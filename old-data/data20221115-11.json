The EU also tells the people that Putin sets their energy and food costs, not their shitty Marxist policies.", "time": 1668529934, "resto": 404505515, "id": "jf+sPmMd", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404531615, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:56:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404505515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404505515</a>", "filename": "1589302672697", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 572, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1668531397163796, "time": 1668531397, "md5": "WldNaH3Scb6sc0AXdakqWQ==", "fsize": 154144, "resto": 404505515, "id": "Yy02LjCN", "country": "AT", "country_name": "Austria"}], "last_modified": 1668531397}, {"no": 404510254, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)08:46:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does the right-wing understand how insane they look complaining about shit like this when there&#039;s bigger problems in the world?", "filename": "9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 1638, "tn_w": 171, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668520011441917, "time": 1668520011, "md5": "eOXRmzzSldQqWiROVMXhkw==", "fsize": 246435, "resto": 0, "id": "zC6AlYLi", "country": "US", "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-the-rightwing-understand-how-insane-they", "country_name": "United States", "replies": 203, "images": 33, "omitted_posts": 198, "omitted_images": 33, "last_replies": [{"no": 404531441, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:54:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404510254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404510254</a><br>Do jews like Ben collins think he\u2019s going to get away with it?<br>You will not escape to Israel", "time": 1668531298, "resto": 404510254, "id": "/iQiF981", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404531514, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:55:36", "name": "Sage", "com": "<a href=\"#p404510254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404510254</a><br>Don&#039;t worry about your children being groomed by sexual deviants goy!<br>Herbs", "time": 1668531336, "resto": 404510254, "id": "8GV0q5R/", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404531524, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:55:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404531381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404531381</a><br>Pedos even founded western civilization", "time": 1668531341, "resto": 404510254, "id": "reO2n/aD", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404531570, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:56:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404531514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404531514</a><br>Why not raise them yourself?", "time": 1668531371, "resto": 404510254, "id": "reO2n/aD", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404531616, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:56:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why does this specific state show up all the time,more than Florida or anything else???The only Georgia I know is the country close to Russia", "time": 1668531397, "resto": 404510254, "id": "34P7FveF", "country": "GR", "country_name": "Greece"}], "last_modified": 1668531397}, {"no": 404529328, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:37:08", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/uhg/ -

A phone is sending out signals constantly even when its on standby, putting it on off, might also not be completely be &quot;off&quot;. Edward Snowden, is right after all, about everything he told. I think encoding messages seems so futille if its done a device that is freely showing what you are doing on it. Maybe its safe as you say. but I really doubt it. And what I mean is not just messages, I mean servers. I want the public to be safe and do their businesses without the data farming. One Idea I had was to keep the data presets on your own device instead of the server and make it illigal for them to do that.

In addition, a number of related published articles from the same databases were included to improve the integrity of the discussion, and hence the edge of the future directions. In summary, there is an evidence that onions enhance testosterone level in males. The mechanisms by which this occurs is mainly by increasing the production of luteinizing hormone, enhancing the antioxidant defense mechanism in the tests, neutralizing the damaging effects of the generated free radicals, ameliorating insulin resistance, promoting nitric oxide production, and altering the activity of adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate -activated protein kinase. However, this effect requires further approval in humans, mainly by conducting clinical trials.</span>", "time": 1668531285, "resto": 404515253, "id": "beWIAQDf", "country": "RO", "country_name": "Romania"}, {"no": 404531484, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:55:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404515253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404515253</a><br>Seems like mine has doubled", "time": 1668531318, "resto": 404515253, "id": "WJkpASyI", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404531566, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:56:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404515355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404515355</a><br>Coomed in my wife for over 2 years.

In my state, the pattern was basically mandating the vaccine, which would lead to massive resignations, and then the nurses who quit would all sign up with travel agencies and go back to their old jobs at triple the pay because the hospital was desperate. The travel agencies rubber stamped every exemption request and the hospital would have to honor it. This happened at hospital after hospital until the holdouts finally saw the writing on the wall: mandates wouldn&#039;t work, and implementing them would force them to contract nurses at $10K/week incentivizing their remaining staff to join in on the scam.

We can safely count on a major war breaking out when nuclear defense capabilities advance enough to allow for superpowers to confidently survive a nuclear engagement.

The ones running the show know they fucked up once they realized that migrants only delay demographic decline for the first generation, and after that, birthrates level out. Now, the only option the elites in western and eastern societies have is war as a means of reasserting dominance and to revitalize their societies. It\u2019s why feds are empowering dem warhawks to clamp down on power and are doing everything in their power to keep anti-war sentiment out of Washington. It\u2019s why Russia has been using Ukraine as a meat grinder to revise doctrines and tactics, as they did in Finland during WWII. It\u2019s why Xi took total authority as a dictator now.

They are simply rich people hiding behind a label so they can call you antisemitic if you dare question their corruption. <br><br>You see, black folks can identify as any group of people they want and most groups just laugh it off, but Ashkenazim absolutely lose their shit and seethe like wild men. They are insecure, because they are afraid of being found out. <br><br>&quot;DNA analysis of Ashkenazic Jews \u2013 a Jewish ethnic group \u2013 revealed that their maternal line is European. It has also been found that their DNA only has 3% ancient ancestry which links them with the Eastern Mediterranean/Middle East. This is the part of the world Jewish people are said to have originally come from \u2013 according to the Old Testament. But 3% is a minuscule amount, and similar to what modern Europeans as a whole share with Neanderthals. So given that the genetic ancestry link is so low, Ashkenazic Jews\u2019 most recent ancestors must be from elsewhere.&quot;<br><br>https://theconversation.com/ashkena<wbr>zic-jews-mysterious-origins-unravel<wbr>led-by-scientists-thanks-to-ancient<wbr>-dna-97962", "filename": "1668086769217765", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 956, "h": 2788, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668519796454239, "time": 1668519796, "md5": "+tPeHe76d5Eo4iz4xaEyyA==", "fsize": 337178, "resto": 0, "id": "EFN/249b", "country": "US", "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "atheist-ashkenazim-fake-jews", "country_name": "United States", "replies": 352, "images": 36, "omitted_posts": 347, "omitted_images": 35, "last_replies": [{"no": 404531377, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:54:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404531092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404531092</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Same Doctrine</span><br>Nope otherwise you&#039;d cite just the bible and not that extra bullshit your brand made up<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Which Council do you disagree with?
