In a time when food gets expensive, the netherlands being a massive food exporter, should have had a really good profit in this way, but we dont. Sure gas and electricity, but we can solve that with investments.

My mum was in terrible health, so many different unrelated problems. She was dependent on painkillers (paracetamol and ibuprofen), took em multiple times every day for terrible headaches and sometimes migraines. A splitting headache nearly every day for decades, 30 years or more. One summer I told her just to experiment by going off them, just for a month. I&#039;ll never forget the look of terror in her eyes when I suggested it, that&#039;s how dependent she was on them, that&#039;s how much the thought of enduring those headaches without painillers scared her.

No diet, no chaging diet, certainly no exercise. It just melted off her, because her appetite went back to its natural equilibrium after having been altered all this time.

I had previously got her to stop dyeing it, to grey gracefully and she did. She was almost entirely grey. After going off the painkillers, not only the her hair become fuller again, but half of it went back to its natural colour. Not everywhere, but overall half of it, it&#039;s in weird different patches. She&#039;s half grey half not.

The Skeksis came to betray all friendship, without reason, without need.&quot;<br><br>The Skeksis were the self-proclaimed Lords of the Crystal, and rulers of an Empire which dominated Thra throughout the &#039;Age of Division&#039;. Tall and reptilian in appearance, the Skeksis posed as benevolent caretakers of the Crystal, while in reality leeching off its power in order to prolong their lives, thus causing the spread of the Darkening. During their thousand-trine rule, the Skeksis formed the Alliance of the Crystal with the Gelfling, keeping the latter divided and subservient. Species that resisted their governance, such as the Gruenaks and Arathim, were either eradicated or evicted from their lands. <br><br>When the Crystal was exhausted of its power after a millennium of abuse, the Skeksis began to abduct the Gelfling in order to drain them of their essence, which had a rejuvenating effect on them. This lead to the formation of the Gelfling resistance and the outbreak of Garthim War. After the death of Emperor skekSo, the subsequent infighting among the Skeksis prevented them from stopping the fulfillment of a prophecy that foretold the end of their rule by Gelfling hand. <br><br>The Skeksis viewed themselves as bringers of order, innovation and purpose, and were convinced of their inherent superiority over all creatures of Thra, seeing them at best as sources of food, revenue and entertainment. I have, many times, characterized them as intelligent, ambitious and gregarious, full of daring wit and bold experiment - yet simultaneously manipulative, thieving, parasitic and needlessly treacherous, with ice in their hearts and a thirst for blood.", "filename": "1648098925009", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 565, "h": 414, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 183, "tim": 1668527237164676, "time": 1668527237, "md5": "L+cpbrYvum9Tx/RKrpFZYg==", "fsize": 59523, "resto": 0, "id": "BuVgpWC7", "country": "US", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "antiskekscism", "country_name": "United States", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1668527237}, {"no": 404508738, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)08:30:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "What group would win a race war, Mexicans or niggers?", "com": "https://youtu.be/OPJdpOmAZfI", "filename": "Haitians in Mexico (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 683, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668519003854757, "time": 1668519003, "md5": "4pN1Y8yRQB7bhBDOJsNFFg==", "fsize": 808461, "resto": 0, "id": "oCgO0YL0", "country": "US", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-group-would-win-a-race-war-mexicans-or", "country_name": "United States", "replies": 60, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 55, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 404522800, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)10:42:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404522597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404522597</a><br>no indios on My linage.<br>cartel uses the money from operations to buy power,<br>you politicians have price tags, all of them.<br>You know nothing, and it shows.<br><br>Death to kikes", "time": 1668526930, "resto": 404508738, "id": "+MaCzlw1", "country": "MX", "country_name": "Mexico"}, {"no": 404523078, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)10:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404509219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404509219</a><br>NOBODY HAS WHITE GUILT EXCEPT WHITES.
