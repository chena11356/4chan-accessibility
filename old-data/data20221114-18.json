Ron Desantis had some biting remarks for the former President this Monday, after the GOP suffered a crushing blow in the midterm elections.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Trump needs to be quiet. His level of involvement in U.S politics should shrink dramatically. He is one of the many factors of why the Republicans have lost in a big way. He&#039;s political poison.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desantis went on to say there was this dude he hung out with in Cky called &quot;Mike Vallely&quot;, and he was the douchiest blowhard I&#039;ve ever seen.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He was a 5&#039;8&quot; balding manlet who looked like he hit the gym maybe twice a week to do only chest and arms, and he would get super aggro over nothing in order to look like the &quot;tough one&quot; of the crew; which isn&#039;t really much of an accomplishment, because the bar isn&#039;t set very high in the first place. His accomplishments included scattering 4 timid teenagers by flailing his arms like a windmill, and shoving a middle-aged mall cop away while the security guard was just trying to do his job.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He also had a brief stint as a hockey enforcer, where presumably his appreciation for violence might serve some sort of purpose, but then, to absolutely NO ONE&#039;S surprise, the MOMENT he had to fight someone as strong, or stronger than him, who was equally as fond of violence as he was, he got his shit pushed in regularly. Never won a single fucking hockey fight in his life and was CONSTANTLY getting thrown to the ice.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The guy was the definition of coked up blowhard.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mike Vallely, ladies and gentlemen. A possible contender for &quot;faggiest skater in all of existence&quot;. Possibly faggier than even Bam Margera himself</span>", "filename": "107149658-16680870302022-11-10t132735z_1922193139_rc2fhx9gu03s_rtrmadp_0_usa-election.jpeg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 929, "h": 523, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668464412153319, "time": 1668464412, "md5": "9UfofV5ERPv77wKzfpf4yw==", "fsize": 72517, "resto": 0, "id": "jJgXPAXz", "country": "US", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ron-desantis-says-trump-needs-to-be-quiet", "country_name": "United States", "replies": 13, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 8, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 404432336, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)17:53:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In 2005, I fucked Mike V on the train tracks behind a Ross Dress for Less. Man, his ass could grip. Real tight, not a hair on it, and a sphincter you could only dream of. I had fun at first. But he was so weirdly macho about it. He kept saying things like &quot;thats right bitch, am I gonna make you nut?&quot; and &quot;fucking fag I bet you can&#039;t wait to bust in my fat hairy man ass hahaha faggot&quot;. I just ignored him and kept railing. He continued unironically calling me his bitch and a fag as he had several hands free prostate orgasms spilling seminal fluids onto the train tracks, getting more angry and dominant after each one. &quot;Yea i bet you like dudes. You look like a pussy&quot; he&#039;d say &quot;I cant even feel your limpdick bitch.&quot; I just kept clapping, wondering wtf is up with him. After about 20 minutes of railing Mike&#039;s boypussy, drenched in sweat and his cream, I finally got a nut off despite his constant berating and degrading comments. He immediately hopped off, laid flat on his back and bent his legs over his head so the cum dripped out of his asshole directly into his mouth. &quot;The fuck you looking at? You like this gay boy?&quot; He kept saying. After he got every last drop. He cackled like a rooster and punched me in the face as hard as he could. He nearly broke his hand, but I was fine. &quot;Fucking fag&quot; he said as he limped off into the sunset, shaking his wrist.

This debate is a false debate because it is misplaced. Albert Pike is a metonymic historical figure, a part of the whole that ties into a multitude of anonymous or semi-anonymous individuals organized into various clubs and schools of thought. Therefore, the real question is whether American Freemasonry founded the KKK. This question may seem absurd to many of our contemporaries, who, in stereotyping Masonic values as cosmopolitan, anti-racist, anti-nationalist, pro-NWO, etc., deem them opposite to the values expounded by the KKK. Theoretically, the KKK supports ethnic nationalism, or rooting one\u2019s identity in a land and race, whereas Freemasonry defends multiculturalism and the mixing of different national identities at the supranational level; but in reality, American Freemasonry is \u2013 like Janus \u2013 two-faced, contradictory, and certainly capable of closing in on populations and crushing them all at once from both the left and right, with a pair of pliers</span>", "filename": "1665283779225732", "ext": ".png", "w": 1114, "h": 614, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 68, "tim": 1668466350865420, "time": 1668466350, "md5": "fRRR6/l1o2OjmXpDshpmBw==", "fsize": 85523, "resto": 404369443, "id": "PmSMyoXd", "country": "BR", "country_name": "Brazil"}, {"no": 404433490, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)18:03:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump.", "time": 1668467037, "resto": 404369443, "id": "kbJDq3ok", "country": "BR", "country_name": "Brazil"}], "last_modified": 1668467037}, {"no": 404431111, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)17:44:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;most influential American zoomer</span><br><br>What&#039;s wrong with americans?", "filename": "l-intro-1659381761", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668465843169419, "time": 1668465843, "md5": "P82YYqTO+iD2UDAFS8xDUA==", "fsize": 154077, "resto": 0, "id": "N5rOT2Zj", "country": "IT", "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "most-influential-american-zoomer", "country_name": "Italy", "replies": 20, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 15, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 404432473, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)17:55:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404431111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404431111</a><br>You mean mr beast right?", "time": 1668466510, "resto": 404431111, "id": "FoON/08p", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404432552, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)17:55:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404431111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404431111</a><br>Niggers are America\u2019s gods.

First, there are very, very few actual White Supremacists in the US. The vast majority of White Identitarians are Nationalist and advocate for their people but don&#039;t necessarily believe that they are better than others. Real White Supremacists of today, such as myself, are Christian Identity. CI&#039;s don&#039;t believe non-Whites are people or even animals but are bastard creations that are the result of some sort of miscegenation with animals or fallen creatures that no-longer exist.<br>However, technically, we are not White Supremacists because we believe that only We are actually people. rather than believing that we are &quot;better&quot; than the others.
