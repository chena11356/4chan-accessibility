It has nothing to do with concentration camps or that some jews died in the war. As the central piece in the post-WW2 new world order, it was instrumental in the creation of the of left&#039;s new religion where whiteness became the original sin, Hitler the Devil, right-wing politics demonic, racism the greatest evil, jews the gods and the destruction of Western culture the ultimate redemption.<br><br>It was a very clever way to enslave an entire group of people without them even noticing.<br><br>Some jews died in WW2. Some jews (rightfully, just like US Japanese were) were held in camps in WW2. Some jews starved in camps in WW2. Jews were not gassed by the millions. There were no &#039;extermination camps&#039;. There was no systematic effort to exterminate all jews by the Germans. There was no 6 gorillion. Jews in camps had typhus and camps were de-loused with Zyklon B just like people, ships, and warehouses were all over the world.<br><br>The Germans were blockaded and starving. Therefore their prisoners starved as well. The combination of typhus and starvation due to the blockade and 24/7 nationwide bombings cutting supply lines and crippling the nation resulted in a lot of prisoners dying. In order to decrease the rate of typhus infection the bodies of the dead were burned, just as the allies did when they captured the camps. The concentration camps and deaths of some jews (likely around 300,000 maximum) was real. The &#039;holocaust&#039; is an event GREATLY exaggerated in order to increase jew political power and their ability to manipulate others to their benefit post-WW2. <br><br>Absolute must-know Weimar, WW2 and holohoax redpills with sources:<br>https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thre<wbr>ad/391009291<br>https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thre<wbr>ad/391009291<br>https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thre<wbr>ad/391009291", "time": 1668630312, "resto": 404741259, "id": "dra2OHl0", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404743183, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:30:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404741259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404741259</a><br>He laughs it off here, but was reportedly furious at the security staff for allowing it. <br>A woman of another country.
