The jews want to destroy and corrupt as much as possible before the Final Liberation and Take Over by the Imperial Germans or Space Reich (Reichsdeutschen), they (jews and their golems) know that their end is near and they intend to drag the world down with them.<br><br>The Plan for Total World Conquest (JWO) that was supposed to start smoothly and on schedule in 2030 (Agenda-2030) but has been sneakily and abruptly brought forward 10 years (2020). The jews have been forced to move in an increasingly uncoordinated, unsilent, unfleecked manner.<br><br>In short, like thieves in a glass house, they are now running around making a big racket and destroying everything. Plus, &quot;waking up&quot; their victims in the process ,who the jews and their golems will have a nice farewell &quot;Party&quot;. That&#039;s why the jews rush things. If the jews had total control over things, then they would have implemented Agenda 2030 with small steps so as not to wake up the people.<br><br>When you&#039;re in control, it doesn&#039;t matter 50 or 100 years. But something or someone (which is obviously the Reichsdeutschen) turned their plans upside down in such a way that they know they have no chance of success but given their destructive mentality the jews prefer scorched earth tactic.<br><br>By the way, just because the existence of the Reichsdeutschen is known doesn&#039;t mean to just wait for them to mass appear in the skies or on the streets or even discourage in real life action in the meantime. But its best to just be well prepared for the inevitable economic/social collapse (getting out of the cities) and takeover by them.<br><br>The Rise of the &quot;Invisible Reich&quot;<br>https://www.bitchute.com/video/irEU<wbr>pSLzcoOb/", "filename": "Andromeda-Ger\u00e4t-over-Washington-&amp;-California-2021", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 982, "h": 678, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1668625816605544, "time": 1668625816, "md5": "4Eib/jge4PKbR8VEC/H/VA==", "fsize": 106715, "resto": 404709159, "id": "AoyDrwH0", "board_flag": "NZ", "flag_name": "Nazi"}, {"no": 404730166, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:10:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;christ</span>", "time": 1668625853, "resto": 404709159, "id": "CYULjbpX", "board_flag": "PR", "flag_name": "Pirate"}, {"no": 404730236, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:11:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404730052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404730052</a><br>Additional Reading \u2013 Book Links:<br>https://i.imgur.com/scDKH9c.jpg<br><br>UFO: Nazi Secret Weapon?, by Ernst Zundel<br>https://archive.org/details/UFOsNaz<wbr>iSecretWeapon1974/mode/2up<br><br>Part 1<br>https://youtu.be/FTJG1dJhGOk<br><br>Part 2<br>https://youtu.be/DZryYWcxxaU<br><br>Miguel Serrano: Hitler\u2019s UFO Against the New World Order\u2019<br>https://archive.org/details/ufo_202<wbr>01123<br><br>German Flying Disks and Submarines Monitor the Oceans(Deutsche Flugscheiben und U-Boote \u00fcberwachen die Weltmeere) \u2013 Book 1 and Book 2 \u2013 by O Bergmann<br>https://archive.org/details/Bergman<wbr>nO.DeutscheFlugscheibenUndUBooteUeb<wbr>erwachenDieWeltmeere11988111S./mode<wbr>/2up<br><br>https://archive.org/details/Bergman<wbr>nO.DeutscheFlugscheibenUndUBooteUeb<wbr>erwachenDieWeltmeere21989104S./mode<wbr>/2up<br><br>(If you click on the version \u2018FULL TEXT\u2019 of these archive pdf books then you can just use a translate app or input to translate the texts of the books to your native language.)<br><br>Secret Miracle Weapons(Geheime Wunderwaffen), by D H Haarmaan<br>https://archive.org/details/Haarman<wbr>n-D-H-Geheime-Wunderwaffen-1<br><br>https://archive.org/details/Haarman<wbr>n-D-H-Geheime-Wunderwaffen-2<br><br>https://archive.org/details/Haarman<wbr>n-D-H-Geheime-Wunderwaffen-3-Text<br><br>The Third Power(Die Dritte Macht), by Gilbert Sternhoff<br>https://archive.org/details/DieDrit<wbr>teMacht<br><br>Die Reichsdeutschen Das Dritte Reich als dritte Supermacht auf Erden?<br>https://archive.org/details/reichsd<wbr>eutscheebook_202103<br><br>Johannes J\u00fcrgenson - &quot;The Opposite Is True&quot; vol. 2 (Das Gegenteil Ist Wahr J\u00fcrgenson Band 2 Flugscheiben)<br>https://archive.org/details/johanne<wbr>s-jurgenson-das-gegenteil-ist-wahr-<wbr>band-ii", "filename": "Haunebu-1_and_2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 732, "h": 1073, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668625874805488, "time": 1668625874, "md5": "AOyq8JcRW+kXmKEqDMyxgA==", "fsize": 151488, "resto": 404709159, "id": "AoyDrwH0", "m_img": 1, "board_flag": "NZ", "flag_name": "Nazi"}, {"no": 404730249, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:11:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404709159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404709159</a>", "filename": "1651258486468", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668625877821079, "time": 1668625877, "md5": "w2hc+ferUe4kuV0fVpQ+gQ==", "fsize": 2014031, "resto": 404709159, "id": "6U/4foa9", "country": "DE", "country_name": "Germany"}, {"no": 404730361, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:12:06", "name": "Doc_Strangelove", "com": "<a href=\"#p404725971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404725971</a><br><br>Eh, it&#039;s alright, likely mean more or less the same as you.

suddenly naming the jew, it&#039;s likely all done in a controlled way such that the general population starts rising up against the average jew instead of against the few jews in power.<br>Israel is losing the demographic war against Palestinians and America is the last place that has more jews than currently residing in Israel.<br>The ADL is actually trying to use assimilated American jews as human shields to protect against criticism of Israel and jewish power in America. In fact the ADL was founded by B&#039;nai B&#039;rith and one of the main purposes of B&#039;nai B&#039;rith is to resist jewish assimilation at all costs, even by promoting antisemitism as a tool. You will notice that many of Jonathan Greenblatt&#039;s tweets are now blatantly and intentionally confirming the power that jews have and confirming the accusations against them in order to incite more antisemitism under the guise of fighting antisemitism.<br>The kikes will temporarily allow antisemitism to increase until the majority of jews have been chased out to Israel, possibility even allowing an antisemitic government to form like in Germany. Then when their demographic goals are achieved, they will use the other global powers along with much of Europe to destroy America and this will basically be WW3. Whatever will remain of America afterwards will be again put under the control of the few remaining jews.<br>This is more or less the plan and any burgers who troll or dumbpost in this thread are most likely gatekeeping glowniggers.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ9<wbr>vKFHw7Fs", "filename": "Jews by country", "ext": ".png", "w": 639, "h": 717, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668619208234891, "time": 1668619208, "md5": "bNVh3xhvLxVIQ7nI6S/ucA==", "fsize": 42388, "resto": 0, "id": "Z9LPpd5h", "country": "CA", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-have-to-understand-that-the-kikes-need-to", "country_name": "Canada", "replies": 55, "images": 15, "omitted_posts": 50, "omitted_images": 13, "last_replies": [{"no": 404729422, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:06:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404723156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404723156</a><br>Fuck you jew, kek.", "time": 1668625613, "resto": 404713086, "id": "u+TxByyi", "board_flag": "NT", "flag_name": "NATO"}, {"no": 404729527, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:07:29", "name": "&gt;tfw no big dick trap gf (not a jew)", "com": "<a href=\"#p404729420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404729420</a><br>germany could easily defeat america", "time": 1668625649, "resto": 404713086, "id": "B01eQweD", "country": "IL", "country_name": "Israel"}, {"no": 404729826, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:09:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404729527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404729527</a><br>They lack natural resources and population.", "time": 1668625744, "resto": 404713086, "id": "f20jWTM/", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404729999, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404727773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404727773</a><br>Fertility rate of arabs is declining.
