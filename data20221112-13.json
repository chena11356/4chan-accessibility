I will openly admit that I accept the official numbers presented, give or take a few hundred thousand. However, it is not even necessary to argue about numbers. The Nazis were neo-Pagan amoral scum and they presented a facade about how capable and glorious they actually were. The SS, for example, had tons of problems with deployed men&#039;s wives cheating on them, sometimes even with non-German men like Poles. The birth rates were low. Coping was abundant about how fucked up the situation actually was. In other words, Nazism was a modernist ideology that suffered from some of the same trappings of modernism that are everpresent today. Do not buy the propaganda, the Nazis were the OG propagandists, and every government and intelligence agency has been playing catchup to their propaganda machine ever since. This is all straight from the documents and words of Himmler himself and is easily googleable information.<br><br>Before any calls me a shill or a Jew, I am neither. I just see Nazism for what it really is, a self-destructive ideology that was bound to come crashing to the ground. Debates about numbers or the existence of swimming pools at concentration camps or the wacky accounts of a few people seeking attention (bendy gun, you know the one) do not change the big picture. Nazism was amoral and evil and we have it to thank for the current landscape of globalized intelligence networks that have fucked up everything. <br><br>Christ is the answer. Do not fall for the &quot;christcuckery&quot; or &quot;Jewish lie&quot; or any of that stupid shit. Jesus sent his disciples unto all nations and was the son of God, not just some Middle Eastern Jew. Being a Christian does not mean submitting yourself to globalism or the horrors of modernity, that is just watered-down current strains of Christianity.

Multiculturalism has been built on Jewish myths about the biological equality of the races. It was a Jewish myth that was behind the September 11 attack on America: namely, the myth that Israel is America&#039;s &quot;ally&quot; and deserves America&#039;s support. The Jewish swindlers who made all of these myths depended heavily on the support of corrupt or foolish Gentiles for their success, just as (((Michael Milken))) and Andy Fastow depended on the collaboration of corrupt and greedy Gentiles for the success of their clever, Jewish shell games with stocks and bonds and money. <br><br>Well, anyway, what we can hope for now is that the Enron investigations will stay alive long enough for a few perceptive Americans to appreciate fully the truly Jewish role played by Enron&#039;s chief financial officer, Andy Fastow, in bringing about the ruin of the company. <br><br>Beyond that, I suppose it is too much to hope that many Americans will gain a deeper understanding of the essential role that the corruption of our government and our society has played in allowing Jews like Milken and Fastow to do their destructive work. But it is a fact, as I have said before, that without our own weakness and corruption the Jews would have no opportunity to do their destructive work: no opportunity to exploit us or to hypnotize us with their myths. Curing that weakness and cutting that corruption out of our society is the biggest task we have before us.", "filename": "1625294804512", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668287699960472, "time": 1668287699, "md5": "Eh5NBLIe9A4N9YRw3zwbQg==", "fsize": 2288196, "resto": 404140113, "id": "lMh6NpBy", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404141629, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)16:15:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thanks for being with me again today.</span>", "filename": "fin", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668287730999683, "time": 1668287730, "md5": "zKmRR4Me+6tgJM5ExaISWQ==", "fsize": 25145, "resto": 404140113, "id": "lMh6NpBy", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404142735, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)16:25:55", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1668245767432934", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668288355432288, "time": 1668288355, "md5": "EO51APRzjheuAm/mxSLCdw==", "fsize": 455732, "resto": 404140113, "id": "lMh6NpBy", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404143540, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)16:33:21", "name": "Novus Ratio", "com": "<a href=\"#p404141566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404141566</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;diversity is our strength&quot; is the creation of fast-talking Jewish myth-makers.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; come on goys of various colors, do a racial strife</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; dont unite against us</span><br>turns out &quot;&quot;diversity is our strength&quot; is the creation of fast-talking Jewish myth-makers.&quot; is a creation of fast-talking Jewish myth-makers.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; many such cases</span>", "time": 1668288801, "resto": 404140113, "id": "GYDtoaNM", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404144022, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)16:37:30", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "( general otto ernst remer", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 2212, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668289050867739, "time": 1668289050, "md5": "AFF0BeoIxOenl2KwVRXgtA==", "fsize": 621008, "resto": 404140113, "id": "lMh6NpBy", "country": "US", "m_img": 1, "country_name": "United States"}], "last_modified": 1668289050}, {"no": 404137248, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)15:34:54", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Cryptocurrency won&#039;t survive if people don&#039;t use their own wallets", "com": "Why the fuck do people keep their cryptocurrency holdings in online wallets?

Dr John Bannister, the on-call registrar who had tended to Hendrix that day, believed him to have been dead for hours, but would claim he was covered in red wine. \u201cThe amount of wine that was over him was just extraordinary,\u201d Bannister was quoted in The Times in 2009. \u201cNot only was it saturated right through his hair and shirt, but his lungs and stomach were absolutely full of wine \u2026 We kept sucking him out and it kept surging and surging \u2026 He had really drowned in a massive amount of red wine.\u201d<br><br>Hendrix\u2019s autopsy, though reporting 400ml of \u201cfree fluid\u201d in his left lung, mentioned no wine in Hendrix\u2019s lungs or stomach and little alcohol in his bloodstream; his death certificate listed cause of death as \u201cinhalation of vomit [due to] barbiturate intoxication\u201d.

There were certainly people and organisations with motives.

This is important to remember.<br><br>NOW...consider how one would cheat. One would need to know by HOW MUCH one needs to cheat. If it is practically impossible to cheat and get away with it, one would not bother trying. But if it were possible....then one would not just add more votes to the side one wants. This would immediately garner attention because the totals do not match possible voters. (&quot;How the hell did one million people vote for them if there aren&#039;t even that many people registered to vote in that county?&quot;)<br><br>SO HERE&#039;S WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY GOING ON:<br>They need to count all the votes, so they can see how many votes they need to cheat by. THEN...they can destroy enough votes going to the GOP, and create the same number of fake votes for the Dem...so the total numbers don&#039;t raise suspicion. This takes far more time than just counting.<br><br>[Also note that this process can not be attempted until the cheaters are sure they even need to cheat, based on results elsewhere in the country.
