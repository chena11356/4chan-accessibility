Some days I practice some forging, melt some metals or craft stuff. Other days I spend hours training archery, basking in the sunlight. There are days, where I simply gather wood, make some charcoal, burn leaves or spend some time identifying strange herbs, insects and fungi. Today, for example, I tended to my herb garden, gathered some edible weeds and grass seeds, did some sight seeing, surrounded by my gigantic dandelions. Made some soup, using the leftovers of some ribs I made yesterday, mixed with wild herbals. Ate. Now I&#039;m shit posting on the 4Chang, because there&#039;s nothing else to do. If there was some sort of community spirit and we didn&#039;t live in a world controlled by soulless corps, maybe I would be playing flute or guitar around a campfire, surrounded by my people (I used to play all types of instruments and even play my bowstring like a bass string sometimes). Sadly, the corps made everything meaningless. Everyone is on the internet now, getting brainwashed to hate themselves over corporate political bullshit. They mad at NEET. So I shitpost. Tomorrow I make some more arrows, modify my machete to be pointier and change the edge profile of my axe. People think I do nothing with my time, because I&#039;m NEET. They are wrong.
