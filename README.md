4CHAN DATA ACCESSIBILITY & ACCESS
======

The 4Chan Data Accessibility & Access project began in an effort to address the lack of quantitative and qualitative data available for research to adequately study the influence of **wholly anonymous, unmoderated, and influential** forums like [4chan](https://www.4chan.org/). 

Please refer to the [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUr4ICrPZ7bCPPykO3giH9UMEwxIIhoTFqbpSbwpHSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information and/or the [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eLEuoAExj_0qkn_goqQRF-Vf6OpRj0nAVFmIzxcJ6nQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## About
![meme](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Feels_good_man.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

4chan is a wholly anonymous English Language image-based forum website. 22 million users visit 4chan every month to discuss topics ranging from daily activities to extremist viewpoints. 4chan is divided into 76 boards, some of which are more prone than others to disinformative and problematic content, including the notorious /pol/ (Politically Incorrect). The controversial differentiating factor for 4chan is its complete anonymity and lack of accountability for users. Posts last only for a few days and names are never revealed. (Some boards contain archives where posts go after a few days, and others do not.) Unlike other forum websites like Reddit, an account doesn’t need to be created on the website in order to post. The site is the originator of everything from the mundane, like memes, to the dangerous, like cyberbullying, hoaxes, and disinformation.

While the site has proven critical to understanding sociopolitical movements like the Alt-Right, it suffers from data inaccessibility, making it difficult to conduct research about 4chan users and therefore how these movements start and propagate.

## Goals
* Increasing data access in order to help peers perform studies on social media platforms with less documented APIs
* Understanding of trending topics on 4chan, particularly as it pertains to disinformation and problematic content
* Navigating across the challenges for data accessibility 

## Guiding Questions 
* Why is 4chan important in public discourse? 
* How can we make data more accessible for non-technical researchers? 
* How does sub-culture influence and impact pop culture? 
* What are the tradeoffs between free speech and internet safety? 
* What are the ethical implications of studying extremist forums? 

## Existing Research
* [The Challenges of Studying 4chan and the Alt-Right](https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820948803): The research highlights the challenges associated with gathering strong data and research on a forum like 4chan. Colley, Thomas, and Moore discovered that there is limited quantitative analyses of 4chan available due to evolving slang, sarcasm, and imagery. Furthermore, anonymity ont the forum makes identifying individual users and identities particularly difficult. Further research would benefit from online storage of platform content with a blend of quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our project aims to address these issues of a lack of quantitative analyses due to ephemerality by persisting the 4chan data. 


* [4chan and /b/: An Analysis of Anonymity and Ephemerality in a Large Online Community](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14134): This paper analyzes 4chan’s random board /b/ to understand anonymity and ephemerality online. The paper found that roughly 35,000 threads and 400,000 posts per day and the median life of a thread 3.9 minutes (fastest is 28 seconds, longest is 6.2 hours). 4chan's content deletion and ephemerality encourages users to post more frequently, which also keeps content “fresh”. 90% of posts are made completely anonymously and the /b/ community uses non-technical mechanisms like slang and timestamping to signal status and identity. /b/’s anonymity is likely shaping a strong communal identity among a very large set of individuals.

* [From cyberfascism to terrorism: On 4chan/pol/ culture and the transnational production of memetic violence
](https://doi.org/10.1111/nana.12780): The paper examines the the transnational production of cyberfascism at 4chan /pol/ and argues that platforms like 4chan promote extreme facism globally via cyberfascism, the virtualization of fascist thought and action. In addition, the forum promotes memetic violence and white supremacism globally. Extremist ideology is transnational with ripple effects globally.
