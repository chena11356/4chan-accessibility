4CHAN DATA ACCESSIBILITY & ACCESS
======

The 4Chan Data Accessibility & Access project began in an effort to address the lack of quantitative and qualitative data available for research to adequately study the influence of **wholly anonymous, unmoderated, and influential** forums like [4chan](https://www.4chan.org/). 

Please refer to the [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUr4ICrPZ7bCPPykO3giH9UMEwxIIhoTFqbpSbwpHSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information and/or the [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eLEuoAExj_0qkn_goqQRF-Vf6OpRj0nAVFmIzxcJ6nQ/edit?usp=sharing).

##About
![meme](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Feels_good_man.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

4chan is a wholly anonymous English Language image-based forum website. 22 million users visit 4chan every month to discuss topics ranging from daily activities to extremist viewpoints. 4chan is divided into 76 boards, some of which are more prone than others to disinformative and problematic content, including the notorious /pol/ (Politically Incorrect). The controversial differentiating factor for 4chan is its complete anonymity and lack of accountability for users. Posts last only for a few days and names are never revealed. (Some boards contain archives where posts go after a few days, and others do not.) Unlike other forum websites like Reddit, an account doesn’t need to be created on the website in order to post. The site is the originator of everything from the mundane, like memes, to the dangerous, like cyberbullying, hoaxes, and disinformation.

While the site has proven critical to understanding sociopolitical movements like the Alt-Right, it suffers from data inaccessibility, making it difficult to conduct research about 4chan users and therefore how these movements start and propagate.

## Goals
* Increasing data access in order to help peers perform studies on social media platforms with less documented APIs
* Understanding of trending topics on 4chan, particularly as it pertains to disinformation and problematic content
* Navigating across the challenges for data accessibility 

## Guiding Questions 
* Why is 4chan important in public discourse? 
* How can we make data more accessible for non-technical researchers? 
* How does sub-culture influence and impact pop culture? 
* What are the tradeoffs between free speech and internet safety? 
* What are the ethical implications of studying extremist forums?
