And a lot of it won\u2019t survive the decade.<br><br>Fast furniture, which is mass-produced and relatively inexpensive, is easy to obtain and then abandon. Like fast fashion, in which retailers like Shein and Zara produce loads of cheap, trendy clothing that\u2019s made to be discarded after only a few wears, fast furniture is for those looking to hookup but not settle down. It\u2019s the one-season fling of furnishings.<br><br>Many of the Ikea beds and Wayfair desks bought during the Covid-19 lockdown were designed to last about five years, said Deana McDonagh, a professor of industrial design at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. \u201cI relate to fast furniture like I do to fast food,\u201d Ms. McDonagh said. \u201cIt\u2019s empty of culture, and it\u2019s not carrying any history with it.\u201d<br><br>Ikea of Sweden said in a statement that \u201clife span estimation may vary\u201d for its furniture, and customers are encouraged to repair, resell or return products they can no longer use. Wayfair said through a spokesperson that \u201cwe sell an extensive range of furniture products across all styles and price points,\u201d adding that some are meant to \u201clast for generations as well as furniture that meets customer needs for affordability.\u201d<br><br>Increasingly, renters and homeowners are opting for fast and cheap, or as Amber Dunford, style director at Overstock.com, defines it, \u201cfurniture where the human hand is missing.\u201d And they don\u2019t keep it long. Each year, Americans throw out more than 12 million tons of furniture, creating mountains of solid waste that have grown 450 percent since 1960, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Bits of tossed furniture can be recycled, but the vast majority ends up in landfills.", "filename": "merlin_183784719_eb754d2d-077e-45c2-b006-331728f0e4c6-superJumbo_jpg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1365, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1667346594712670, "time": 1667346594, "md5": "IWE8JZcfLIMOawlIkXoqNQ==", "fsize": 2569490, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cheap-furniture-bought-during-pandemic-will", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 21, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 16, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1113740, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)10:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1111716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1111716</a><br>Yes they were.

While the experts and the hosts are still rooting for the Republicans, they stop short of promising the audience total salvation even with the GOP back in charge.

Why would they need to watch if everything was decided over here?\u201d<br><br>Even former President Donald Trump\u2019s anticipated reemergence on the political scene did little to cheer up Putin\u2019s mouthpieces. During Sunday\u2019s broadcast of the show, Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, the top pro-Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov described a video clip of Trump\u2019s diatribe against President Joe Biden as the opinion of a \u201csmart person who openly says everything that many Americans are thinking.\u201d<br><br>Andrey Sidorov, deputy dean of world politics at the Moscow State University, bitterly complained about the Biden administration trying to force Russia to negotiate with Ukraine. The host and the panelists recoiled, questioning what would be the point of negotiations. Sidorov explained that the U.S. wanted Russia to retreat from the territories it occupies in Ukraine. Solovyov incredulously asked: \u201cRetreat where?\u201d Head of RT Margarita Simonyan blurted out: \u201cTo Siberia.\u201d", "filename": "fifthcolumn", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 1199, "tn_w": 177, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1667931653831398, "time": 1667931653, "md5": "2E4PdFva6//LLLuXNfesmA==", "fsize": 211557, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "russia-desperately-hoping-for-a-gop-victory", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1112150, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)13:21:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The topic of retreating touched a nerve, since the Russian troops are rapidly losing Ukrainian ground to the Ukrainian army.

Of course, I am a big aficionado of this former president. I even love his colors, the colors of the Republican party.\u201d Sidorov recounted Trump\u2019s dealings with the Jan. 6 Committee and added that they will be ratcheting up their pressure. Solovyov interrupted, \u201cLordy, so let them pressure him. Let them get married to each other, cut each other up or kill one another.\u201d<br><br>Sidorov clarified: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t care less how they feel about each other, but Trump generates a lot of hatred in America\u2019s society. From my standpoint, the more they hate each other, the better it is for us.\u201d He distilled the main talking point that emerged on multiple state TV shows: regardless of the party that may come to power in the United States, Russia is in dire straits in Ukraine. The best course of action proposed by the state TV experts was to stoke the divisions in the U.S. in hopes of placing the continued aid to Ukraine in peril.<br><br>During Monday\u2019s broadcast of the state TV show 60 Minutes, Sergei Luzyanin, professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations under the Russian Foreign Ministry, complained of the bipartisan \u201cRussophobic consensus\u201d in the U.S. Congress and Senate. Luzyanin said, \u201cA potential victory of the Republicans in the Congress and perhaps in the Senate, will mark the beginning of a political Halloween.\u201d He predicted that in the next two years, Republicans will pursue a multitude of legal disagreements, court cases and impeachments, all of which will lead to exacerbating the already existing societal divisions and conflicts among the elites.", "time": 1667931680, "resto": 1112149}, {"no": 1112154, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)13:25:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Luzyanin predicted: \u201cAfter the midterm elections, we\u2019ll see a glass jar full of poisonous American spiders, tearing each other up.

Military aid to Ukraine will continue.\u201d<br><br>Skabeeva concurred: \u201cThe situation won\u2019t change for the better and we have to rely solely upon ourselves, on the Russian army.

There\u2019s no chance it will happen, which Biden knows. Only Congress can impose new taxes, and Congress isn\u2019t in session right now.

But passing a windfall tax in the lame duck session, when Dems still have control, would require 60 votes in the Senate, to overcome the filibuster.

Obviously he\u2019s trying to offload the blame for high gasoline and energy prices onto energy companies, just as Americans cast their midterm votes. But most voters have made up their minds, and some have already cast early ballots. Biden has been blaming energy companies for high prices all year, and there\u2019s nothing about a phony windfall tax proposal that\u2019s going to suddenly convince voters that this time, Biden probably means it.
