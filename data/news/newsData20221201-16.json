Contrary to what Waxman and many others might believe, neuroscience can be just as squishy as psychology, a field some snobs argue isn\u2019t even a science. Just like psychologists, neuroscientists must make judgment calls about how to collect and interpret data, and there are no right answers for how best to do that. Studying people is messy. \u201cDespite being popularly viewed as revealing the \u2018objective truth,\u2019 neuroimaging techniques involve an element of subjectivity,\u201d three health researchers who study adolescents wrote in a 2009 paper.</span>", "time": 1669785604, "resto": 1119390}, {"no": 1119408, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)00:21:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The choices researchers make in their methodology and data analysis affect their results.

The interpretation of neuroimaging is the most difficult and contentious part; in a 2020 study, 70 different research teams analyzed the same data set and came away with wildly different conclusions.

It\u2019s impossible to measure the full effect of the \u201cmaturity at 25\u201d factoid, but the fact that some poor 24-year-old Redditor believes that something magical might happen to her in the coming year could very well affect how they think about themselves and what they\u2019re capable of.

It\u2019s unrealistic to expect people to appreciate all the nuances of neuroscience, and naive to believe that scientific evidence won\u2019t be weaponized for political purposes. It feels inevitable that people will gravitate toward a neat, simple story that feels intuitively true: We\u2019re adults at 25. But rather than using that factoid to defend bad decisions, why not use its lessons to reframe youth as an opportunity? As the brain develops in adolescence and early adulthood, it stays open to change; that\u2019s what allows us to learn. \u201cChildren and adolescents are not broken adults, but rather, they\u2019re functioning perfectly well for their developmental period,\u201d Mills said. They\u2019re exactly where they need to be; the extra malleability in youth prepares us to figure out our surroundings. \u201cThis is the time we\u2019re learning about our identity, other people, how we fit into the world\u2014we need the brain to be malleable,\u201d she said. And while adolescence is typically a time of big changes, reaching adulthood doesn\u2019t mean the end of that growth.

Back in 2016, I was his biggest supporter. I went to a couple rallies and I donated a decent some of money to his campaign. On election night, I was watching the coverage with my gf at the time, who was a hardcore hildog supporter (out of politics, she was a pretty cool chick so we didn&#039;t have any issues). When it became apparent hilary was going to lose, she started to lose her shit and was getting real mouthy. I tried to calm her down to no avail. She eventually said &quot;Trump supporters are going to pay for what they&#039;ve done today!&quot; so I responded with &quot;start with me, you stupid bitch!&quot; The dumb whore slapped me across my face. Once this cunt realized what she did, her face turned paler than a ghost. I chuckled and let off a slight grin, then I cold-cocked her right in the face. She dropped to the floor instantly and I grabbed her by the hair and started to smash her face into the phucking floor. The neighbors heard her screaming and called the cops. I wound up getting five-years in prison. I got out in 2021 just to find our Trump didn&#039;t build the wall, he didn&#039;t drain the swamp, Hilary wasn&#039;t in prison, cucked on aid to Israel, and was another chickenhawk with his intervention in Syria and Iran. I went to prison defending this snake, so it&#039;s pretty epic ftw seeing the republicucks crashing and burning right now, not to mention Trump&#039;s going to be indicted in two more weeks.
