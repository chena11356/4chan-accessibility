The hearing is scheduled for Friday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.<br><br>The request came after months of mounting frustration from the Justice Department with Trump\u2019s team \u2014 frustration that spiked in June after the former president\u2019s lawyers provided assurances that a diligent search had been conducted for classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago Club and residence. But the FBI amassed evidence suggesting \u2014 and later confirmed through a court-authorized search \u2014 that many more remained.<br><br>One of the key areas of disagreement centers on the Trump legal team\u2019s repeated refusal to designate a custodian of records to sign a document attesting that all classified materials have been returned to the federal government, according to two of these people. The Justice Department has repeatedly sought an unequivocal sworn written assurance from Trump\u2019s team that all such documents have been returned, and Trump\u2019s team has been unwilling to designate a custodian of records to sign such a statement while also giving assurances that they have handed documents back.", "filename": "1660336013671352", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1180, "h": 842, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 178, "tim": 1670581736179687, "time": 1670581736, "md5": "JzmZjfUnAe5RpZQGaadDGg==", "fsize": 114509, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "trump-team-will-soon-be-held-in-contempt-its-over", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 17, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 12, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1122712, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)13:38:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1122651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1122651</a><br>the worst part about it is they&#039;re not going to do anything about it. just constant menacing with no follow through. like a yapping dog", "time": 1670611091, "resto": 1122554}, {"no": 1122722, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)14:17:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1122554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1122554</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i-its over for trump!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the walls are c-c-closing in!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its literally mueller time, for real!</span><br>Says increasingly desperate troon for the 1,000,000th time since 2016.

A jury found two corporate entities at the Trump Organization guilty on all 17 counts, including conspiracy charges and falsifying business records. The verdict came on the second day of deliberations following a trial in which the Trump Organization was accused of being complicit in a scheme by top executives to avoid paying personal income taxes on job perks such as rent-free apartments and luxury cars.

Texas, an important immigration case, the Supreme Court got sidetracked over a question that has major implications for the executive branch and its ability to function: Can a plaintiff walk into court, challenge a federal regulation, and win a victory that halts the entire government\u2019s ability to enforce that regulation anywhere, against anyone\u2014even parties that played no role in the litigation?<br><br>The answer to this question is important, because this tactic has rapidly become an obstacle to governance.<br><br>Under President Barack Obama, conservative judges began using a specific power to \u201cset aside\u201d policies, granted to them by a provision of a 1946 law, to halt executive policies nationwide, claiming that Congress intended to award them this sweeping power. Left-leaning judges used the tool to limit President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to rewrite federal statutes, particularly asylum law, and prompted a huge backlash among Republicans. Today, with President Joe Biden in office, conservative judges have transformed the power to \u201cset aside\u201d policies into an unprecedented weapon of obstruction, voiding agency rules and executive policies so frequently that they have turned the federal judiciary into a kind of shadow president with a permanent veto over the actual, elected president.<br><br>It is not actually clear, though, that judges even have the legal authority to wipe federal policy off the books.

David Rivera arrested. Charges tied to $50 million he laundered", "com": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/lo<wbr>cal/article269634466.html<br><br>Former Republican Miami Congressman David Rivera was arrested Monday on federal criminal charges, including failing to register as a foreign agent for Venezuela, stemming from his $50 million consulting contract with the country\u2019s oil company that supposedly aimed to improve its tarnished image in the United States. Rivera, a once-influential player in South Florida politics, and his former Miami-Dade political consultant, Esther Nuhfer, have been charged by an indictment accusing them of conspiring to commit offenses against the United States, failing to register as foreign agents as part of their consulting work for Venezuela\u2019s oil subsidiary, PDV USA, and money laundering. Rivera had his first federal court appearance in Atlanta, where he had been living and was arrested Monday afternoon. But he is expected to be transferred to Miami this week to face charges that were returned on Nov. 16 by a federal grand jury in Miami, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in South Florida. The Miami Herald could not reach Rivera or his defense attorney, but the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Marshals Service said Rivera had bailed out of jail Monday afternoon after making an initial appearance in Atlanta federal court. His attorney, Jeffrey Feldman, declined to comment, telling the AP in a text message that he had \u201cnot seen the indictment.\u201d<br>The indictment accuses Rivera and Nuhfer of conspiring to \u201cunlawfully enrich themselves by engaging in political activities in the United States on behalf of the Government of Venezuela ... in an effort to influence United States foreign policy toward Venezuela.\u201d It further accuses them of trying \u201cto conceal these efforts by failing to register under [federal law] as agents of the Government of Venezuela and by creating the false appearance that they were providing consulting services to PDV USA.\u201c", "filename": "1670307679925441", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670323484947187, "time": 1670323484, "md5": "EEcpFhIeInxG4GS33nSJiA==", "fsize": 121118, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "republican-rep-david-rivera-arrested-charges-tied", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 5, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1121293, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)05:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As Venezuela\u2019s economy was crashing in 2017, the country\u2019s state-owned oil company hired Rivera for a costly public relations campaign to prop up the Venezuelan firm in the United States and to prevent U.S. sanctions. In just a few months, Rivera\u2019s business, Interamerican Consulting, collected $20 million from Venezuela\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, PDV USA, but its $50 million contract with the former politician abruptly ended when he was accused of doing little work, according to a lawsuit in New York that was filed before the federal indictment in Miami. Court documents in both the civil and federal case revealed that Rivera diverted more than half of his PDV USA income \u2014 $13 million \u2014 to three subcontractors in Miami who supposedly provided \u201cinternational strategic consulting services\u201d for the Venezuelan firm.<br>One of Rivera\u2019s subcontractors who received millions from his Venezuelan deal was a Miami real estate developer, Hugo Perera, who was convicted in one of South Florida\u2019s biggest drug-trafficking cases, the Miami Herald and el Nuevo Herald have learned from court records and sources familiar with Perera\u2019s history. Perera is not named as a defendant in the indictment filed against Rivera and Nuhfer.

PDV USA, based in New York and the parent company of Houston-based Citgo, is seeking to recover the $20 million in payments from Rivera\u2019s company in a breach-of-contract suit stemming from their original $50 million agreement signed in 2017.
