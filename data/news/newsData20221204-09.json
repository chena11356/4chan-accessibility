Left-leaning judges used the tool to limit President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to rewrite federal statutes, particularly asylum law, and prompted a huge backlash among Republicans. Today, with President Joe Biden in office, conservative judges have transformed the power to \u201cset aside\u201d policies into an unprecedented weapon of obstruction, voiding agency rules and executive policies so frequently that they have turned the federal judiciary into a kind of shadow president with a permanent veto over the actual, elected president.<br><br>It is not actually clear, though, that judges even have the legal authority to wipe federal policy off the books.

How we talk about maturity and adulthood\u2014and the evidence we use to support that\u2014has real-world consequences for our behavior and self-concept. It\u2019s impossible to measure the full effect of the \u201cmaturity at 25\u201d factoid, but the fact that some poor 24-year-old Redditor believes that something magical might happen to her in the coming year could very well affect how they think about themselves and what they\u2019re capable of. Mills told me she\u2019s heard from middle and high school students that their teachers often point to \u201cbrain science\u201d as justification for their bad decisions. (Mills is currently working on a study to interview young people about what they think and feel when they hear those kinds of assertions.)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even with a flimsy basis at best, the real-world consequences of the \u201cbrains are fully mature at 25\u201d myth are only beginning to emerge. Some of those are relatively harmless; using this half-truth to explain Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s dating habits primarily hurts DiCaprio, who hardly needs our sympathy. But as people continue to cite this factoid, it has the power to create serious societal change. In some cases, the result might literally save lives\u2014for instance, keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of young people or preventing instances of capital punishment. In other cases, it could cost lives; anti-trans activists cite this as evidence that young people should not be allowed to access lifesaving, gender-affirming care. The ultimate trajectory of this growing belief\u2014and the profound effect it could have on young lives\u2014is impossible to know, but it\u2019s clear that neuroscience has and will be deployed to shape policy.</span>", "time": 1669785726, "resto": 1119390}, {"no": 1119411, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)00:23:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perhaps the whole enterprise needs a reframe. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect people to appreciate all the nuances of neuroscience, and naive to believe that scientific evidence won\u2019t be weaponized for political purposes. It feels inevitable that people will gravitate toward a neat, simple story that feels intuitively true: We\u2019re adults at 25. But rather than using that factoid to defend bad decisions, why not use its lessons to reframe youth as an opportunity? As the brain develops in adolescence and early adulthood, it stays open to change; that\u2019s what allows us to learn. \u201cChildren and adolescents are not broken adults, but rather, they\u2019re functioning perfectly well for their developmental period,\u201d Mills said. They\u2019re exactly where they need to be; the extra malleability in youth prepares us to figure out our surroundings. \u201cThis is the time we\u2019re learning about our identity, other people, how we fit into the world\u2014we need the brain to be malleable,\u201d she said. And while adolescence is typically a time of big changes, reaching adulthood doesn\u2019t mean the end of that growth. You can make good or bad decisions at any age; you\u2019ll mature and regress throughout your life. You, like your brain, are endlessly complex, and we\u2019re so much more than brain scans will ever reveal.</span>", "time": 1669785787, "resto": 1119390}, {"no": 1119565, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)19:02:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1119390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1119390</a><br>i kept trying to figure out where this rambling, boring-ass article was going, then I got there.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&quot;In other cases, it could cost lives; anti-trans activists cite this as evidence that young people should not be allowed to access lifesaving, gender-affirming care.&quot;</span><br>fucking slate.", "time": 1669852964, "resto": 1119390}], "last_modified": 1669852964}]}, {"page": 6, "threads": [{"no": 1118460, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)12:11:32", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Seattle socialist arrested for Nazi saluting sea-tac airport", "com": "A Seattle neo Nazi socialist, Nicholas Edward Letney, arrested at Seattle airport.<br>Nazi identified as Nicholas Edward Letney.

When it became apparent hilary was going to lose, she started to lose her shit and was getting real mouthy. I tried to calm her down to no avail. She eventually said &quot;Trump supporters are going to pay for what they&#039;ve done today!&quot; so I responded with &quot;start with me, you stupid bitch!&quot; The dumb whore slapped me across my face. Once this cunt realized what she did, her face turned paler than a ghost. I chuckled and let off a slight grin, then I cold-cocked her right in the face. She dropped to the floor instantly and I grabbed her by the hair and started to smash her face into the phucking floor. The neighbors heard her screaming and called the cops. I wound up getting five-years in prison. I got out in 2021 just to find our Trump didn&#039;t build the wall, he didn&#039;t drain the swamp, Hilary wasn&#039;t in prison, cucked on aid to Israel, and was another chickenhawk with his intervention in Syria and Iran. I went to prison defending this snake, so it&#039;s pretty epic ftw seeing the republicucks crashing and burning right now, not to mention Trump&#039;s going to be indicted in two more weeks. I obviously can&#039;t vote, but I live in a state with loose voter ID laws. My geriatric father has the same name as me, so I used his name at the polling station and voted blue down the line.
