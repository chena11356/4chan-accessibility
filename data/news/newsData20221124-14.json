I&#039;ll explain. Firstly, Biden did not fuck domestic production. I&#039;ll go through a few of the popular talking points that retards like you parrot. Keystone XL was dead before Biden even came into office and even if it wasn&#039;t it was an export pipeline. It had nothing to do with production for the purpose of domestic consumption. Secondly, Biden&#039;s EO that prohibited the renewal of leases on federal lands did nothing to impact production. The U.S. gets less than 1/4 of its oil production from federal lands and oil companies are currently sitting on 9000 unused permits (or 12 million acres) that they could drill on any time they want. The reason oil companies are not investing in these developments is because they&#039;re making record profits and using those profits in stock buybacks. They have no incentive to increase production because they&#039;re making more money now than they ever have. It has nothing to do with them being afraid because Biden is in office. Biden has close to no leverage to bully OPEC into doing what he wants them to do and there is no &quot;shortage&quot;. As I said, oil companies are sitting on 12 million acres of federal lands (which again only makes up 24% of all U.S. drilling) they could drill on any time but they don&#039;t want to because they have no need to. This is why Biden is pressuring them to increase production and even began fining them for the practice of sitting on unused permits and not developing them. As I said, nearly everything you said was comically incorrect. You know absolutely nothing about this topic other than whatever propaganda your far-right blogs have convinced you of.", "time": 1669259184, "resto": 1117089}, {"no": 1117763, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)22:14:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1117762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1117762</a><br>brandon and mayorfaggot childrapist let the standard oil jews change the DoE regs and caused all the shale companies that were keeping the price down to bust out of business<br>https://www.wsj.com/articles/fracki<wbr>ng-oil-prices-shale-boom-1164382432<wbr>9<br>Under Trump the small shale frackers were keeping prices low by over producing.

That included stops along the way in VIP rooms of Caribbean strip joints, Amsterdam\u2019s red-light district and aboard a Colombian yacht that launched with plenty of booze and more than a dozen prostitutes.", "filename": "1280px-QaLastSunset", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668539492394363, "time": 1668539492, "md5": "Ze5xZLo7zfNqQOzw4WYK5Q==", "fsize": 134618, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "most-corrupt-dea-agent", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 17, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 12, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1115073, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)18:17:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1114955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1114955</a><br>Doesn&#039;t really surprise me they finally caught this guy while under Republican leadership", "time": 1668554278, "resto": 1114955}, {"no": 1115159, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)23:32:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1114955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1114955</a><br>Good thread<br>Thanks op", "time": 1668573155, "resto": 1114955}, {"no": 1115182, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)01:06:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Classic /news/ ending OP, nice one.
