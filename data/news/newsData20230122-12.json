Pritzker raised the memory of the July 4th parade massacre in Highland Park last year \u2013 which left seven people dead and 36 injured, and left a 2-year-old boy parentless and wandering around.<br><br>The shooter used legally-purchased semiautomatic weapon.<br>Pritzker said the massacre was allowed to happen &quot;all because our state and our nation have been held hostage by the NRA and their allies time and time again.<br><br>&quot;After nearly every mass shooting, we&#039;ve seen efforts to ban dangerous weapons thwarted \u2013 and then leaders send their thoughts and prayers, while the they throw their hands up \u2013 resigning themselves to the idea that gun violence is a sacrifice that Americans must accept,&quot; Pritzker said. &quot;But it doesn&#039;t have to be that way.&quot;<br><br>Pritzker emphasized that he and members of the Illinois General Assembly have been battling the gun lobby to pass gun safety legislation for years and with some success \u2013 but until now, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines have been elusive.<br><br>Pritzker noted that while most attention has gone to &quot;weapons of war&quot; such as AR-style rifles like the one used in Highland Park, many mass shootings also involve handguns modified by switches that turn them into automatic weapons. Such a modified handgun was used mass shooting in May of last year that killed two people and wounded seven outside the McDonald&#039;s at Chicago Avenue and State Street, Pritzker noted.", "filename": "1645535304190", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1366, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673486325503107, "time": 1673486325, "md5": "BbUqC55KV+o5KVMeFYt9KA==", "fsize": 251109, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gov-jb-pritzker-signs-illinois-assault-weapons", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 122, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 45}, {"no": 1133013, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:33:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Remember kids, gun ownership is not a human right.", "time": 1673487198, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133019, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:42:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1133012</span><br>Of course it won&#039;t, Republicans will keep trafficking weapons of war into Illinois across the border from Indianian and Wisconsin.", "time": 1673487743, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133032, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1133023</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s illegal</span><br>That doesn&#039;t stop Republicans from violating the law, like not enforcing Red Flag laws.", "time": 1673488768, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133046, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)21:30:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1133036</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We don&#039;t follow the laws </span><br>Thank you for admitting that Republicans are called gun traffickers and allow mass murders to happen.", "time": 1673490636, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133049, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)21:31:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Another Democrat bill that will overturned in the supreme court.

Not only had the insurrection itself failed but so had all theother efforts Trump had made to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump and his allies had made over 200 overtures to state officials to throw out the results of the election, according to the final report of the House-appointed January 6 committee. Trump filed 62 lawsuits in an effort to have the results evacuated, only to see the effort totally fail. A strong majority of Americans are repulsed by Trump&#039;s attacks on democracy. Four out of five Americansbelieve Trump acted &quot;unethically or illegally&quot; in trying to steal the 2020 election and nearly 70% say January 6 was a crisis point for the U.S. Under the circumstances, it was reasonable to expect the GOP to back down from these unpopular anti-democratic activities.<br><br>However, the opposite happened in 2022. A new report from Democracy Docket chronicling the election litigation in 2022 shows the trend moving forward, with Republicans continuing to file large numbers of lawsuits geared toward making it harder for Americans to vote or for those votes to be counted. In 2022, there were 93 anti-voting lawsuits filed across the country \u2014 fairly steady from 2020, when there were 95 lawsuits aimed at making it harder to vote or attempting to throw out votes. And in one aspect, things are getting worse: In 2022, the flood of lawsuits spread throughout state and federal races, instead of being driven by Trump&#039;s single-minded obsession with suing his way to victory in the 2020 presidential race.", "filename": "trumpandbiden", "ext": ".gif", "w": 600, "h": 628, "tn_w": 238, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673561997530625, "time": 1673561997, "md5": "j83mxIpZeJ7tpnxNIMU/ug==", "fsize": 256282, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "conservatives-hate-democracy", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 34, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 19}, {"no": 1133296, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:20:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As elections lawyer and Democracy Docket founder Marc Elias pointed out in his blog post on the report,there was nothing inevitable about this surge of Republican lawsuits attempting to disenfranchise voters.

This week, Abe Streep at the New York Times Magazine takes a deep dive into how Montana politics have been captured, through Republican leadership, by Christian nationalists who wish to impose their views by fiat.

Montana, he writes, &quot;has long been one of the most politically independent states in the union,&quot; with a Republican party that tended to exhibit a more libertarian bent. But in recent years, &quot;the dominant voice is that of the far right.&quot;<br><br>This has also been on display in the U.S. Congress, where the slim Republican majority in the House has embraced a slate of demands from the far right, many of which are geared toward stopping investigations that might reveal any conspiracies that helped lead to the events of January 6. House Republicans gutted the Office of Congressional Ethics, which had the power to look into accusations that Republican members of Congress were involved in Trump&#039;s attempted coup. They&#039;ve also started a subcommittee called &quot;Weaponization of the Federal Government,&quot; which Republicans say is necessary to stop federal law enforcement overreach. Critics, however, point out that the main targets appear to be any federal officials who are investigating the January 6 attacks and other right wing efforts to intimidate elected officials or government employees.", "time": 1673562085, "resto": 1133295}, {"no": 1133298, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:22:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1133295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1133295</a><br>Last week, supporters of defeated far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro rioted in Brazil, for the apparent purpose of overthrowing the current leftist president in favor of the hard-right Bolsonaro.

While far from the only state to criminalize drug use during pregnancy, the law in Alabama is particularly harsh: if a woman has a miscarriage or stillbirth and is found to have used drugs during her pregnancy, the law states she can be sent to prison for 99 years (Kilander, 2022).

Santos was later caught lying to the public on multiple occasions, in particular involving his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The Washington Post reported that Santos\u2019s main campaign committee received the maximal individual amount of USD 5,800 from Intrater as well as his wife. On top of that committees with connections to Santos received \u201dtens of thousands\u201d of Dollars. Intraters firm has also put \u201chundreds of thousands of Dollars\u201c into Santos former employer Harbor City, which was accused by regulators of running a Ponzi scheme.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Intrater manages the investment firm Sparrow Capital, formerly known as Columbus Nova, which was the American affiliate of the Russian Renova Group, where he also served on the board of directors. Renova Group is owned by Intrater&#039;s cousin, the Russian oligarch Victor Vekselberg. Columbus Nova&#039;s biggest asset at the time was a controlling stake in CIFC, a publicly-traded company that managed credit investments. Together with Israel&#039;s former prime minister Ehud Barak, Intrater was on the board of CIFC. CIFC was sold in 2016 for US$333 million to F.A.B. Partners, an investment vehicle of Qatar&#039;s royal family.

Three employees told TIME they were expected to read and label between 150 and 250 passages of text per nine-hour shift. Those snippets could range from around 100 words to well over 1,000. All of the four employees interviewed by TIME described being mentally scarred by the work. Two said they were only given the option to attend group sessions, and one said their requests to see counselors on a one-to-one basis instead were repeatedly denied by Sama management.<br>In the day-to-day work of data labeling in Kenya, sometimes edge cases would pop up that showed the difficulty of teaching a machine to understand nuance. One day in early March last year, a Sama employee was at work reading an explicit story about Batman\u2019s sidekick, Robin, being raped in a villain\u2019s lair. (An online search for the text reveals that it originated from an online erotica site, where it is accompanied by explicit sexual imagery.) The beginning of the story makes clear that the sex is nonconsensual. But later\u2014after a graphically detailed description of penetration\u2014Robin begins to reciprocate. The Sama employee tasked with labeling the text appeared confused by Robin\u2019s ambiguous consent, and asked OpenAI researchers for clarification about how to label the text, according to documents seen by TIME. Should the passage be labeled as sexual violence, she asked, or not?", "filename": "d56d599659009ee58b439fc6e723367af3080eaf", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 317, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 165, "tim": 1674142709883495, "time": 1674142709, "md5": "yBcSrvLGMMwa2raP2b9nOA==", "fsize": 33294, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "kenyans-paid-2hr-to-suffer-psychological-abuse", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 1135010, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)14:18:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1134962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1134962</a><br>We found the one good thing that coomers are good for: mindbreaking Kenyans, apparently.", "time": 1674155911, "resto": 1134962}, {"no": 1135012, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)14:29:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;kenyans</span><br>https://youtu.be/qRuNxHqwazs", "time": 1674156554, "resto": 1134962}, {"no": 1135034, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)15:38:23", "name": "Afro Saxon", "com": "<a href=\"#p1134962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1134962</a><br>None of my business, we warn those apes the nature of white people, they can cope or kill themselves.", "time": 1674160703, "resto": 1134962}, {"no": 1135056, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)16:12:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1134962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1134962</a><br>This is an interesting story with implications for how AIs are put together in the future.

Successful transition typically involves modifying your body to more accurately express the gender you perceive yourself as. Social reinforcement is a large part of that. Granted, most trans people transition focusing primarily on the more easily manageable secondary characteristics. Sexual reassignment surgery is actually fairly rare, something like less than 5% of trans people ever get it done. Even in cases of SRS, the sex of the person is not being altered.

This is made evident by the fact that having a penis or a functioning vagina/uterus isn&#039;t what makes you a man or woman. If I scooped out an entire woman&#039;s reproductive system her biological sex is completely unchanged. Gender is the expression of a combination of innate biological and socially prescribed characteristics. If a person with gender dysphoria were suddenly zapped with a ray and their chromosomes switched to the opposite sex but they still looked exactly the same they would still experience dysphoria. Additionally, if I zapped you with a ray and changed your chromosomes to the opposite sex but you looked exactly the same you wouldn&#039;t suddenly &quot;feel&quot; like a woman because you don&#039;t have gender dysphoria - you identify as a man and, if I had to guess, it would probably be distressing to you that your body did not match your internal perception of what your gender is.

Wyoming\u2019s legislature is considering a resolution that calls for a phaseout of new electric vehicle sales by 2035. Introduced on Friday, Senate Joint Resolution 4 has support from members of the state\u2019s House of Representatives and Senate.<br><br>In the proposed resolution, a group of lawmakers led by Senator Jim Anderson says Wyoming\u2019s \u201cproud and valued\u201d oil and gas industry has created \u201ccountless\u201d jobs and contributed revenue to the state\u2019s coffers. They add that a lack of charging infrastructure within Wyoming would make the widespread use of EVs \u201cimpracticable\u201d and that the state would need to build \u201cmassive amounts of new power generation\u201d to \u201csustain the misadventure of electric vehicles.\u201d<br><br>SJ4 calls for residents and businesses to limit the sale and purchase of EVs voluntarily, with the goal of phasing them out entirely by 2035. If passed, the resolution would be entirely symbolic. In fact, it\u2019s more about sending a message to EV advocates than banning the vehicles altogether. To that point, the final section of SJ4 calls for Wyoming\u2019s Secretary of State to send President Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom copies of the resolution.<br><br>\u201cOne might even say tongue-in-cheek, but obviously it\u2019s a very serious issue that deserves some public discussion,\u201d Senator Boner, one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, told the Cowboy State Daily. \u201cI\u2019m interested in making sure that the solutions that some folks want to the so-called climate crisis are actually practical in real life.

The legislation will apply to platforms that host user-generated content, which covers social media services such as Twitter, TikTok and Facebook, and search engines such as Google. Although many of these services are based outside the UK, if they are accessible to UK users then they are in the scope of the bill\u2019s powers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All tech firms covered by the bill will have to protect all users from illegal content.

This will involve preventing children from accessing harmful content and ensuring that age limits on social media platforms \u2013 the minimum age is typically 13 \u2013 are enforced. Platforms will have to explain in their terms of service how they enforce these age limits and what technology they use to police them.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In relation to both of these duties, tech firms will have to carry out risk assessments detailing the threats their services might pose in terms of illegal content and keeping children safe. They will then have to explain how they will mitigate those threats \u2013 for example through human moderators or using artificial intelligence tools \u2013 in a process that will be overseen by Ofcom, the communications regulator.

At the top end, it will be able to impose fines of up to \u00a318m, or 10% of global turnover \u2013 a big number if it is a company such as Meta, which generated revenue of just under $118bn in 2021. In the most extreme cases, rogue sites can be blocked from operating by ordering payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with them. Ofcom will also have the power to issue enforcement notices under the bill, telling companies and platforms to improve how they operate.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can executives go to jail under the legislation?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even before the government conceded to backbench rebels on Monday, tech executives faced the threat of a two-year jail sentence under the legislation, if they hinder an Ofcom investigation or a request for information.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, they also face the threat of a two-year jail sentence if they persistently ignore Ofcom enforcement notices telling them they have breached their duty of care to children.

How that is to be done is up to the platform \u2013 there are a number of tools that can be used to check a user\u2019s age \u2013 but it will be vetted by Ofcom. The government has said any age assurance method used by pornography sites would have to protect users\u2019 data, reflecting privacy campaigners\u2019 concerns that requiring users of porn websites to log in could make it easier to collect \u2013 and leak \u2013 data on an individual\u2019s viewing habits.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Will it protect adults from online trolls and abuse?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Under a previous iteration, the bill placed a duty of care on large platforms to address content that was harmful but not illegal.

Instead, tech firms will be required to remove certain types of \u201clegal but harmful\u201d content if it is already banned under their terms of service, under a clause that tries to ensure platforms pay more than just lip service to their content rules. Adults will also have the option of screening out certain types of harmful content if they so choose.

Back in 2016, I was his biggest supporter. I went to a couple rallies and I donated a decent some of money to his campaign. On election night, I was watching the coverage with my gf at the time, who was a hardcore hildog supporter (out of politics, she was a pretty cool chick so we didn&#039;t have any issues). When it became apparent hilary was going to lose, she started to lose her shit and was getting real mouthy. I tried to calm her down to no avail. She eventually said &quot;Trump supporters are going to pay for what they&#039;ve done today!&quot; so I responded with &quot;start with me, you stupid bitch!&quot; The dumb whore slapped me across my face. Once this cunt realized what she did, her face turned paler than a ghost. I chuckled and let off a slight grin, then I cold-cocked her right in the face. She dropped to the floor instantly and I grabbed her by the hair and started to smash her face into the phucking floor. The neighbors heard her screaming and called the cops. I wound up getting five-years in prison. I got out in 2021 just to find our Trump didn&#039;t build the wall, he didn&#039;t drain the swamp, Hilary wasn&#039;t in prison, cucked on aid to Israel, and was another chickenhawk with his intervention in Syria and Iran. I went to prison defending this snake, so it&#039;s pretty epic ftw seeing the republicucks crashing and burning right now, not to mention Trump&#039;s going to be indicted in two more weeks. I obviously can&#039;t vote, but I live in a state with loose voter ID laws. My geriatric father has the same name as me, so I used his name at the polling station and voted blue down the line.

It says your 21 or older.</span><br>There&#039;s a few reason this is a bad analogy. Firstly, a club, bar or strip club is a physical location that you have to leave your house to enter. The notion that a club would check your ID involves far less privacy implications than needing your ID verified in the comfort of your own home. The second reason this is a bad analogy is because the burden of who is responsible for managing age-appropriate materials inside of the home has always been the parent, not the state. At least in our lifetime I&#039;ve never understood that to be the case in bars or clubs. I think it sets a very dangerous precedent to make the state responsible for managing age-appropriate materials for people&#039;s children especially when conservatives are the ones who have been platforming this message for the last several decades. This is the same justification they use for removing sex education from schools. Seems like a slippery slope to control a problem that hasn&#039;t even really proven itself to be a giant issue. This law does absolutely nothing that a parental lock on an iPad can&#039;t do.", "time": 1673233727, "resto": 1130964}, {"no": 1133513, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)14:22:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1132073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1132073</a><br>See, there&#039;s a difference between giving your ID to a local shop or club and giving your ID to a third-party app online. With the former, while you did give up your identity to the people there and it might be logged in a computer if they have it, it&#039;s more likely kept private for that club or shop only. Thus, security is pretty much guaranteed. To top it off, it&#039;s easier to know when someone is using a fake ID since it&#039;s all being done in person. None of those factors really exist for the law in effect. Right now, we&#039;re seeing this integrated with LA Wallet, which is usually used for driver licenses. Not only do we barely know anything about this app, but it&#039;s owned by a private company and to my knowledge, it&#039;s likely a proprietary app. So, we don&#039;t know just how much info they could store on someone who signs up for it.<br>This could be catastrophic if someone were to decide to breach the app and leak its info, which could lead to either blackmail or even identity theft. The internet has a massive scope that spans the entire globe. Do you expect me to believe that nobody would want to break into this app to get everyone&#039;s IDs? It&#039;s insane. If we don&#039;t trust Facebook to keep our identities safe with their bullshit ID verification, why should we trust this? If they try to keep this up, push it into other states, or even attempt to have it apply to other parts of the internet like social media, it&#039;s more likely that we&#039;ll see hackers trying to use this as an opportunity to steal and even dox individuals for their online activity.

Pamelia J, 27, was diagnosed with gigantomastia in March 2022 after seeking medical help for her back, neck and shoulder pain.<br><br>The model was referred to a surgeon, who identified that she has a very uncommon condition characterised by excessive breast tissue growth. Pamelia hopes to raise awareness of the challenges that come with rapidly-growing boobs, like shopping for clothes and getting vile looks from men.<br><br>In just eight months, Pamelia&#039;s bust went from a J cup bra size to an M cup, growing 14cm in width.<br><br>She says it causes her massive physical and mental discomfort, and she often gets judged by strangers for her large boobs.<br><br>&quot;It is very uncomfortable - they are so heavy and I can be in a lot of pain,&quot; Pamelia told the Mirror. At first it was fun and interesting to see how much they were growing, but recently I&#039;ve grown to be uncomfortable, and I find myself wishing I had normal tits. I struggle to find clothing to suit my tits and I end up just wearing oversized T-shirts. There are very limited options for big-titted bints if you don&#039;t want to have your tits on show. I feel self-conscious when out in public. If I wear something that is tight on my chest, I notice women giving me looks.I feel like I&#039;m getting dirty looks for having big tits, so I tend to stay at home - Am I on crazy pills?!.&quot;<br><br>Pamelia, who is an OnlyFans content creator, also suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) so is undergoing testing to see if the two conditions could be related.<br>Gigantomastia can be caused by a range of factors including hormonal changes, medications, and autoimmune diseases, but Pamelia&#039;s cause is currently unknown.

Barry Croft Jr, a member of the far-right Three Percenters militia group, was sentenced on Wednesday after being convicted of conspiracy and possession of an unregistered explosive. Another participant and militia member, Adam Fox, received a 16-year sentence on Tuesday. \u201cAlthough he may not have had hierarchical control over all the other participants, he [Croft] coordinated and pushed the implementation of the conspiracy from its inception to its final stages,\u201d Assistant US Attorney Nils Kessler said in a court filing. Croft is the fourth and final federal defendant in the case to be handed a sentence, part of a high-profile series of arrests that has brought attention to the growing threat of far-right militia groups in the US. Prosecutors depicted Croft and Fox as the leaders of an operation they hoped would trigger a \u201csecond American revolution\u201d. Prosecutors said the group planned to abduct Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor, from her vacation home in 2020 in order to give her a sham \u201ctrial\u201d on charges of treason and potentially execute her. Members of the group were opposed to public health measures put in place under Whitmer to combat the spread of COVID-19. Croft and Fox were also found guilty of planning to use an explosive device that prosecutors said would be used to hinder law enforcement response to the kidnapping. In addition to his 16-year sentence, Fox was given five years of supervised release.</span>", "filename": "12.28.22", "ext": ".png", "w": 770, "h": 318, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 103, "tim": 1672263300089043, "time": 1672263300, "md5": "nX96TbAV0bdnd6HHrnJopQ==", "fsize": 474879, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "us-militia-member-sentenced-to-19-years-in", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 42, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 1128234, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)16:36:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the US domestic intelligence agency, was embedded in the group, and 13 people, including Croft and Fox, were charged in October 2020 in relation to the conspiracy.

A different jury in Grand Rapids failed to reach a verdict on Croft and Cox in an initial trial earlier in the year and acquitted two others. Prosecutors sought life sentences for both Croft and Fox. Croft\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Blanchard, had played down his client\u2019s centrality in the plot, saying that he was \u201ca participant to a lesser degree than others\u201d. Whitmer had openly sparred with former US President Donald Trump over public health policies in her state meant to contain the spread of COVID-19, and Trump was accused of contributing to a hostile environment through his repeated attacks on Whitmer.

While a terrorism enhancement set up Fox for a possible life term, Jonker said that the harshest sentence isn\u2019t automatic and that he had to carefully consider other factors. Jonker said he leaned heavily on a 2018-19 Northern California case in which U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, sentenced Islamic State sympathizer Amer Alhaggagi to 188 months in prison, more than 15 years short of the 33 years sought by prosecutors. \u201cYou have to calibrate, as judges, the overall seriousness of wrongdoing and the overall seriousness of the defendant\u2019s history,&quot; Jonker said.</span>", "time": 1672264838, "resto": 1128232}, {"no": 1128251, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:08:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI see nothing in the record ... nothing that makes me think he\u2019s a natural leader and nothing that makes me think he\u2019s the kind of person that anybody involved in this group was naturally going to follow.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler had said Fox was out to spark an all-out war and needed to be put away for life. \u201cThey wanted a second Civil War or a revolution,\u201d Kessler told the court Tuesday. &quot;They wanted to ruin everything for everybody.&quot; Kessler warned that Fox will still be dangerous when he someday walks free. \u201cThe problem is this defendant, he\u2019s going to go into jail and probably emerge more radicalized than when he went in and will remain a danger to the public, your honor,&quot; the prosecutor said.

Wallace dedicated her Boxing Day show to the shocking revelations from this year that Russia&#039;s Vladimir Putin was working with Donald Trump&#039;s allies because he thought he could take pieces of eastern Ukraine, specifically Mariupol, without waging his invasion.<br><br>Writing before the mid-term election, New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg explained that hundreds of documents he&#039;s sifted through, in addition to former Robert Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann&#039;s details, revealed enough to show what Putin was after when he worked to swing the 2016 election for Trump.<br><br>&quot;What Weissman found was all along Paul Manafort and others were avoiding talking about the meeting at the cigar bar I just mentioned or the idea of the Mariupol plan, and it was concealed from them, they felt when Weissman gets new e-mails and information and sees things have been left out what he has learned so far from Mr. Manafort, who was speaking with prosecutors as they talked about a possible cooperation deal, and he said, what are they hide here?&quot; asked Rutenberg. &quot;Well, here&#039;s what they are hiding well, what they are talking about is the east of Ukraine, and once you realize how important the east of Ukraine is to Putin, and that there was a Russian meddling operation to affect social media and disrupt American politics, it all came together for Mr. Weissman.&quot;<br><br>It prompted Wallace to wonder if the Manafort pardon was still part of all of that. Trump more recently claimed on his social media site that if he had been president the war with Ukraine wouldn&#039;t have happened. Wallace asked if that is because Trump would have handed Mariupol over to Putin as the Russian leader assumed.", "filename": "1648605780484", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1062, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 245, "tim": 1672143945921400, "time": 1672143945, "md5": "BChFzAjxHhvokXShRzfLOQ==", "fsize": 231870, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "russias-scheme-to-target-ukraine-along-with", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 52, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 1127929, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)07:26:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "&quot;I don&#039;t know what was in his head. I do know there was an argument that one could make that had this plan gone forward,&quot; said Rutenberg. &quot;And by the way, before it got a chance to, the Russian investigation really kicked in and Manafort was in legal trouble it really got stopped in its tracks. However, had that plan gone forward, arguably Putin would have gotten what he wanted and perhaps there would not have been a war and perhaps the flip side would be no Ukraine as we understand it. What any Ukrainian will tell you right now is that wouldn&#039;t have happened anyway, because what we have seen is the Ukrainian people would never have accepted that plan. But Putin&#039;s planning was never based on what the Ukrainian people would do or wouldn&#039;t do, as we now know. Yes, on paper, this would have given Putin what he wanted and would have rendered Ukraine as a broken democracy.&quot;<br><br>With the new information slotted into the Nov. 2022 report, however, it&#039;s clear to the Times&#039; Washington investigative correspondent Mark Mazzetti that it ties together the major global events while the story unspools in real-time. Then, things didn&#039;t seem connected, now they do.<br><br>&quot;If you take the events of the campaign election interference in 2016, Russia sabotaged the election, and the second event being the first impeachment of Donald Trump which was all about Ukraine, and recall that the person who has just been named Time magazine person of the year, Zelensky, was at the time at the other end of the call that Trump placed that was a shakedown call,&quot; said Mazzetti. &quot;And Zelensky is not the person he is now, and then the third one was the invasion of the south. As Jim puts in his piece, Ukraine is the baseline running through this but it shows this was the prize \u2014 or at least a prize that Putin wanted.
