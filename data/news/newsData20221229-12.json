Croft is the fourth and final federal defendant in the case to be handed a sentence, part of a high-profile series of arrests that has brought attention to the growing threat of far-right militia groups in the US. Prosecutors depicted Croft and Fox as the leaders of an operation they hoped would trigger a \u201csecond American revolution\u201d. Prosecutors said the group planned to abduct Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor, from her vacation home in 2020 in order to give her a sham \u201ctrial\u201d on charges of treason and potentially execute her. Members of the group were opposed to public health measures put in place under Whitmer to combat the spread of COVID-19. Croft and Fox were also found guilty of planning to use an explosive device that prosecutors said would be used to hinder law enforcement response to the kidnapping.

What we have yet to cover is Covid. This reporting, for The Free Press, <br>@thefp , is one piece of that important story.<br><br>4. The United States government pressured Twitter and other social media platforms to elevate certain content and suppress other content about Covid-19.<br><br>5. Internal files at Twitter that I viewed while on assignment for <br>@thefp<br> showed that both the Trump and Biden administrations directly pressed Twitter executives to moderate the platform\u2019s pandemic content according to their wishes.<br><br>6. At the onset of the pandemic, according to meeting notes, the Trump admin was especially concerned about panic buying. They came looking for \u201chelp from the tech companies to combat misinformation\u201d about \u201cruns on grocery stores.\u201d But . . . there were runs on grocery stores.<br><br>7.

This has been the case for decades.

Homeless people violate that. They do nothing, contribute nothing, and occupy those spaces while violating social norms by engaging in crime and sleeping in common areas. If enough people do this, eventually something changes in the social ecosystem. For example, if enough homeless occupy my downtown area and do crime, businesses close and fewer people come, which causes a landslide effect. I am seeing this now in our city, the local news touches a bit on it but mostly pretends everything is OK.

These are all punitive actions, and they address a failure to conform to the societal expectations of being a taxpaying citizen.</span><br>I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;re engaging in good faith so I&#039;ll do the same. Here&#039;s a few basic sociological facts. Punishing people into not being homeless doesn&#039;t work. We have the largest, most punitive criminal justice system of any third world country and its done nothing to reduce drug use, address poverty or keep families together. If throwing people in prison solved homelessness then the massive expansion of incarceration in the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s would&#039;ve shown some progress but homelessness has only grown. <br><br>The next fact we know - literally every first world country with a substantial social safety net has exponentially less homeless people than we do. We know for a fact which programs work. For example, we know that providing housing post-release for inmates reduces recidivism. In LA county, for example, it reduced re-offending by something like 40%. We also know that things like GED programs in prisons massively increases the employment rate of post-release convicts. We know that well funded jobs programs reduces homelessness. We know that widely available drug rehabilitation massively decreases drug dependence which massively decreases homelessness. Family planning services, financial advising, after school programs, childcare etc., These are the building blocks of programs that meaningfully reduce homelessness. Every Nordic country on the planet has implemented these programs with wild success.<br><br>Sociologically speaking, the higher you raise the bottom of society the easier it is to lift people up. As someone who lives and works in a city with a big homeless population the idea that these people have all these opportunities to meaningfully improve but just like being homeless is false.", "time": 1671513091, "resto": 1125435}, {"no": 1125804, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)00:17:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1125800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1125800</a><br><a href=\"#p1125803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1125803</a><br>Every city, for example, that has instituted programs like sending social workers to address homelessness instead of cops has seen a drastic decrease in the amount of police resources required, an increase in drug rehabilitation rates and an increase in participation in mental health services. If you understand the sorts of issues that cause homelessness its a rather straight forward issue to address - broken homes, drug addiction, mental health issues, lack of affordable housing. Considering that we live in a country where most Americans can&#039;t afford a $500 emergency it really isn&#039;t a surprise that all it takes is one massively traumatic or expensive life event to send people to the streets where the cycle is inherently built to keep them from succeeding. All it takes is one drug charge, for example, and your job prospects are fucked. All it takes is one eviction or late rent payments to fuck your credit and make sure no property management company every rents to you again. Everyone likes to think that they&#039;re worlds apart from a random homeless person but the reality is that most of us are one or two catastrophic financial or psychiatric incidences away from being in their shoes. Anyways, I could go on but my idea to address homelessness is to stop the issues that causes it. Locking people up doesn&#039;t work. That&#039;s just a fact.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies send legal and information requests to social media companies, telephone companies, GPS companies etc., every day during the course of investigations. It&#039;s my understanding that most larger companies have an entire legal department which handles law enforcement requests for information. Sometimes the request is cell phone records, internal communications data, location records, message history etc., It&#039;s the job of these departments to investigate the requests, process them, and coordinate with law enforcement agencies. The internal e-mail in question in this article essentially says that, historically, Twitter used to just assign employees at their company to process and investigate these requests free of charge but are now deciding to charge the FBI for the man hours that they are dedicating to processing their requests. Given that several Russian nationals were tried and convicted for money laundering, wire fraud, identity theft and hacking in connection to the 2020 election it&#039;s not surprising that the FBI sends requests to Twitter to investigate suspicious accounts. Nowhere in this article is any evidence that the FBI paid Twitter to boost Democratic candidates or to censor anybody. That&#039;s not even what the subject of this article is about, it&#039;s just the misleading title that both OP and the author of this dogshit article put up to bait conservatives.

The Great Depression had also crushed the first iteration of Farmington State Bank, originally founded in 1887, and a new bank of the same name was created in May 1929. Much of Farmington State Bank\u2019s history is hardly noteworthy. Joining the bank in 1973 was C. Wayne Wexler, who served as the bank\u2019s president for over a decade. Throughout the 1970s, the bank held around $1.5 million in deposits, which grew modestly during the 1980s to around $3.5 million. <br><br>Around 1995, Farmington, for reasons still unknown, attracted the attention of a British citizen residing in Hong Kong named Archie Chan. According to a 2010 interview given by Farmington\u2019s then-president, John Widman, Chan bought the bank in 1995 \u201cwhen he was looking for a chartered Washington bank that might become a platform for international banking.\u201d Though this never came to pass, Chan\u2019s connections suggest that his interests in the small, rural bank may have been manifold.<br><br>Chan acquired Farmington through a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) called Farmington Finance Corporation. The lawyer who aided him in setting up the corporate structure for the new Farmington organization was David K.Y. Tang, who \u2013 among other things \u2013 is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Tang, whose careers in law and business spans Seattle, Hong Kong and Beijing, also served a stint as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2014the central bank branch that has technical legal oversight of Farmington. According to a different Protos investigation, this same component of the Federal Reserve system \u201ctook over regulatory duty for [Farmington/Moonstone] earlier this year, but seems to have glossed over Moonstone\u2019s for-profit foreign interests.\u201d", "time": 1670998457, "resto": 1123952}, {"no": 1123954, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:15:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Though it remained under BVI jurisdiction, annual reports from Farmington State Bank reveal that Chan\u2019s Farmington Finance Corporation maintained its offices in the Jardine House in Hong Kong.

That company is the successor to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co, one of the largest foreign trading companies in the Far East for much of the 19th century which was extensively involved in entrenching British political and economic influence in Hong Kong. It also played a key role in the opium trade. Notably, Archie Chan has claimed to be \u201ca member of one of the oldest and most prominent Hong Kong families,\u201d suggesting a potential familial link to the power networks of early colonial Hong Kong, where Jardine Matheson was particularly prominent. Later, Chan\u2019s Farmington Finance Corporation relocated to St. George\u2019s House, also in Hong Kong. <br><br>Further investigation into Chan reveals that he was, until relatively recently, the executive director of Glorious Sun Enterprises. Glorious Sun Enterprises is the main company of its parent organization, the Glorious Sun Group. The latter began as a textile concern in Hong Kong in the mid-1960s, later expanding into the fields of finance, real estate and other ventures during the 1980s.

However, over two decades before this, Chan had been acting as the group\u2019s primary \u201cbusiness consultant\u201d, a position that required him manage the various partnerships and subsidiaries that made up the fledgling empire\u2019s vast reach.", "time": 1670998521, "resto": 1123952}, {"no": 1123955, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:16:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Documents submitted by Glorious Sun to the SEC state that he would act as a director in various joint-ventures where Glorious Sun controlled 50% of more of company stock.

Important gold smuggling institutions in Macao included Seng Heng Bank. For many years, the controllers of Seng Heng were a small syndicate that included Ho Yin, a gold smuggler with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and Cheng Yu-tung, the founder of Hong Kong\u2019s New World Development Company.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies send legal and information requests to social media companies, telephone companies, GPS companies etc., every day during the course of investigations. It&#039;s my understanding that most larger companies have an entire legal department which handles law enforcement requests for information. Sometimes the request is cell phone records, internal communications data, location records, message history etc., It&#039;s the job of these departments to investigate the requests, process them, and coordinate with law enforcement agencies. The internal e-mail in question in this article essentially says that, historically, Twitter used to just assign employees at their company to process and investigate these requests free of charge but are now deciding to charge the FBI for the man hours that they are dedicating to processing their requests. Given that several Russian nationals were tried and convicted for money laundering, wire fraud, identity theft and hacking in connection to the 2020 election it&#039;s not surprising that the FBI sends requests to Twitter to investigate suspicious accounts.

Jan Brewer. <br><br>When the same group certified the 2020 election, Ducey silenced a call from then-President Donald Trump, who was at the time in a frenetic push to persuade Republican allies to go along with his attempts to overturn the election he lost.<br><br>\u201cThis is a responsibility I do not take lightly,\u201d Ducey said. \u201cIt\u2019s one that recognizes the votes cast by the citizens of our great state.\u201d", "filename": "1670375413634544", "ext": ".gif", "w": 540, "h": 304, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1670398248828695, "time": 1670398248, "md5": "edVnS7fZo3862li7/chQdg==", "fsize": 1935137, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fascists-defeated-as-arizona-certifies-2022", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 96, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 24}, {"no": 1121758, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)02:31:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Republicans have complained for weeks about Hobbs\u2019 role in certifying her own victory, though it is typical for election officials to maintain their position while running for higher office.

Previously, Musk had said of the @elonjet account, \u201cMy commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk,\u201d he tweeted on November 6.

Twitter then retroactively added a new policy that banned accounts &quot;dedicated to sharing someone&#039;s live location.&quot;<br><br>https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjk<wbr>5V2DHKKyx/elon-musk-had-his-most-ab<wbr>surd-disturbing-24-hours-at-twitter<wbr>-yet", "filename": "Untitled-design-2022-12-14T162409.770", "ext": ".png", "w": 870, "h": 320, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1671152533544515, "time": 1671152533, "md5": "bNCKYOQtnaK/4nw7+EV+dg==", "fsize": 17210, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "elon-musk-goes-on-twitter-banning-spree-against", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 108, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 47}, {"no": 1124479, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:02:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Musk then took to his personal account to launch a PR offensive.

The rest of the article goes on to say that there&#039;s a department at the FBI which assigned several agents to monitor social media platforms and flag users/post. Not only is this not new information but given that several Russians were tried and convicted for hacking DNC servers, wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft in relation to election interference, its also not surprising. Much like the Twitter files 1-5, there&#039;s zero new information here and, like before, zero evidence that the FBI blocked any information. I highly suspect that this new conservative misinformation campaign is rearing its head due to the fact that they got stomped in the middterms, gas prices are plummeting and inflation is leveling out so they need a new set of talking points to obsess with.

David Rivera arrested. Charges tied to $50 million he laundered", "com": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/lo<wbr>cal/article269634466.html<br><br>Former Republican Miami Congressman David Rivera was arrested Monday on federal criminal charges, including failing to register as a foreign agent for Venezuela, stemming from his $50 million consulting contract with the country\u2019s oil company that supposedly aimed to improve its tarnished image in the United States. Rivera, a once-influential player in South Florida politics, and his former Miami-Dade political consultant, Esther Nuhfer, have been charged by an indictment accusing them of conspiring to commit offenses against the United States, failing to register as foreign agents as part of their consulting work for Venezuela\u2019s oil subsidiary, PDV USA, and money laundering. Rivera had his first federal court appearance in Atlanta, where he had been living and was arrested Monday afternoon. But he is expected to be transferred to Miami this week to face charges that were returned on Nov. 16 by a federal grand jury in Miami, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in South Florida. The Miami Herald could not reach Rivera or his defense attorney, but the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Marshals Service said Rivera had bailed out of jail Monday afternoon after making an initial appearance in Atlanta federal court. His attorney, Jeffrey Feldman, declined to comment, telling the AP in a text message that he had \u201cnot seen the indictment.\u201d<br>The indictment accuses Rivera and Nuhfer of conspiring to \u201cunlawfully enrich themselves by engaging in political activities in the United States on behalf of the Government of Venezuela ... in an effort to influence United States foreign policy toward Venezuela.\u201d It further accuses them of trying \u201cto conceal these efforts by failing to register under [federal law] as agents of the Government of Venezuela and by creating the false appearance that they were providing consulting services to PDV USA.\u201c", "filename": "1670307679925441", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670323484947187, "time": 1670323484, "md5": "EEcpFhIeInxG4GS33nSJiA==", "fsize": 121118, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "republican-rep-david-rivera-arrested-charges-tied", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 18, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 1121293, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)05:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As Venezuela\u2019s economy was crashing in 2017, the country\u2019s state-owned oil company hired Rivera for a costly public relations campaign to prop up the Venezuelan firm in the United States and to prevent U.S. sanctions. In just a few months, Rivera\u2019s business, Interamerican Consulting, collected $20 million from Venezuela\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, PDV USA, but its $50 million contract with the former politician abruptly ended when he was accused of doing little work, according to a lawsuit in New York that was filed before the federal indictment in Miami. Court documents in both the civil and federal case revealed that Rivera diverted more than half of his PDV USA income \u2014 $13 million \u2014 to three subcontractors in Miami who supposedly provided \u201cinternational strategic consulting services\u201d for the Venezuelan firm.<br>One of Rivera\u2019s subcontractors who received millions from his Venezuelan deal was a Miami real estate developer, Hugo Perera, who was convicted in one of South Florida\u2019s biggest drug-trafficking cases, the Miami Herald and el Nuevo Herald have learned from court records and sources familiar with Perera\u2019s history. Perera is not named as a defendant in the indictment filed against Rivera and Nuhfer. Perera\u2019s main company, PG &amp; Associates, which develops residential projects in Miami, and his other firm, Krome Agronomics, which sells fertilizer products, received a total of $4.85 million from Rivera\u2019s consulting firm as part of his PDV USA contract, civil court records show. Nuhfer\u2019s Miami business, Communication Solutions, Inc., received a total of $4.5 million from Rivera\u2019s firm, according to civil court records.

Gorrin, who was indicted in a separate foreign corruption and money-laundering case in 2018, is also not mentioned by name in the new indictment. According to sources familiar with the case, both Perera and Gorrin helped Rivera land the public relations contract with the Venezuelan government and its national-oil company\u2019s subsidiary, PDV USA \u2014 though they ultimately failed to prevent U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and its oil interests. Between March 2017 and mid-April 2017, Rivera\u2019s business, Interamerican Consulting, received three installment payments totaling $15 million from PDV USA, according to the indictment. \u201cRivera divided these funds in approximately equal amounts with Esther Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1, and Individual 1,\u201d says the indictment filed by prosecutor Harry Schimkat. \u201cOver time, Rivera, Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1 and Individual 1 used their portions of these funds to pay for various personal and business expenses, such as the purchase of real estate, payment of expenses for luxury yachts, and, in Rivera\u2019s case, contributions to his campaign for state office [in 2018],\u201d according to the indictment.

The verdict came on the second day of deliberations following a trial in which the Trump Organization was accused of being complicit in a scheme by top executives to avoid paying personal income taxes on job perks such as rent-free apartments and luxury cars.
