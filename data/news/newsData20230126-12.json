widespread hope across Beltway media that the violence of that day would cool the Donald Trump-fueled Republican hostility towards democracy. Not only had the insurrection itself failed but so had all theother efforts Trump had made to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump and his allies had made over 200 overtures to state officials to throw out the results of the election, according to the final report of the House-appointed January 6 committee. Trump filed 62 lawsuits in an effort to have the results evacuated, only to see the effort totally fail. A strong majority of Americans are repulsed by Trump&#039;s attacks on democracy. Four out of five Americansbelieve Trump acted &quot;unethically or illegally&quot; in trying to steal the 2020 election and nearly 70% say January 6 was a crisis point for the U.S. Under the circumstances, it was reasonable to expect the GOP to back down from these unpopular anti-democratic activities.<br><br>However, the opposite happened in 2022. A new report from Democracy Docket chronicling the election litigation in 2022 shows the trend moving forward, with Republicans continuing to file large numbers of lawsuits geared toward making it harder for Americans to vote or for those votes to be counted. In 2022, there were 93 anti-voting lawsuits filed across the country \u2014 fairly steady from 2020, when there were 95 lawsuits aimed at making it harder to vote or attempting to throw out votes. And in one aspect, things are getting worse: In 2022, the flood of lawsuits spread throughout state and federal races, instead of being driven by Trump&#039;s single-minded obsession with suing his way to victory in the 2020 presidential race.", "filename": "trumpandbiden", "ext": ".gif", "w": 600, "h": 628, "tn_w": 238, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673561997530625, "time": 1673561997, "md5": "j83mxIpZeJ7tpnxNIMU/ug==", "fsize": 256282, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "conservatives-hate-democracy", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 36, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 1133296, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:20:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As elections lawyer and Democracy Docket founder Marc Elias pointed out in his blog post on the report,there was nothing inevitable about this surge of Republican lawsuits attempting to disenfranchise voters.

The Republican governor, Greg Gianforte, belongs &quot;to a church in Bozeman adhering to a literal interpretation of the Bible that rejects evolution and considers homosexuality a sin,&quot; which hosts a men&#039;s group that features readings about the alleged evils of anti-racism.<br><br>Montana is one state with a small population, but, Streep argues, it&#039;s an important data point. Montana, he writes, &quot;has long been one of the most politically independent states in the union,&quot; with a Republican party that tended to exhibit a more libertarian bent. But in recent years, &quot;the dominant voice is that of the far right.&quot;<br><br>This has also been on display in the U.S. Congress, where the slim Republican majority in the House has embraced a slate of demands from the far right, many of which are geared toward stopping investigations that might reveal any conspiracies that helped lead to the events of January 6. House Republicans gutted the Office of Congressional Ethics, which had the power to look into accusations that Republican members of Congress were involved in Trump&#039;s attempted coup. They&#039;ve also started a subcommittee called &quot;Weaponization of the Federal Government,&quot; which Republicans say is necessary to stop federal law enforcement overreach. Critics, however, point out that the main targets appear to be any federal officials who are investigating the January 6 attacks and other right wing efforts to intimidate elected officials or government employees.", "time": 1673562085, "resto": 1133295}, {"no": 1133298, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:22:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1133295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1133295</a><br>Last week, supporters of defeated far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro rioted in Brazil, for the apparent purpose of overthrowing the current leftist president in favor of the hard-right Bolsonaro.

Modi \u201cquite brazenly used India\u2019s law enforcement apparatus to jail political opponents, journalists, and activists on a regular basis,\u201d Marathe said. \u201cHis directive to Twitter to take down all links of the documentary (and Twitter\u2019s shocking compliance after Elon\u2019s commitment to free speech) also follows on the heels of the Modi government\u2019s announcement that it will soon implement a regulatory regime in which it will have the right to determine what is fake news and order Big Tech platforms to delete the content.\u201d", "time": 1674673234, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136772, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:00:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;M OUTRAGED!!1 HE OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE!!!11", "time": 1674673254, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136776, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:10:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m outraged he ought to apologize now!!!", "time": 1674673850, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136778, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:12:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "support rich foreign liars, god bless america", "time": 1674673966, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136827, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:56:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1136767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1136767</a><br>THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

After breaking into the building, the students destroyed much of what was inside, and looted tens of thousands of items \u2014 including works by authors who had been blacklisted in Nazi Germany. Following this, the leader of the students gave a speech before the institute, and the students sang Horst-Wessel-Lied.[69] It is presumed that Dora &quot;D\u00f6rchen&quot; Richter (the first known person to undergo complete male-to-female sex reassignment surgery) may have been killed in this or a subsequent attack on the institute.[70] Members of the Sturmabteilung (SA) appeared later in the day to continue looting the institute.[69]<br><br>Four days later, the institute&#039;s library and archives were publicly hauled out and burned in the streets of the Opernplatz by members of SA alongside the students. A bronze bust of Hirschfeld, taken from the institute, was placed on top of the bonfire.[16][68] One estimate says that between 12,000 to 20,000 books and journals, and even larger number of images and sex subjects, were destroyed.[68] Another estimate says that about 25,000 books were destroyed.[71]<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insti<wbr>tut_f%C3%BCr_Sexualwissenschaft", "time": 1674587974, "resto": 1136445}, {"no": 1136459, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)14:26:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Every time I hear about evil republicans &quot;banning&quot; books it reminds me of the sad tale of Geordi La Forge.<br>Back a couple years ago, Geordi, aka Levar Burton, star of Paramount&#039;s Star Trek, went on Paramount&#039;s Late Night with Stephen Colbert and urged people to read books which failed to win government contracts by a Paramount holding which he purported to be &quot;banned&quot;.<br>Interestingly enough, these books were not banned, but they, and the attached curriculums, were simply not approved for use by the state.<br>So, Paramount&#039;s advertising team went to work.", "time": 1674588386, "resto": 1136445}, {"no": 1136464, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)14:41:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1136457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1136457</a><br>Wow lots of ties to bad actors are involved in this one.<br>Activist Don Falls, Manatee High School, Corrupt Super Intendant Cynthia Saunders.<br>DeSantis should just send the police in there and have them all arrested.", "time": 1674589296, "resto": 1136445}, {"no": 1136470, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)15:24:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1136459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1136459</a><br>Well DeSantis is banning books now, Geordi would cry if his eyes worked.", "time": 1674591860, "resto": 1136445}, {"no": 1136476, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)15:59:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Kids don&#039;t read.

Around three dozen workers were split into three teams, one focusing on each subject. Three employees told TIME they were expected to read and label between 150 and 250 passages of text per nine-hour shift. Those snippets could range from around 100 words to well over 1,000.

Obviously things like a bunch of cleavage or tummy shirts are still frowned upon but there are such things as professional sleeveless tops. Thirdly, if you&#039;re going to institute a policy that wasn&#039;t in place before then there should probably be a good reason. There should be some evidence or argument why it was an issue that requires a new policy to address.

Such a modified handgun was used mass shooting in May of last year that killed two people and wounded seven outside the McDonald&#039;s at Chicago Avenue and State Street, Pritzker noted.", "filename": "1645535304190", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1366, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673486325503107, "time": 1673486325, "md5": "BbUqC55KV+o5KVMeFYt9KA==", "fsize": 251109, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gov-jb-pritzker-signs-illinois-assault-weapons", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 123, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 45}, {"no": 1133013, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:33:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Remember kids, gun ownership is not a human right.", "time": 1673487198, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133019, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:42:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1133012</span><br>Of course it won&#039;t, Republicans will keep trafficking weapons of war into Illinois across the border from Indianian and Wisconsin.", "time": 1673487743, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133032, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1133023</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s illegal</span><br>That doesn&#039;t stop Republicans from violating the law, like not enforcing Red Flag laws.", "time": 1673488768, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133046, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)21:30:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1133036</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We don&#039;t follow the laws </span><br>Thank you for admitting that Republicans are called gun traffickers and allow mass murders to happen.", "time": 1673490636, "resto": 1133004}, {"no": 1133049, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)21:31:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Another Democrat bill that will overturned in the supreme court.

Santos was later caught lying to the public on multiple occasions, in particular involving his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The Washington Post reported that Santos\u2019s main campaign committee received the maximal individual amount of USD 5,800 from Intrater as well as his wife. On top of that committees with connections to Santos received \u201dtens of thousands\u201d of Dollars. Intraters firm has also put \u201chundreds of thousands of Dollars\u201c into Santos former employer Harbor City, which was accused by regulators of running a Ponzi scheme.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Intrater manages the investment firm Sparrow Capital, formerly known as Columbus Nova, which was the American affiliate of the Russian Renova Group, where he also served on the board of directors. Renova Group is owned by Intrater&#039;s cousin, the Russian oligarch Victor Vekselberg. Columbus Nova&#039;s biggest asset at the time was a controlling stake in CIFC, a publicly-traded company that managed credit investments. Together with Israel&#039;s former prime minister Ehud Barak, Intrater was on the board of CIFC. CIFC was sold in 2016 for US$333 million to F.A.B. Partners, an investment vehicle of Qatar&#039;s royal family.

Sex, in the biological sense, is chromosomes, DNA. Gender is the expression of that sex in both primary and secondary characteristics. This is made evident by the fact that having a penis or a functioning vagina/uterus isn&#039;t what makes you a man or woman. If I scooped out an entire woman&#039;s reproductive system her biological sex is completely unchanged. Gender is the expression of a combination of innate biological and socially prescribed characteristics. If a person with gender dysphoria were suddenly zapped with a ray and their chromosomes switched to the opposite sex but they still looked exactly the same they would still experience dysphoria. Additionally, if I zapped you with a ray and changed your chromosomes to the opposite sex but you looked exactly the same you wouldn&#039;t suddenly &quot;feel&quot; like a woman because you don&#039;t have gender dysphoria - you identify as a man and, if I had to guess, it would probably be distressing to you that your body did not match your internal perception of what your gender is.

Wyoming\u2019s legislature is considering a resolution that calls for a phaseout of new electric vehicle sales by 2035. Introduced on Friday, Senate Joint Resolution 4 has support from members of the state\u2019s House of Representatives and Senate.<br><br>In the proposed resolution, a group of lawmakers led by Senator Jim Anderson says Wyoming\u2019s \u201cproud and valued\u201d oil and gas industry has created \u201ccountless\u201d jobs and contributed revenue to the state\u2019s coffers. They add that a lack of charging infrastructure within Wyoming would make the widespread use of EVs \u201cimpracticable\u201d and that the state would need to build \u201cmassive amounts of new power generation\u201d to \u201csustain the misadventure of electric vehicles.\u201d<br><br>SJ4 calls for residents and businesses to limit the sale and purchase of EVs voluntarily, with the goal of phasing them out entirely by 2035. If passed, the resolution would be entirely symbolic. In fact, it\u2019s more about sending a message to EV advocates than banning the vehicles altogether. To that point, the final section of SJ4 calls for Wyoming\u2019s Secretary of State to send President Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom copies of the resolution.<br><br>\u201cOne might even say tongue-in-cheek, but obviously it\u2019s a very serious issue that deserves some public discussion,\u201d Senator Boner, one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, told the Cowboy State Daily. \u201cI\u2019m interested in making sure that the solutions that some folks want to the so-called climate crisis are actually practical in real life.

The sort of content that platforms will need to remove includes child sexual abuse material, revenge pornography, selling illegal drugs or weapons, and terrorism.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tech platforms will also have a duty of care to keep children safe online. This will involve preventing children from accessing harmful content and ensuring that age limits on social media platforms \u2013 the minimum age is typically 13 \u2013 are enforced. Platforms will have to explain in their terms of service how they enforce these age limits and what technology they use to police them.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In relation to both of these duties, tech firms will have to carry out risk assessments detailing the threats their services might pose in terms of illegal content and keeping children safe. They will then have to explain how they will mitigate those threats \u2013 for example through human moderators or using artificial intelligence tools \u2013 in a process that will be overseen by Ofcom, the communications regulator.

It says your 21 or older.</span><br>There&#039;s a few reason this is a bad analogy. Firstly, a club, bar or strip club is a physical location that you have to leave your house to enter. The notion that a club would check your ID involves far less privacy implications than needing your ID verified in the comfort of your own home. The second reason this is a bad analogy is because the burden of who is responsible for managing age-appropriate materials inside of the home has always been the parent, not the state. At least in our lifetime I&#039;ve never understood that to be the case in bars or clubs. I think it sets a very dangerous precedent to make the state responsible for managing age-appropriate materials for people&#039;s children especially when conservatives are the ones who have been platforming this message for the last several decades. This is the same justification they use for removing sex education from schools. Seems like a slippery slope to control a problem that hasn&#039;t even really proven itself to be a giant issue. This law does absolutely nothing that a parental lock on an iPad can&#039;t do.", "time": 1673233727, "resto": 1130964}, {"no": 1133513, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)14:22:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1132073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1132073</a><br>See, there&#039;s a difference between giving your ID to a local shop or club and giving your ID to a third-party app online. With the former, while you did give up your identity to the people there and it might be logged in a computer if they have it, it&#039;s more likely kept private for that club or shop only. Thus, security is pretty much guaranteed. To top it off, it&#039;s easier to know when someone is using a fake ID since it&#039;s all being done in person. None of those factors really exist for the law in effect. Right now, we&#039;re seeing this integrated with LA Wallet, which is usually used for driver licenses. Not only do we barely know anything about this app, but it&#039;s owned by a private company and to my knowledge, it&#039;s likely a proprietary app. So, we don&#039;t know just how much info they could store on someone who signs up for it.<br>This could be catastrophic if someone were to decide to breach the app and leak its info, which could lead to either blackmail or even identity theft. The internet has a massive scope that spans the entire globe. Do you expect me to believe that nobody would want to break into this app to get everyone&#039;s IDs? It&#039;s insane. If we don&#039;t trust Facebook to keep our identities safe with their bullshit ID verification, why should we trust this? If they try to keep this up, push it into other states, or even attempt to have it apply to other parts of the internet like social media, it&#039;s more likely that we&#039;ll see hackers trying to use this as an opportunity to steal and even dox individuals for their online activity.

Pamelia J, 27, was diagnosed with gigantomastia in March 2022 after seeking medical help for her back, neck and shoulder pain.<br><br>The model was referred to a surgeon, who identified that she has a very uncommon condition characterised by excessive breast tissue growth. Pamelia hopes to raise awareness of the challenges that come with rapidly-growing boobs, like shopping for clothes and getting vile looks from men.<br><br>In just eight months, Pamelia&#039;s bust went from a J cup bra size to an M cup, growing 14cm in width.<br><br>She says it causes her massive physical and mental discomfort, and she often gets judged by strangers for her large boobs.<br><br>&quot;It is very uncomfortable - they are so heavy and I can be in a lot of pain,&quot; Pamelia told the Mirror. At first it was fun and interesting to see how much they were growing, but recently I&#039;ve grown to be uncomfortable, and I find myself wishing I had normal tits. I struggle to find clothing to suit my tits and I end up just wearing oversized T-shirts. There are very limited options for big-titted bints if you don&#039;t want to have your tits on show. I feel self-conscious when out in public. If I wear something that is tight on my chest, I notice women giving me looks.I feel like I&#039;m getting dirty looks for having big tits, so I tend to stay at home - Am I on crazy pills?!.&quot;<br><br>Pamelia, who is an OnlyFans content creator, also suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) so is undergoing testing to see if the two conditions could be related.<br>Gigantomastia can be caused by a range of factors including hormonal changes, medications, and autoimmune diseases, but Pamelia&#039;s cause is currently unknown.

That was the first permanent European colony to establish itself on the east coast, other than Spanish colonies in Florida. Before Jamestown, there were multiple other colonies that did not become permanent settlements, mainly because people eventually starved. <br><br>There are horrific stories of early colony life, even cases where entire communities vanished. That was before they had stable farmlands and could reasonably sustain themselves, and it takes weeks to send a ship from Europe with supplies.
