That&#039;s categorically false.

Secondly, Biden wasn&#039;t the one that wanted Shokin gone. The entirety of the EU wanted him gone. The U.S. government wanted him gone. The Ukranian people wanted him gone. He was a notoriously corrupt prosecutor. Its super confusing why you think that Biden, the VP, had some unilateral power to deny funding to Ukraine. That isn&#039;t true at all, whereas Trump took it upon himself to deny funding to Ukraine that congress had already approved without any coordination or support from the legislative branch.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies send legal and information requests to social media companies, telephone companies, GPS companies etc., every day during the course of investigations. It&#039;s my understanding that most larger companies have an entire legal department which handles law enforcement requests for information. Sometimes the request is cell phone records, internal communications data, location records, message history etc., It&#039;s the job of these departments to investigate the requests, process them, and coordinate with law enforcement agencies. The internal e-mail in question in this article essentially says that, historically, Twitter used to just assign employees at their company to process and investigate these requests free of charge but are now deciding to charge the FBI for the man hours that they are dedicating to processing their requests. Given that several Russian nationals were tried and convicted for money laundering, wire fraud, identity theft and hacking in connection to the 2020 election it&#039;s not surprising that the FBI sends requests to Twitter to investigate suspicious accounts. Nowhere in this article is any evidence that the FBI paid Twitter to boost Democratic candidates or to censor anybody. That&#039;s not even what the subject of this article is about, it&#039;s just the misleading title that both OP and the author of this dogshit article put up to bait conservatives.

Most of the people who believed that have either ignored that there was no evidence to support it, or have simply moved on to this new lie, suggesting that \u201cthe FBI\u201d was \u201csending lists\u201d to Twitter of people to censor.<br><br>The problem is that, once again, that\u2019s not what \u201cthe Twitter Files\u201d show, even as the reporters working on it \u2014 Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and Michael Shellenberger \u2014 either don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re looking at or are deliberately misrepresenting it.

But\u2026 there\u2019s literally no scandal here. <br><br>What the files show is that the FBI would occasionally (not very often, frankly) use reporting tools to alert Twitter to accounts that potentially violated Twitter\u2019s rules. When the FBI did so, it was pretty clear that it was just flagging these accounts for Twitter to review, and had no expectation that the company would or would not do anything about it.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies send legal and information requests to social media companies, telephone companies, GPS companies etc., every day during the course of investigations. It&#039;s my understanding that most larger companies have an entire legal department which handles law enforcement requests for information. Sometimes the request is cell phone records, internal communications data, location records, message history etc., It&#039;s the job of these departments to investigate the requests, process them, and coordinate with law enforcement agencies. The internal e-mail in question in this article essentially says that, historically, Twitter used to just assign employees at their company to process and investigate these requests free of charge but are now deciding to charge the FBI for the man hours that they are dedicating to processing their requests. Given that several Russian nationals were tried and convicted for money laundering, wire fraud, identity theft and hacking in connection to the 2020 election it&#039;s not surprising that the FBI sends requests to Twitter to investigate suspicious accounts. Nowhere in this article is any evidence that the FBI paid Twitter to boost Democratic candidates or to censor anybody. That&#039;s not even what the subject of this article is about, it&#039;s just the misleading title that both OP and the author of this dogshit article put up to bait conservatives.

There has been exactly one democratic head of the FBI in its entire history, and he was just the fill-in guy for about 3 months after 9/11 because the previous guy resigned and they needed a seatwarmer. Most of the rank and file are also conservative Republicans, and often can be see at Republican donor meetings and dinners, which (if you&#039;re curious) is why those are more often closed-camera and why Romney&#039;s leak that ultimately sank his 2012 bid was so shocking.<br><br>It&#039;s interesting to me that publicly Republican politicians are bashing the shit out of the FBI, but in private they&#039;re still eating with them and getting along fine. It&#039;s a show. Meanwhile the actual conservative base seems to be genuinely starting to loathe the FBI, which is a pretty historical turn. Really, this hasn&#039;t happened before since the FBI was founded, historically mainstream conservative white and blue collar voters were the backbone of FBI/CIA/law enforcement support. There have always been fringe far-right people who do not like the FBI, but you would never hear the FBI being corrupt and evil as a topic at a conservative or even moderate Thanksgiving dinner even a decade ago.<br>As a student of political science, I am interested to see what this will mean for the future of the FBI as an organization. Despite serving democrat interests at the moment, it hasn&#039;t really gotten more popular with liberals than it has been historically (low).

Homeless people violate that. They do nothing, contribute nothing, and occupy those spaces while violating social norms by engaging in crime and sleeping in common areas. If enough people do this, eventually something changes in the social ecosystem. For example, if enough homeless occupy my downtown area and do crime, businesses close and fewer people come, which causes a landslide effect. I am seeing this now in our city, the local news touches a bit on it but mostly pretends everything is OK.

These are all punitive actions, and they address a failure to conform to the societal expectations of being a taxpaying citizen.</span><br>I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;re engaging in good faith so I&#039;ll do the same. Here&#039;s a few basic sociological facts. Punishing people into not being homeless doesn&#039;t work. We have the largest, most punitive criminal justice system of any third world country and its done nothing to reduce drug use, address poverty or keep families together. If throwing people in prison solved homelessness then the massive expansion of incarceration in the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s would&#039;ve shown some progress but homelessness has only grown. <br><br>The next fact we know - literally every first world country with a substantial social safety net has exponentially less homeless people than we do. We know for a fact which programs work. For example, we know that providing housing post-release for inmates reduces recidivism. In LA county, for example, it reduced re-offending by something like 40%. We also know that things like GED programs in prisons massively increases the employment rate of post-release convicts. We know that well funded jobs programs reduces homelessness. We know that widely available drug rehabilitation massively decreases drug dependence which massively decreases homelessness. Family planning services, financial advising, after school programs, childcare etc., These are the building blocks of programs that meaningfully reduce homelessness. Every Nordic country on the planet has implemented these programs with wild success.<br><br>Sociologically speaking, the higher you raise the bottom of society the easier it is to lift people up. As someone who lives and works in a city with a big homeless population the idea that these people have all these opportunities to meaningfully improve but just like being homeless is false.", "time": 1671513091, "resto": 1125435}, {"no": 1125804, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)00:17:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1125800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1125800</a><br><a href=\"#p1125803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1125803</a><br>Every city, for example, that has instituted programs like sending social workers to address homelessness instead of cops has seen a drastic decrease in the amount of police resources required, an increase in drug rehabilitation rates and an increase in participation in mental health services. If you understand the sorts of issues that cause homelessness its a rather straight forward issue to address - broken homes, drug addiction, mental health issues, lack of affordable housing. Considering that we live in a country where most Americans can&#039;t afford a $500 emergency it really isn&#039;t a surprise that all it takes is one massively traumatic or expensive life event to send people to the streets where the cycle is inherently built to keep them from succeeding. All it takes is one drug charge, for example, and your job prospects are fucked. All it takes is one eviction or late rent payments to fuck your credit and make sure no property management company every rents to you again. Everyone likes to think that they&#039;re worlds apart from a random homeless person but the reality is that most of us are one or two catastrophic financial or psychiatric incidences away from being in their shoes. Anyways, I could go on but my idea to address homelessness is to stop the issues that causes it. Locking people up doesn&#039;t work. That&#039;s just a fact.

The article opens up with a bunch of tweets from GOP politicians claiming interference but providing no evidence. The rest of the article goes on to say that there&#039;s a department at the FBI which assigned several agents to monitor social media platforms and flag users/post. Not only is this not new information but given that several Russians were tried and convicted for hacking DNC servers, wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft in relation to election interference, its also not surprising. Much like the Twitter files 1-5, there&#039;s zero new information here and, like before, zero evidence that the FBI blocked any information. I highly suspect that this new conservative misinformation campaign is rearing its head due to the fact that they got stomped in the middterms, gas prices are plummeting and inflation is leveling out so they need a new set of talking points to obsess with.

David Rivera arrested. Charges tied to $50 million he laundered", "com": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/lo<wbr>cal/article269634466.html<br><br>Former Republican Miami Congressman David Rivera was arrested Monday on federal criminal charges, including failing to register as a foreign agent for Venezuela, stemming from his $50 million consulting contract with the country\u2019s oil company that supposedly aimed to improve its tarnished image in the United States. Rivera, a once-influential player in South Florida politics, and his former Miami-Dade political consultant, Esther Nuhfer, have been charged by an indictment accusing them of conspiring to commit offenses against the United States, failing to register as foreign agents as part of their consulting work for Venezuela\u2019s oil subsidiary, PDV USA, and money laundering. Rivera had his first federal court appearance in Atlanta, where he had been living and was arrested Monday afternoon. But he is expected to be transferred to Miami this week to face charges that were returned on Nov. 16 by a federal grand jury in Miami, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in South Florida. The Miami Herald could not reach Rivera or his defense attorney, but the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Marshals Service said Rivera had bailed out of jail Monday afternoon after making an initial appearance in Atlanta federal court. His attorney, Jeffrey Feldman, declined to comment, telling the AP in a text message that he had \u201cnot seen the indictment.\u201d<br>The indictment accuses Rivera and Nuhfer of conspiring to \u201cunlawfully enrich themselves by engaging in political activities in the United States on behalf of the Government of Venezuela ... in an effort to influence United States foreign policy toward Venezuela.\u201d It further accuses them of trying \u201cto conceal these efforts by failing to register under [federal law] as agents of the Government of Venezuela and by creating the false appearance that they were providing consulting services to PDV USA.\u201c", "filename": "1670307679925441", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670323484947187, "time": 1670323484, "md5": "EEcpFhIeInxG4GS33nSJiA==", "fsize": 121118, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "republican-rep-david-rivera-arrested-charges-tied", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 18, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 1121293, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)05:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As Venezuela\u2019s economy was crashing in 2017, the country\u2019s state-owned oil company hired Rivera for a costly public relations campaign to prop up the Venezuelan firm in the United States and to prevent U.S. sanctions. In just a few months, Rivera\u2019s business, Interamerican Consulting, collected $20 million from Venezuela\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, PDV USA, but its $50 million contract with the former politician abruptly ended when he was accused of doing little work, according to a lawsuit in New York that was filed before the federal indictment in Miami. Court documents in both the civil and federal case revealed that Rivera diverted more than half of his PDV USA income \u2014 $13 million \u2014 to three subcontractors in Miami who supposedly provided \u201cinternational strategic consulting services\u201d for the Venezuelan firm.<br>One of Rivera\u2019s subcontractors who received millions from his Venezuelan deal was a Miami real estate developer, Hugo Perera, who was convicted in one of South Florida\u2019s biggest drug-trafficking cases, the Miami Herald and el Nuevo Herald have learned from court records and sources familiar with Perera\u2019s history. Perera is not named as a defendant in the indictment filed against Rivera and Nuhfer. Perera\u2019s main company, PG &amp; Associates, which develops residential projects in Miami, and his other firm, Krome Agronomics, which sells fertilizer products, received a total of $4.85 million from Rivera\u2019s consulting firm as part of his PDV USA contract, civil court records show. Nuhfer\u2019s Miami business, Communication Solutions, Inc., received a total of $4.5 million from Rivera\u2019s firm, according to civil court records.

Gorrin, who was indicted in a separate foreign corruption and money-laundering case in 2018, is also not mentioned by name in the new indictment. According to sources familiar with the case, both Perera and Gorrin helped Rivera land the public relations contract with the Venezuelan government and its national-oil company\u2019s subsidiary, PDV USA \u2014 though they ultimately failed to prevent U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and its oil interests. Between March 2017 and mid-April 2017, Rivera\u2019s business, Interamerican Consulting, received three installment payments totaling $15 million from PDV USA, according to the indictment. \u201cRivera divided these funds in approximately equal amounts with Esther Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1, and Individual 1,\u201d says the indictment filed by prosecutor Harry Schimkat. \u201cOver time, Rivera, Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1 and Individual 1 used their portions of these funds to pay for various personal and business expenses, such as the purchase of real estate, payment of expenses for luxury yachts, and, in Rivera\u2019s case, contributions to his campaign for state office [in 2018],\u201d according to the indictment.

The verdict came on the second day of deliberations following a trial in which the Trump Organization was accused of being complicit in a scheme by top executives to avoid paying personal income taxes on job perks such as rent-free apartments and luxury cars.

The Great Depression had also crushed the first iteration of Farmington State Bank, originally founded in 1887, and a new bank of the same name was created in May 1929. Much of Farmington State Bank\u2019s history is hardly noteworthy. Joining the bank in 1973 was C. Wayne Wexler, who served as the bank\u2019s president for over a decade. Throughout the 1970s, the bank held around $1.5 million in deposits, which grew modestly during the 1980s to around $3.5 million. <br><br>Around 1995, Farmington, for reasons still unknown, attracted the attention of a British citizen residing in Hong Kong named Archie Chan. According to a 2010 interview given by Farmington\u2019s then-president, John Widman, Chan bought the bank in 1995 \u201cwhen he was looking for a chartered Washington bank that might become a platform for international banking.\u201d Though this never came to pass, Chan\u2019s connections suggest that his interests in the small, rural bank may have been manifold.<br><br>Chan acquired Farmington through a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) called Farmington Finance Corporation. The lawyer who aided him in setting up the corporate structure for the new Farmington organization was David K.Y. Tang, who \u2013 among other things \u2013 is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Tang, whose careers in law and business spans Seattle, Hong Kong and Beijing, also served a stint as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2014the central bank branch that has technical legal oversight of Farmington. According to a different Protos investigation, this same component of the Federal Reserve system \u201ctook over regulatory duty for [Farmington/Moonstone] earlier this year, but seems to have glossed over Moonstone\u2019s for-profit foreign interests.\u201d", "time": 1670998457, "resto": 1123952}, {"no": 1123954, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:15:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Though it remained under BVI jurisdiction, annual reports from Farmington State Bank reveal that Chan\u2019s Farmington Finance Corporation maintained its offices in the Jardine House in Hong Kong. That property is owned by the interests of Jardine Matheson Holdings. That company is the successor to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co, one of the largest foreign trading companies in the Far East for much of the 19th century which was extensively involved in entrenching British political and economic influence in Hong Kong. It also played a key role in the opium trade. Notably, Archie Chan has claimed to be \u201ca member of one of the oldest and most prominent Hong Kong families,\u201d suggesting a potential familial link to the power networks of early colonial Hong Kong, where Jardine Matheson was particularly prominent. Later, Chan\u2019s Farmington Finance Corporation relocated to St. George\u2019s House, also in Hong Kong. <br><br>Further investigation into Chan reveals that he was, until relatively recently, the executive director of Glorious Sun Enterprises. Glorious Sun Enterprises is the main company of its parent organization, the Glorious Sun Group. The latter began as a textile concern in Hong Kong in the mid-1960s, later expanding into the fields of finance, real estate and other ventures during the 1980s.

Texas, an important immigration case, the Supreme Court got sidetracked over a question that has major implications for the executive branch and its ability to function: Can a plaintiff walk into court, challenge a federal regulation, and win a victory that halts the entire government\u2019s ability to enforce that regulation anywhere, against anyone\u2014even parties that played no role in the litigation?<br><br>The answer to this question is important, because this tactic has rapidly become an obstacle to governance.<br><br>Under President Barack Obama, conservative judges began using a specific power to \u201cset aside\u201d policies, granted to them by a provision of a 1946 law, to halt executive policies nationwide, claiming that Congress intended to award them this sweeping power. Left-leaning judges used the tool to limit President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to rewrite federal statutes, particularly asylum law, and prompted a huge backlash among Republicans. Today, with President Joe Biden in office, conservative judges have transformed the power to \u201cset aside\u201d policies into an unprecedented weapon of obstruction, voiding agency rules and executive policies so frequently that they have turned the federal judiciary into a kind of shadow president with a permanent veto over the actual, elected president.<br><br>It is not actually clear, though, that judges even have the legal authority to wipe federal policy off the books. A strictly textualist interpretation of federal law strongly suggests that they do not. To the contrary, the fact that federal courts have unlawfully expanded their power to interfere with duties of the executive branch seems like a direct attack on the separation of powers.<br><br>https://slate.com/news-and-politics<wbr>/2022/12/supreme-court-biden-immigr<wbr>ation-masks-debt-relief-elizabeth-p<wbr>relogar.html", "filename": "1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1440, "h": 960, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1670142923371596, "time": 1670142923, "md5": "4GrlNjZu57xM0GwjhkkFqQ==", "fsize": 158861, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "elizabeth-prelogar-dared-to-challenge-the", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 16, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 1120573, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)08:51:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Democrats are uneducated.

Firstly, you haven&#039;t provided any solutions. &quot;Build a wall and genocide blacks with poisoned drugs&quot; is not a solution its just a /pol/ meme you&#039;ve been trained to parrot because you&#039;re retarded and mentally ill. Secondly, AFRICAN AMERICANS, not just people with black skin, are the number one least socioeconomically privileged group in the country. Of course Nigerians are well educated, they come from families who are rich enough to send their children to a different country to study. Thirdly, there are no black Americans who can&#039;t read that are getting into elite colleges. This is another one of your schizo delusions. Fourthly, the issue isn&#039;t simply school funding. The issue is macro socioeconomic picture. Dumping funding into a school doesn&#039;t make things better because education outcomes depend on everything from class sizes to home supports i.e. after school tutoring, having a parent in the house to assist with homework. You can&#039;t dump money into a school full of kids who have shit home lives and rotten communities and think they&#039;re going to do better. It doesn&#039;t work that way. Lastly, welfare fixes nothing. I&#039;ve never defended eternal welfare. Every study we&#039;ve ever done shows that eliminating the conditions that cause people to need welfare fixes communities, not just giving people enough money to not starve and die. It seems like you&#039;re arguing that black people are just genetically worse people but all data shows that the programs I listed before drastically improve outcomes.
