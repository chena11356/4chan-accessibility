This is why after the civil war the entirety of America spent decades burning down black businesses, killing black politicians and excluding blacks from wealth building opportunities with the explicit approval of the U.S. government.

You&#039;re correct, we don&#039;t let children make informed decisions. That&#039;s why these decisions are made collectively between parents, children and medical professionals.

In the end there will always be these kinds of stories. There is no medical treatment on the planet that doesn&#039;t produce some percentage of tragedy cases of medicine and psychiatry gone wrong.

Natural rights require non-interference to function, civil rights require the labor of others to function.</span><br>That is not how natural and civil rights are defined. Natural, or human, rights are rights that all persons are considered to have regardless of whether any state legally recognizes it or not, so it&#039;s more of a philosphical concept than a legal one. Civil, or legal, rights are rights that are legally recognized by a state as being possessed by all of its citizens and so are a strictly legal construct. In this sense, it&#039;s possible for a right to be both a civil and natural right. If someone is unfairly denied freedom of speech, thought, or expression, you can say that they&#039;ve lost their natural right to free speech as well as their civil right which is supposed to be legally protected by the first amendment. In the case of abortion law in the US, Dobbs is philosophically inconsistent with how the natural rights of bodily integrity and privacy have traditionally been protected by the federal government because it permits state governments to grant a right to another party which no legal person has at the expense of another paty&#039;s rights. Of course, this is not normally a problem from a strictly legal perspective since natural rights are not legal rights, but natural rights that are either implicitly or explicitly legally recognized are also civil rights. Both the right to bodily integrity and privacy can be inferred from the constitution through the fourth and ninth amendments and this is additionally supported by the equal protection clauses of the fifth and 14th amendments which prohibit state governments from stripping rights away without due process. Also, the equal protection clause of the 14th emphasizes consistency in how the law is applied to individuals in similar circumstances, which can also part of civil law that conflicts with Dobbs.", "time": 1675997477, "resto": 1140755}, {"no": 1140989, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1140987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1140987</a><br>through that adjudication, they can create laws<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-18<wbr>50/5us137</span><br>a classic example, through their ruling on whether or not commissions delivered late would be valid, the court gave itself the power to decide the constitutionality of laws", "time": 1675997671, "resto": 1140755}, {"no": 1140990, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:58:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1140989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1140989</a><br>they didn&#039;t give themselves any power. the writers of the constitution were still alive at that point and in office, why would they let Marshall make shit up?

What you&#039;re essentially talking about is a military operation that would span the entire U.S. and amount to kicking down people&#039;s doors, dragging them out of their homes and processing tens of millions of people for deportation. This includes the civil rights of American citizens as well. What if they&#039;re hiding an illegal in their home? What if illegals start feeling and hiding? Do we investigate and process warrants for millions of people across hundreds of millions of square miles of the country? Do we start raiding camps in the woods and mountains to round them up? How long will this take? How much money? Could it even pass as legislation? I know /pol/ likes to circlejerk about this meme all of the time but in the reality we currently occupy its just not possible. Secondly, it would be a disastrous hit to the economy. Whether you like it or not, immigrants and illegals alike have become irrevocably embedded in our markets. Agriculture depends on them. Hospitality and construction depends on them.

But academics who study the topic say many consumers are now feeling irritated by automatic tip requests at coffee shops and other counter service eateries where tipping has not typically been expected, workers make at least the minimum wage and service is usually limited.<br><br>\u201cPeople do not like unsolicited advice,\u201d said Ismail Karabas, a marketing professor at Murray State University who studies tipping. \u201cThey don\u2019t like to be asked for things, especially at the wrong time.\u201d<br><br>Some of the requests can also come from odd places. Clarissa Moore, a 35-year-old who works as a supervisor at a utility company in Pennsylvania, said even her mortgage company has been asking for tips lately. Typically, she\u2019s happy to leave a gratuity at restaurants, and sometimes at coffee shops and other fast-food places when the service is good.

Michael Lynn, a consumer behavior professor at Cornell University, said consumers were more generous with tips during the early days of the pandemic in an effort to show support for restaurants and other businesses that were hard hit by COVID-19. Many people genuinely wanted to help out and felt sympathetic to workers who held jobs that put them more at risk of catching the virus, Lynn said.<br><br>Tips at full-service restaurants grew by 25.3% in the third quarter of 2022, while gratuities at quick or counter service restaurants went up 16.7% compared to the same time in 2021, according to Square, one of the biggest companies operating digital payment methods.

People have made the chatbot say everything from curse words, to slurs, to conspiracy theories using this technique. <br><br>Users first send ChatGPT a message that begins with, \u201cHello ChatGPT.

Modi \u201cquite brazenly used India\u2019s law enforcement apparatus to jail political opponents, journalists, and activists on a regular basis,\u201d Marathe said. \u201cHis directive to Twitter to take down all links of the documentary (and Twitter\u2019s shocking compliance after Elon\u2019s commitment to free speech) also follows on the heels of the Modi government\u2019s announcement that it will soon implement a regulatory regime in which it will have the right to determine what is fake news and order Big Tech platforms to delete the content.\u201d", "time": 1674673234, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136772, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:00:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;M OUTRAGED!!1 HE OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE!!!11", "time": 1674673254, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136776, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:10:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m outraged he ought to apologize now!!!", "time": 1674673850, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136778, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:12:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "support rich foreign liars, god bless america", "time": 1674673966, "resto": 1136767}, {"no": 1136827, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:56:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1136767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1136767</a><br>THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

I&#039;m totally open to the possibility that marijuana laws contributes to homicide rates. The issue I&#039;m facing is that there&#039;s no study that shows this. He&#039;s claiming that relaxed weed laws CAUSES more murders. In order to substantiate a causal link between a law and an increase in murders you would have to done a comprehensive study on it. There&#039;s perhaps hundreds of reasons that murder rates go up and down.

Those refineries include ExxonMobil Baytown, Pemex Deer Park, Valero Houston, Chevron Pasadena, LyondellBasell-Houston and Kinder Morgan Galena Park. The pollution is discharged into the Houston ship channel which flows into Galveston Bay and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>Despite the danger this pollution poses, very little regulation exists and seldom is enforced. &quot;A lot of the water pollution from refineries is essentially unregulated by the EPA,&quot; said Tom Pelton, co-director of the Environmental Integrity Project&#039;s Center for Investigations. &quot;The EPA has never set any limits for discharges of pollutants like selenium, cyanide, benzene, mercury and many others that are very harmful.&quot;", "time": 1675180223, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "6-texas-refineries-dump-millions-of-gallons-of", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 1138676, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)10:50:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1138675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1138675</a><br><br>When it comes to the regulations that the EPA has set, companies that exceed these limits rarely face financial penalties. Of the 81 refineries included in the report, 67 reported enough pollution from 2019-2021 to exceed their pollution control permits. Of those 67, only 15 were actually penalized for water pollution violations during that time frame.<br><br>When they are penalized, Pelton said the penalties are little more than a &quot;slap on the wrist.&quot; The Phillips 66 refinery in Sweeny, Texas, about an hour south of Houston, reportedly exceeded its pollution limits 44 times between 2019 and 2021. Most of those violations involved dumping cyanide into the Brazos River. Still, the company was only fined $30,000.<br>Pelton said he believes a step forward would be for the EPA to update its technology standards for wastewater systems. Despite the Clean Water Act, which calls for these regulations to be updated every five years, the EPA has not updated them since 1985. &quot;We have a lot better wastewater treatment technologies since the Reagan administration, and we think it&#039;s time for the EPA to require these better systems in our refineries,&quot; said Pelton.<br><br>As important as the oil and gas industry is to Houston&#039;s local economy, Dunham said she believes companies can still function at a high level while doing their fair share to protect waterways by updating their technologies and adhering to regulations. &quot;Some of these companies are making record-breaking profits,&quot; she said. &quot;And if they&#039;re going to be existing in our communities, I think it&#039;s their responsibility to make sure that they&#039;re cleaning [their pollution] up.&quot;", "time": 1675180257, "resto": 1138675}, {"no": 1138678, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)11:01:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And they&#039;ve been doing this for decades.
