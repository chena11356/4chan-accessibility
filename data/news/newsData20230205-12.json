Buddy Carter of Georgia on Jan. 9, has so far attracted 23 Republican co-sponsors, including Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz and Kat Cammack of Florida.<br><br>The legislation calls for the elimination of &quot;current income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes,&quot; which would be replaced by a national sales tax. It also calls for the elimination of the Internal Revenue Service.<br><br>Even if the bill passes the House, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate, which is controlled by a Democratic majority.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An analysis of the Republican proposal by the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that the FairTax Act &quot;would impose a 30 percent federal sales tax on everything we buy \u2013 groceries, cars, homes, health care, school tuition \u2013 and lead to a giant tax shift from the well-off to everyone else.&quot;</span><br><br>https://americanindependent.com/joe<wbr>-biden-speech-house-republicans-fai<wbr>rtax-act-2023-irs-national-sales-ta<wbr>xes/", "filename": "1653798402464", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1448, "h": 1448, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674252464637426, "time": 1674252464, "md5": "tqJWHLRqzzSKyXs3AbDxaQ==", "fsize": 298696, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "biden-assails-the-republicans-30-sales-tax-hike", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 306, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 51}, {"no": 1135370, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)17:08:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The institute&#039;s federal policy director, Steve Wamhoff, wrote that, if enacted, the bill would also eliminate current tax credits for middle-income earners, such as the Child Tax Credit and credits for insurance premiums charged under the Affordable Care Act.<br><br>A 2004 study conducted by the institute of a similar national sales tax proposal found that &quot;replacing most federal taxes with a national sales tax would mean very large<br><br>tax increases on most Americans and very large tax cuts for the wealthy.&quot;<br><br>House Republican leadership has not yet indicated a timetable for passage of the FairTax Act.

I&#039;m totally open to the possibility that marijuana laws contributes to homicide rates. The issue I&#039;m facing is that there&#039;s no study that shows this. He&#039;s claiming that relaxed weed laws CAUSES more murders. In order to substantiate a causal link between a law and an increase in murders you would have to done a comprehensive study on it. There&#039;s perhaps hundreds of reasons that murder rates go up and down.

Their opportunities and jobs have eroded the most quickly and completely in America. As such, their communities have quietly become some of the most despondent, drug-ridden towns in the country.

They are covered by the FLSA and must be paid a total of at least $7.25 an hour. But the FLSA allows restaurants to take customer tips into consideration when it sets cash wages for these employees.

Those refineries include ExxonMobil Baytown, Pemex Deer Park, Valero Houston, Chevron Pasadena, LyondellBasell-Houston and Kinder Morgan Galena Park. The pollution is discharged into the Houston ship channel which flows into Galveston Bay and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>Despite the danger this pollution poses, very little regulation exists and seldom is enforced. &quot;A lot of the water pollution from refineries is essentially unregulated by the EPA,&quot; said Tom Pelton, co-director of the Environmental Integrity Project&#039;s Center for Investigations. &quot;The EPA has never set any limits for discharges of pollutants like selenium, cyanide, benzene, mercury and many others that are very harmful.&quot;", "time": 1675180223, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "6-texas-refineries-dump-millions-of-gallons-of", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 1138676, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)10:50:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1138675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1138675</a><br><br>When it comes to the regulations that the EPA has set, companies that exceed these limits rarely face financial penalties.

Of those 67, only 15 were actually penalized for water pollution violations during that time frame.<br><br>When they are penalized, Pelton said the penalties are little more than a &quot;slap on the wrist.&quot; The Phillips 66 refinery in Sweeny, Texas, about an hour south of Houston, reportedly exceeded its pollution limits 44 times between 2019 and 2021.

To assess support for libertarian ideology, the researchers asked the participants the extent to which they agreed with statements such as \u201cPeople who are successful in business have a right to enjoy their wealth as they see fit\u201d and \u201cPeople should be free to decide what group norms or traditions they themselves want to follow.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIn sum, libertarians supported men\u2019s autonomy and tended to oppose women\u2019s, particularly when it conflicted with men\u2019s, and there was evidence that this may have been because they tended to have hostile attitudes towards women,\u201d Chalmers said.<br><br>But the study, like all research, includes some limitations.

While more left-wing versions of libertarianism do still exist to some extent in the United States, it has been argued that the American libertarian movement formed a kind of alliance with paleoconservatism (a populist, isolationist alternative to the more cosmopolitan neoconservatism; Ashbee, 2000).\u201d<br><br>\u201cThis alliance allowed American libertarians to mend the contradiction between economic freedom and property rights (which can impinge upon freedom for those who are not property owners) by letting them pair freedom from the state with a lack of freedom in the private sphere (Cooper, 2021).", "time": 1674250867, "resto": 1135341}, {"no": 1135347, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)16:42:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This American brand of libertarianism may thus be uniquely suited to reinforcing existing hierarchies, as long as they don\u2019t involve the state \u2013 e.g., a hierarchical relationship between husband and wife.\u201d<br><br>Chalmers noted there are still some other questions that need to be addressed.<br><br>\u201cAbortion is far from the only issue where the interests of women and the concept of individual freedom may be perceived as conflicting, so questions about how libertarians approach other issues related to pregnancy, childbirth and even child-rearing still need to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cSusan Okin argued in her book \u2018Justice, Gender and the Family\u2019 (1989) that libertarian principles have been developed based on the needs and experiences of men, and the reality of motherhood brings to light an issue largely ignored by libertarian theorists whereby \u2018the potential lives of some are radically dependent upon [] the bodies of others\u2019 (p. 75).\u201d<br><br>\u201cIn fact, following the reversal of Roe v. Wade, challenges to women\u2019s bodily autonomy appear to have become more common,\u201d Chalmers told PsyPost. \u201cIn one particularly egregious circumstance, a woman in Alabama was jailed for allegedly using drugs during pregnancy despite not actually being pregnant (Yurkanin, 2022).

Not only had the insurrection itself failed but so had all theother efforts Trump had made to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump and his allies had made over 200 overtures to state officials to throw out the results of the election, according to the final report of the House-appointed January 6 committee. Trump filed 62 lawsuits in an effort to have the results evacuated, only to see the effort totally fail. A strong majority of Americans are repulsed by Trump&#039;s attacks on democracy. Four out of five Americansbelieve Trump acted &quot;unethically or illegally&quot; in trying to steal the 2020 election and nearly 70% say January 6 was a crisis point for the U.S. Under the circumstances, it was reasonable to expect the GOP to back down from these unpopular anti-democratic activities.<br><br>However, the opposite happened in 2022. A new report from Democracy Docket chronicling the election litigation in 2022 shows the trend moving forward, with Republicans continuing to file large numbers of lawsuits geared toward making it harder for Americans to vote or for those votes to be counted. In 2022, there were 93 anti-voting lawsuits filed across the country \u2014 fairly steady from 2020, when there were 95 lawsuits aimed at making it harder to vote or attempting to throw out votes.

They&#039;ve also started a subcommittee called &quot;Weaponization of the Federal Government,&quot; which Republicans say is necessary to stop federal law enforcement overreach.

Around three dozen workers were split into three teams, one focusing on each subject. Three employees told TIME they were expected to read and label between 150 and 250 passages of text per nine-hour shift. Those snippets could range from around 100 words to well over 1,000. All of the four employees interviewed by TIME described being mentally scarred by the work. Two said they were only given the option to attend group sessions, and one said their requests to see counselors on a one-to-one basis instead were repeatedly denied by Sama management.<br>In the day-to-day work of data labeling in Kenya, sometimes edge cases would pop up that showed the difficulty of teaching a machine to understand nuance. One day in early March last year, a Sama employee was at work reading an explicit story about Batman\u2019s sidekick, Robin, being raped in a villain\u2019s lair. (An online search for the text reveals that it originated from an online erotica site, where it is accompanied by explicit sexual imagery.)
