The group published detailed instructions on a Substack blog on how to falsely report people along with a list of accounts which included Loder&#039;s profile at the top. <br><br>Loder shared screenshots with Insider of messages on Telegram channels — with thousands of followers including Proud Boys and QAnon believers — celebrating Loder&#039;s suspension from the platform. <br><br>Senior members of Twitter&#039;s trust and safety team were aware of the list and the false reporting campaign against Loder — which is a violation of Twitter&#039;s policies against platform manipulation — and had plans to address it.

Chaudry admitted that he committed the crime knowing that information may be used in furtherance of and with the intent to commit stalking. <br><br>The plea agreement was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III; and Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Sobocinski of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office.<br><br>According to the plea agreement, from June 2009 to June 18, 2021, Chaudry worked as an Assistant State’s Attorney in the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office (“BSAO”). From September 2015 until he left the BSAO Chaudry worked in the BSAO’s Homicide Division. Chaudry maintained a romantic relationship with Victim #1 from May 2005 through January 2018; and with Victim #2 from August 2017 through September 2020. Victims #3, #4, and #5 were long-time friends of Victim #1. At no point were any of the victims a witness or target of any criminal investigation or prosecution by the BSAO. <br><br>As detailed in the guilty plea, between January 3, 2019, and February 22, 2019, Chaudry caused three grand jury subpoenas to be sent to a telecommunications company in Florida requesting all subscriber information, billing information, and toll records, including incoming and outgoing calls, from October 28, 2018 through February 22, 2019, for Victim #1’s phone number.",1670626196,0,,former-baltimore-city-assistant-states-attorney,1,3,0,"[{'no': 1122839, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)17:50:51', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Chaudry caused the subpoenas to appear to be related to a “special investigation in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City”; to contain no identifying case number; and to further state, “The information sought in this subpoena is relevant and material to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry.” The subpoenas directed that the records be produced “as soon as possible” directly to Chaudry at his BSAO address and stated, “Any and all questions should be directed to him.” The grand jury subpoenas contained Chaudry’s signature, the name of the Grand Jury Foreperson, and the signature of the Clerk of Baltimore City Circuit Court. Other subpoenas contained similar fraudulent information. <br><br>In a similar manner, Chaudry caused grand jury and trial subpoenas to be issued to a telecommunications company in New Jersey for the telephone records of Victim #2 between February 22, 2019 and April 12, 2021; caused multiple grand jury and trial subpoenas to be issued for the telephone records of Victim #3 between March 12, 2019 and April 21, 2020; caused multiple grand jury and trial subpoenas to be issued for the telephone records of Victim #4 between March 22, 2019 and February 8, 2021; and caused multiple grand jury and trial subpoenas to be issued for the telephone records of Victim #5 between January 21, 2019 and February 18, 2020. <br><br>In addition, on March 26, 2019, an investigator at BSAO provided Chaudry information that Chaudry had previously requested including Victim #1’s home address, MVA information, and her driver’s license photograph. Chaudry then used the information, including Victim #1’s driver’s license photograph to contact a hotel to request information about Victims #1 and #4’s stays at the hotel using his BSAO email address.

Just level with me and tell me whether you are dating him. Yes or No.” After this email exchange, Chaudry issued a total of 23 Circuit Court subpoenas for the telephone records of Victim #1, #2, #3, and #4. <br><br>Between January 3, 2019 and April 12, 2021, Chaudry caused 33 grand jury and trial subpoenas to be issued for the telephone records of Victim #1.

All these nations preparing for ‘World War Trans’ are running out of diesel fuel.”<br><br>While Carlson’s fear-stoking declaration that the U.S. was 25 days from economic collapse and Mad Max-like dystopia proved wildly incorrect, it did not stop Moscow’s propaganda machine from repeatedly blasting it out.<br><br>Confider found via the Internet Archive’s TV records that Carlson’s monologue, in which he also suggested Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-NY) wanted to destroy Russia over its traditional Christian values, was featured at least eight times across three different state networks over multiple days. <br><br>Among those boosting Carlson’s comments was Russia-1 TV host Vladimir Solovyov, who recently pushed for air strikes against several countries after “Russian-made” bombs killed two in Poland.<br><br>Russian TV has long had a love affair with Carlson, especially in the run-up to Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, though, the state’s propagandists have at times warned that Carlson’s pro-Putin bias may be too blatant.<br><br>https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-k<wbr>remlin-loved-tucker-carlsons-diesel<wbr>-doomsday-bs",1669711954,0,,the-kremlin-loved-tucker-carlsons-diesel-doomsday,1,136,0,"[{'no': 1121785, 'now': '12/07/22(Wed)07:02:45', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1119119"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1119119</a><br>Holy shit who the fuck cares.<br>Fucking /news/ is always full of the most irrelevant boring political tripe that has zero effect on anyone.<br><br>Go to catalog and see if you can find a thread even more meaningless than &quot;faux news opinions guy is a probably russian nazi traitor&quot;', 'time': 1670414565, 'resto': 1119119}, {'no': 1121796, 'now': '12/07/22(Wed)08:02:51', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1121785"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1121785</a><br>see <a href=""#p1119236"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1119236</a>', 'time': 1670418171, 'resto': 1119119}, {'no': 1121857, 'now': '12/07/22(Wed)10:53:21', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1119128"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1119128</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;russia iz winning</span><br>Running away is the opposite of winning anon.

Corriea remains convicted of multiple counts of fraud, extortion conspiracy and extortion. He reported to prison in April to begin serving his six-year prison sentence.<br><br>Lawyers for Correia declined to comment on Tuesday. In their appeal, they accused prosecutors of carrying out an “unfair smear campaign in the courtroom” and called the evidence against their client “remarkably shallow.” The former mayor maintains he is innocent.<br><br>Correia’s trial shone a light on his meteoric rise to become mayor as a recent college graduate. Correia portrayed himself to voters as a successful entrepreneur who could breathe new life into the town.<br>Prosecutors told jurors that in reality Corriea funded his lavish lifestyle with money he stole from investors who pumped cash into his startup, “SnoOwl,” an app designed to help businesses connect with consumers.",1669828134,0,,froddemocrats,1,11,0,"[{'no': 1120506, 'now': '12/03/22(Sat)23:30:59', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Fraud bump', 'time': 1670128259, 'resto': 1119510}, {'no': 1122284, 'now': '12/08/22(Thu)13:42:03', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1119510"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1119510</a><br>Why are democrats so corrupt', 'time': 1670524923, 'resto': 1119510}, {'no': 1122356, 'now': '12/08/22(Thu)16:07:29', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1122284"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1122284</a><br>Their party was founded by mobsters and white supremacists.<br>And while their white supremacy has shifted towards anti white racism, the mobsters are still very much in control', 'time': 1670533649, 'resto': 1119510}, {'no': 1122358, 'now': '12/08/22(Thu)16:13:44', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1122284"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1122284</a><br>Democrats are nowhere near as corrupt as Republicans.<br><a href=""#p1122356"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1122356</a><br>Nice revisionist history you have there.', 'time': 1670534024, 'resto': 1119510}, {'no': 1122451, 'now': '12/08/22(Thu)20:05:47', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1122284"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1122284</a><br>They&#039;ve often been proven to rig their parties primary elections.

46,1120545,,,12/04/22(Sun)03:35:23,Anonymous,Elizabeth Prelogar dared to challenge the conservative courts overreach infuriating Republicans,"During oral arguments on Tuesday in United States v. Texas, an important immigration case, the Supreme Court got sidetracked over a question that has major implications for the executive branch and its ability to function: Can a plaintiff walk into court, challenge a federal regulation, and win a victory that halts the entire government’s ability to enforce that regulation anywhere, against anyone—even parties that played no role in the litigation?<br><br>The answer to this question is important, because this tactic has rapidly become an obstacle to governance.<br><br>Under President Barack Obama, conservative judges began using a specific power to “set aside” policies, granted to them by a provision of a 1946 law, to halt executive policies nationwide, claiming that Congress intended to award them this sweeping power. Left-leaning judges used the tool to limit President Donald Trump’s efforts to rewrite federal statutes, particularly asylum law, and prompted a huge backlash among Republicans. Today, with President Joe Biden in office, conservative judges have transformed the power to “set aside” policies into an unprecedented weapon of obstruction, voiding agency rules and executive policies so frequently that they have turned the federal judiciary into a kind of shadow president with a permanent veto over the actual, elected president.<br><br>It is not actually clear, though, that judges even have the legal authority to wipe federal policy off the books. A strictly textualist interpretation of federal law strongly suggests that they do not. To the contrary, the fact that federal courts have unlawfully expanded their power to interfere with duties of the executive branch seems like a direct attack on the separation of powers.<br><br>https://slate.com/news-and-politics<wbr>/2022/12/supreme-court-biden-immigr<wbr>ation-masks-debt-relief-elizabeth-p<wbr>relogar.html",1670142923,0,,elizabeth-prelogar-dared-to-challenge-the,1,12,0,"[{'no': 1120920, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)01:27:39', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1120917"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1120917</a><br>Man I hate you zoomer fags or nutjobs that are just ignorant of history.<br>I&#039;m talking 2013 when Dems removed the 60 vote threshold in the senate.

He didn’t list the debt in financial disclosure filings, as candidates and presidents are expected to do, Forbes reported.<br><br>The loan was paid off just over five months into his presidency. Forbes said the documents don’t specify who satisfied it.<br><br>Daewoo is a South Korean conglomerate that partnered with Trump on a development project near the United Nations headquarters in New York City and on several other projects over the years. The company has ties to North Korea, Forbes reported, and was the only South Korean company allowed to operate a business in North Korea in the mid-1990s.<br><br>Trump may have skirted disclosure laws and not committed an outright violation because the loan was on the books of his company, the Trump Organization, and not identified as a personal loan, Forbes noted.<br><br>The debt would have sparked conflict of interest concerns over an American president’s indebtedness to a foreign operation vulnerable to influence by North Korea’s rogue government. Trump often gushed about his close relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.<br><br>Such loans are largely reported on an honor system because the U.S. Office of Government Ethics has neither the resources nor the power to delve into a president’s assets.<br><br>“If someone does not disclose a loan, OGE has no way to know,” said Walter Shaub, who ran that agency when Trump took office.<br><br>Don Fox, who once also headed the office, told Forbes:“The system is kind of predicated upon people actually following a law because they want to follow the law.”",1670256057,0,,trump-did-not-disclose-198-million-loan-from,1,77,0,"[{'no': 1121401, 'now': '12/06/22(Tue)11:16:54', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1121382"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1121382</a><br>Then why did you post this?<br><span class=""quote"">&gt; ”The system is kind of predicated upon people actually following a law because they want to follow the law.”</span>', 'time': 1670343414, 'resto': 1120982}, {'no': 1121894, 'now': '12/07/22(Wed)12:00:40', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1121382"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1121382</a><br>It just shows Trump is above the law and why he must be prosecuted to save America.', 'time': 1670432440, 'resto': 1120982}, {'no': 1122098, 'now': '12/07/22(Wed)22:51:45', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1121894"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1121894</a><br>Any attempt to prosecute him will be seen as a partisan attack from political enemies and might motivate his followers to violence.

Charges tied to $50 million he laundered,"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/lo<wbr>cal/article269634466.html<br><br>Former Republican Miami Congressman David Rivera was arrested Monday on federal criminal charges, including failing to register as a foreign agent for Venezuela, stemming from his $50 million consulting contract with the country’s oil company that supposedly aimed to improve its tarnished image in the United States. Rivera, a once-influential player in South Florida politics, and his former Miami-Dade political consultant, Esther Nuhfer, have been charged by an indictment accusing them of conspiring to commit offenses against the United States, failing to register as foreign agents as part of their consulting work for Venezuela’s oil subsidiary, PDV USA, and money laundering. Rivera had his first federal court appearance in Atlanta, where he had been living and was arrested Monday afternoon. But he is expected to be transferred to Miami this week to face charges that were returned on Nov. 16 by a federal grand jury in Miami, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in South Florida. The Miami Herald could not reach Rivera or his defense attorney, but the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Marshals Service said Rivera had bailed out of jail Monday afternoon after making an initial appearance in Atlanta federal court. His attorney, Jeffrey Feldman, declined to comment, telling the AP in a text message that he had “not seen the indictment.”<br>The indictment accuses Rivera and Nuhfer of conspiring to “unlawfully enrich themselves by engaging in political activities in the United States on behalf of the Government of Venezuela ... in an effort to influence United States foreign policy toward Venezuela.” It further accuses them of trying “to conceal these efforts by failing to register under [federal law] as agents of the Government of Venezuela and by creating the false appearance that they were providing consulting services to PDV USA.“",1670323484,0,,republican-rep-david-rivera-arrested-charges-tied,1,5,0,"[{'no': 1121293, 'now': '12/06/22(Tue)05:45:22', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'As Venezuela’s economy was crashing in 2017, the country’s state-owned oil company hired Rivera for a costly public relations campaign to prop up the Venezuelan firm in the United States and to prevent U.S. sanctions. In just a few months, Rivera’s business, Interamerican Consulting, collected $20 million from Venezuela’s U.S. subsidiary, PDV USA, but its $50 million contract with the former politician abruptly ended when he was accused of doing little work, according to a lawsuit in New York that was filed before the federal indictment in Miami. Court documents in both the civil and federal case revealed that Rivera diverted more than half of his PDV USA income — $13 million — to three subcontractors in Miami who supposedly provided “international strategic consulting services” for the Venezuelan firm.<br>One of Rivera’s subcontractors who received millions from his Venezuelan deal was a Miami real estate developer, Hugo Perera, who was convicted in one of South Florida’s biggest drug-trafficking cases, the Miami Herald and el Nuevo Herald have learned from court records and sources familiar with Perera’s history. Perera is not named as a defendant in the indictment filed against Rivera and Nuhfer. Perera’s main company, PG &amp; Associates, which develops residential projects in Miami, and his other firm, Krome Agronomics, which sells fertilizer products, received a total of $4.85 million from Rivera’s consulting firm as part of his PDV USA contract, civil court records show. Nuhfer’s Miami business, Communication Solutions, Inc., received a total of $4.5 million from Rivera’s firm, according to civil court records. Lastly, a Miami company, Interglobal Yacht Management, LLC, which provided maintenance services for Venezuelan businessman Raul Gorrin’s yacht, received a total of $3.75 million from Rivera’s firm.', 'time': 1670323522, 'resto': 1121292}, {'no': 1121294, 'now': '12/06/22(Tue)05:46:23', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'It was not clear from the civil court records whether Perera and other recipients of Rivera’s payments — including Nuhfer and Gorrin — ever did any work as part of Rivera’s consulting firm’s contract with PDV USA. Gorrin, who was indicted in a separate foreign corruption and money-laundering case in 2018, is also not mentioned by name in the new indictment. According to sources familiar with the case, both Perera and Gorrin helped Rivera land the public relations contract with the Venezuelan government and its national-oil company’s subsidiary, PDV USA — though they ultimately failed to prevent U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and its oil interests. Between March 2017 and mid-April 2017, Rivera’s business, Interamerican Consulting, received three installment payments totaling $15 million from PDV USA, according to the indictment. “Rivera divided these funds in approximately equal amounts with Esther Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1, and Individual 1,” says the indictment filed by prosecutor Harry Schimkat. “Over time, Rivera, Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1 and Individual 1 used their portions of these funds to pay for various personal and business expenses, such as the purchase of real estate, payment of expenses for luxury yachts, and, in Rivera’s case, contributions to his campaign for state office [in 2018],” according to the indictment. Venezuela’s U.S. subsidiary only became aware of Rivera’s diversion of payments after it sued his company, Interamerican Consulting, in 2020; it is battling with Rivera and his firm’s lawyers over obtaining key evidence from the former politician.<br>. PDV USA, based in New York and the parent company of Houston-based Citgo, is seeking to recover the $20 million in payments from Rivera’s company in a breach-of-contract suit stemming from their original $50 million agreement signed in 2017.

Holmes will be benched from their anchoring duties at ABC News’ “GMA3′ while the news division weighs the effect their recent disclosure of a romantic relationship might have on the program and the company, ABC News President Kim Godwin informed staffers Monday.<br><br>Godwin told ABC News employees during an editorial call Monday that Robach and Holmes had not violated any company policy, according to a person familiar with the matter, but indicated ABC News felt the matter had become “an internal and external disruption,” and “wanted to do what’s best for the organization.”<br><br>ABC News declined to make executives available for comment. Gio Benitez and Stephanie Ramos will co-host Monday’s broadcast, this person said, but there’s not a sense at present of how the program will be staffed for the rest of the week or when Robach and Holmes might return.<br><br>The duo has generated reams of unwanted attention since the revelation last week that they had been involved romantically for some time, even though most outsiders believed each anchor was still in a committed marriage. Since the disclosure, the pair has been the focus of tabloid reports, with viewers analyzing their every word on camera to see if either was making reference to the discovery of the relationship.<br><br>ABC News and its corporate parent, Walt Disney, have reason for concern. “GMA3,” an afternoon extension of the popular “Good Morning America,” has been a bright spot in daytime for the network. In 2021, the program generated nearly $43.4 million in advertising, according to ad-tracker Kantar, a jump of 26.1% from the nearly $34.4 million it captured in the previous year. Just days ago, ABC News was touting the ratings performance of “GMA3” and comparing it with rivals such as CBS’ “The Talk’ and NBC News’ “NBC News Daily.”",1670260229,0,,abc-news-benches-amy-robach-tj-holmes-after,1,1,0,"[{'no': 1121052, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)12:10:55', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'The company seemed to have no worries last week about putting Robach and Holmes on screen.

The idea was simple: Expand the reach of “GMA,” which would cost less to do than run other kinds of original daytime programming, and build new roosts for advertisers who had faith in the dependability of the news brand. But the first concept never really gained traction, and when the coronavirus pandemic hit, executives turned the program more toward news, tapping Robach, a veteran of “Good Morning America” and “20/20,” along with medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton.

Its decision means that Cannon’s orders are void, and everything she had done—including the appointment and oversight of a special master—must be undone. The special master must be dismissed, and Cannon must relinquish all control over this dispute. Any other outcome, the court explained, would constitute “a radical reordering of our caselaw” that violates “bedrock separation-of-powers limitations.” It is a complete victory for the Justice Department and a vindication of the principle that judges may not rewrite the law to run interference for the president who appointed them.<br><br>From the start, Cannon’s efforts to seize control over the DOJ’s probe were entirely lawless, in the very literal sense that she had no lawful justification to intervene.<br><br>Recall how this case began: In August, federal investigators executed a search warrant to seize classified documents that Trump stored at his residence in Mar-a-Lago. A federal magistrate judge authorized the warrant, which articulated probable cause of illegal storage, and explicitly described the areas to be searched—precisely what the Fourth Amendment requires. Trump, infuriated by the search (which he dubbed a “raid”), contested the warrant in a different federal court, where he stood a good chance of securing a judge whom he appointed.

Hobby Lobby, according to a bombshell report in The New York Times.<br><br>The dinner companions, who were wealthy donors to an evangelical Christian nonprofit, reportedly tipped off the minister who led the nonprofit, Rev. Rob Schenck, who told the Times he later informed the CEO of Hobby Lobby.<br><br>Schenck also used the information “undetectably” to assist “in preparing for the inevitable announcement” of the court’s decision, which he wrote in a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts earlier this year which was obtained and published by the Times.<br><br>The minister, whose beliefs have changed in recent years, provided “thousands” of emails and other records to the Times showing how he campaigned for decades to lay the legal groundwork for the Supreme Court to eventually overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973.<br><br>The 2014 contraception case prompted the court to decide whether requiring a company to provide contraception as part of its health coverage violated religious freedom protections. Hobby Lobby’s conservative Christian owners said they were opposed to contraception use. The result was a victory for the craft store chain and religious conservatives ― much like the court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, rolling back abortion rights for millions of people.<br><br>Alito denies tipping the court’s hand eight years ago, the Times reported.<br><br>But the accusation comes at a contentious moment where swaths of the nation have already begun questioning the court’s legitimacy and its station above politics.",1668899873,0,,alito-confirmed-as-the-leaker-for-the-republican,1,40,0,"[{'no': 1120802, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)20:20:45', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1120796"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1120796</a><br>they are literally oligarchy dictatorships. that is how every socialist/communist government ever has worked. that is the only way they will ever work because they are based on having an extremely authoritarian government stripping people of their autonomy and stealing their labor from them to give to others.

The whole episode came to a head yesterday.<br><br>In a statement on Monday calling for Congress to end the impasse, Biden ― the self-proclaimed “most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history” ― misleadingly hailed the White House–brokered deal that cut the legs out from under railworkers as a grand victory agreed to “by both sides.”",1669886474,0,,bernie-sanders-and-the-left-outflank-corporate,1,27,0,"[{'no': 1119984, 'now': '12/02/22(Fri)11:08:05', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p1119982"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1119982</a><br>Our highways are already nationalized you fucking dumb nigger.

Republicans, as well as tough-on-crime Democrats like Mr. Adams, a former police captain, have argued that growing disorder calls for more aggressive measures.
