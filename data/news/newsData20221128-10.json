in Republican report on alleged misconduct<br><br>House Republicans on Friday released a new report detailing whistleblower allegations of FBI misconduct and politicization at the highest levels of the Department of Justice. &quot;The Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the stewardship of Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland, is broken,&quot; the GOP report states. &quot;The problem lies not with the majority of front-line agents who serve our country, but with the FBI&#039;s politicized bureaucracy.&quot;<br><br>Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee say this report is &quot;the first comprehensive accounting of the FBI&#039;s problems to date, which undermine the FBI&#039;s fundamental law-enforcement mission.&quot; The report features testimony from whistleblowers who describe FBI leadership in Washington, D.C., as &quot;rotted at its core.&quot; They allege a &quot;systemic culture of unaccountability&quot; and say the bureau is beset by &quot;rampant corruption, manipulation, and abuse.&quot;", "filename": "House Republicans release lengthy report alleging politicization in the FBI and DOJ", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 533, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1667566177872892, "time": 1667566177, "md5": "I1HvvYT7WXCmkJjEZ81HsQ==", "fsize": 248277, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "house-republicans-release-1000page-report", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 86, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 81, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1115163, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)23:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1115162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1115162</a><br>good necrobump", "time": 1668574005, "resto": 1110738}, {"no": 1115171, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)00:18:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1111548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1111548</a><br>What&#039;s the down side if this happens?<br>I&#039;m asking very seriously.", "time": 1668575932, "resto": 1110738}, {"no": 1115172, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)00:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1115171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1115171</a><br>proud boys members would have to fight with FBI agents instead of leftists", "time": 1668576107, "resto": 1110738}, {"no": 1115175, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)00:28:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1115172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1115172</a><br>What&#039;s the down side if this happens?", "time": 1668576515, "resto": 1110738}, {"no": 1115218, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)06:37:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1115175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1115175</a><br>prison rape is a horrible thing", "time": 1668598666, "resto": 1110738}], "last_modified": 1668598666}, {"no": 1114266, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)14:15:39", "name": "ROPE A DOPE", "sub": "DIS DA TYPE A BOOK MEGA MAGA GOP WANT IN BARRY OBAMA PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY CHICAGO", "com": "Obama presidential library construction halted after noose found on site \u2018We have zero tolerance for any form of bias or hate,\u2019 company says and offers $100,000 reward to help find who was responsible The firm building former US president Barack Obama\u2019s presidential library suspended operations after a noose was found at the construction site in Chicago and the police were called.

Obama\u2019s charitable foundation also released a statement on the library, part of a project to create the Obama Presidential Center. Obama was born in the US state of Hawaii but entered politics after becoming a community organizer in Chicago, passing through the state senate before becoming a US senator representing Illinois. He beat Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination for the presidency in 2008 and became America\u2019s first Black president when he won the election, then was re-elected for a second term in 2012. Having reached term limits, he handed the mantle to Clinton in 2016 and she lost the election in a shock defeat by Donald Trump.https://www.theguardian.com/u<wbr>s-news/2022/nov/11/obama-presidenti<wbr>al-library-construction-halted-noos<wbr>e-found-site", "time": 1668366939, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dis-da-type-a-book-mega-maga-gop-want-in-barry", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 16, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 11, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1114783, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)21:33:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1114768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1114768</a><br>Pathetic deflection.
