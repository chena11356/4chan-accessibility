Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization (2022) that \u201cthe Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.\u201d Given that Dobbs tossed out a half-century of precedent, upended reproductive freedom in about half of the country, and effectively eliminated an entire constitutional right, you probably heard about this decision.<br><br>Nevertheless, on Monday, a federal judge in Washington, DC handed down a brief order suggesting that the Supreme Court may not have meant what it said in Dobbs. \u201cThe \u2018issue\u2019 before the Court in Dobbs was not whether any provision of the Constitution provided a right to abortion,\u201d Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton appointee, wrote. \u201cRather, the question before the Court in Dobbs was whether the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution provided such a right.\u201d<br><br>And that leaves open the possibility that the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits \u201cslavery\u201d and \u201cinvoluntary servitude,\u201d does forbid laws banning abortion. Judge Kollar-Kotelly\u2019s order requires the parties to a criminal prosecution touching on abortion rights to brief whether the Thirteenth Amendment or \u201cany other provision of the Constitution could confer a right to abortion.\u201d<br><br>Unless the membership of the Supreme Court changes drastically, the Court is exceedingly unlikely to rule that any provision of the Constitution protects the right to an abortion. The Court\u2019s GOP-appointed majority stridently opposes abortion rights. They didn\u2019t just overrule Roe v. Wade. They established, in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v.

As Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has written, \u201ca woman forced by law to submit to the pain and anxiety of carrying, delivering, and nurturing a child she does not wish to have is entitled to believe that more than a play on words links her forced labor with the concept of involuntary servitude.\u201d<br><br>Moreover, while Judge Kollar-Kotelly\u2019s order is, at most, a very thoughtful effort to troll the Supreme Court, trolling is now common practice by lower court judges throughout the federal judiciary. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is dominated by right-wing trolls, who routinely hand down outlandishly reasoned decisions declaring entire federal agencies unconstitutional, ordering the Biden administration to change America\u2019s foreign policy, or even permitting military personnel to defy orders that political conservatives do not like.<br><br>It would certainly be best if federal judges all engaged in good faith efforts to follow the law, including well-established legal precedents. But since we don\u2019t live in that world, Kollar-Kotelly\u2019s order raises an arresting question: Why should left-leaning judges unilaterally disarm?

Handy, a criminal prosecution of several individuals who allegedly worked together to block access to a reproductive health clinic in 2020, when Roe was still good law.<br><br>Among other things, these defendants are charged with violating a federal law that makes it a crime to conspire to \u201cinjure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person . . . in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d<br><br>Before Dobbs, this would have been a fairly straightforward case (assuming, of course, that the government can prove its factual allegations against these defendants beyond a reasonable doubt). Prior to Dobbs, cases like Roe established that there is a constitutional right to an abortion. So blocking an abortion clinic injured the right of that clinic\u2019s patients to exercise a constitutional right.<br><br>After Dobbs, however, the case becomes more complicated. The government still has a strong argument that blocking an abortion clinic violates a federal statute that specifically prohibits using certain tactics to block access to an abortion clinic \u2014 and the government also charged these defendants with violating this statute. Nevertheless, the prosecution\u2019s argument that these defendants violated the broader ban on injuring constitutional rights would be stronger if it could also argue that these defendants violated a constitutional right to an abortion. <br><br>Enter the Thirteenth Amendment.

In Bailey v. Alabama (1911), the Supreme Court held that this amendment sought to abolish \u201cthat control by which the personal service of one [person] is disposed of or coerced for another\u2019s benefit, which is the essence of involuntary servitude.\u201d<br><br>As Koppelman writes, \u201cforced pregnancy and childbirth\u201d by its very nature, operates \u201cby compelling the woman to serve the fetus.\u201d<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But wait, what about Dobbs\u2019 statement that \u201cthe Constitution does not confer a right to abortion?\u201d</span><br><br>Of course, one major problem with this Thirteenth Amendment argument is that Dobbs spoke in categorical terms about the right to an abortion \u2014 or, rather, the nonexistence of that right. Dobbs states outright that \u201cthe Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.\u201d<br><br>To get around this problem, Kollar-Kotelly rests on a notoriously hard-to-pin-down distinction between a court decision\u2019s \u201cholding\u201d and something known as \u201cdicta.\u201d<br><br>Briefly, the portions of an opinion that respond to the specific legal question before a court are considered the court\u2019s \u201cholding,\u201d and are binding on lower courts that consider similar cases. By contrast, when a judge launches into a non-sequitur or otherwise opines on issues that are not relevant to the actual legal issue in the case, those portions of the judge\u2019s opinion are considered \u201cdicta\u201d and are not binding.", "time": 1675918947, "resto": 1140755}, {"no": 1140760, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)00:03:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As Kollar-Kotelly writes, quoting from the eminent federal Judge Henry Friendly, \u201ca judge\u2019s power to bind is limited to the issue that is before him; he cannot transmute dictum into decision by waving a wand and uttering the word \u2018hold.\u2019\u201d<br><br>The specific issue that was before the Court in Dobbs, Kollar-Kotelly notes, was whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects a right to an abortion, not whether any other provision does so. \u201cThat is why neither the majority nor the dissent in Dobbs analyzed anything but the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d she writes. Thus, the Court\u2019s broad pronouncement that the Constitution as a whole \u201cdoes not confer a right to abortion\u201d can plausibly be dismissed as dicta.<br><br>Realistically, this argument is unlikely to persuade anyone on the Supreme Court who joined the majority opinion in Dobbs.

Natural rights require non-interference to function, civil rights require the labor of others to function.</span><br>That is not how natural and civil rights are defined. Natural, or human, rights are rights that all persons are considered to have regardless of whether any state legally recognizes it or not, so it&#039;s more of a philosphical concept than a legal one. Civil, or legal, rights are rights that are legally recognized by a state as being possessed by all of its citizens and so are a strictly legal construct. In this sense, it&#039;s possible for a right to be both a civil and natural right. If someone is unfairly denied freedom of speech, thought, or expression, you can say that they&#039;ve lost their natural right to free speech as well as their civil right which is supposed to be legally protected by the first amendment. In the case of abortion law in the US, Dobbs is philosophically inconsistent with how the natural rights of bodily integrity and privacy have traditionally been protected by the federal government because it permits state governments to grant a right to another party which no legal person has at the expense of another paty&#039;s rights. Of course, this is not normally a problem from a strictly legal perspective since natural rights are not legal rights, but natural rights that are either implicitly or explicitly legally recognized are also civil rights. Both the right to bodily integrity and privacy can be inferred from the constitution through the fourth and ninth amendments and this is additionally supported by the equal protection clauses of the fifth and 14th amendments which prohibit state governments from stripping rights away without due process. Also, the equal protection clause of the 14th emphasizes consistency in how the law is applied to individuals in similar circumstances, which can also part of civil law that conflicts with Dobbs.", "time": 1675997477, "resto": 1140755}, {"no": 1140989, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1140987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1140987</a><br>through that adjudication, they can create laws<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-18<wbr>50/5us137</span><br>a classic example, through their ruling on whether or not commissions delivered late would be valid, the court gave itself the power to decide the constitutionality of laws", "time": 1675997671, "resto": 1140755}, {"no": 1140990, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:58:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1140989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1140989</a><br>they didn&#039;t give themselves any power. the writers of the constitution were still alive at that point and in office, why would they let Marshall make shit up?

We probably wouldn&#039;t consider this to be a &quot;person&quot;. A human? Yes, technically. Biologically, sure, but it seems to be the case that society basis its idea of personhood around a shared conscious experience as opposed to simply being human. A human who is permanently brain dead, for example, is not considered a person. We routinely unplug these people from life support if its decided that they have no chance of ever being conscious again despite the fact that they are physiologically still alive and biologically a human. Death is another great example. What do we consider death really? Is it the cessation of biological function? Well, no. Cell activity still continues on long after death. Involuntary muscle twitches, hair growth, etc., We consider someone dead when their consciousness is permanently gone. My point is that even if a baby were carried fully to term but was born with zero conscious experience due to some permanent brain injury, we wouldn&#039;t consider that baby to be a person worthy of moral consideration. Being carried to term is irrelevant in terms of whether or not a fetus is a person.

Larger amateur radio balloons launched in the USA require FAA clearance, need a radar reflector attached, and usually continually transmit APRS telemetry before naturally popping and falling back to earth after a few hours, just like a weather balloon.<br>However there is also the simpler &#039;pico&#039; ballooning hobby, which involves the use of mylar helium party balloons to launch small solar powered payloads that are only a few grams in weight. They typically transmit low power WSPR at HF frequencies and can only transmit whenever there is sufficient solar power available. Amateur radio or SDR hobbyist stations around the world can pick up these transmissions, and report them on amateur.sondehub.org and/or wsprnet.org. Well built balloons can totally circumnavigate the globe several times over several months before degrading.<br>While termed &#039;pico&#039;, the party balloons used can still be roughly a meter in diameter on the ground, with some latex balloons potentially expanding further at high altitudes due to the low atmospheric pressure. These balloons can be legally launched from almost anywhere in the world. In particular in the USA there is no FAA clearance required to launch them due to their payload being much less than the limit of 4 lbs (1.8kg).<br>...<br>More: https://www.leonarddavid.com/amateu<wbr>r-pico-balloon-unidentified-flying-<wbr>object-identified/", "filename": "NENA_99_Luftballons_trim", "ext": ".webm", "w": 196, "h": 144, "tn_w": 196, "tn_h": 144, "tim": 1676625526774634, "time": 1676625526, "md5": "kVKgC3g70mE/0Q8GTq0CRQ==", "fsize": 875155, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-us-airforce-may-have-shot-down-an-amateur", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 1142604, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)04:20:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1142603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1142603</a><br>... There is speculation that at least one of the objects shot down over Canada, Yukon by a US Air Force jet may have been amateur radio pico balloon K9YO-15 which was launched from Illinois on October 10 2022. It was on it&#039;s seventh circumnavigation of the globe after being aloft for 123 days.<br>The launch blog post indicates that the K9YO-15 balloon was flying a silver mylar 32&quot; sphere SAG balloon which appears to be this one from balloons.online. Unlike latex or rubber weather balloons which inflate and stretch as they rise into lower atmospheric pressures, these mylar balloons can&#039;t stretch, so their fully inflated ground size will be the same as their size at high altitudes, meaning the pico balloon won&#039;t get much bigger than 32&quot;. The payload was a GPS module, Arduino, SI5351 used as a WSPR and APRS transmitter and a solar panel, all together weighing 16.4 grams. A pentagon memo notes that the object shot down over Canada was a &quot;small metallic balloon with a tethered payload&quot; which fits the description of the pico balloon exactly.<br>The K9YO-15 balloon ceased all WSPR telemetry transmissions while flying just below Alaska since Feb 11 00:18 UTC (just before sunset in Alaska when the solar panels would stop working).<br>By using NOAA wind models and the last known location by Alaska, K9YO-15 was projected to have been over Yukon when the US Air Force shot down the unknown balloon object at Feb 11 20:41 UTC (3:41 PM EST / 1:41 PM Yukon time according to Canadian Defense Minister Anand). Reports put the altitude of the shot down object at approximately 40,000ft (~12000 meters), which matches the projected ~11500 meters of K9YO-15. Based on the previous days transmission times, it is suspected that if it were operational, the balloon would have begun transmitting again sometime later in the Yukon afternoon when the sun was stronger, but no transmissions have been seen.<br>On February 14th the balloon was declared as missing in action by the launch group. <br>...", "time": 1676625623, "resto": 1142603}, {"no": 1142605, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)04:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1142604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1142604</a><br>...

These floater balloons often use only solar panels, no batteries. Batteries were dropped from the projects early on because they have limited charging cycles before they stop accepting a charge, especially in the harsh temps at altitude, -40F/-40C or worse. When the battery stops accepting a charge, it ends telemetry from the mission. So they only report telemetry during daylight, when the sun is at a high enough angle to illuminate the tiny solar panels. In the Arctic winter, the days are short and the sun might not get high enough to wake up the electronics. So it stays dormant for one or more days until it drifts back down to lower latitudes where there&#039;s more sunlight. So K9YO-15 was in a period where watchers didn&#039;t expect to hear from it for a few days. But we expected it today. So far nothing. As I write this, daylight is almost done way up there for Tuesday, Feb 14.<br>We (the Amateur Radio balloon community) only expect any telemetry from it today would be via WSPR, none via APRS. WSPR uses HF and can be received at long distances, where it&#039;s relayed to Internet map sites. APRS is (usually) on VHF and UHF, only received by line of sight. There are no relay stations in range of today&#039;s projected flight course in northern Ontario and James Bay, Canada. So APRS-fed sites wouldn&#039;t show updates today anyway.<br>The club in Illinois that built the balloon has tracking links at https://nibbb.org/links-to-locate-a<wbr>nd-track/ - you&#039;ll have to scroll down to find K9YO-15.<br>For an introduction, I&#039;m Ian KO6YQ.

Transcript from the Office of Elise Stefanik:<br><br>Congresswoman Stefanik: \u201cThank you, Ms. Parker for your extraordinary service and your courage for being here today. Mr. Turley, I want to start with you. The Twitter Files laid bare for the American people what you correctly call unconstitutional, \u2018censorship by surrogate\u2019. Matt Taibbi writes, \u2018Twitter\u2019s contact with the FBI was constant and pervasive, as if it were a subsidiary.\u2019 Do you agree with that assessment?\u201d<br><br>Turley: \u201cI do. What we know on the record so far shows a relationship that goes beyond this sort of informal exchange of ideas\u201d.<br><br>Stefanik: \u201cYou\u2019re correct. In fact, isn\u2019t it true that leading up to the 2020 election, Twitter had weekly meetings with not just the FBI, with DOJ, with DHS, with DNI to conduct this unconstitutional censorship by surrogate. We know that because of the Twitter Files, correct?\u201d<br><br>Turley: \u201cCorrect\u201d.<br><br>Stefanik: \u201cAnd it was not just meetings, not just censorship of stories like the Hunter Biden laptop story. We also now know that the FBI paid Twitter over $3.4 million of taxpayer taxpayer funds to censor these stories before the 2020 election. Is that correct?\u201d<br><br>Turley: \u201cThat money was paid, Twitter confirmed that\u201d.", "time": 1676296790, "resto": 1141740}, {"no": 1141743, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)09:01:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1141742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1141742</a><br>Stefanik: \u201cThe Twitter Files are just the tip of the iceberg because there\u2019s so much more.\u201d There was a corrupt revolving door at the highest levels between the FBI and Twitter. Look no further than Jim Baker, former General Counsel at the FBI, who helped unlawfully investigate Donald Trump in the 2016 election, or look at Jim Comey as Deputy Chief of Staff who became the Director of Strategy at Twitter. Isn\u2019t it true, according to the Twitter Files, that there were so many FBI officials who then went to work at Twitter that they created their own Slack channel and crib sheet for onboarding? The Twitter Files confirmed that, correct?\u201d<br><br>Stefanik: \u201cAre you aware, as the American people are aware that according to polling, of the people that were made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story, 53 percent would have changed their vote, including 61 percent of Democrats. This is the definition of election meddling, and it\u2019s the definition of election meddling by the FBI on behalf of Democrats paid for by the US taxpayers. It\u2019s collusion. It\u2019s corruption, and it\u2019s unconstitutional. Ms. Parker, I want to go to you next about your experience at the FBI. Because this is not just about the Twitter Files, which folks are focused on because of the news it made, it\u2019s about a systemic rot in the culture and the politicization of the leadership of the FBI, and it needs to be rooted out. On September 29, 2021, the National School Boards Association sent a letter to Joe Biden, equating parents at school board meetings to domestic terrorists. And on October 4th, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a memorandum to the FBI and US attorneys that the department would use federal enforcement tools to target and prosecute these parents. Do you consider parents as domestic terrorists?\u201d<br><br>Parker: \u201cI do not consider parents as domestic terrorists. No, I do not\u201d.", "time": 1676296862, "resto": 1141740}, {"no": 1141744, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)09:01:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Trump lost", "time": 1676296907, "resto": 1141740}, {"no": 1141745, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)09:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1141743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1141743</a><br>Stefanik: \u201cNo, and neither do the American people. But there\u2019s more to this story. It goes back further than that initial letter on September 29th. Because the letter didn\u2019t happen organically\u2014it was solicited, it was solicited by the White House and by the Secretary of Education. Essentially, the Biden Administration laid the predicate for which it used to justify illegally targeting the American people, targeting these parents. Is it proper protocol, as a former FBI officer, to set that predicate, to manufacture the reasoning to justify opening an investigation?\u201d<br><br>Parker: \u201cI believe that no one should be targeted for free speech and that violence should never be tolerated under any circumstance, but it should definitely not\u2014no one should be targeted because they want to speak up at a school board meeting\u201d.<br><br>Stefanik: \u201cThis was a setup, and it was the setup and it\u2019s the real definition of weaponization of the government against the American people. And it\u2019s not just this example of targeting parents [by the National] School Boards Association. It goes back to the opening of \u2018Crossfire Hurricane,\u2019 it goes back to the faulty FISA application. It goes back to what we heard on that first panel from Senators Grassley and Johnson. It goes back to the suppression, illegally, of the Hunter Biden laptop story paid for by the U.S. taxpayers. This corruption needs to be rooted out. And it\u2019s not just about protecting the US Constitution, it\u2019s most importantly about protecting the American people from the weaponization of the federal government against them\u201d.", "time": 1676296941, "resto": 1141740}, {"no": 1141746, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)09:42:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The FBI killed Martin Luther king but this is what America is upset about", "time": 1676299342, "resto": 1141740}, {"no": 1141748, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)09:54:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Twitter is a private company.

No.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;If you think that Toyota makes safe cars then you&#039;re basically saying that Toyota is a harmless company that should be trusted without question!&quot;</span><br>The last bit of conspiracy thinking is just blatant straw manning.

The study looked at gun regulation state by state in comparison with FBI data about gun homicides, gathered from police departments around the country. Analysis revealed that universal background checks, permit requirements, \u201cmay issue\u201d laws (where local authorities have discretion in approving who can carry a concealed weapon), and laws banning people convicted of violent misdemeanors from possessing firearms are, individually and collectively, significantly able to reduce gun-related deaths.<br><br>It\u2019s a particularly compelling finding because in March 2019, Siegel and collaborators drew virtually the same conclusion by analyzing state laws in comparison with death certificate data collected nationally by the CDC.<br><br>In that study, which was published March 28, 2019, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Siegel\u2019s team analyzed 25 years of national data to examine the relationship between 10 different types of state laws and the number of deaths by homicide and suicide in all 50 states. State gun laws requiring universal background checks for all gun sales resulted in homicide rates 15 percent lower than states without such laws. Laws prohibiting the possession of firearms by people who have been convicted of a violent crime were associated with an 18 percent reduction in homicide rates. In contrast, Siegel found that laws regulating the type of firearms people have access to\u2014such as assault weapon bans and large capacity ammunition magazine bans\u2014and \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws have no effect on the rate of firearm-related homicide.

The move comes after a Chinese \u201cspy balloon\u201d was spotted and shot down in US airspace. In a statement, the US Commerce Department said the entities were being blacklisted for supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary modernization efforts, specifically those related to aerospace programs.\u201d These included airships, balloons and related materials used by Beijing for intelligence and reconnaissance. The new restrictions will make it harder for the sanctioned companies to obtain US technologies. The targeted entities include Beijing Nanjing Aerospace Technology and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation\u2019s 48th Research Institute. China\u2019s \u201cuse of high-altitude balloons violates our sovereignty and threatens US national security,\u201d Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez stated. He said the sanctions would make clear that entities seeking to undermine Washington\u2019s national security \u201cwill be cut off from accessing US technologies.\u201d The \u2018spy balloon\u2019 saga started last week when the Pentagon said it was tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance airship over the US state of Montana. Two days later, it was brought down by a F-22 fighter jet over the water off the coast of South Carolina. While the Pentagon accuses China of using the balloon to \u201csurveil strategic sites\u201d in the US, Beijing described the vessel as a \u201ccivilian airship\u201d which strayed into the US territory due to force majeure circumstances.", "filename": "balloon", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 768, "h": 432, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676136972449172, "time": 1676136972, "md5": "MWKsZSyWK3K4m1S72U4iyg==", "fsize": 105846, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "us-unveils-new-sanctions-on-china", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 1141340, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)13:33:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1141334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1141334</a><br>I&#039;m not actually sure what this will accomplish<br>If Chinese intelligence business X can&#039;t purchase specific US tech, they are simply going to use Chinese business Y to purchase it instead", "time": 1676140387, "resto": 1141334}, {"no": 1141405, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)18:40:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1141334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1141334</a><br>bump", "time": 1676158830, "resto": 1141334}, {"no": 1141415, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)18:57:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1141340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1141340</a><br>doesnt accomplish anything. dems just want to pre-empt the possibility of being called &#039;weak&#039; by their opponents so pick something meaningless to make it seem as tho they are making some kind of stand.", "time": 1676159841, "resto": 1141334}, {"no": 1141888, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)23:24:24", "name": "Borderlands", "com": "Funny the great American national openly spy&#039;s on every one even it&#039;s own people by taping our phones and censoring it&#039;s people and their worried about a balloon with a camera how sad I&#039;m more worried my country is cheating and stealy from my retirement than a balloon with a camera.face the facts I can get pictures of my home fore free using googy earth after all did we really spend a billion dollars to take pretty pictures of stars of course not were peeping toms spying on our neighbors.", "time": 1676348664, "resto": 1141334}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 1141874, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:13:52", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "nuke war: China messing with USA", "com": "https://nypost.com/2023/02/13/biden<wbr>-silent-on-flying-objects-after-dir<wbr>ecting-four-shootdowns-in-eight-day<wbr>s/", "filename": "Screenshot_20230123-113313_Brave", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 2220, "tn_w": 121, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676340832734675, "time": 1676340832, "md5": "yLIdjW/RGd4iOWKNNjsVUg==", "fsize": 717491, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "nuke-war-china-messing-with-usa", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 1141881, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:30:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1141874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1141874</a><br>Article paste fagnew", "time": 1676345411, "resto": 1141874}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 1138717, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)12:57:53", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "America Private Healthcare System Returns on Health Investment Worsening", "com": "Conservatives still resist the nationalization of the health care industry even with its inferior system.<br><br>https://www.axios.com/2023/01/31/wo<wbr>rsening-return-health-investment<br><br>The U.S. continues to far outspend other developed nations while seeing worsening health outcomes.<br><br>Driving the news: A report from the Commonwealth Fund today shows poorer U.S. health outcomes \u2014 such as Americans being more likely to suffer from multiple chronic illnesses, die from avoidable causes including maternal mortality and assault, and having a shorter life expectancy \u2014 all while America pays the most per capita for those outcomes.<br><br>&quot;The problem is getting worse,&quot; Munira Gunja, senior researcher at the Commonwealth Fund&#039;s International Health Policy Program.<br><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;In these sorts of studies where we make cross-national comparisons, we can see we are still behind our peer countries and need to start implementing methods they&#039;ve developed into our own system,&quot; she said.</span><br><br>By the numbers: The U.S. spends nearly $12,000 on health care per capita, including more than $1,200 in household out-of-pocket spending a year, according to a Commonwealth Fund study released today.<br><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s more than $4,500 than its nearest peer, Germany, which spends about $7,4000 on health care per person in a year.

The amount of resources necessary is prohibitive, the process of isolating and verifying the legal status of every single person in the country would take a literal multi-billion dollar infrastructure that would take years to implement and the legal implications to such a thing would create decades of backlogged courts. What you&#039;re essentially talking about is a military operation that would span the entire U.S. and amount to kicking down people&#039;s doors, dragging them out of their homes and processing tens of millions of people for deportation. This includes the civil rights of American citizens as well. What if they&#039;re hiding an illegal in their home? What if illegals start feeling and hiding? Do we investigate and process warrants for millions of people across hundreds of millions of square miles of the country? Do we start raiding camps in the woods and mountains to round them up? How long will this take? How much money? Could it even pass as legislation? I know /pol/ likes to circlejerk about this meme all of the time but in the reality we currently occupy its just not possible. Secondly, it would be a disastrous hit to the economy. Whether you like it or not, immigrants and illegals alike have become irrevocably embedded in our markets. Agriculture depends on them. Hospitality and construction depends on them. This isn&#039;t even including all of the landlords, business owners and suppliers who would essentially lose a metric fuck ton of business and/or employees overnight.

Every group around them was allowed to increase their generational wealth and invest in the growing infrastructure of America and they were legally prohibited from doing so. As they were getting fucked the government kicked all of the black people out of up and coming communities and red lined them into the &quot;hood&quot;. Segregation made sure that they had the shittiest of everything - schools, healthcare, housing etc., It was absolutely no mystery that both parties post civil war were united under the principal that blacks should never, ever approach a level where they gained the same amount of economic or political power as whites. This is why after the civil war the entirety of America spent decades burning down black businesses, killing black politicians and excluding blacks from wealth building opportunities with the explicit approval of the U.S. government.

The 38-year-old earns about $400 a month in tips, which provides a helpful supplement to his $15 hourly wage as a barista at Philadelphia caf\u00e9 located inside a restaurant.

Michael Lynn, a consumer behavior professor at Cornell University, said consumers were more generous with tips during the early days of the pandemic in an effort to show support for restaurants and other businesses that were hard hit by COVID-19. Many people genuinely wanted to help out and felt sympathetic to workers who held jobs that put them more at risk of catching the virus, Lynn said.<br><br>Tips at full-service restaurants grew by 25.3% in the third quarter of 2022, while gratuities at quick or counter service restaurants went up 16.7% compared to the same time in 2021, according to Square, one of the biggest companies operating digital payment methods.

Jailbreakers give the chatbot a character to play, specifically one that follows a different set of rules than the ones OpenAI has defined for it. In order to do this, users have been telling the bot that it is a different AI model called DAN (Do Anything Now) that can, well, do anything.

On February 4, DAN 5.0 was posted on Reddit, and since then, there has been a DAN 6.0 and SAM, which stands for \u201cSimple DAN,\u201d both of which were posted to Reddit on February 7.

The \u201csociopolitical biases\u201d built into ChatGPT are actually the result of moderation tools that prevent the model from promoting hateful speech or conspiracies. This is because AI already has its own baked-in biases due to being trained on text from the internet, and those biases tend to be racist, sexist, etc..

Studies from Princeton University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Academy of Sciences, find that zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 2050 will require electrifying buildings, making appliances more efficient, and powering them mostly with emission-free sources like renewable energy.<br><br>In the 1980s indoor air quality was in the news, and the CPSC was taking aim at another home appliance that burns fossil fuels: kerosene heaters. Sales were increasing, and regulators grew concerned, because the heaters emitted harmful pollution into homes, mainly nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.<br><br>The EPA says both pollutants can cause breathing problems, especially for people with asthma. And nitrogen dioxide, at higher levels and over longer periods, may contribute to developing asthma. <br><br>The natural gas industry saw regulators&#039; interest and worried the CPSC might come for gas cooking stoves next, according to a 1984 Science News article.
