Im not tryting to victim blame or excuse bad behavior, but there&#039;s just this little itch in the back of my mind when I see stuff like this that says something like, &quot;what did you expect?&quot; Being a cheerleader is one of the most sexualized jobs you can do with clothes on. The kind of people that handle cheerleaders are gonna be lecherous pervs. They exist purely to show tits and jiggle their asses and the people in charge of them exist purely to facilitate this happening so the pervs orbiting them can see that. What else was going to happen? Im not gonna jump the gun and go full prude, but like...? I get why a chick would want to be a cheerleader for some big football team cause money and fame and whatever. Its not just because they&#039;re sluts. And I get that if half naked chicks are flailing around, guys are gonna turned on. I just feel like this whole thing is so pointless and hopeless and stupid. Why is this even a thing? Why do we have people whose job is to be a living blow up doll for establishment media? And why is it seen as okay? Some chick selling herself independently is one thing, but what basically amounts to stare sponsored strippers? Society is so fucked dude. Like, I see the reasons why all of the people in this scenario did what they did, but just fuck. What even is this shit? Is this really what our ancestors survived for millenia for?

David Rivera arrested. Charges tied to $50 million he laundered", "com": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/lo<wbr>cal/article269634466.html<br><br>Former Republican Miami Congressman David Rivera was arrested Monday on federal criminal charges, including failing to register as a foreign agent for Venezuela, stemming from his $50 million consulting contract with the country\u2019s oil company that supposedly aimed to improve its tarnished image in the United States. Rivera, a once-influential player in South Florida politics, and his former Miami-Dade political consultant, Esther Nuhfer, have been charged by an indictment accusing them of conspiring to commit offenses against the United States, failing to register as foreign agents as part of their consulting work for Venezuela\u2019s oil subsidiary, PDV USA, and money laundering. Rivera had his first federal court appearance in Atlanta, where he had been living and was arrested Monday afternoon. But he is expected to be transferred to Miami this week to face charges that were returned on Nov. 16 by a federal grand jury in Miami, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in South Florida. The Miami Herald could not reach Rivera or his defense attorney, but the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Marshals Service said Rivera had bailed out of jail Monday afternoon after making an initial appearance in Atlanta federal court. His attorney, Jeffrey Feldman, declined to comment, telling the AP in a text message that he had \u201cnot seen the indictment.\u201d<br>The indictment accuses Rivera and Nuhfer of conspiring to \u201cunlawfully enrich themselves by engaging in political activities in the United States on behalf of the Government of Venezuela ... in an effort to influence United States foreign policy toward Venezuela.\u201d It further accuses them of trying \u201cto conceal these efforts by failing to register under [federal law] as agents of the Government of Venezuela and by creating the false appearance that they were providing consulting services to PDV USA.\u201c", "filename": "1670307679925441", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670323484947187, "time": 1670323484, "md5": "EEcpFhIeInxG4GS33nSJiA==", "fsize": 121118, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "republican-rep-david-rivera-arrested-charges-tied", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 14, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 1121293, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)05:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As Venezuela\u2019s economy was crashing in 2017, the country\u2019s state-owned oil company hired Rivera for a costly public relations campaign to prop up the Venezuelan firm in the United States and to prevent U.S. sanctions. In just a few months, Rivera\u2019s business, Interamerican Consulting, collected $20 million from Venezuela\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, PDV USA, but its $50 million contract with the former politician abruptly ended when he was accused of doing little work, according to a lawsuit in New York that was filed before the federal indictment in Miami. Court documents in both the civil and federal case revealed that Rivera diverted more than half of his PDV USA income \u2014 $13 million \u2014 to three subcontractors in Miami who supposedly provided \u201cinternational strategic consulting services\u201d for the Venezuelan firm.<br>One of Rivera\u2019s subcontractors who received millions from his Venezuelan deal was a Miami real estate developer, Hugo Perera, who was convicted in one of South Florida\u2019s biggest drug-trafficking cases, the Miami Herald and el Nuevo Herald have learned from court records and sources familiar with Perera\u2019s history. Perera is not named as a defendant in the indictment filed against Rivera and Nuhfer. Perera\u2019s main company, PG &amp; Associates, which develops residential projects in Miami, and his other firm, Krome Agronomics, which sells fertilizer products, received a total of $4.85 million from Rivera\u2019s consulting firm as part of his PDV USA contract, civil court records show. Nuhfer\u2019s Miami business, Communication Solutions, Inc., received a total of $4.5 million from Rivera\u2019s firm, according to civil court records.

Gorrin, who was indicted in a separate foreign corruption and money-laundering case in 2018, is also not mentioned by name in the new indictment. According to sources familiar with the case, both Perera and Gorrin helped Rivera land the public relations contract with the Venezuelan government and its national-oil company\u2019s subsidiary, PDV USA \u2014 though they ultimately failed to prevent U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and its oil interests. Between March 2017 and mid-April 2017, Rivera\u2019s business, Interamerican Consulting, received three installment payments totaling $15 million from PDV USA, according to the indictment. \u201cRivera divided these funds in approximately equal amounts with Esther Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1, and Individual 1,\u201d says the indictment filed by prosecutor Harry Schimkat. \u201cOver time, Rivera, Nuhfer, Foreign Individual 1 and Individual 1 used their portions of these funds to pay for various personal and business expenses, such as the purchase of real estate, payment of expenses for luxury yachts, and, in Rivera\u2019s case, contributions to his campaign for state office [in 2018],\u201d according to the indictment.

PDV USA, based in New York and the parent company of Houston-based Citgo, is seeking to recover the $20 million in payments from Rivera\u2019s company in a breach-of-contract suit stemming from their original $50 million agreement signed in 2017.

Texas, an important immigration case, the Supreme Court got sidetracked over a question that has major implications for the executive branch and its ability to function: Can a plaintiff walk into court, challenge a federal regulation, and win a victory that halts the entire government\u2019s ability to enforce that regulation anywhere, against anyone\u2014even parties that played no role in the litigation?<br><br>The answer to this question is important, because this tactic has rapidly become an obstacle to governance.<br><br>Under President Barack Obama, conservative judges began using a specific power to \u201cset aside\u201d policies, granted to them by a provision of a 1946 law, to halt executive policies nationwide, claiming that Congress intended to award them this sweeping power. Left-leaning judges used the tool to limit President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to rewrite federal statutes, particularly asylum law, and prompted a huge backlash among Republicans. Today, with President Joe Biden in office, conservative judges have transformed the power to \u201cset aside\u201d policies into an unprecedented weapon of obstruction, voiding agency rules and executive policies so frequently that they have turned the federal judiciary into a kind of shadow president with a permanent veto over the actual, elected president.<br><br>It is not actually clear, though, that judges even have the legal authority to wipe federal policy off the books. A strictly textualist interpretation of federal law strongly suggests that they do not. To the contrary, the fact that federal courts have unlawfully expanded their power to interfere with duties of the executive branch seems like a direct attack on the separation of powers.<br><br>https://slate.com/news-and-politics<wbr>/2022/12/supreme-court-biden-immigr<wbr>ation-masks-debt-relief-elizabeth-p<wbr>relogar.html", "filename": "1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1440, "h": 960, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1670142923371596, "time": 1670142923, "md5": "4GrlNjZu57xM0GwjhkkFqQ==", "fsize": 158861, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "elizabeth-prelogar-dared-to-challenge-the", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 16, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 1120573, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)08:51:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Democrats are uneducated.

Harding, who was elected in 2020, was charged with using two dormant corporate entities to apply for the funds, filling out fraudulent applications.<br><br>In his application, prosecutors said Harding claimed one of his businesses had more than $400,000 in revenue and four employees in the months prior to the pandemic. The company has actually been dormant for three years, with no revenue or no employees.<br><br>The indictment also alleges Harding created false bank statements to support his applications.<br><br>He faces six counts, including wire fraud, making false statements and money laundering. Harding has pleaded not guilty and was released on bond before a scheduled trial on Jan. 11.<br><br>\u201cI want the public and my constituents to know that I fully repaid the loan and cooperated with investigators as requested,\u201d he told The Associated Press in a statement.<br><br>Harding sponsored the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill earlier this year, which sparked nationwide outrage before Gov.

The Great Depression had also crushed the first iteration of Farmington State Bank, originally founded in 1887, and a new bank of the same name was created in May 1929. Much of Farmington State Bank\u2019s history is hardly noteworthy. Joining the bank in 1973 was C. Wayne Wexler, who served as the bank\u2019s president for over a decade. Throughout the 1970s, the bank held around $1.5 million in deposits, which grew modestly during the 1980s to around $3.5 million. <br><br>Around 1995, Farmington, for reasons still unknown, attracted the attention of a British citizen residing in Hong Kong named Archie Chan. According to a 2010 interview given by Farmington\u2019s then-president, John Widman, Chan bought the bank in 1995 \u201cwhen he was looking for a chartered Washington bank that might become a platform for international banking.\u201d Though this never came to pass, Chan\u2019s connections suggest that his interests in the small, rural bank may have been manifold.<br><br>Chan acquired Farmington through a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) called Farmington Finance Corporation. The lawyer who aided him in setting up the corporate structure for the new Farmington organization was David K.Y. Tang, who \u2013 among other things \u2013 is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Tang, whose careers in law and business spans Seattle, Hong Kong and Beijing, also served a stint as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2014the central bank branch that has technical legal oversight of Farmington. According to a different Protos investigation, this same component of the Federal Reserve system \u201ctook over regulatory duty for [Farmington/Moonstone] earlier this year, but seems to have glossed over Moonstone\u2019s for-profit foreign interests.\u201d", "time": 1670998457, "resto": 1123952}, {"no": 1123954, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:15:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Though it remained under BVI jurisdiction, annual reports from Farmington State Bank reveal that Chan\u2019s Farmington Finance Corporation maintained its offices in the Jardine House in Hong Kong.

That company is the successor to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co, one of the largest foreign trading companies in the Far East for much of the 19th century which was extensively involved in entrenching British political and economic influence in Hong Kong. It also played a key role in the opium trade. Notably, Archie Chan has claimed to be \u201ca member of one of the oldest and most prominent Hong Kong families,\u201d suggesting a potential familial link to the power networks of early colonial Hong Kong, where Jardine Matheson was particularly prominent. Later, Chan\u2019s Farmington Finance Corporation relocated to St. George\u2019s House, also in Hong Kong. <br><br>Further investigation into Chan reveals that he was, until relatively recently, the executive director of Glorious Sun Enterprises. Glorious Sun Enterprises is the main company of its parent organization, the Glorious Sun Group.

This is illustrative of Charles Yeung\u2019s position within the \u201cpro-business, pro-Beijing\u201d wing of Hong Kong\u2019s ruling class. He has also been affiliated with the One Country, Two Systems Research Institute think-tank and with the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, a business-led political party that has had ties to liberal factions in the Communist Party of China.

Firstly, you haven&#039;t provided any solutions. &quot;Build a wall and genocide blacks with poisoned drugs&quot; is not a solution its just a /pol/ meme you&#039;ve been trained to parrot because you&#039;re retarded and mentally ill. Secondly, AFRICAN AMERICANS, not just people with black skin, are the number one least socioeconomically privileged group in the country. Of course Nigerians are well educated, they come from families who are rich enough to send their children to a different country to study. Thirdly, there are no black Americans who can&#039;t read that are getting into elite colleges. This is another one of your schizo delusions. Fourthly, the issue isn&#039;t simply school funding. The issue is macro socioeconomic picture. Dumping funding into a school doesn&#039;t make things better because education outcomes depend on everything from class sizes to home supports i.e. after school tutoring, having a parent in the house to assist with homework. You can&#039;t dump money into a school full of kids who have shit home lives and rotten communities and think they&#039;re going to do better. It doesn&#039;t work that way. Lastly, welfare fixes nothing. I&#039;ve never defended eternal welfare. Every study we&#039;ve ever done shows that eliminating the conditions that cause people to need welfare fixes communities, not just giving people enough money to not starve and die. It seems like you&#039;re arguing that black people are just genetically worse people but all data shows that the programs I listed before drastically improve outcomes.

The verdict came on the second day of deliberations following a trial in which the Trump Organization was accused of being complicit in a scheme by top executives to avoid paying personal income taxes on job perks such as rent-free apartments and luxury cars.

on Saturday and a further 17 were injured says growing anti-LGBTQ sentiment may have contributed to the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s different to walk down the street holding my boyfriend\u2019s hand and getting spit at (as opposed to) a politician relating a drag queen to a groomer of their children,\u201d said Nic Grzecka, the co-owner of Club Q, in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI would rather be spit on in the street than the hate get as bad as where we are today.\u201d In recent years, right-wing politicians and social media users have become increasingly hostile towards the LGBTQ community, comparing those who are open about their sexual orientation or gender identity to pedophiles by way of the phrase \u201cgroomer.\u201d In March, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, preventing some public school teachers from disclosing their sexual orientation to students. \u201cLying about our community, and making them into something they are not, creates a different type of hate,\u201d Grzecka said, whose voice, according to The Associated Press, was \u201ctinged with exhaustion.\u201d The suspect, who was subdued by heroic patrons inside the club, has not entered a plea or spoken about the incident, according to reports.", "time": 1669363881, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "club-q-owner-says-republican-rhetoric-has-pushed", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 40, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 1118113, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)05:52:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s getting so bad fags are shooting fags instead of shooting pozz loads in fags.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Someone think of the fags!</span>", "time": 1669373541, "resto": 1118108}, {"no": 1118114, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)07:00:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1118108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1118108</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;non-binary shoots up gay club</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blame republicans</span>", "time": 1669377618, "resto": 1118108}, {"no": 1118115, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)07:32:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1118108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1118108</a><br>oh sure blame the republicans for leftists pretending to be lgbt allies then using that as an excuse to violent attack and cancel people.

At its simplest level, the Hunter saga is just a potential Achilles\u2019 heel for a president they want to defeat in 2024, assuming Joe Biden runs. But that has never quite explained the manic quality of the drive to turn Hunter into the symbol and standard-bearer of the Democratic Party and of liberalism generally. It had to have something to do, I always thought, with the notion that Hunter represents the licentiousness with which conservatives associate liberals\u2014his drug use, his sketchy affair with his dead brother\u2019s wife, and now his entry into the effete and vaguely un-American Manhattan art world.<br><br>But this weekend, things got even weirder\u2014and in ways that were so sordid it took me a while to even understand what was going on.<br><br>If you had the good fortune or sense not to crawl down this particular rabbit hole over the weekend, fear not, I won\u2019t drag you into the depths that I descended. The briefest recap is this. On Friday, Elon Musk tweeted that he was going to reveal how Twitter supposedly covered up the Hunter Biden scandal in October 2020. Matt Taibbi (\u201cthe Tulsi Gabbard of Substack,\u201d as The Bulwark\u2019s Tim Miller icily dubbed him) posted some of the emails found on Hunter\u2019s hard drive. Some showed the Biden campaign asking Twitter to refrain from posting certain material.", "time": 1670353357, "resto": 1120148}, {"no": 1121446, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)14:03:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1121445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1121445</a><br>That\u2019s basically it. In some quarters of the right, this is the biggest scandal in the history of the republic, because it allegedly proves that Biden used his governmental power (a neat trick for someone who, at the time, controlled no part of the government) to set fire to the Constitution. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t a violation of the Constitution\u2019s first amendment, what is,\u201d Musk tweeted.<br><br>What this actually proves is two things about Musk. First, he is a constitutional illiterate. The First Amendment enjoins only the government from suppressing speech. During his 2020 campaign, Biden was a private citizen, so he had no means by which to violate the First Amendment at all. It also proves that Musk knows nothing about how politics and journalism work. Throughout history, media, and now social media, have gotten hold of material that might embarrass a campaign. The campaign learns of it, and the campaign pleads its case that the material is merely prurient and that publishing it would be gratuitous and not in the public interest.<br><br>Sometimes campaigns win that argument, sometimes they lose. I\u2019ve had a few of those kinds of conversations myself over the years. They can get heated. But they never have anything to do with the First Amendment. They\u2019re about exercising news judgment and defining what\u2019s in the public interest.

The New York Post reported over the summer on its actual size. You can go look that up if you wish.<br><br>So here, clearly, is still one more thing for the right to hate about Hunter. Don\u2019t laugh. Men don\u2019t talk about it much in polite company, but this is something many men think about to the point of obsession. And isn\u2019t it particularly acute among conservative men, all full of that macho swagger? Isn\u2019t that swagger a form of compensation, like that bright orange Dodge Charger the 61-year-old balding man suddenly decides he can\u2019t live without?

I am not asserting that James Comer, the incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee who has vowed to make the 118th Congress entirely about Hunter Biden, is thinking about how the first son holsters his Dillinger as he contemplates how he\u2019s going to cut him down to\u2014as it were\u2014size.

Then, in 2020, the discovery of Hunter\u2019s laptop in that Delaware shop, and its subsequent authentication, was touted as a huge scandal in and of itself. This was because most of the mainstream press was slow to acknowledge that the laptop really was Hunter\u2019s. They were slow, in other words, to follow the lead of Fox News and the New York Post and Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon. Gee, I wonder why that would be.<br><br>Yes, it is his laptop (which I personally never doubted, so I for one was not in on the big liberal media \u201ccover-up\u201d). Various reports have appeared over the subsequent two years discussing its contents.

Clearly subs operated there before. There are modern subs are quite capable of going there.<br><br>As for AIS signals for ships, it turns out that &quot;signals from AIS transponders can also be manipulated&quot;. What does that mean? Gasp! It means that of over 20 ships that went by the area perhaps some of them were not actually who they said they were. It could also be a submarine, because we know submarines have fought in the Baltic decades ago. It could be American ships that went dark, it could be Russian, it could even be someone else&#039;s ships. <br><br>So how would we know if American ships were not there? Well presumably you&#039;d try to identify all the ships to make sure, but you haven&#039;t. You just claim to know, but you haven&#039;t proven it or shown any evidence and instead have used simple and very flawed reasoning giving your argument less credibility. We know the estimated size of the dark ships is reportedly 95 to 130 meters long, we know that this fits not only some American military vessels, but also some of their attack submarines (but other ships also fit that size range).<br><br>And what is the official statement following the explosions? That NATO would &#039;increase their forces in the Baltic&#039;. Oh no, oh no, what does that mean?!

My point is that it&#039;s easy to secure a majority of votes when you deliberately disenfranchise anyone who would vote against you. Florida is going red anyways because it&#039;s the State of Denial, liberal leaning folks (such as my parents) are evacuating en masse from Florida as rich white Trumpican people buy shitty, swampy, hurricane prone lands because they can&#039;t think forward enough.
