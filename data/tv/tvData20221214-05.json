It was always weak or gave off pedo vibes. My favorite teacher was a former artillery officer in Vietnam. He was pretty chill but he had some clear rules. You do your homework or else you do it 10x extra and get put at the back of the lunch line every day for the week. And he would hit kids with a pointer stick on the hand or they could go to the principle. At Halloween he would tie one of those tootsie pop ghosts to the end of his pointer stick with a length of fishing line and he would hover the little ghost in your face and threaten you sincerely with the little ghost bobbing around. It was hilarious and you couldn&#039;t hate the guy because the rules were so cut and dry. He didn&#039;t have opinions and didn&#039;t talk about his politics or personal life. We just copied long hand notes about history, read from chapters, were required to make 15 to 20 pages of noted on each chapter and took tests after turning in our notes. If you can believe it, everyone in his class had a B or higher and nobody complained about getting hit with a ghost pop or missing lunch to complete their homework.

The phrase itself refers to the Kipling poem, while Jack uses it contextually to refer to alcohol. These are easily read together with the absent native Americans who previously inhabited the land, in a now-famliar trope about native American curses (Poltergeist).<br><br>The Kipling poem itself is taken to refer to the &quot;White man&#039;s burden&quot;, the moral task to civilize the rest of the non-white world via imperialism, colonialism, conversion to Christianity, and so forth. Alcohol is also a burden borne by white men (and many others), as Jack is an alcoholic who is &quot;on the job&quot;, and relaxing. Specifically, and in the American context, alcohol is a burden which white men are capable of shouldering (because they are civilized), while the uncivilized are not. White men can handle their liquor (never mind Jack&#039;s history, which shows the opposite). One of the major reasons for the humiliation and total defeat of the native Americans (who were &quot;repelled&quot; from the Overlook&#039;s site, cheerily noted by Ullman) is that they are almost unique in human culture in never having cultivated any sort of rot juice which generates alcohol and which gets you fucked up. It wasn&#039;t until the white man came along that they got a taste of the fire water, and that together with several other factors ruined them.<br><br>Jack is upholding himself as a member of orderly white society. The Overlook&#039;s employees, living and dead, are (mostly) white men, upholding the hotel (America/the West) itself, conquered and against the colonized. I realize that this sort of racial/colonial reading is tiresome these days, but it&#039;s unironically one of the clear subtexts in the movie. Jack styles himself as &quot;one of the good guys&quot; but of course he&#039;s scum.

The comic book wasn&#039;t made for the sake of the Oscars, Sony doesn&#039;t use the original intent behind the creation of spider-man to start spider-man projects in current day. They just make spider-man products to earn money and so the miles morales movie was petitioned.

The costumes, set pieces, and school are all beautiful and fitting for the show. However the show itself ends up looking like Hannah Montana because of the sparse color grading done to the shots. I am not saying the show needs to be heavily filtered to look dark and gloomy, but it&#039;s TOO colorful for an Addams family show, and doesn&#039;t match the theme whatsoever. <br><br>The actual camerawork itself isn&#039;t incredibly interesting, and feels, again, like that of some Disney channel daytime show like iCarly. It needs work, needs transition shots, needs more interesting camera angles and whatnot to not feel so &quot;cheap&quot;.<br><br>The show IS cheap, however, it&#039;s clearly not a big budget production. This isn&#039;t a huge issue but it shows, and I would like to see more effort in the visual style next season considering its success.<br><br>Plotwise I thought the show was fantastic. It&#039;s a mystery show where Wednesday is acting as the detective, investigating suspects for who might be killing people in the woods. During the season her relationship with her family and other people in her life are examined, and I liked that aspect a lot. I liked the scenes with her dad and uncle fester and thought everyone played their roles well.<br><br>My main issue with the plot is that I KNEW who the perpetrator was 15 minutes into the show when Thornhill is introduced with dirt on her boots right after a person is killed in the woods, it&#039;s too obvious a tell. And when we find out that Tyler is actually the Hyde, it just doesn&#039;t make that much sense - I felt like there wasn&#039;t enough proof to pin on him.<br><br>Next season I&#039;d like to see the show be more clever, where Wednesday truly solves a crime Sherlock Holmes style by considering multiple pieces of evidence critically. <br><br>Good show, watch it.", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670969309630849, "time": 1670969309, "md5": "sdTtaoKfxH5IImraixTMxA==", "fsize": 1751372, "resto": 177852931}, {"no": 177857868, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)17:11:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177853656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177853656</a><br>It&#039;s ok.

If ever Crom answered a prayer, it would be to give a man a chance to fight, as Conan acknowledges in his prayer. Valeria also says she would come back even from death to fight with Conan. It could also have been a hallucination and the man was blinded by the sun. Look at Conan&#039;s face in reaction, it&#039;s a mystery, unknowable.<br>2. It&#039;s unknown, and again perhaps unknowable. I think the inability to attain certain knowledge of the world is a theme throughout the movie. Conan&#039;s father gives his answer to what the riddle is, that only steel is reliable. One good theory I&#039;ve read is that Conan&#039;s father gets it wrong by trusting in steel, Thulsa Doom gets it wrong by concluding that the answer is that soft flesh is stronger than hard steel, but Conan realizes that true steel is in the will, and thus conquers them both. I like the theory anon poasted earlier in this thread that it&#039;s about turning your body &amp; mind into steel through hardship. Personally, I think that there paradoxically is no answer, that as steel is made strong through assaying and forging, man is made strong through adversity and specifically through seeking the answer to the riddle of steel. A man who thinks he has found the answer becomes content, as Conan&#039;s father did before Thulsa Doom, in quest of the riddle, killed him (&quot;when I was younger I sought it too&quot;), and as Thulsa Doom himself did before Conan slew him in turn. To stop seeking the riddle is to die with an (inevitably wrong) answer (&quot;if I die, I will have to go before Crom and he will ask me, &#039;what is the riddle of steel?&#039; If I don&#039;t know it, he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me&quot;), thus to live is to seek the riddle of steel and forge oneself stronger. That which does not kill me...<br>3. The sorcerer was pulling his soul back into his body, from hell? the beyond? Valhall?

Resident Evil Afterlife is, in a word, sumptious. Paul W.S. Anderson was inspired by James Cameron, purchased some very expensive 3D cameras, then pushed cinema forward.

high school and college in a scheme to lure said niggers to be players for sportsball teams. This is done so that said sportsball teams can succeed and bring in more money to their shitty post industrial city so that they can buy a bigger sportsball stadium and more fat white boomers can crowd the stands to watch sweaty sportsball playing niggers slam into each other. The purpose of white men in this scheme is to be sent off to colleges with zero economic or social support from their family, and be placed into six figures of debt from the moment they enter adulthood. For the rest of their lives they will work as wage slaves to pay off this unrecoverable debt, and what little is left will all be spent to fund the sportsball teams so that more sweaty roided-up niggers can slam into each other. Once the pretty blonde has gotten reamed out by nigger cock for a decade or two she will be paired up with some hapless white guy in a christcuck ceremony. The loser white guy will give her all his hard-earned money and be a total pushover because that is what his christcuck indoctrination of chivalry tells him to do. Once they are married in some shitty McMansion the wife&#039;s purpose is to raise more good little taxcattle boys and BBC prostitute girls while the husband&#039;s purpose is to get morbidly obese on Jewish fastfood and hand out all the little money he is allowed to keep so he can go watch sportsball with his other fat retarded boomer buddies and delight in sweaty niggers slamming into each other. Inevitably the wife will divorce him and take all his money at some point, which will be used to fund plastic surgeries so she can look hotter and fuck more niggers.

And we can look back at the infatuation with space of the 60s and 70s as a quaint nativity. We now are slowly realizing that Science itself is not the sole answer to human advancement. It has extreme limits- such as it having absolutly no say in ethics, which as Plato said was the main purpose in human civilization. The good life, as it were. Humanity, since the scientific revolution has neglected his other disciplines. Like a child that only does his math homework, sure he is good at geometry, but he sucks at biology now lol.
