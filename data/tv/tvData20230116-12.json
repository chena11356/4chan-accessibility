After a second appearance the following year in Fantastic Four Annual #2 (September 1964), the character appeared again in The Avengers #8 (published the same month), also by Lee and Kirby, which revealed that Rama-Tut had gone on to travel to the year 4000, where he had adopted the identity of Kang. A decade later, the character of Immortus, previously introduced in Avengers #10 (November 1964), was retroactively established to be a future identity of Kang&#039;s in Giant-Size Avengers #3 (February 1975).</span><br>You\u2019re just racist.

But you won&#039;t understand til you&#039;ve watched the whole thing:<br>The Perfect Getaway (by David Twohy of the Riddick movies)<br><br>The movie is on the surface a twisty, gotcha thriller. But it&#039;s actually structured like a college thesis on the Hero&#039;s Journey, but the Hero&#039;s Journey gone awry.<br><br>It turns out there are two &quot;hidden&quot; student figures included, and one hidden mentor on top of the usual. And BOTH mentor figures fail. But the up-front mentor figure turns out to have succeed with his &quot;hidden&quot; student.<br><br>Thinking of it, there may also even be another layer of mentor/student relationships. Where one hidden student turns another nascent student away from the dark path.<br><br>Best movie outside of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon to take some of the mentor/student problems of the SW movies and play them out in a non-SF (but still strange) setting. I had to wonder if this was David Twohy getting some unrealized Riddick ideas out of his system during the long hiatus after Chronicles.<br><br>The biggest lesson I took from it, was that we haven&#039;t paid enough attention to the Mentor in the Hero&#039;s Journey. We&#039;ve seen the young hero, set out on his quest, meet the mentor figure, cross over into the underworld (this is the tip-off moment in The Perfect Getaway - look out for - a near death experience where the obvious mentor saves the obvious student&#039;s life), face his dark side etc, and ultimately become a mentor himself. Spiritually this allows the mentor (who is always a semi-spectral figure - a living ghost - in this movie he has a plate in his head signifying he lives in a half living/half underworld sphere ), to &quot;ascend&quot; and in SW we see them become Force Ghosts, and Gandalf become the White etc.<br><br>But what happens if the student, cum new mentor, is evil? It seems like the spiritual ascendance of the first mentor is cancelled and he is forced to return to the fold, to fight.

It&#039;s almost always women so I guess like makeup it&#039;s an attempt to increase their attractiveness but it&#039;ll only work on someone with a double digit IQ. It&#039;s always hilarious when I see a pajeet female pounce at the first white guy she can get. Even when I&#039;m single I lie and say I&#039;m in a relationship with [insert white name] as a fuck off signal but some of my mates don&#039;t mind dipping their tips in curry. Good on them I guess but I&#039;ve seen them get so weirdly attached to the guy it&#039;s insane. I mean one from the place I used to work followed my mate to his house, shops and would even leave her house early to stalk him going to work.

starts out by saying that the contestants are retarded degenerates that didn&#039;t read anything in the contract, and have signed up to allow themselves to be hunted. they are taken out to a privately owned island in international waters and are brought to what seems like the generic love island resort bullshit lodgings, only for everybody to show up, hang out, get drunk, do their gay little interviews - and then BANG. a mustached man in a pith hat and victorian-era safari attire comes out of the bushes with a single shot hunting rifle, machete, and basic survival kit, squeezing rounds off at them. they run back into the dorm areas where they left their bags of fake silver chain necklaces and swimwear and find instead identical bags full of bargain bin survival gear. the next shot the hunter gets off this time on whoever is in his sights is no longer intended to miss and terrify but instead to grievously wound - enough for them to know its real. the hunter? also the narrator. it becomes more like a nature documentary/reality show for the hunter instead as he goes about the island, systematically picking off the participants one by one. the hunter goes on until there&#039;s 1 man and 1 woman left and they are forced at gun point to marry and consummate their union. that kind of trauma bond would be unbreakable and normalfags are scarily bloodthirsty so

I don&#039;t think the criticism of the movie is that it has no message or that there isn&#039;t any symbolism, it&#039;s that the message really isn&#039;t so deep as to require a full hour and a half movie to get across and doesn&#039;t do that much interesting stuff beyond the core premise. And no, making the point that the woman wanted him to speak so he would take the fall for any mistake while also refusing to accept any risk by speaking up for him isn&#039;t very interesting, its just another variation on the theme that they&#039;re both selfish in their marriage and unwilling to see beyond themselves.<br><br>It&#039;s a fine movie, it&#039;s just not a great one. It has things to say, but those things aren&#039;t particularly original or new and while it delivers on the core theme it doesn&#039;t offer enough beyond that.", "time": 1673858091, "resto": 179282668}, {"no": 179290581, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:35:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179284747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179284747</a><br>Almost everything he complained about too was HIS own doing.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On my only day off i watched a shitty movie</span><br>His fault for choosing such a trash movie.

Still located in the northern hemisphere of the battlestation, the much improved superlaser equipped in the second Death Star was much more powerful than its predecessor, and took only three minutes to recharge, in comparison to the 24 hour recharge required for the first Death Star&#039;s superlaser. In addition, while the first Death Star only had the capabilities to fire on very large targets, such asplanetarybodies, the improved superweapon was upgraded with additional lower-power weapon fire options and targeting systems that were more suited for fine-tuned accuracy, while still maintaining great destructive power, in order to fire the powerful weapon on enemycapital ships.
