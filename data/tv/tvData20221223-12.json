Back in the day the episodes were ~30-45 minutes, then they were ~1 hr for the longest time, and now they regularly run up to ~1.5 hours. If we assume that the discussion takes about as long to film as it ever did (which must be the case, given their previous comments about how long the BOTW days already were), then they&#039;re filling the episodes with ~+30 minutes of content that might have otherwise been left on the chopping room floor. I enjoy the show, so I don&#039;t want to complain about getting more content ... but some of the episodes (especially the Wheel/Black Spine episodes) have started to feel like they&#039;re dragging on a bit. <br><br>Speaking of the Wheel/Black Spine episodes, it also feels like they&#039;re a bit over-engineered these days. The old Wheel episodes were fun because the videos were so random and silly, and they had to make do with what they got. Episodes were shorter, so it didn&#039;t really matter if they didn&#039;t have too much to say. And if the selected video was properly shit, they could just spin/select a new one, or play a ringer tape. So many of those older episodes felt unique because of how much randomness the format allowed. The newer &quot;watch chunks of 50 fucking tapes&quot; format is probably more consistent, but it also feels so much more samey than the older episodes. I don&#039;t want to sound too negative about it - I&#039;m sure this is largely a personal taste issue, and I&#039;m still enjoying these episodes just fine.", "time": 1671778241, "resto": 178219153}, {"no": 178239651, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)02:14:55", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "844C29FB-08EB-48B8-B951-74E173F03D91", "ext": ".gif", "w": 436, "h": 359, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1671779695946547, "time": 1671779695, "md5": "MjD2eAb0t9NBj+aBaJDJCA==", "fsize": 3292668, "resto": 178219153}, {"no": 178240107, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)02:34:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178219153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178219153</a><br>Nu-Rich has grown on me.

But for each of the three characters, taking the film by itself and ignorning we book, we do not have absolute proof for any of them. I&#039;m talking about the overnight clerk at the second (Del Rio?) motel, &quot;Accounting&quot;, this guy, and of course Carla Jean.<br><br>1) For the Del Rio clerk, we can hear the soft THUNK noise of Anton&#039;s shotgun suppressor, a moment before he stands in front of Llewelyn&#039;s second-floor room. As Llewelyn escapes, he sees a glimpse of the clerk&#039;s shoe or something, motionless. In the end, the other sherrif tells Ed Tom that the man was &quot;shot&quot;, but without confirming the kill in his language. All signs point to the clerk being dead, but there&#039;s a slight gap on this one.<br><br>2) Accounting was probably killed. He literally sees Anton, even gets a good look at his face, and they both know it. Anton wants to be careful not to leave traces (hence fucking with the gas station clerk, which ironically leaves even more of a trace of himself). Also Anton is pissed with this drug company and has some emotional reason to take out more of their people, like he took out the other two guys at the initial crime scene. But again, it&#039;s not certain.<br><br>3) Then Carla Jean. All signs point to her being killed, yes (Anton following up his promise, checking his shoes), but it wasn&#039;t shown on screen. This is enough to give a slight ambiguity, &quot;we don&#039;t know for certain&quot;, but the most obvious inference is that she is killed like the others.<br><br>If you&#039;re an otherwise-uninvolved clerk and you get Anton, you might live or die depending on the timing and circumstances.

If I had designed the Aliens luxury chess set, I would lay out White&#039;s side as follows:<br><br>King: Newt (the most important piece, the whole objective of the game/mission, the one piece that must be protected at all costs. She can crawl easily from place to place, adjacent squares.)<br>Queen: Ripley. Emerges as the most powerful piece of the group as the game/movie develops.<br>Bishops: Bishop (of course) and Gorman. Displaying both the pros and cons of the piece type. Capable of moving in a straight line (bishop crawls a straight line of pipe for several hundred feet, an important move in the movie&#039;s game).<br>Knights: Drake and Vasquez. Useful point-tactical pieces.<br>Rooks: Apone (as the rook starting on a1), and Hicks (as the rook starting on h1). The actual powerful, capable soldiers.<br><br>This leaves us with a group of rank-and-file pawns, and we can approximate an amusing alliteration:<br><br>a-pawn: Wierzbowski: a barely-seen guy hangs out on one side.<br>b-pawn: Burke. Just kinda hangs out, off to the side.<br>c-pawn: Crowe, Often, one of the first to be captured in a game.<br>d-pawn: Dietrich, see above.<br>e-pawn: Frost, see above. Close to the f-pawn.<br>f-pawn: Ferro, see above.<br>g-pawn: Spunkmeyer, see above. These two might occupy the section of the board leading to fool&#039;s mate.<br>h-pawn: Hudson (fitting that this coward should occupy a weak position at the edge of the board!)<br><br>For Black&#039;s side there are roughly six &quot;types&quot; of fighters, so Queen = Queen, pawn = egg, knight=facehugger, bishop=chestburster, rook=adult.

See what movie this epic 4chan meme is being applied to today. Most of the time it&#039;s the older Sam Raimi Spiderman movies but since these threads die very fast the guys that force this apply it to other movies now. This thread however uses the Raimi Spiderman meme. Please pay attention.<br><br>Step 2: Take an iconic scene in the movie, any will do as long as people remember the scene. Greentext a quote from the scene and twist the words to use anti semitisim, racism, homophobia or any other edgy as fuck topic. Go nuts, the sky is the limit! The more vulgar it is the more epic the meme is. This takes us to the final step.....<br><br>Step 3: Make a regular post, taking the position of a normal person and pretend to be disgusted by that scene. I know, I know, this is 4chan, a site where gore flows like fine wine but that&#039;s what makes this meme edgy, wacky and zany. We pretend to be offended by that fake scene. Funny huh?<br><br>Now that you understand how to do this, have fun kids.

This movie has no 3rd act. I still liked it as much as the first one, the effects are worth it and the visual presentation of the film is better than anything else out there. If this were done under a different director and team, it would not come off as this good. Also, I like the new Navi characters. The disappointment that I had with the film was Quaritch and the other human characters. Somehow they&#039;re even more cliche and cringe in this one than the first, which I expected Cameron to improve on in this film but he didn&#039;t. The standout theme of the film is the whole Sully family thing and the spiritual aspects of Pandora and Navi culture. You want to know what makes this different from Dances with Wolves and Last Samurai? Featherheads and Nips exists, but blue ayyliums don&#039;t, so they have a lot more creative freedom in expressing the artistic vision with this movie. The franchise has earned its right to exist.
