First, patrilineal corporate kin groups produce high levels of Y-chromosomal homogeneity within each social group due to common descent, as well as high levels of between-group variation. Second, the presence of such groups results in violent intergroup competition preferentially taking place between members of male descent groups, instead of between unrelated individuals. Casualties from intergroup competition then tend to cluster among related males, and group extinction is effectively the extinction of lineages.<br><br>There is evidence that other analogous situations involving gene-culture hitchhiking in culturally-defined social groups may have affected genetic diversity. Central Asian pastoralists, who are organized into patriclans, have high levels of intergroup competition and demonstrate ethnolinguistic and population-genetic turnover down into the historical period59. They also have a markedly lower diversity in Y-chromosomal lineages than nearby agriculturalists42,60. In fact, Central Asians are the only population whose male effective population size has not recovered from the post-Neolithic bottleneck; it remains disproportionately reduced, compared to female estimates using mtDNA4.

Indeed, there&#039;s a strong argument to be made that the original movie only works if Deckard himself is human and not a replicant, since that heightens the divide between himself and the non-humans he hunts. That&#039;s the entire point of the fucking film, asking us what exactly it is to be human, ultimately deciding that it is our acts, our good acts, that gives us our humanity. 2049 then goes on to poke fun at the Deckard-Replicant/Human argument with the dog, without realising that it&#039;s own plot requires him to be a replicant.

To maintain the mission, the Soong-breed android Data Soong faked continued orders from Unifleet, keeping the crew in the dark about losing their nation.<br><br>By 1,007,260, Soong had realized that he was stuck as the only corporeal being among a crew of holograms, and that he would be stuck like that for eternity. Soong locked himself into his quarters, began genetic engineering of his cats and focused on artistic pursuits.

I watched one called The Fallen Knight that removed a good chunk of the jokes, Finn and Rose&#039;s arc and Holdo, focusing it on Rey, Luke and Kylo.

Kylo should have returned to being Ben (although I thought this was done nicely in ROS, it&#039;s a tender moment when Rey heals him) but Rey&#039;s sith nature comes out and she goes bad. Then ironically Rey is the villain and Kylo needs to stop her. At the end, Kylo, Finn and Friends manage to exorcise the Sith from her and she returns to normal, Kylo sacrificing himself to do so.

Here are the memories of Elvis&#039; stepbrother:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The minute I walked in there, I knew. &quot;You son of a bitch,&quot; I yelled. Elvis was lying there, with pills and empty syringes all around, and I had no doubt what had happened. None. And it just pissed me off. It hurt, but it made me mad, too. Damn it, Elvis! But I didn&#039;t spend a lot of time hurting right away, because it was so instilled in me to take care of business. And that&#039;s what I did, picking up syringes, picking up the pills. And I&#039;ve gotten a lot of heat for that. Geraldo Rivera said that&#039;s obstruction of justice. But I didn&#039;t care. All I knew was there was an ambulance crew fixing to walk through that door and there&#039;s stuff lying all over the place, and I had to clean this place up now. So I grabbed everything I could and stuffed it in my pocket and then moved over to Elvis. He was lying face down, kind of all curled up. We turned him over and his eyes were rolled back in his head. His face was blue, bloated, and his tongue was sticking out of his mouth, black, and half bitten off. He was gone.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joe Esposito, Al Strada, Billy Smith, Charlie Hodge and I were standing in a waiting room while all the efforts were being made to revive Elvis. A doctor came in and Joe asked, &quot;How long has Elvis been without oxygen?&quot; The doctor&#039;s response was too long in coming. Joe said, &quot;I guess we should hope he&#039;s gone, otherwise he would just be a living vegetable.&quot; Moments later Dr. Nick walked in the room and just lowered his head. We already knew, but Elvis was officially pronounced dead. At that moment time stood still. My mind flashed back to that November 22nd day when President John F. Kennedy died. Family and friends much like us were the first to hear the news that would forever be inscribed in the minds of the whole world.</span><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMm<wbr>pN6eETP8", "filename": "The Rock And Roll Book Of The Dead", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 641, "h": 517, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674115057543659, "time": 1674115057, "md5": "c3fb5gcNjXw2ZBu1nT0wIw==", "fsize": 117973, "resto": 179411286}, {"no": 179433080, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)02:59:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179432911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179432911</a><br>Why did Keith do it?", "time": 1674115156, "resto": 179411286}, {"no": 179433083, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)02:59:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179432911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179432911</a><br>Saw them live once.

Rape scenes in movies are meant to be traumatic experience for both the viewer and the character. so you can&#039;t and shouldn&#039;t sexualize the rape scene because it isn&#039;t a pornography.<br><br>general rule of thumb is that if you make a rape scene that ended up being something so sexual and erotic. to the point where it&#039;s hot instead of traumatizing. you fucked it up and failed as a director.<br><br>Good rape scene should be something like Irreversible by Gaspar Noe. people always say that edgy. but I think Gaspar Noe did it right. In that scene, the scene holds for 9 mins, and it&#039;s that long to shock the audience. and the fact that you barely see her face close-up when she&#039;s being raped. the audience find it hard to sexualize the scene. which is something very important for this kind of scene. while it&#039;s true that degenerates will jerk off to anything.

The film returned to movie theaters in 2020 following its 4K restoration. Some of the screenings were cancelled with the initiative taken by my aforementioned colleague or other conscientious film people. Although you can find this interview in the DVD commentary and in Jodorowsky\u2019s book, I wonder how no one paid any attention to this \u2018detail\u2019 until recently.[1] Jodorowsky made a statement following the cancellation of a screening in New York. He claimed that he did not rape [her]; that his intention at the time of the interview was to provoke people; and he acknowledged what he had done as problematic. Let\u2019s say he did not \u201creally\u201d rape her and he is remorseful for underestimating \u201crape\u201d. What are we to do with his assertion that Mara Lorenzio was healed through rape? Or the fact that he attributed the female character\u2019s inability to reach an orgasm to her refusal of male sexuality? Or that he denied Lorenzio her power by exhibiting that he is not hurt while being beaten up by her. Following that, the rape is \u201creal\u201d-ized amidst her desolation. He is deceiving us by idealizing arts as holy and curative while maneuvering the space between fiction and reality. Isn\u2019t he playing a wretched game, with the psyche of a woman who has expressed that she had been raped before, for the sake of his art and capacity to heal someone else? Then, there is the sophistry around raping a woman until she reaches orgasm.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A surrealist director can compound the reality of his life (and in this case, his co-starring son\u2019s life) with the reality of cinema. With the ego of a healer/guru, he can believe that he is the sole creator of reality, too. It might suit someone perceived as the sole creator of a film to intentionally blur the boundary between fiction and reality. But when the blurred boundaries of art violate someone else\u2019s reality and body, the validity and reality of \u201cconsent\u201d becomes questionable.</span>", "time": 1674130025, "resto": 179432765}, {"no": 179439051, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:07:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179432765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179432765</a><br>is this peepee in vagina or peepee in poopoo?", "time": 1674130043, "resto": 179432765}, {"no": 179439089, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:08:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179436058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179436058</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;better than a close up of the guy&#039;s face</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what else is there supposed to be a close up on exactly?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blanket denial of the intention behind the choice</span><br>ur the rapist", "time": 1674130114, "resto": 179432765}, {"no": 179439096, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:08:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179439026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179439026</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;showing penetration = porn</span><br>?", "time": 1674130130, "resto": 179432765}, {"no": 179439151, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:11:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179438295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179438295</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rape is a traumatic experience. and again, it shouldn&#039;t be anything else.</span><br>woosh", "time": 1674130280, "resto": 179432765}, {"no": 179439182, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:12:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179432865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179432865</a><br>Women unironically enjoy rape.<br>When my wife and I were dating, I accidentally raped her (we were fooling around, I had been drinking a bit and mistook her protests as a bit of banter, and I ended up fucking the shit out of her while she halfheartedly tried to push me off).
