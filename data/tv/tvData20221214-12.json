They&#039;re hired because they&#039;re part of their clique, or to fill a quota, or because they share their ideology, or in some cases, seemingly specifically because they&#039;re ugly. They&#039;re charisma voids, they can&#039;t act, they&#039;re not attractive. It&#039;s like the various d-list comedians suddenly getting major roles in MCU movies. Saying &quot;We&#039;re not stars because they&#039;re marvel movies&quot; is 100% cops. The Mask made Jim Carrey a star, Michael Keaton was virtually unknown before Batman, Christopher Reeve is synonymous with Superman. The difference is those were good actors in good movies. MCU movies are products. They hire unknowns who share their ideology and to check boxes, so then of course when people don&#039;t genuinely like the movie and the actors are genuinely terrible, they don&#039;t become stars.

Humanity had a hope that space would reap some great advancement. Star Trek, 2001, star wars, etc. All had this great incredible hope in space travel. It has died significantly in recent years. And we can look back at the infatuation with space of the 60s and 70s as a quaint nativity. We now are slowly realizing that Science itself is not the sole answer to human advancement. It has extreme limits- such as it having absolutly no say in ethics, which as Plato said was the main purpose in human civilization. The good life, as it were. Humanity, since the scientific revolution has neglected his other disciplines. Like a child that only does his math homework, sure he is good at geometry, but he sucks at biology now lol. Science is good at revealing nature, but it has a stern limit.<br>Anyway, like the hope of space travel 2001 is stupid and a lie.", "time": 1670984706, "resto": 177865088}, {"no": 177865937, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)21:28:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177865088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177865088</a><br><br>As I&#039;ve aged, I have uniroincally come to appreciate The Dawn of Man as an excellent part of the film, equal to the rest.

Then again adults can also relate to spongebob, and especially squidward since they live the doomer wagie life. <br><br>emplemon made a good video on the the spongebob squidward dynamic for any fellow spongebob enjoyer anons out there<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYu<wbr>7Y52iiYI", "time": 1670988642, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177867952, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:31:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The fine dining and breathing episode<br><br>and the spongebob taking gary a bath<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk7<wbr>sWrZPOBA", "time": 1670988702, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177867959, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:31:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177867194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177867194</a><br>I don&#039;t get it...", "time": 1670988716, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177867977, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:32:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I SOILED THE GOOD KRUSTY KRAB NAME<br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT", "time": 1670988746, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177867982, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:32:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEv<wbr>gNY6Pkvg<br><br>tis the season", "time": 1670988752, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177868024, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:33:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s not my wallet.", "filename": "9a1a9e88-c7f4-4700-9c46-4b8ed0c93a98_1024[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 542, "h": 542, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670988829760594, "time": 1670988829, "md5": "ZQxQkKMNkOZp53+Zu5iePQ==", "fsize": 38284, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177868035, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:34:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177867164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177867164</a><br>Mother of Pearl never have I seen such a masterpiece says I", "time": 1670988851, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177868204, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:39:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Probably when Spongebob references Julien Donkey Boy<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG4<wbr>-xPRrxxw", "time": 1670989163, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177868222, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:39:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;say again deputy</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THE MANIAC IS IN THE MAILBOX</span><br><br>AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH", "time": 1670989198, "resto": 177864528}, {"no": 177868263, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:41:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177864885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177864885</a><br>This.

When I was 8 there was this girl, also 8 who lived in an apartment across from mine. There was a swimming pool in the middle of the apartments. She was pale with dark hair, either white or half white half hispanic as her mom was a redhead. One day after school we saw her sitting outside her apartment crying, she&#039;d been locked out for some reason. My mom felt bad, so we took her with us to get some pizza so she wouldn&#039;t be alone for a couple hours. When we got back, she asked if I would go out with her, but I pretended I didn&#039;t know what she meant because I found her kind of off-putting. It feels weird to say in retrospect but I kind of saw her as a slut and suspected she must be doing stuff with all the boys in the neighborhood, though they kinda didn&#039;t like her either. I thought this because she was always taking off her shirt to show off her nipples. It was this weird pull for me of &quot;You shouldn&#039;t be doing that.&quot; against &quot;I kinda wanna look though.&quot; I remember thinking even then someone&#039;s probably molesting her, even if I didn&#039;t fully understand the implications of that. She&#039;d always claim her mother was a prostitute and that she brought a lot of guys home and they watched a lot of dirty movies. She&#039;d always want me to watch her strip and invite me to watch her take a shower. One time she wanted to play a game where we each closed our eyes and the other could do whatever they wanted to them.

When stopped and questioned, he told police that he was on his way to check on an address in a neighboring town ahead of an audition the following morning with a young singer named Cheryl Johnson. However, both the phone number he gave police and Cheryl Johnson turned out to be fictitious.[6]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two days later, on May 24, the nude body of 27-year-old Nathaniel Cater, who had been missing for four days and was last seen with Williams, was discovered in the river. The medical examiner ruled he had died of probable asphyxia but never specifically said he had been strangled. Police thought that Williams had killed Cater and that his body was the source of the sound they heard as his car crossed the bridge.[7]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Williams failed three polygraph tests. Hairs and fibers retrieved from the body of another victim, Jimmy Ray Payne, were found to be consistent with those from his home, car, and dog. Co-workers told police they had seen Williams with scratches on his face and arms around the time of the murders which, investigators surmised, could have been inflicted by victims during struggles.[7] Williams held a press conference outside his home to proclaim his innocence, volunteering that he had failed the polygraph tests, which would have been inadmissible in court.[8]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Williams was questioned again by police for 12 hours on June 3 and 4 at FBI headquarters and released without arrest or charge, but remained under surveillance.[9]</span>", "filename": "nonfictionserialkiller", "ext": ".png", "w": 145, "h": 191, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671010838324390, "time": 1671010838, "md5": "uaJx21C8rpVsKVymVJo3Kg==", "fsize": 39216, "resto": 177875760}, {"no": 177876419, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)04:41:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177875903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177875903</a><br>Yes but the killer was morally white.", "time": 1671010909, "resto": 177875760}, {"no": 177876484, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)04:45:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177876402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177876402</a><br>cont&#039;d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Arrest and trial</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Williams was arrested on June 21, 1981, for the murders of Cater and Payne.[10] His trial began on January 6, 1982, in Fulton County. During the two-month trial, prosecutors matched to a number of victims 19 sources of fibers from Williams&#039;s home and car: his bedspread, bathroom, gloves, clothes, carpets, dog, and an unusual trilobal carpet fiber. Other evidence included witness testimony that placed Williams with several victims while they were alive, and inconsistencies in his accounts of his whereabouts.[11] Williams took the stand in his own defense but alienated the jury by becoming angry and combative.[11] After 12 hours of deliberation, the jury found him guilty on February 27 of the murders of Cater and Payne. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.[12] After Williams became a suspect, the killings stopped.[2]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the late 1990s, Williams filed a habeas corpus petition and requested a retrial. Butts County Superior Court judge Hal Craig denied his appeal. Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker said that &quot;although this does not end the appeal process, I am pleased with the results in the habeas case&quot; and that his office will &quot;continue to do everything possible to uphold the conviction.&quot;[13] In early 2004, Williams sought a retrial again, with his attorneys arguing that law enforcement officials covered up evidence of involvement by the Ku Klux Klan, and that carpet fibers purportedly linking him to the crimes would not stand up to scientific scrutiny.[14] A federal judge rejected the request for retrial on October 17, 2006.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aftermath</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Williams was never tried for any of the Atlanta Child Murders.
