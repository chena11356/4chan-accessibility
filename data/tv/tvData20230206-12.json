Then there&#039;s a the poisoned well of Abby being called a tranny when there is another actual fucking tranny hanging out with her so that compounded by a number of other Abby topics results in no one taking critiques to Pt2 seriously, and all that discourse is going to bubble up again in a few years time with Season 2, and then again with Pt3 because Druckmann won&#039;t let this franchise end.", "filename": "1652842127447", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1152, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675679532731213, "time": 1675679532, "md5": "VAeoJTVfNaUOk2eLT+JyXA==", "fsize": 196050, "resto": 180231363}, {"no": 180235578, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:32:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180231457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180231457</a><br>not my problem", "time": 1675679539, "resto": 180231363}, {"no": 180235591, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:32:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180234692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180234692</a><br>Why is everything so fucking gay?", "time": 1675679560, "resto": 180231363}, {"no": 180235653, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:35:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180235573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180235573</a><br>The self aggrandizing makes me sick", "time": 1675679721, "resto": 180231363}, {"no": 180235851, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:43:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180235591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180235591</a><br>It&#039;s literally gayer than 10 guys sucking 11 guys dicks", "time": 1675680201, "resto": 180231363}, {"no": 180235873, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:44:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180231457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180231457</a><br>Imagine how humiliated that mother was that her son displayed homophobic tendencies while she was trying to virtue signal.

The only good &quot;character arcs&quot; were the ones lifted from history. Verenus was a good character, stern but upright, until whispering about his cuckoldry became the kink that made Julius Caeser&#039;s assassination possible. From there to the wife&#039;s suicide to the children banishment to the black-shirt &quot;I am the son of hades fear me!&quot; tavern to the sister-in-law runaway to the children rescue to &quot;my father saved us so I hate him and want him dead please have sex with me, sexy doll maker&quot; to literally just fuck all that. All of it. Octavian was oddly written throughout, jumping from meek pushover to bold master tactician between scenes, then after the timeskip he solidifies as an absolute waste of screentime. The House Brutus woman I can&#039;t remember the name of going full psychopath over Julius doing his job was even more ridiculous, and she became less bearable the longer she stayed alive, until the jew mysteriously decided that the psychopath being abused is too far, even though all the innocents he murdered, tortured, and raped was fine.<br><br>The good ones were the ones from history. Mark Anthony, Cicero, Julius. Pullo had good moments, but also a lot of bad ones, especially when they wanted him to play the part of &quot;simpleton&quot; instead of &quot;simple man&quot; without any real consistency.<br><br>I liked the show a lot, but the second season practically feels like a fever dream with how poorly all those character arcs go in it. Even Anthony, a pillar of the show, becomes a drunk idiot by the end once the writers liberally tweak history for his demise.

He once took me on a luxurious trip aboard the most majestic vessel created by man. A great man of many virtues and success, he used to pamper me and shower me with expensive gifts, basically treating me like a Queen. Oh, he loved me so very dearly and with utter loyalty, this made me hate his guts and thus I was even considering suicide just to escape from his kindness and affection. I showed him how grateful I was by cheating on him with a poor lower-class bum, who hadn&#039;t taken a bath in month and had achieved nothing of worth in his entire life. After spreading my legs for him, I watched him die horribly in freezing water, from the comfort of a piece of wood that had room for two but that I kept only for myself. I&#039;m telling you this, because even though I&#039;ve only known this bum for a couple of days and I now have a loyal husband, loving children and grandchildren, even to this day, the thrill of cheating with a dirty no-gooder just to spite Cal and watching the life escape from his eyes as his body shut down from agonizing hypothermia is still the best memory of my life and still gives my old vagina shivering tingles. I stole one of Cal&#039;s most valuable diamond necklaces, but not before leaving him a gratuitous letter filled with poisonous insults, and after we made it back to shore, I never talked to him again. Cal killed himself shortly afterwards due to financial distress. Although the diamond necklace is still to this day worth an immense fortune and holds significant historical value for you, I just threw it in the ocean on a whim 5 minutes ago. Did you know it belonged to the great King Louis XVI? I can&#039;t imagine the trouble Cal went through just to obtain it for me.
