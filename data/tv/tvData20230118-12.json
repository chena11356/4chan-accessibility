Behaving with each other like decent humans, wary of each other.<br>2) Jake&#039;s first flight, a straightforward coming-of-age. Making the consciousness-link idea perfectly clear (shut up and fly straight!)<br>3) Neytiri saving Jake. She is confronted with this ugly little pink body which she has every right to hate, and she doesn&#039;t. The power of love unironically wins out over hate, and this is the fantasy. She knows who he is/sees him, and what he just did.<br><br>Jake&#039;s original three-month timeline is suggestive of many things. This is just enough time to have a summer vacation. This is just enough time to get a basic idea of what another country is like in some detail.

He has important time alone, develops a relationship with an important helper. I had difficulty distinguishing the brothers on the first pass.<br><br>I found the first few minutes of the film cringey in places, especially the Sears catalogue family photo, but the chaste family cuddling created an idyll which would of course be interrupted. The idea of the happy couple playfully having &quot;date night&quot; on their steeds was also communicated well. I tolerated this well because I knew how the original made me feel once I got into it, and sure enough in the back half of the sequel, I was holding back tears at a few simple places.

And even though you could make a credible argument for Avengers: Infinity War being the Empire Strikes Back of our generation, I still think of the Avatar franchise as being the TRUE successor to the REAL Star Wars franchise (AKA the pre-Disney Star Wars franchise, which sadly died in 2012). By the way, the Avatar franchise and the pre-Disney Star Wars franchise have some similarities. First of all, the first Star Wars movie from 1977 and the first Avatar movie both became the highest-grossing movie of all time (with the first Avatar movie still being the highest-grossing movie of all time even to this day) and both movies were under 20th Century Fox when they came out (although now they&#039;re under Disney, unfortunately). Also, the first Star Wars movie from 1977 is what inspired Cameron to become a film-maker in the first place. Furthermore, Star Wars and Avatar are both science fantasy/space opera franchises.

They drive off into an uncertain future.<br><br>The second movie would be the 2036 plotline. But heavily streamlined and with a lot of Jade being a wanker trimmed out. Her idiotic decision to bring a live zombie onboard the ship, cut it. Restructure the third act so that Umbrella arrive as she&#039;s completing her research, and she gets dragged out to go meet them. Entirely cut the retarded plotline about Bea going to the shore and Jade somehow forgetting she told Bea to do that. It&#039;s not entirely illogical but it&#039;s stupid. Move the piano recital from the middle to the end. So the boat leaves, Billie escapes on a helicopter chased by the giant croc, and then Jade and the others sail away on the ship. By moving a few scenes from earlier in the show, we can craft an ending that is a bit more satisfactory for something that will never get a sequel.

This was a sticking point from day 1. It&#039;s why Alice is the star and not Jill.

That&#039;s a major reason why no Capcom characters appear in the first movie. Consequently, ever RE film has script approval from Capcom in regards to characters.

The actual films with quality issues are Apocalypse (2) and The Final Chapter (6). Apocalypse&#039;s problems stemmed from a new director stepping in and doing a poor job. Final Chapter&#039;s problems stem from shit going very wrong behind the scenes, from budget to on-set accidents to very hasty rewrites. Even delaying shooting an entire year because Milla was pregnant, and shifting the shooting location from Canada to South Africa had impacts. The first film is great, the third is very stylish, and generally it&#039;s a bit hit and miss, but slightly more hit than miss. The Alien franchise doesn&#039;t fare much better. And The Final Chapter is basically the Alien 3 of RE films, copying plot points and motifs from Alien 3, and having its own behind the scenes drama.<br><br>Where it gets really interesting is what happened to Welcome to Racoon City. Johannes Roberts did an okayish job, but the film falls short, and budget seems to be a major problem. Shooting an RE film for 25 million is nuts.

Loved the soundtrack too, one of DP&#039;s best albums - I was a huge fan of Daft Punk in the 90&#039;s/early 2000&#039;s they were the first musical group that I had discovered myself. The aesthetic of the movie is amazing, and looks exactly what I wanted it to look like when imagining a modern Tron reboot.<br><br>However, in terms of script/character and plot, it was a little disappointing. I think Hedlund was poorly cast or his character in the script wasn&#039;t very sympathetic, for example his stunt at the beginning came off less as getting back at the company and doing something philanthropic, and more that he was just a shithead with no father figure or impulse control. I understood that matter could be digitized but it didn&#039;t make sense how CLU would materialize into the real world with his troops, tanks and ships the other way around, there was literally 0 explanation of how that would happen, they just took it for granted that audiences would understand this vague nonsensical threat. It would have made sense that with Flynn&#039;s disc, he would materialize as Flynn himself since he was his copy, using his trapped matter - and perhaps thats how Quorra was able to materialize, as Flynn&#039;s trapped matter would be restructured and spit out as Quorra? Also wanted a more progressive, rather than abrupt Tron redemption, and his face to be shown &amp; turn blue before he suicide crashed into CLU<br><br>I&#039;m definitely overthinking a Disney movie, but these explorations of the digital world vs the real world and the duality between Flynn&#039;s &quot;In there, there&#039;s a new world&quot; and CLU&#039;s &quot;Out there, there&#039;s a new world&quot; was really interesting to me.

Compared to the shit you get today generally it&#039;s Shakespeare, but compared to the era it&#039;s a little anemic. Also sorry to Boxleinerfags but I&#039;ve always found that guy the dramatic equivalent of beige. He&#039;s perfectly serviceable, nothing wrong with him, but nothing that interesting about him either. Always thought it weird Tron was the title character considering what that character actually does in the film too, or more to the point, doesn&#039;t do.

Not disliked, not a box office failure or anything, but both of these films in some way turned out to be not the droids the studio were looking for.<br><br>I love the characters generally in the old one, and Warner was the fucking shit. I would have loved to see the MCP and maybe Sark updated, but I can see what they were going for here and why they were not recreated.<br><br>If asked to update the Tron aesthetic myself I doubt I would have thought to go with the more simplified look, so I was impressed by that right out the gate.

Michael here.<br>In my latest video, I revealed that in 2014, I was in a meeting with President Obama. &quot;President&quot; is a title for life, even after your presidential position has passed. So it would still be accurate to call Barack Hussein Obama, Present Obama. But he is no longer THE President... right? The current officially recognised president is Joseph Robinette Biden, who served as Vice President to Obama during his first and second terms. But is President Biden making any presidential decisions? Well... not likely... Biden&#039;s mental deterioration has become increasingly apparent, even with the government&#039;s best efforts to mask it. So... who is making the decisions? Given that Obama&#039;s administration still sits in the white house, many people refer to this period as Obama&#039;s third and fourth term. It&#039;s plausible that President Obama is still.... President Obama.<br>So, what was discussed at this meeting I was in? Well, it could have something to do with a video I uploaded in 2021, at the start of Obama&#039;s &quot;third&quot; term, and during the COVID-19 fear campaign, spearheaded by Bill Gates among others. The video in question was made in partnership with Bill Gates, in which I repeated his rhetoric, and I even shilled his book, &quot;how to avoid climate disaster&quot;. I spoke about the unproven idea that our contribution to gasses such as CO2 are causing increased natural disasters as if was fact. I even said that humans NEED to produce 0% of such gasses... which would imply we should stop breathing... and die. In fact, even that would not satisfy this goal, as our decaying bodies would still produce gas.<br>You may have noticed around this time, other popular youtubers also shilled this exact book. Was this all coincidence? Or was this evidence of the hand of Bill Gates, and the Obama administration, reaching out to young audiences on the internet through popular influencers? We may never know...<br>And as always... thanks for watching.", "filename": "1672589646359", "ext": ".png", "w": 502, "h": 655, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674042486847542, "time": 1674042486, "md5": "yRWh/XadFtl3CBAgoro7GA==", "fsize": 263360, "resto": 179390203}, {"no": 179392337, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)06:48:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179391711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179391711</a><br>Finasteride or other hair loss solutions and some cheap hair dye", "time": 1674042510, "resto": 179390203}, {"no": 179392401, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)06:50:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179390375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179390375</a><br>this is fake news he carried the entire team", "time": 1674042657, "resto": 179390203}, {"no": 179392487, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)06:54:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hey guys I found this interesting subject I flew half way across the world to show you.

The adaptation is being produced by Sony Pictures Television and Amazon Studios in association with PlayStation Productions, and it will premiere on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. It is being written by Fergus and Ostby, with Judkins serving as showrunner, who will all also be executive producers. Other executive producers include Santa Monica Studio&#039;s Creative Director Cory Barlog, PlayStation Productions&#039; Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan, Santa Monica Studio&#039;s Yumi Yang, and Vertigo Entertainment&#039;s Roy Lee.
