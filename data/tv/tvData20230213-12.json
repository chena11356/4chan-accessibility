Considering Gedmund doesn&#039;t know a single thing about ships it was really Ned Bean who would be actually in command. There&#039;s some roles I would give him considering his ability, allegiances and geographic position. He&#039;d initially be pro Westerosi during the Stepstones conflict but switches sides to the Triarchy. He chose to betray them outright from within by injuring Corlys and killing Dalton&#039;s uncle along with some other men. Dalton gets some revenge but Ned Bean makes it out alive. Now that he&#039;s part of the Triarchy he&#039;d probably be part of the Battle of the Gullet. Maybe even being one of the guys who kill Jacerys. He&#039;d return to Essos with Sharako Lohar, participate in part of the Daughter&#039;s War before ending up part of the Anti Braavos side. Unwin gets him when he became Hand around the same time he hired his personal guard made of sellswords or maybe Ned was referral from a guy like Tessario. This is when he becomes second in command of the Royal Fleet. He basically does nothing at Tarth because Gedmund is waiting for orders whilst Alyn sneaks out stealing his ships back and winning at the Stepstones.<br>Ned would stay with Gedmund at the Gullet incase of a Braavosi attack which never came whilst Alyn goes to deal with Dalton. The Royal Fleet was also not used at the Battle for Gulltown. The fall of House Rogare occured during which 9/10 of the ships of Rogare were lost, probably due to attacks, whilst he was escaping the narrow sea. Considering Ned Bean is at the Gullet and Unwin wanted to destroy the Rogares he could be the culprit. When Alyn returned he was named Master of Ships, displacing Gedmund. That&#039;s when we can kill of Ned Bean, but after the secret siege Gedmund is put back as Master of Ships. Since Alyn wasn&#039;t mad anymore I&#039;m guessing his real problem was with Ned Bean who was already dealt with. That&#039;s at least how I saw the events.

He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany.[122] But he and many of the project staff were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view.[123] He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned.[124] In October 1945, Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S. Truman. The meeting went badly after Oppenheimer said he felt he had &quot;blood on my hands&quot;. The remark infuriated Truman and put an end to the meeting.

She didn&#039;t seem a credible threat in the previous episode so I thought they&#039;d give her a dedicated scene or have someone comment on her ascent to power. Turns out she&#039;s just the previous leader&#039;s brother and the ruthlessness born out of her desire for revenge kept her in that position. She doesn&#039;t do anything in either episode besides being angry and cold, doesn&#039;t fire a gun, doesn&#039;t outsmart anyone, doesn&#039;t give lifesaving orders or think out some form of plan. If it weren&#039;t for Tommy&#039;s VA hyping her up with his blind obedience, anyone would be wondering why anyone would be following her.<br><br>Just one cold open with a scene showing taking power or doing anything leadership related would have probably fixed this. During both episodes her character felt forced and the parallel drawn in her speech to Sam with Joel&#039;s endgame decision only amplifies this. I say this as someone who&#039;s enjoyed both games and the series so far, but with the Bill episode having wasted so much time on side-characters that contribute almost nothing to the main pair, if they still insist on doing the whole of the first game in one season they better have something special up their sleeve or the Joel/Ellie relationship won&#039;t ever be fully realized. There&#039;s only 4 episodes left, one of which is fully Left Behind, so that&#039;s next episode for the Tommy stuff, one for Left Behind, one for Ellie solo content and then the lab.

"Synopsis for next episode is strongly foreboding that things will get dramatic again at some point, because I think Jazz melting down over something like this is a symptom of his dysfunctional relationship with Jeanette, and there is no possible resolution to it in sight. <br><br>My theory is that Jazz has an internalized version of Jeanette inside his head that tyrannizes him, leading to more meltdowns / nonfunctional behavior. Even when the real Jeanette relents to a decision and says she&#039;s okay with it, the internalized version of Jeanette still shuts Jazz down. So that is why when the actual Jeanette &quot;relented&quot; as it says in the episode synopsis, Jazz&#039;s anxiety escalated. <br><br>Jazz has a history of going to therapists, but if this sort of dysfunction is still a thing it means no therapist she&#039;s been to was a worth a damn, and it&#039;s just pill pusher hacks trying to mask symptoms. One of the therapists is Debbie, who is basically a co-conspirator with Jeanette who originated the idea that Jaron was trans in the first place. But if Jazz sees different therapists/shrinks other than Debbie, they were doubtless all hand picked to tow the narrative line. They are paid to overlook Jeanette&#039;s borderline personality disorder helicopter mothering, and respect the trans conclusion as infallible.<br><br>Prediction: Jazz makes some cry for help failed 41% attempts in the next year.

While his siblings were given the &quot;normal&quot; childhood of being sent out to face the brutal, Darwinistic world of childhood and public education as the elder brothers and sister of a child put forth as the face &quot;trans children,&quot; he was coddled, sheltered, virtual &quot;schooled,&quot; told repeatedly what a special, fragile little flower he was, and while he spent the bulk of his life only subliminally aware of how different his upbringing had been, his adolescent brushes with reality started bringing it to the forefront of his confused, manipulated mind. &quot;The world is cruel and dangerous,&quot; he&#039;d been told, and while any other child(including his sister, his brothers) would have been encouraged to find the bravery to face it, Jaron was ever encouraged to retreat. While it is a matter of some conjecture how conscious his mother was of what she was instilling in him, the end result is inarguable in its reality - a palpable, nigh-unbreakable codependency between mother and child, one of the hallmarks of the syndrome known as Munchausen by Proxy. <br><br>At some point, possibly during her &quot;special&quot; pregnancy with the twins, Jeannette became addicted to the attention she was receiving. It is not difficult to imagine the celebration she received in response to her bravery, going under the knife as she did to save her unborn children. But then came Jaron - boring, uneventful, perfectly healthy little Jaron. Thus was born in her subconscious the desire to somehow elevate this final child, this final source of attention, and what a phenomenal coincidence that it was in a way that aligned both with her desire to return to the world of film production and to have another little girl. A &quot;special&quot; little girl.
