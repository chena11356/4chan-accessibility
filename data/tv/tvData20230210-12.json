I follow the creek again, now marking trees as I go onward until I return, now I&#039;ve concluded the radius the magical dome that transports me to the beginning, I can mark the exact cut off point. Now I walk backwards towards the wall, all the while my friends are walking forward facing me, this concludes whether or not I&#039;m &quot;teleported&quot; away or until everyone has crossed the border. If latter, we one person right at the border, the second one goes as far as the first person can see them, and so on, a chain of visual contact. If former, we see if it&#039;s a sphere by digging under the &quot;wall&quot; or climbing the nearest tree to the area of the circle and jumping over the &quot;wall&quot;, if both efforts provide to be fruitless, we begin to create an area of controlled fire, after burning some 10mx10m area, we dig 1x2m holes on the ground, prepare to set the whole forest on fire, drench ourselves in water by the creek and set a damp cloth over our heads while the fire rages above. After the fire has settled, two things should&#039;ve occurred, a smoke signal to indicate distress, and or if the dome doesn&#039;t let anything out not even fire, confirms our dome theory absolutely.

The starting premise of cultural conflict between the northern and southern tribes was interesting, but after that it went to dogshit. The retcons to the lore weren&#039;t great in their own right, but made extra worse by ruining something better. The kaiju battle at the end was cringe.

And every time, Korra would defeat them because they were &quot;the bad guys.&quot; All the social problems would just die with the villains (unless Korra made them worse) and the universal band-aid of liberal democracy would fix everything.

It&#039;s an irrelevant argument to most. XY male is still male, and XX female is still female to people who are quite sure they are heterosexual. This is because heterosexuality is obviously just a product of the evolutionary drive to reproduce and maintain the species. Any heterosexual who is intelligent at all won&#039;t go against the grain of this even if they just want pleasure and not kids. <br><br>It tends to be men of lower IQ who also have a lower disgust response, who even care about the question of &quot;passing&quot;. Because they have less of a cognitive ability to override their sex drive. So for stupid people with lower disgust response, they are also more likely to settle for someone with an STD, someone with brain damage, someone deformed or morbidly obese, an animal , etc etc. So remember that when you see an idiot in these threads fawning over a tran who they say &quot;passes&quot;. <br><br>People are at their dumbest when they are horny, so the already dumb are most vulnerable to having the lowest standards. So if a tranny did find such a guy to fuck them, it&#039;s no more flattering than someone scoring with a person who is very wasted on alcohol.

The wars had caused massive devastation throughout the entire continent. Even before we get into looting, raping, and executions; Marching to Moscow without an extensive logistics train made the grand armee turn to foraging. Having soldiers steal your crop and any food you had stored would starve the local citizens and force them to flee to other towns/villages. This would then lead to a domino effect of peasantry spreading the word. Even burning down Moscow would cause a massive ripple effect as there are always people from the countryside traveling to the capital to conduct business.

I waited specifically to listen to the audiobook for Sam Witwer&#039;s performance as Maul, and I was not disappointed. Some of my favorite Star Wars audiobook experiences are with the anthologies like the Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark and the FACPOV anthologies, so it was great to have one that included stories from the High Republic and the sequel era as well. People who don&#039;t normally pick up the middle grade novels are really missing out, too - this connected so well with many other SW books and comics.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also (slight spoiler ahead!).....was that a hint of something romantic with a man in the Luke Skywalker story? As a queer Star Wars fan I&#039;ve always read Luke as gay, but this story definitely had some things in it that no straight man I&#039;ve ever met would think about another man.

A women in her 30s will probably be desperate to settle down before her eggs run out whilst the guy gained enough financial resources that his bad looks can be overlooked. The guy isn&#039;t that desperate since there&#039;s no ticking time bomb although his sperm does get shitter over time. That&#039;s it. It&#039;s when women become desperate to settle down. And down is the important word. She&#039;s not settling for Chad. If she found and locked in a Chad she&#039;d be married already, no, she failed and time is running out so she&#039;s scrambling for the guys she ignored in the past.<br>Retards think that a middle class salary working 50 hours a week in some office makes them a Chad.

There seemed to emanate from it a light from within - this gleaming radiant marble. I had known this place. I had in fact been born and raised there. This was my first return, a reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being. Wandering about, I happily noticed that the house had been immaculately maintained. There had been added a number of additional rooms, but in a way that blended so seamlessly with the original construction, one would never detect any difference. Returning to the house&#039;s grand foyer, there came a knock at the door. My son was standing there. He was happy and carefree, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy. We embraced - a warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were in this moment one. My vision ended. I awoke with a tremendous of optimism and confidence in you and your future.

The Next Generation - First Trek I ever watched and to me it&#039;s basically perfect Trek. It&#039;s got just the right balance of intelligence, humour, comfiness, action and sciency stuff. The whole show has this feeling of warmth and positivity that I really like and it always lifts my mood (except the more dark episodes).<br><br>2. The Original Series - Yes it&#039;s dated and cheap and often silly, but that&#039;s all part of the charm. It doesn&#039;t take itself all that seriously unlike most other Trek series&#039; afterwards, even the good ones. The sheer amount of soul and comfiness present throughout TOS outweighs any negatives. Plus it&#039;s just in general an incredibly iconic, influential and groundbreaking series. Like TNG, this show always puts me in a better mood.<br><br>3. The Animated Series - Highly underrated and unfairly dismissed because of how cheap the animation quality is. But other than that it&#039;s pure Trek and basically an unofficial season 4 of TOS: same actors, same writers, same producers, and it used some storylines that were goinig to be in the cancelled season 4 of TOS. Plus because it was animated they could be way more ambitous and creative with visuals. Supremely comfy Trek.<br><br>4. Deep Space Nine - Probably the best written Trek from an &quot;objective&quot; point of view and some characters and storylines are awesome (Quark, Dukat, Wayoun, Grand Nagus) but others are... not so much. Also in general the show is too dour and grim to find comfy like older Trek. I&#039;ve had no desire to rewatch it, unlike the above three series. Also some of the more politically-themed episodes are a bit cringe.<br><br>5. Voyager - It&#039;s TNG but worse in every single way. Despite having a great premise it doesn&#039;t take advantage of it and instead everything just feels rather bland and mediocre and unimpressive. It has the highest amount of &quot;meh&quot; episodes of any Trek series, and only a few great episodes.

Despite some criticism for its uneven writing, it remains a favorite among fans for its sense of adventure and exploration.<br><br>9 - Lower Decks (2020-present) - Lower Decks is a more light-hearted and comedic take on the Star Trek universe. It has been praised for its humor and its ability to both pay homage to and subvert familiar Star Trek tropes.<br><br>10 - Strange New Worlds (upcoming) - Strange New Worlds is an upcoming series that will follow the adventures of Captain Pike, Mr. Spock, and Number One from the original series.

Rick is essentially a parody of Doc Brown from Back to the Future but even more insane and nihilistic, who abuses his grandson Marty who&#039;s himself a parody of Marty McFly but made pathetic. In the episode called Pickle Rick (written by the show runner of the She Hulk series), Rick decides to reach new levels of absurdity by turning himself into a pickle with a human face. Since he&#039;s unable to move he soon rolls into the sewers where he has to fights rats and manages to creates arms and legs prosthetics from the slain rats. He escapes the sewers and end up in a mansion used by russian secret intelligence who end up hunting him as they think he&#039;s an infiltrator. The episode evolves into a John Wick parody where Picke Rick kills most of the russians. He escapes the mansion and joins his family at a therapy session where he gets chastised for being late and doing stupid shit, The End. This became a classic for redditors and created plethora of memes. The prankster in the picture also mentions the Szechuan Sauce which is from the first episode of season 3. In that episode Rick gets interrogated by an insectoid agent from a galactic empire who entered his mind, in order to get the formula for interdimentional travel. Rick fakely agrees and show the agent the memory where he discovered interdimentional travel, that is the day where an alternate version of himself massacred his family. Rick who&#039;s an hedonist uses the opportunity they&#039;re back in a memory of 1998 to go to McDonald&#039;s and order nuggets with the Szechuan sauce specially released by the fast food restaurant as advertising for the Mulan animated movie. At the end of the episode Rick managed to crush the gallactic empire, boasts about it to Marty in a cazed manner and announces this and the whole new season of Rick and Morty was all about him getting a taste of the Szechuan sauce.", "time": 1676027159, "resto": 180397380}, {"no": 180400419, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)06:12:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180397750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180397750</a><br>I&#039;ve always wondered if this was legit or a guy pranking.", "time": 1676027577, "resto": 180397380}, {"no": 180400444, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)06:14:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180397380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180397380</a><br>Yeah this one was always based.
