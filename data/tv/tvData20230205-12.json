To trans people, everyone should have a &quot;choice&quot; to transition. It&#039;s either that, or admit that those that do are mentally ill. Compulsive behavior or emotions outside of the norm are a tell-tale sign of mental illness, and Jaron has them in droves (without even diving into his state ignoring them).<br><br>Almost perfectly evidenced by I Am Jazz is how the issue of &quot;choice&quot; isn&#039;t true. Trans ideology fails to account for this entirely. The questioning of his gender could not have been a resolute question in his mind at such a young age; if it was it was clearly a mental illness. Either he is a super genius that became aware of his surroundings and possessed the capacity to consent to changing gender, or he was just a child.<br><br>Let me put it like this. If you were completely unaware that it was possible to transition to the opposite sex, what would the likelihood of you transitioning be? It would be almost zero, and on the offchance that you did, it would be a serious illness that required constant help. It&#039;s inherently selfish to assume that Jazz wasn&#039;t driven towards this. This ideology has been spread far and wide, and is akin to a mind virus. The reason why we are here and aware of it now is because it was spread, and we unquestionably are seeing the outcome of those that fall victim to it.

Forcing the people who are actually interested in using Netflix to pay for it is one of the only avenues left to increase their revenue. They&#039;re going to do it, and most of the people bitching about it are the people who are currently leeching from someone else&#039;s account. Their vows to stop using the service are meaningless because they already don&#039;t pay, and for Netflix it&#039;s simply a matter of minimizing their noise.

Both for the sake of the film&#039;s narrative in and of itself, and the wider implications given what we already know about the Star Wars universe. She thwarts the grandson of the most powerful Jedi at every turn with little effort, meaning she must be &quot;SOMEBODY&quot; given Star Wars is obsessed with lineages. She rarely has to make any difficult decisions or concessions, making her unrelatable and unsympathetic. This leads to her being more of an, as you pointed out, mystery box than an actual character. &quot;Who is she? Who is her father (and it must be a character we know!)&quot; She SHOULD have been a nobody, but JJ made sure we wouldn&#039;t be given an actual protagonist by giving us the myriad scenes of her performing master-level feats within hours of leaving nu-Tatooine.<br><br>I partially agree with Snoke.

It&#039;s still one guy&#039;s vision and he had a certain idea how things should go. If, along the way, lightning strikes your nether regions and you have a great idea how all things fit together even better, then all the better, but you have to start out with at least a coherent idea how to do things.<br>That being said, Rian brought in his own brand of retardation. He knew very well that he was gong to direct the middle of a trilogy, so how he thought it&#039;s a good idea to burn up every single plot thread set up by TFA and leave basically scorched earth for his successor is beyond me. It is kinda poetic justice though, that they forced (heh) JJ to do the third movie, to finally reveal how much of a fuckup he is. Make me wonder though how they convincend him to come back at all.
