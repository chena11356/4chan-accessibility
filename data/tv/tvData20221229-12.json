Rian Johnson might have a different character when he first wrote the script. Andrew Tate was 100% the inspiration for the character. Tate was banned on Twitter but then became popular on other ones.

That&#039;s the kind of thing that is completely plausible not only because of current year politics but because of the nature of unisex products having mass appeal. They make basically the same toothbrush and then make it blue or pink and ship it, but in this case GW would make the same marine and ship it to let the owner paint it whatever color they want.

It takes a long while for the romance thing to kick in because I guess the writers want you to know the characters and for it not to feel forced. Kdramas go on for 16 episodes usually so they have time. I swear I&#039;m starting Doberman after I finish Dark (German). There&#039;s not much romance in that but it&#039;s fucking great you should try it. I can&#039;t even say when I got hooked.

Godard thinks that only through how we shoot things (see my panning shot point, the pan makes you realize you are watching a film whereas a tracking shot exarcerbates the illusion of the cinematic apparatus for example) and represent them, and then in the montage that follows, can we come to any real truth in cinema.

So he thinks that with proper technique we can somehow avoid that impact on our thinking? I don&#039;t follow.<br>Case 1: I&#039;m watching ridiculous anime with space vampires. Would Godard feel this is impacting my perception of reality, i.e. the human brain is largely incapable of differentiating fact from fiction once our suspension of disbelief is functioning?<br>Case 2: I&#039;m watching a documentary about a genocide, but it uses a lot of tracking shots. The impact of what I&#039;m seeing and learning is reduced because I subconsciously view it as &quot;filmic&quot;?<br>I see the point about the shadows, but it seems that 1) looking at reflections is unavoidable; hell, even in real life you only get small snippets of the entirety of reality at any given point; and 2) I always know it&#039;s a movie. I&#039;m not going to genuinely think that the train is going to come out of the screen and hit me, and even if I weep for Leon and Mathilda I&#039;m not going to worry about how she&#039;s doing the week after (I think they&#039;ll be OK there). Yes, on some level we take lessons from fiction and internalize them, but I don&#039;t see how the degree to which that takes place can be significantly impacted by camera technique.<br>I think a person is more likely to internalize things due to setting (something mundane like Kramer vs Kramer) than something with &quot;non-illusory&quot; techniques used to produce it but takes place on the space vampires&#039; home planet.<br>I&#039;m probably off-base, but enjoy your sleep.<br>addendum: Godard uses an exceptionally long tracking shot during the traffic scene in Week-end, and it&#039;s one of the more realistic scenes, arguably.

The humor is extremely base, and without a solid grasp on toilet humor, most of the jokes will go under a typical viewer&#039;s taint. There&#039;s also Peter&#039;s moronic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from pre-school literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual obliviousness to truly appreciate the shallowness of these jokes, to realize that they&#039;re not just funny- they say something dumb about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Family Guy truly ARE well-adjusted human beings - of course they wouldn&#039;t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Peter&#039;s mind-numbing catchphrase &quot;c&#039;mon Lois!&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to some dumb bro movie probably.
