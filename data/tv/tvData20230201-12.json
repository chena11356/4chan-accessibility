Worst case scenario you&#039;ve acquainted yourself with an important classic. With regards to Babylon, as soon as you see 1927 appear on the screen &#039;Singing in the rain&#039; must come to your mind even if it&#039;s not necessary to understand every reference. It will elevate the experience though. Babylon is trying join the conversation of Singing in the Rain as well as Sunset Boulevard and films like that<br><br>But Manny watching the film is essential for Babylon because his viewing of tSingning in the Rain leads into a vision/hallucination/premonition of the history of cinema itself. It serves as the reckoning moment, when he realizes he was, at some point, an integral part of a thing that has developed a neverending cyclical movement of its own. He witnessed first-hand the end of the first cycle (1890-1927) and got chewed out. But he realizes it&#039;s become an essential aspect of contemporary life, which is both beautiful and disturbing, since cinema is both spontaneous and mechanical, etc. If the ending part had gotten cut out, if Manny didn&#039;t watch his own story unfold on the big screen, thent his emotional ambivalence is lost and the film is reduced to LE WACKY PEOPLE (not that the film wasn&#039;t banking on this aspect to get people hooked though)", "time": 1675252271, "resto": 180018388}, {"no": 180021549, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)06:58:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180021399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180021399</a><br>Okay sir, you have changed my mind.

And I think in a film like 2001, where each viewer brings his own emotions and perceptions to bear on the subject matter, a certain degree of ambiguity is valuable, because it allows the audience to &quot;fill in&quot; the visual experience themselves. In any case, once you&#039;re dealing on a nonverbal level, ambiguity is unavoidable. But it&#039;s the ambiguity of all art, of a fine piece of music or a painting -- you don&#039;t need written instructions by the composer or painter accompanying such works to &quot;explain&quot; them. &quot;Explaining&quot; them contributes nothing but a superficial &quot;cultural&quot; value which has no value except for critics and teachers who have to earn a living. Reactions to art are always different because they are always deeply personal. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are the areas I prefer not to discuss because they are highly subjective and will differ from viewer to viewer. In this sense, the film becomes anything the viewer sees in it. If the film stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer, if it stimulates, however inchoately, his mythological and religious yearnings and impulses, then it has succeeded.</span><br><br>This is from an interview about 2001 but there is no indications he would have changed his mind later on. http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/<wbr>doc/0069.html", "time": 1675213594, "resto": 179998990}, {"no": 180003304, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:07:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179998990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179998990</a><br>This whole &#039;two creepy guys in the toy store&#039; thing that gets brought up here from time to time is complete horseshit, so that alone already discredits this.

In order for the actor to check the ammunition, they would have to perform the full check over again.

He only gets across the state line when he runs out of fuel because he forgot to fill it up. Instead of simply walking to the nearest gas station or flagging down help he decides to push his car over an embankment and set it on fire. He then proceeds to walk on foot to the nearest car lot (which happens to be in Mexico for some reason, mostly because he burned up his map in the car and he&#039;s been taking backroads.) He finds an old bicycle in a garbage dump and uses that.<br><br>He finally gets to the car lot and buys a fixer-upper for $50. Before leaving the car lot he has to change a tire, which he replaces with the solid rubber donut. He buys fuel and heads off to the Daytona 500 again. Only he&#039;s heading deeper into Mexico and eventually ends up broken down in front of, &quot;Autodromo Internacional de la Jolla&quot; due to no water in the radiator. The engine block has seized up. Luckily, there&#039;s a race about to start. Christopher...er &quot;Alexander Superspeeder&quot;, who changed his name, pays the $125 entry fee for the race.<br><br>Unfortunately, Alexander Superspeeder doesn&#039;t have a race car. He does however have an old bicycle still. He uses the bicycle to race. He makes it only 3 laps before he is too tired to steer straight and veers off into a race car and is killed.<br><br>Some Jew picks up his story and writes a book about his life and how he followed his dreams.

Likewise if you want campy fun you&#039;ll be disappointed by the darker tone and better effects of Heisei, whereas if you want more serious sci-fi and political commentary it&#039;s awesome.

So evidently she has heard of it and just wants to pick on Ray.<br><br>But then, a minute later, when she finds out that she was talking to Ray Romano, she expressed shock, even though she did mean sarcasm just a minute earlier. Which is it?<br><br>I don&#039;t think the issue is even that these Disney Channel kids are bad actors. They&#039;re just being directed to act &quot;funny,&quot; even when the funny body language they&#039;re doing works against the intent of the scene. There&#039;s a different episode where Jackson and Billy Ray were snowed in and in mortal danger, and Jackson&#039;s actor did &quot;clown pretending to be scared&quot; acting instead of actually trying to look scared, and it made the intent of the scene super muddled.", "time": 1675254081, "resto": 180010613}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 180015938, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)02:22:48", "name": "Anonymous",

The final nail in the coffin was he filled his staff with yes-men who didn&#039;t bother questioning his decisions or helping him explore his ideas to their fullest potential.
