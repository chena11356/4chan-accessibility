It was clearly unfinished with the scenes having missing cgi and script notes detailing what&#039;s supposed to happen. The intro was changed so that instead of following a bloodline across Vissy&#039;s legos, the camera follows the Hightower itself, its bricks and tiles carved so that they represent each member of the targaryen family, going higher until it reaches the brazier at the top with the title card and logo and the intro ends. Sadly the episode itself was pretty much just exposition, and I don&#039;t mean what happened in S1 but literally just random expository lines about dragons and valyria and the like.

We Indian Hindus love Cameron&#039;s Avatar franchise even more than Marvel capeshit (inb4 poo memes/sir memes/do not redeem memes). The inspiration for Avatar was blue-skinned Hindu gods (like Vishnu and Shiva) according to Cameron himself. Also, the word &#039;avatar&#039; itself means &#039;divine incarnation&#039; in the ancient Sanskrit language of India. An &#039;avatar&#039; is a Hindu concept that refers to the descent of a divine being from the realm of spirit to the realm of matter where we all dwell. When Avatar 1 was released, James Cameron during one of his speeches in New Delhi mentioned &quot;I just have loved everything, the mythology, the entire Hindu pantheon, seems so rich and vivid.&quot; He continued and said, &quot;I didn&#039;t want to reference the Hindu religion so closely, but the subconscious association was interesting, and I hope I haven&#039;t offended anyone in doing so.&quot;<br>Furthermore, when Cameron was asked what exactly the word &#039;avatar&#039; means, he said \u201cIt&#039;s an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human&#039;s intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\u201d (source: https://www.jagrantv.com/en-show/av<wbr>atar-the-way-of-water-is-the-story-<wbr>related-to-matsya-avatar-cameron-sp<wbr>iritual-connection-with-india-rc103<wbr>7160)<br><br>Also, that liquid in Avatar: The Way Of Water which stops aging is called &#039;amrita&#039; and &#039;amrita&#039; is a Sanskrit word meaning &#039;immortality&#039;.

They were both active for a period of time and, not having human social norms and being literally form-fitted to one another, were fucking. The colonists really wanted them destroyed because they were freaked out by the twincest. Soong deactivated Lore, his least favorite because he acts more gay, hoping the colonists would tolerate one of them without the twincest. Data then contacted the crystalline entity, who both Data and Lore knew of for some time, which is why Soong left Data behind to have his memory wiped. Soong was stored deeper in the laboratory under more layers of rock and steel, which is both why he wasn\u2019t discovered until later and why he had slightly less of his memory wiped. <br>When he was reactivated on the Enterprise, he contacted the entity as the only other being he knew would be alive, not knowing its reputation.

Desperate for the chance to send their children to what they call a &quot;land of plenty&quot;, a mob of desperate Indians swarms the consulate.
