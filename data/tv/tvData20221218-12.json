Honestly, think about it rationally. Your brother is feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by her uncle. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to dragonriding practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, rearing her for rule, educating her, playing tabletop Valyria with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the uncle that will eventually fuck her in every hole.<br><br>Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you&#039;re lucky, the rogue uncle who had little to nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her after both of his previous wives die of mysterious circumstances. He gets to fuck her tight, white-pubed pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.<br><br>As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for her uncle to enjoy.

Every human being recognizes the role milk plays in the life of an infant. It represents all these powerful aspects of the mother-infant relationship that echo forward in the infant&#039;s life; Nourishment, Care, Security, and Fertility are some examples off the cuff, but I&#039;m sure you could think of more. We also have popular ideas all over the world and across society about what that relationship illustrates to others when viewed from the outside. A distant mother using a wet nurse, the mothers of a village feeding their children communally, from a bottle in the orphanage, from livestock on the farm, the hormonally ravaged first world mother relying on the food industry that did so for baby formula etc etc.<br>So you can see that milk tells us quite a bit about the human from the very beginning of their life. You can also see that the relationship echoes forward through their lives via it&#039;s source. So in these stills you see human beings consuming the stuff in a different context. They&#039;re carrying out violence, plotting evil deeds, or relishing their total control over their helpless victims. These are all perversions of what we pointed out above. So when a human audience sees those acts associated with the consumption of milk it makes us uncomfortable, scared, and uncertain of what the character is capable of. There is clearly something wrong with them, and all of us sense it. <br>So <a href=\"#p178039269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178039269</a> and the tweet here <a href=\"#p178039421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178039421</a> are just boring and lazy takes on a symbolic tradition in film that extends at least to the middle of the last century, and probably longer.", "time": 1671363485, "resto": 178039243}, {"no": 178040056, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178039243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178039243</a><br>I like milk and I&#039;ve done some pretty evil shit ngl", "time": 1671363521, "resto": 178039243}, {"no": 178040251, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:47:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178040049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178040049</a><br>You&#039;re probably right anon, those takes are trite.", "filename": "34325", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 499, "h": 217, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 54, "tim": 1671364033740343, "time": 1671364033, "md5": "o/vOiz7ZFPeTHD0IsQNr/A==", "fsize": 16002, "resto": 178039243}, {"no": 178040420, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:54:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178040251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178040251</a><br>Ok, now do the Get Out, Basterds, No Country, and Clockwork.", "time": 1671364463, "resto": 178039243}, {"no": 178040634, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:04:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178040420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178040420</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get Out</span><br>you mean the movie about evil White people stealing the bodies of blacks?", "time": 1671365048, "resto": 178039243}, {"no": 178040778, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:10:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178039243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178039243</a><br>RIP babies who did nothing wrong.", "time": 1671365448, "resto": 178039243}, {"no": 178040920, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178039243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178039243</a><br>Jews mad because they fart and shart when they drink delicious, high on nutrients milk.

She was snarky, snippy, and was generally unpleasant to the interviewer and her fellow actors alike, usually in response to even vaguely gender related comments or questions. She was giving off real &quot;drunk gender studies student at a college party&quot; vibes. I guess the scriptwriters and handlers decided it was a bad idea to keep having/letting her act this way and in December 2019 she was selected to guest host Jimmy Kimmel Live looking like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFq<wbr>Ax-Tvo90 After this appearance her behavior came back in line to match her fellow actors and her youtube channel oriented seemingly to pander to exactly the section of audience most alienated by her previous behavior. I couldn&#039;t tell you how much of it was a failed experiment to market her deliberately to the radfem audience and see if they could make any money off them, or if she was just going off script and acting like herself in those appearances but in any case she was given some sort of strong correction behind the scenes and since then has been on her best behavior.", "filename": "Larson", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 696, "h": 390, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671366973351722, "time": 1671366973, "md5": "UeKLSpcQ5JcKWrLx71pWjg==", "fsize": 52077, "resto": 178035275}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 178041197, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:27:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;FRASIER LOOKS ITS A FRASIER THREAD</span>", "filename": "frasier 4chan", "ext": ".png", "w": 1921, "h": 1215, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 158, "tim": 1671366458193450, "time": 1671366458, "md5": "XO3lesdYMuf9gk8gqEovow==", "fsize": 2991539, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "frasier-looks-its-a-frasier-thread", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 2, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 178041377, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:34:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178041197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178041197</a><br>I just put a carnivorous beetle inside my foreskin in time for a Christmas treat.

The beginning of the film provides a wealth of information that the viewer only understands later. As I said earlier, the entire structure of Once Upon A Time In America is based on time. And there is a lot of camera movement that we do not take account of. Because I did not use the camera to describe a city, a street or a place. The camera moves only whilst following a character. Its movement works with the movement of a man in a space which is nothing other than time. And it is necessarily less spectacular because I use the technique to show feelings and not as a means of discovering a world, a story or a universe, as was the case for Once Upon a Time in the West. There, when the crane rises, it is to show a city which has been created. Here, the city is already there. We do not need to show it as well. I am aware of the apparent static nature of my film.

Producing effects such as these made me really feel the cinema of yesterday. We believe it! And that&#039;s why all the places are real. I found them. Again, it was to do with searching for a lost time. The Grand Central station in New York of that era no longer exists. It was destroyed. But I knew it was only a replica of the Gare du Nord in Paris. So I shot those scenes at the Gare du Nord in Paris. Those are the same windows, the same pillars of concrete and stone: the same materials. It&#039;s like the scene in the Long Island hotel, where Noodles takes Deborah. The place no longer exists but it was a copy of the Palaces of Venice. So I filmed the movie in Venice. It&#039;s logical. America has never done anything other than imitate Europe in all this. Following my intuition, I filmed the movie in the places the buildings were modelled on. Without snobbery or chauvinism. Only because the reality of the era no longer exists in America. All is lost, forgotten, destroyed... And me, to make a film about memory and memories, I had to find these images of reality. To best portray this notion of myth and dream, I had to work on more certain realities. From there, everything came. Time is the protagonist of film and time is always right.

Like thousands of other young offenders, survivors of gang warfare, then locked behind the bars of a penitentiary, he was crucified on a cross too big for him.

After Once Upon a Time in the West, I asked myself this many times. I wondered if I should abandon the profession. Here it&#039;s a little different because it&#039;s primarily a film about cinema. It&#039;s not just nostalgia and pessimism. I have written something about it. I will read it to you: In my eyes, The Hoods was one of those glass balls for tourists, with inside a small Eiffel Tower, a small Coliseum, perhaps a small Statue of Liberty. If you turn the ball upside down, you can see large snowflakes falling down on the scene. That was the America of Noodles. And mine. Tiny, fabulous, lost forever. I must add that this film is also a painful vengeance. Yes, I retaliated for everything that America and cinema have put in my head. And I am aware that this film is different from my previous works. This time I worked in total clarity as to the correctness of what I was doing. No question. Not the slightest concern. I have no doubt. I was transported on a journey during which I was certain of a good result. I&#039;m speaking of the making of the movie. I&#039;m really happy to have waited fifteen years to do it.

Even if they&#039;re not leftists they will paint Corlys black as to avoid the potential outcry of racism and whitewashing despite the character being a victim of blackwashing. We&#039;ve lost the Velaryons and some Targaryens but that&#039;s about it. None of the first men or Andal houses could be turned black without everyone realising its BS. The &quot;summer islander admixture&quot; or the &quot;race isn&#039;t skin deep for Valyrians&quot; cope isn&#039;t going to hold water at all there. That situation is near inevitable when they adapt Robert&#039;s Rebellion and the other spin offs that have close to zero black people you can shoehorn in with muh black Valyrian copes. Either way zoomers despite being more left wing and filled with minorities, find raceswapping ridiculous. They&#039;re no longer minorities in most places and don&#039;t feel the need for overrepresentation like millennials. Racist jokes are back. The only issue is it will be a long time before zoomer men displace millenials in the writing room and executive offices, by then we will be in care homes.
