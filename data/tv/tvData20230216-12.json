The real story is about how every man has a Daniel Plainview inside ourselves somewhere. we&#039;ve all been frustrated with self-important people who wield some sort of power over us and are protected by societal norms.<br>But what if you were to just say fuck you to those societal norms? What if you went with your own, primal sense of justice? a sense of justice and fairness that is so old that we can recognize it in chimps. If you bring one chimp a cake for his birthday, another chimp will kill you because of the injustice that he feels he has had to endure.<br>&#039;I want noone else to succeed&quot;, Daniel says to the primate masquerading as his brother in a candid moment, but the sentiment is lost on the dim-witted impostor. In another scene he cooly explains to the man who insulted him with a business proposal that he, Daniel, is going to climb through the window of the man while he is sleeping, and slit his throat with a knife. Then and there, he means it, too. He does not like to bandy words. Who does? Earlier in the film, we can see him begrudgingly negotiating with various land owners with oil on their property, and it is obvious how demeaning he feels it to be. <br>Who here has not had to quibble with and kowtow to some petty bureaucrat about pointless minutiae all the while you feel like ramming your fist through their face on the inside?

As it stands, he appears in a few flash-backs with Janet (which were his better scenes), and then mostly just stays in his Villain Tower. He captures Scott and Cassie, then sends Scott out to do a side quest. Worst of all, during the big climactic battle towards the end of the movie, he just kinda ... sits around in his tower, and lets Ant-Man Godzilla his shit from the outside.

One of the worst aspects of the movie is that the tone is just fucked - some parts they want to be super dramatic and serious, and other parts they want to be a literal fucking joke.

We don&#039;t want Emory to die, Clarent was a cool kid and Swyft/Reyne were always smiling and happy. They&#039;re not le ebil green villains. There should also be ups and downs in the battle where it seems to be going both ways in both the battle as a whole and the individual duels. The duels also have symbolic meaning, at first Roddy wins then Emory (or vice versa) but the rest (the lesser lords we don&#039;t really know) get slaughtered in the chaos of battle. No one winning the 2v2 duel is a good thing.<br>The Winter Wolves shouldn&#039;t win easily. They had to charge 5 times and lost 2/3 of their men. The boys were actually winning the battle. Roddy gets increasingly aggravated when his charges get repulsed and eventually he accepts help from the others which explains the 700 casualties that weren&#039;t part of the winter wolves. But the fact they&#039;re held back for so long doesn&#039;t really make sense so add in the fear of Aemond/Criston coming. Maybe when Red Robb Rivers shoots down a raven they&#039;re able to retrieve a message. Someone doubts that Robb shot down all the ravens in the pre battle war meeting, there&#039;s a mini argument and they send off some men a bit north and position them defensively just in case. This explains why only the Winter Wolves were fighting initially, they feared a second army coming in. By now they&#039;d have also had news of Daeron making everyone bend the knee in the Reach so the southern portion led by Pate Longleaf would be in a defensive position facing south too. Its only in the midst of the battle that the riders return with confirmation that there&#039;s no one nearby which allows them to be available for a charge. This is when Roddy refuses help for one charge but accepts it grudgingly when he comes back around again", "time": 1676534244, "resto": 180639603}, {"no": 180640037, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)02:57:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180639715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180639715</a><br>Catelyn never liked Jon but she&#039;s not petty enough to instill that hate in any of her true born children even though she could&#039;ve done so easily.

I want to let everyone know now that I will most likely delete this post in the next 36 hours or so. I\u2019m not certain if I will post on this account again, but as of now, I will probably not post again. This post is regarding scenes that could appear in season 2 of House of the Dragon if there are not cut or scrapped before filming.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Disclaimer: these are not in perfect order; I read these about a week ago, and so what you\u2019ll see here are the most significant things I remember or found significant. The wording will also not be exact, but I will try to make it as similar to the best of my ability</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1: There will be more abuse of Rhaenyra at the hands of Daemon. In one scene, Rhaenyra is arguing with Daemon concerning some of his actions in the war. The notes state that Rhaenyra should look as if she had been crying beforehand. Daemon snaps and slaps her across the face. Rhaenyra is quiet for a while and then replies with something along the lines of, \u201cyou wish to take what was given to me, just as my brother has stolen what was mine.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2: Daeron will make his first appearance in Old Town. It seems that he has a close relationship with Ormund and Garmund Hightower. It appears that Daeron and Ormund were making plans to visit King\u2019s Landing to return Daeron to his family. Daeron playfully remarks that he will ride his dragon there and greet Aemond and Vhagar at King\u2019s Landing, and Garmund laughs at this.</span>", "time": 1676549986, "resto": 180639603}, {"no": 180645626, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:21:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "(2/2)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3: Aegon will make his first appearance in the council room with Otto, Tyland Lannister, Jasper Wylde, and Orwyle. The men will bicker amongst themselves, and Aegon sits silently with his hands on the table. Based on the dialogue, they seem to be arguing over Lucaerys\u2019 death and what actions they should take next. An attendant enters the room and says the queen needs urgent attendance. Aegon starts to get up, and Otto tries to stop him and address the issue at hand, Aegon says, \u201cIf Aemond can kill one pup, we can kill more,\u201d before excusing himself.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4: The scene opens to Helaena slumped over, holding her stomach. Alicent is with her, Helaena outstretches her hand, and Aegon grabs it. Alicent says that Helaena has been sick as of late, and the scene implies that she is pregnant.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5: Aemond will be first seen with Vhagar, and he talks to her like she\u2019s human. He says that he will not blame her and remarks on how Alicent is still upset with him and Otto will not talk to him.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6: blood and cheese will occur in the middle of the night. Helaena will be with two children, and they will talk down the hall by themselves. Helaena hears a noise and calls Aegon and Aemond\u2019s names. When blood appears, she will grab her children and start to run. Blood grabs her by the hair, and cheese takes her son from her arms. Blood warns her to drop her daughter, or he will rape the both of them, but Helaena refuses. Cheese tells Blood to stop and that \u201cwe\u2019ve got the boy.\u201d When blood and cheese start to leave, Helaena screams, and her children cry. Cheese tries to run with her son in his arms, but Blood slits the boy\u2019s throat before running. Helaena and her daughter start screaming, and Cheese hesitates before running.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7: Jacaerys is flying on dragonback and there is a cut away to Winterfell.

The overwhelming majority of the autogynephiles swept up in this hysteria are deeply addicted to pornography, have indulged themselves to such a degree that merely imagining themselves a woman no longer provides them with sufficient fodder for their sexual needs. For many of them, there is a degree of power fantasy involved, wherein they derive gratification from forcing others to accept them as something they are not, a sort of passive-aggressive dominance roleplay, a rape fantasy where they are the aggressor and their victim is generalized into everyday social interaction. <br><br>With Jaron, however, the fetishization is at a deeper, more primal level than merely the sexual. He has been allowed to invest the female form with spiritual power, magical power, to believe that by achieving it, it would be the elixir to remedy all his many, many woes. You can see the deepening of his pathology play out over the course of his childhood and adolescence. First came the sympathetic magic, the mimicry, then came the naming. Jaron, you see, is a thief of both name and form, seeking to claim this power as his own. Only now is he becoming subliminally aware that his problems remain, and he struggles on in increasingly futile denial of this reality. His sheltered upbringing and the chemically-induced hobbling of his neuropsychological development might have rendered him incapable of fully, consciously understanding the quixotic nature of his quest, how pursuing it to the exclusion of all else has left him as hollow as the windmills against which he tilted, as illusory as the Don\u2019s giants, but he senses it nonetheless. Buried in his subconscious, beneath his medicated stupor is the magic mirror he dare not face - the truth that he is merely the fading illusion of a woman, the ghost of what he might have otherwise been.

Traditional sports were out in favour of the black sportsmen.<br><br>Then the Fast and Furious happened. Suddenly this white dude appeared on the scene. Women wanted him, men wanted to be him. Imagine Ryan Gosling but better looking. That was Paul. My dads generation idolised Steve McQueen, he was the king of cool. For us it was Paul Walker. Then 2 Fast hit. Overnight every guy wore a white t with blue jeans and converse. We all wanted a Nissan Skyline. The way Paul was cool around minorities was symbolic. No longer did white guys want a black friend. Black guys wanted a dude like Paul Walker in their crew. Women of all races wanted a blue eyed blond haired Nietzschean superman. If it wasnt for Paul an entire generation would have been lost. He singlehandedly ushered in the 2000&#039;s.<br><br>When he died thats when it all ended. White guys were once again reviled and no longer could we depend on Paul.

His films are technically put together in an amazing way but he has been nothing but a net negative on society. If he never made his films the world would literally be a better place. The west really needs to wake up. You can&#039;t have a functioning society when all of your TV programs are riddled with depression, sex, drugs and violence. Society imitates this bullshit and makes the world a worse place. It spreads violence. TV used to be kind of wholesome with one or two violent movies and programs, today it&#039;s almost 100% negative, violent and overflowing with filth. I would much rather watch positive films and I think it&#039;s far healthier for society.

I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, [applause]--- that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. [Cheers and laughter.] My understanding is that I can just let her alone. I am now in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife.

Richard M. Johnson. [Laughter.] I will also add to the remarks I have made, (for I am not going to enter at large upon this subject,) that I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it, [laughter] but as Judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, [roars of laughter] I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of this State, which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes. [Continued laughter and applause.] I will add one further word, which is this, that I do not understand there is any place where an alteration of the social and political relations of the negro and the white man can be made except in the State Legislature---not in the Congress of the United States---and as I do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself, and as Judge Douglas seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is rapidly approaching, I propose as the best means to prevent it that the Judge be kept at home and placed in the State Legislature to fight the measure.
