It actually all pales in comparison to this though, which actually I suggest if your anywhere in the bay area of san francisco, you try for yourself. At exactly 11:10pm, the San Francisco cab service changes shifts, and there are no cab drivers on the streets for approx. 10 minutes. During that time however, it has been rumoured if you stand outside Rylee Center and whistle for a cab, one will come near with &quot;FRESH&quot; on the plate and dice in the mirror. It&#039;s an extremely rare cab, but if you instruct the driver to deliver you to Bel Air, you&#039;ll pull up alongside a house the next night at around 7 or 8. I&#039;d suggest tellin the cab driver you&#039;ll see him later, or later that night, while your sleeping in your house you&#039;ll notice a strange owl statue randomly in your room. Some have been known to try and call the cops about it, but the calls end up fragmented and extremely static-ful.

However, the lineup of films Disney has announced for 2023-2024 includes a mix of highly-anticipated sequels, adaptations of popular stories, and new original films. The list includes a mix of genres, such as superhero movies, action-adventures, fantasy, and animation, which should appeal to a wide audience. The inclusion of films from well-established franchises such as &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp,&quot; &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy,&quot; &quot;Indiana Jones,&quot; &quot;Blade,&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot; are likely to draw significant attention and interest from fans of those series. Additionally, the live-action adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and the sequel to &quot;Inside Out&quot; are also likely to be popular among audiences.

I believe it was Z-dog(?) or the other chick who said &quot;No shit..!&quot;, realizing that they are in fact biological matches for the world, it doesn&#039;t instinctively go after them. Of course it helps that they&#039;re a threatening, large pack and there were only 2-3 viperwolves at day (the first film and Jake&#039;s corresponding fight with them suggests that they are nocturnal).<br><br>Also I knew to pay attention to blood in water the first time (sharks/predators smelling it), but since I knew the story this time I had more bandwidth to just look at it (blood in the water). The little detail that stood out to me was Lo&#039;ak&#039;s little shoulder cut during the beat when he&#039;s hiding in the reef, which the predator can clearly smell. (But when did Jake get the glancing cut across his face which is seen in the final frame and other near-end stuff?)<br><br>The tribal significance of Lo&#039;ak bonding with any Tulkun, even an outcast, was much clearer this time. He leads the way in legitimately becoming one of them by sharing the intertribal bond, hence the first of the two really important I See Yous, when the girlfriend understands him.

I think that both George Lucas and James Cameron have that delightful type of autism that is rare in Hollywood today which makes them become SO involved in building the worlds of Star Wars and Avatar respectively that they even give names to different fruits that they create (for example). George Lucas and James Cameron are non-jews who independently rose up in jew-controlled Hollywood and succeeded in staying true (or at least mostly true) to their original artistic visions despite immense pressure from Hollywood jews and their army of unquestioningly obedient golems. And for that reason (and many other reasons), I respect and admire George Lucas and James Cameron.", "filename": "the_floating_islands_of_pandora", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1300, "h": 1700, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674301565001579, "time": 1674301565, "md5": "vsQVgmeioQ0kPLXoXXncfw==", "fsize": 1144188, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179529140, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:57:00", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "neysmile", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674302220956250, "time": 1674302220, "md5": "zjV43XF3DU8fPWrChBgwsw==", "fsize": 193778, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179529340, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:06:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179528882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179528882</a>", "filename": "1673851357074466", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 828, "h": 953, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674302784214087, "time": 1674302784, "md5": "P83R9ozk5rzWOfUOTeAmZA==", "fsize": 500471, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179529405, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:09:25", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1673278605378204", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674302965224702, "time": 1674302965, "md5": "T0buEVO0t5+6GOpZrdtyvQ==", "fsize": 1693225, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179529735, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:25:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179521081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179521081</a>", "filename": "0AE5F79D-AC75-4410-B788-99F699F72724", "ext": ".png", "w": 661, "h": 623, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1674303939106126, "time": 1674303939, "md5": "qiMGg9L5x/GSqlQeQ5MyIg==", "fsize": 17549, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179529838, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:31:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Cute...", "filename": "1674304250034", "ext": ".png", "w": 729, "h": 809, "tn_w": 112, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674304264083169, "time": 1674304264, "md5": "xvrZ3zJQSP+34k5zNH1wkw==", "fsize": 1157620, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179529849, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:31:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179529838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179529838</a>", "filename": "1671789741054649", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674304304535679, "time": 1674304304, "md5": "MZsjQ7QqYdzUpWSBhw83Bg==", "fsize": 255764, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179529885, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:33:15", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674304383489", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2016, "h": 1426, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1674304395804656, "time": 1674304395, "md5": "iI24IRC5o70qeKF3MlNbLA==", "fsize": 254780, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179530031, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:39:58", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674304783323", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3500, "h": 2500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1674304798783786, "time": 1674304798, "md5": "qqiIrci3wA1iIP4mugPReQ==", "fsize": 2118100, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179530055, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:41:11", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674304834206", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4096, "h": 1992, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1674304871187835, "time": 1674304871, "md5": "+Td+OMVBSBU2H7hhspSShQ==", "fsize": 1607057, "resto": 179517357}, {"no": 179530075, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:42:26", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674304936778", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1620, "h": 1753, "tn_w": 115, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674304946908430, "time": 1674304946, "md5": "BV6iYr3bWi1flNCDN9SS4Q==", "fsize": 287769, "resto": 179517357}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 179528235, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:12:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Would the original final shot have redeemed the movie?

The characteristics of the grain are important too and make part of the image, remember the seething about DNR (digital nose reduction) and many releases killed by it, like Predator or T2. Then you have film speed, or sensitivity to light (colloquially your might have heard of ISO sensitivity in digital cameras), which is directly related and inversely proportional to the size of silver halide crystal &quot;grains&quot; (ie. larger grains &gt; higher sensitivity &gt; can shoot in lower light &gt; but image is more grainy). But we&#039;re not watching movies under a microscope. And another factor is optical resolution of the camera lens, on top of whether focus puller did a good job to get the scene pin sharp. Finally you can&#039;t look at each part separately, it&#039;s all compounded and interacting, eg. slightly coarse grain makes slightly blurry image perceptibly sharper.<br>Anyway 4K is a good sweet spot for resolution for movies shot on 35mm stock. I&#039;ve been scanning 35mm still photos on professional scanners for some 20 years now, usually at 4000 dpi which gives you about 5600x3800 pixel image, and there is hardly more you could squeeze out of them in 99.9% cases. And remember that motion picture frame is shot with film running vertically, so in that case (assuming 22x16mm Academy format) you would get about 3400x2900 pixels.
