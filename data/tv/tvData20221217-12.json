Did I ever tell you l fought his dad? He was hired to assassinate a senator me and your father were guarding. We kept bringing her around open windows and public areas in order to draw the would-be assassin out because we knew he had too much pride to just shoot her from long range. He had used his payment to hire another bounty hunter to kill the senator for him while he sent us on a wild bantha chase. Also the 2nd assassin used her payment to buy a robot to assassinate the senator for her. Did I mention the 2nd assassin was a shapeshifter? She could have been a good friend in disguise and just shot the senator for all we knew! Then the robot used its payment to buy poisonous bugs to release into the senators room while she slept after lasering a hole through the window. It could have just lasered her too after that because we we weren&#039;t watching her at all but it already bought the bugs. So we sense the hostile life forms not the robot in the room and rush in and save the senator in the nick of time! Then I jumped out the window to chase the robot back to its owner! Luckily it didn&#039;t have a self destruct function. Then we found the 2nd assassin and chased her across the planet and caught her when she tried to kill us instead of shapeshifting and escaping. But to our surprise Jango Fett was watching the whole thing instead of going to kill the senator while we were away chasing the bugs chasing the robot chasing the shapeshifter. He shot her with a poisonous dart instead of sniper blaster and only her instead of shooting all of us or blowing all of us with a rocket or something then he escaped with his tiny jetpack. Luckily for the senator my good friend Dexterr Jettster owned a 50s dinner on Courscant that had Republic secrets on the menu along with cheeseburgers and malt shakes. We found the assassin and Mace Window killed him later right in front of Boba. And he was a good friend.</span>", "filename": "why did she do it", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 534, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1671253859409060, "time": 1671253859, "md5": "g7dB/KQvbGbPEVPkqO1HsQ==", "fsize": 2715894, "resto": 177980860}, {"no": 177987898, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:12:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177982259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177982259</a><br>probably has the ability to grow his arms longer", "time": 1671253951, "resto": 177980860}, {"no": 177987989, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:15:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM<br>BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM", "filename": "1635807751764", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 533, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1671254116832158, "time": 1671254116, "md5": "7SiZ2jXYPT2Vzh4EIyDg1A==", "fsize": 1114519, "resto": 177980860}, {"no": 177988064, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:17:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177987848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177987848</a><br>kek gets me every time", "time": 1671254241, "resto": 177980860}, {"no": 177988186, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:21:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "High five!", "filename": "1636214185690", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 544, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 53, "tim": 1671254469087652, "time": 1671254469, "md5": "oq4Kj3rUa1U/peABZb8rdA==", "fsize": 2712914, "resto": 177980860}, {"no": 177988275, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:24:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marquand: The Emperor doesn\u2019t have Jedi powers, does he?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lucas: Well, he is like Yoda: Yoda isn\u2019t a Jedi, the Emperor isn\u2019t a Jedi.

The elite&#039;s sex orgy was just that. I don&#039;t see how you can believe that a man, surrounded by wives who were brought to him as tribute, doesn&#039;t feel exalted nor how forbidden love is limited to female sexuality.

Gigachad is tasked with killing Sully for leading an insurrection, gigachad hunts sully and makes multiple threats on his children, and Sully decides to go into hiding to protect his children and take heat off of his clan. Gigachad finds out Sully&#039;s general location but can&#039;t locate him through intimidation of other blue people tribes, so he starts brutally killing whales (exactly two) and floating their bodies to bait the blue people. The humans and blue people had a detente over the whale killings prior to the movie and there was no conflict. The humans killed whales in deep ocean away from villages (the blue people have boners for the whales, naturally, and the whales come to play with the blue people in their lagoons regularly as part of their migration patterns) and sunk the bodies when they were done, and the blue people just let it slide. So gigachad kills a a mother and calf near a village and floats the body as bait.

Howard tries to be consistent but sometimes he goes off on tangents and it&#039;s hard to hold him back. He once said to me that there are two Star Trek universes: there&#039;s the TV show and then there&#039;s all the spin-offs. He said that these were completely different and didn&#039;t have anything to do with each other.

We had to learn how to look at the Galaxy from his point of view and let go of some of what we considered canon after we found out the ideas were only EU. Really we had to \u201cunlearn what we had learned\u201d and go back to the movies as the defining source material.</span>", "filename": "1417954937668", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671237720376594, "time": 1671237720, "md5": "BiG8KOmqG9o2dgvBVHlR0A==", "fsize": 53842, "resto": 177961427}, {"no": 177979389, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)19:42:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177979356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177979356</a><br>The only shitposter here is you for unironically saying the words &quot;I am taking the word of Lucas.&quot;<br>It was EU and you cannot disprove this.", "time": 1671237778, "resto": 177961427}, {"no": 177979603, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)19:50:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p177963765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177963765</a><br><a href=\"#p177961556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;177961556</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;killed off its own much funnier shitpost format</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spammed in literally every star wars thread for something like 4 years now (along with some guy going &quot;post it, you know the one&quot; or some variation)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;barely amusing enough for a chuckle the first go around, blaise and rote ever since</span><br>How in the actual fuck is this still spammed every fucking day? <br>I&#039;m sick of Ahsoka and i&#039;m sick of you retards.

So the famous Vader has a random apprentice that no one knew about not even hinted at existing when the actual main movies briefly discussed the Clone Wars? Come on. The story of Star Wars ended with Return of the Jedi and if Ahsoka didn&#039;t even briefly get implied to exist in the prequels she is discarded unimportant shit. And the only thing more annoying than Ahsoka is that cat dick sucker faggot Filoni who is in love with spamming her everywhere and using every single bad writing technique to keep her relevant especially time travel which is a huge can of worms because time travel is how you immediately invalidate any conflict in any story. Why with time travel you can prevent death which is what happened to Ahsoka she had to die, it was due, here comes Filoni using time travel to keep this irrelevant Mary Sue alive even though she should have died years ago and now I guess Filoni wants to invent new fan fiction to keep pretending this shitty character is important to Star Wars. I hope Ahsoka dooms the Star Wars franchise and whenever anyone complains tell them &quot;Lucas created Ahsoka&quot; take it up with Lucas because Disney never created her or the shit fest involving her.

He then called a Vietnamese colleague, Daniel Le, who had a seven-year-old son named Myca. Myca was an outgoing boy who enjoyed posing for pictures, so his parents thought he would be interested.

Landis opted not to seek a special waiver, either because he did not think that he would get permission for such a late hour or because he knew that he would not get approval to have young children in a scene with a large number of explosives. Casting agents were unaware that the children would be involved in the scene. Associate producer George Folsey Jr. told the children&#039;s parents not to tell any firefighters on the set that the children were part of the scene and hid them from a fire safety officer who also worked as a welfare worker.

Similar to this is the Discordian concept of the Law of Fives, which states that everything is connected, in some way, to the the number 5. Robert Anton Wilson, discussing the Law of Fives notes that it is always true that all things are connected to the number 5 given sufficient creativity on the interpretive powers of the interrogator. <br><br>Feminist critique has a problem. It appears to be nothing more than a game in which a person, such as yourself, takes an a thing, such as this trope, and then examines it in order to prove the fundamental principle of feminism, namely that All Men Are Bastards.
