But then she remembers how her mom gave her insecurities about her femininity, and she is reminded of some ghey news report she saw recently talking about trannies.. So from there she decides to be Mrs &quot;unconditionally accepting&quot; and not make a &quot;big deal&quot; about gender norms and expectations.

For the next several decades, Copeland would play key roles in various nefarious activities throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia. In 1947, he was dispatched to Damascus, Syria to serve as the CIA station chief and to orchestrate a series of coups that resulted in power being consolidated in the military and national security sectors. These were the first coups orchestrated by the newly formed CIA, but they would certainly not be the last. Along for the adventure was firstborn son Miles Copeland III, who had been born in London on May 4, 1944. On April 25, 1949, second son Ian, born just outside of Damascus, joined the family.</span>", "time": 1675502743, "resto": 180137027}, {"no": 180145200, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)04:27:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180144983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180144983</a><br><a href=\"#p180145123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180145123</a><br><a href=\"#p180145167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180145167</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From 1957 through 1968, the Copeland clan was stationed in Bei-rut, Lebanon, where Miles, Sr. served as that country\u2019s CIA station chief. In his memoirs, son Ian has described Beirut at that time as a \u201ccenter of intrigue and espionage.\u201d During the early years of that assignment, Copeland worked closely with such intelligence community luminaries as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and CIA chief Allen Dulles. Also during those years, the Copeland sons attended the American Com-munity School in Beirut, where Miles III served as the president of his senior class. When he was just sixteen, Miles also obtained a license to teach judo to the Lebanese Army. Of those years spent in Lebanon, Ian Copeland has written that he \u201cgrew up thinking we were stinking rich. We certainly lived like we were.\u201d Ian has attributed that lavish lifestyle to his father\u2019s rather lucrative expense account.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Following his stint in Beirut\u2014during which time he had frequently been on assignment in various hotspots throughout the Middle East, northern Africa and Asia\u2014Copeland played a more low-profile role in US intelligence operations. In 1988, he penned an article entitled \u201cSpooks for Bush\u201d that argued that the intelligence community heart-ily backed the presidential bid of former spymaster George H.W. Bush. Three years later, Miles Axe Copeland, Jr. passed away, survived by his wife, daughter and three sons.</span>", "time": 1675502825, "resto": 180137027}, {"no": 180145227, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)04:28:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180144983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180144983</a><br><a href=\"#p180145123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180145123</a><br><a href=\"#p180145167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180145167</a><br><a href=\"#p180145200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180145200</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From fall 1962 through 1966, Miles Copeland III attended Birmingham Southern College, spending one semester at the American University in Washington, DC. After that, he was off to Lebanon to attend the American University of Beirut, where he spent three years. During that time, he formed his first business partnership with, again according to his online bio, \u201chis close friend, Amr Ghaleb, son of Egypt\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon (known to run the largest spy network in Lebanon).\u201d While at work at the business entity he dubbed Middle East Security Consult-ants, Copeland was reportedly fond of answering the phone with the greeting: \u201cCIA, how can we help you?\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After graduating from the university in 1969, Miles joined the rest of the family in the UK, where he quickly began serving as a manager for the band Wishbone Ash and signing other new musical acts, including Joan Armatrading, Al Stewart and the Climax Blues Band. By 1974, he had launched his first record label, British Talent Managers (BTM), be-come a partner in a concert-booking agency and started a music indus-try magazine, College Event. As Ian later recalled, \u201cWhen [Miles] found it difficult to get press on some of his bands, he simply determined to start his own magazine.\u201d He also joined with then-unknown attorney Allen Grubman to form what would become the most powerful music industry law firm in the country.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was, needless to say, a natural progression for a kid who had grown up immersed in the world of covert operations and whose first business venture had been a security consulting firm co-owned by the son of another powerful figure in the intelligence community. The publication College Event, not surprisingly, employed some classic spytrade subter-fuge: Copeland kept his name off the publication by employing a front-man editor so that he could then write glowing endorsements of his own bands, disguised, of course, as objective reviews</span>", "time": 1675502886, "resto": 180137027}, {"no": 180145310, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)04:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180141458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180141458</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reminds me of butthole eyes.

These days I sleep about every third day for 3-5 hours, and the time between are filled with narcoleptic episodes usually between 15 minutes and a couple of hours here and there.<br><br><a href=\"#p180149029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180149029</a><br>I don&#039;t usually snore, I think I had hay fever allergies or something at the time.", "time": 1675514310, "resto": 180128388}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 180147726, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:29:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Screech is dead.", "filename": "Best-screech-", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1284, "h": 856, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1675510180449335, "time": 1675510180, "md5": "Vp7/4MT9a/Q9zuVEH57Y/Q==", "fsize": 1216536, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "screech-is-dead", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 10, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 10}, {"no": 180147741, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:30:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wish he would come back to life so he could die again.", "time": 1675510229, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180147743, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:30:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180147726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180147726</a><br>rip screech. you led an odd life.", "time": 1675510233, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180147754, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Its alright cause im burning in hell", "time": 1675510260, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180147760, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:31:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180147743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180147743</a><br>Smell my finger", "time": 1675510276, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180147788, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:32:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180147726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180147726</a><br>RIP DJ Qualls.", "time": 1675510343, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180147964, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:40:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Was he vaxxed?", "time": 1675510814, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180148476, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:09:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180147726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180147726</a><br>Was he the first 4Chan self-insert character?", "time": 1675512542, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180148635, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:16:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180147726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180147726</a><br>Anyone else play Saved By Your Balls?", "time": 1675512971, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180148803, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:23:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180148476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180148476</a><br>No, you already had movies like Revenge of the Nerds and The Last American Virgin way before that", "time": 1675513407, "resto": 180147726}, {"no": 180149028, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "is his house okay?", "time": 1675514006, "resto": 180147726}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 180136883, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:11:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "itt: 2001-2010 /tv/", "filename": "foamy", "ext": ".png", "w": 1092, "h": 786, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 179, "tim": 1675483872579206, "time": 1675483872, "md5": "pezFYA9rufqA+b25Na327A==", "fsize": 341605, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "itt-20012010-tv", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 136, "images": 30, "unique_ips": 84, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 180136951, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:13:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrc<wbr>BMLC2fFQ", "time": 1675484009, "resto": 180136883}, {"no": 180136961, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:13:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "JO\u2019Z HEER", "filename": "76E69B3E-888E-42A8-ABDB-68DCFA110197", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675484031205633, "time": 1675484031, "md5": "W6x8RalfpypjLUETb/8PPw==", "fsize": 21971, "resto": 180136883}, {"no": 180136975, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:14:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180136883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180136883</a><br>Oh shit this takes me back", "time": 1675484063, "resto": 180136883}, {"no": 180136998, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:14:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UH<wbr>5sYVfQAs", "time": 1675484095, "resto": 180136883}, {"no": 180137015, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:15:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180136883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180136883</a>", "filename": "maxresdefault", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675484130771990, "time": 1675484130, "md5": "FKrq3lPsKqvLDRdCcYStPA==", "fsize": 44807, "resto": 180136883}, {"no": 180137017, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:15:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180136883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180136883</a><br>Q IS FOR DR.
