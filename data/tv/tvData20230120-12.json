Up to half of all Yanomami males die violent deaths in the constant conflict between neighboring communities over local resources. Often these confrontations lead to Yanomami leaving their villages in search of new ones.[27] Women are often victims of physical abuse and anger. Inter-village warfare is common, but does not too commonly affect women. When Yanomami tribes fight and raid nearby tribes, women are often raped, beaten, and brought back to the shabono to be adopted into the captor&#039;s community. Wives may be beaten frequently, so as to keep them docile and faithful to their husbands.[29] Sexual jealousy causes much of the violence.[28] Women are beaten with clubs, sticks, machetes, and other blunt or sharp objects. Burning with a branding stick occurs often, and symbolizes a male&#039;s strength or dominance over his wife.[19]<br><br>Yanomami men have been known to kill children while raiding enemy villages.[35] Helena Valero, a Brazilian woman kidnapped by Yanomami warriors in the 1930s, witnessed a Karawetari raid on her tribe:<br><br>They killed so many. I was weeping for fear and for pity but there was nothing I could do. They snatched the children from their mothers to kill them, while the others held the mothers tightly by the arms and wrists as they stood up in a line. All the women wept... The men began to kill the children; little ones, bigger ones, they killed many of them.[35]", "time": 1674210131, "resto": 179483221}, {"no": 179483372, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)05:22:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179483340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179483340</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sensor whips</span><br>cool name", "time": 1674210163, "resto": 179483221}, {"no": 179483394, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)05:23:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179483360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179483360</a><br><br>The civilised modern society <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2011, Baltimore Police Department reported 196 homicides, the city&#039;s first time having fewer than 200 homicides since having 199 in 1978.[3][4] That number is far lower than the peak homicide count of 353 in 1993.[5] The drop in 2011 was significant, when measured by the number of homicides, but the homicide rate was in the same range as the late 1980s when the city population was 130,000 higher.

You would first need to bracket any sort of category or template that your brain is imposing on your own sensory experience. Sort of like when people have a stroke and their mind loses the ability to organise sense data into memorised sets of things and people can no longer tell what any of the information they are receiving is meant to be, because no unconscious programming is organising and parsing it into templates and structures. You intend a \u201ctree\u201d based on your concept of a tree. You passively absorb millions of intentions like this through life and use them to interpret immediate sensory information. A good example for a social or historical equivalent is walking into a church. Imagine you go in with no frame of reference for anything you are seeing on a passive level- all of it would cease to make any sense at all. Your every thought and inclination on a very basic level is axiomatic and pre programmed, and on top of that massively influenced by the language you speak, the culture you grow up in, the people around you. What your brain isn\u2019t already forcing you to think or do it is actively sponging from your surroundings. This idea that people can self create or really free themselves mentally and determine their own choices entirely uninfluenced is completely impossible. Everything you think and do is referring to innate evolutionary stocks of concepts you HAVE TO see the world through, and then outside influences acting on you on top of that. If you just view eywa as a living embodiment of nature, the free will thing makes no sense. It\u2019s like saying that you didn\u2019t design your own body and mind in some pre existent totally uninfluenced void, ergo you aren\u2019t free.

In fact, he didn&#039;t readmit them at all. Certainly they&#039;d been expelled, by Edward I in 1290. In 1655, Menasseh ben Israel, a leader of the Jewish community in Amsterdam, came to England to persuade Cromwell to let them back in. In December that year, a conference of lawyers, merchants and theologians met to discuss the issue, but failed to reach a verdict. According to one account, &quot;the Preachers kept pelting one another so furiously with Texts of Scripture, and wiping their Spectacles, that the Debates continued for four Days; though very little was said on the Question of the Jews&#039; resettlement.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Members of the existing Jewish community in London (yes, there were Jews in Britain before 1656, albeit in hiding) then petitioned Cromwell to let them worship openly, but their petition was ignored.

It was quite true: in September 1656 certain Jews at Amsterdam had applied to the King rejecting the petition of their brethren to Cromwell, in respect of which Charles had graciously acknowledged their support and suggested that any contributions they cared to make to his cause would be rewarded with patronage hereafter. Finally after anxious moments in August 1664 the Jews were at last legally readmitted by Charles II.</span>", "time": 1674218913, "resto": 179483954}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 179480812, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:28:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;DUDE WORMHOLES AND STRING THEORY LMAO</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TIME TRAVEL WILL TOTALLY BE REAL BY 2050</span><br>Fuck this hack", "filename": "1674161362025681", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 452, "h": 679, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674203290994331, "time": 1674203290, "md5": "pMrUqtE5xQwEvlODYLNW8g==", "fsize": 31481, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dude-wormholes-and-string-theory-lmao", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 63, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 48}, {"no": 179480852, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:29:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179480812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179480812</a><br>Who would win in a melee with a weapon of their choice?", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-20 002909", "ext": ".png", "w": 1226, "h": 830, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1674203379450428, "time": 1674203379, "md5": "tN8NT+GOcgFUkayz/vMpMg==", "fsize": 758964, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179480855, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:29:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "anytime this guy appears on a television show I turn it off", "time": 1674203383, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179480989, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:34:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179480812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179480812</a><br>buy my book", "filename": "send me into space pls", "ext": ".png", "w": 1006, "h": 233, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 28, "tim": 1674203645052725, "time": 1674203645, "md5": "5nn+RN2B7y2DbRmdrl3OUQ==", "fsize": 20525, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179481027, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:35:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179480812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179480812</a><br>At least he gives people something to be hopeful for, you duck", "time": 1674203713, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179481067, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:36:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179481027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179481027</a><br>How is he better than a preacher or a ghost hunter?", "time": 1674203801, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179481403, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:50:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "quantum", "filename": "something something string theory", "ext": ".png", "w": 1014, "h": 169, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 20, "tim": 1674204620967993, "time": 1674204620, "md5": "GWZhkzMxOe3m8qHCsi9AZw==", "fsize": 15295, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179481487, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:53:54", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "negative energy and positive energy", "ext": ".png", "w": 1014, "h": 256, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 31, "tim": 1674204834776236, "time": 1674204834, "md5": "uTcjv6EDt05BIAiyaocgxA==", "fsize": 24486, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179481507, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179480812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179480812</a><br>At least he&#039;s a real scientist, unlike Bill Nye or the arrogant black science guy.", "time": 1674204869, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179481517, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179480812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179480812</a><br>Cocku", "time": 1674204915, "resto": 179480812}, {"no": 179481558, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:56:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How is it possible that /tv/ doesn&#039;t know about his O&amp;A appearances<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnM<wbr>MirZBMlc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hello Dr. Ka-</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ahhhh!

They also found a naked photo of one of the boys he molested, but they couldn&#039;t used the photo at trial, because the boy refused to admit that he was the boy in the photo. The FBI in addition reviewed a tape found in his home featuring only little boys who had visited his Neverland Ranch. He only walked at trial, because he pressured Wade Robson and Macaulay Culkin to deny he ever molested them. Witnesses who worked at Neverland Ranch had seen both boys being sexually abused, but Robson and Culkin denied it.

So marriage becomes no more or less valued than the decision not to get married. Having a child out of wedlock is seen as no worse than having one within. Drugs are a personal choice, a legitimate thing to experiment with, and it shouldn&#039;t be anyone else&#039;s business what you put into your body, let alone who you choose to have sex with, how often and in what context. Divorce is no big deal. Religion is just outdated irrational nonsense designed to ruin your fun and hurt sexual minorities. Etc..<br><br>But it turns out the people who are the most free are those with a strong family around them to support them through life. Someone slave to drugs is not free.

The Paris disputation of 1240 and the subsequent Talmud burnings were symptomatic of a new mood not merely at the French court. Popes Gregory IX and Innocent IV also condemned the Talmud from 1239 onwards; the Jews of the thirteenth century were increasingly seen as Judaic heretics who had broken away from their ancient beliefs, which had pointed the way to Christianity. Because the Rabbis had failed to impose true orthodoxy on their fellow Jews, it was legitimate for Christian authorities to do so. In other words, the Christian authorities, well-read in their Josephus, could see a large gap between Jewish practise of the years around 1200 and temple times.</span>", "time": 1674218580, "resto": 179483759}, {"no": 179486342, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)07:46:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179486274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179486274</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m just saying that rabbinic Judaism and Christianity are completely seperate religions</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they both trace their roots to Judaism</span><br>You lost me there senpai.", "time": 1674218780, "resto": 179483759}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 179466369, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:53:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;2010: cable tv is...

Basil Williams photographed him there and thought that he still looked his usual suave self, but he noticed that he seemed very tired and that he stumbled once in the auditorium. Williams recalls that Grant rehearsed for half an hour before &quot;something seemed wrong&quot; all of a sudden, and he disappeared backstage. Grant was taken back to the Blackhawk Hotel where he and his wife had checked in, and a doctor was called and discovered that Grant was having a massive stroke, with a blood pressure reading of 210 over 130. Grant refused to be taken to the hospital. The doctor recalled: &quot;The stroke was getting worse. In only fifteen minutes he deteriorated rapidly. It was terrible watching him die and not being able to help. But he wouldn&#039;t let us.&quot; By 8:45p.m., Grant had slipped into a coma and was taken to St. Luke&#039;s Hospital in Davenport, Iowa.[347] He spent 45 minutes in the emergency room before being transferred to intensive care.

They\u2019re very jealous and bitter people. Their country suffered major setbacks after getting their asses handed to them in WW2, their nation was in ruins after this and they were extremely poor and poverty fuelled, and so since then they\u2019ve always been in the shadow of the other bigger and more influential western nations, like France, the UK and even their former allies the Germans. Not to mention the increasing influence of America and other nations of the world. Italy just became irrelevant. Even today they have slums in Italy still that are full of extreme poverty.<br><br>So after this, all they had left of influence was their food. It was the only thing they had left to be prideful of and so they can\u2019t stand to see other nations take what they see as theirs and change it or make it better. They\u2019re hanging into their last shred of dignity and relevance by playing ignorant, shouting and screaming if someone dares to cook \u201ctheir\u201d food. Of course the reality being it isn\u2019t their food anymore and that Italian food in Italy has gone backwards, suffering from their years of poverty and that the evolution of their food has continued in much richer nations, America for instance has way better Italian food nowadays than Italy. You can also find better Italian food in France, which is the thing they hate the most. The fact that French food became the dominant force in gastronomy really gets to them.
