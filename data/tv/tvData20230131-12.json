The original material isn&#039;t sacred texts or something. It&#039;s good, and no matter what adaptation is made of it, it will carry on existing, but adaptations do not need to be 1:1 up to the absurd. Especially if made by one of the original creators. All creatives will tell you if they had the opportunity to revisit something they made, they would probably change some stuff.<br><br>In general, people with such bigoted opinions are not that upfront, as they don&#039;t want to be called out, so they will hide behind things like biology, historical accuracy etc. A classic example I like to point at is Game of Throne. Some people complained that there were too many female lead roles, unrealistic according to them, given the medieval context. It&#039;s not a direct jab at feminism and so-called &quot;woke culture&quot;, even though it really is that in the end, but it is hidden behind an historial question. A funny one, considering GoT isn&#039;t even trying to be historically accurate.<br><br>This episode of TLOU deviates a bit from the game, for sure. However, as you said it does not fundamentally change the story. It also paints a secondary character under a much more human light than the game. Originally, Bill is your good old survivalist, with a &quot;fuck you&quot; attitude. Quite a common trope in post-apocalyptic flicks. The TV shows makes him a lot more interesting &amp; subtle.

It gives a lot to Bill as a character and creates a completely new Frank, but doesn&#039;t give the rest of the story more than the original game did. The season is going to be tight enough already and I will remember this episode later on if there are problems with pacing or the Joel/Ellie relationship feels forced.

But a completely pathetic, new age, insane cult leader. Those extreme Protestant sects followed Jesus as a of a heroic mortal chosen by God, sometimes viewed as the most perfect man possible, but Defoe&#039;s Jesus appeals to the lowest common denominator of contemporary times. Every quotidian vice, every pathetic weakness of character, the lowly type feels everyone must experience, and everyone must be oriented to in the same lowly sphere. So Jesus cannot be great, that&#039;s just a mythic illusion, what makes him great is being as poor as the rest of us and finding the strength like a weak little redditor to do le moral. But of course morality for these people doesn&#039;t mean much.

The movie is profound for only midwits. A midwittery typical of educated theologians like your father probably is. Another name for the educated literati. But do they really know philosophy or theology? Not a jot. The most basic of incarnations of the life of Jesus makes the most basic of appeals and references in the history of Christianity, and such people take it as a genuine representment of a line of Christian thought. Do you know how stupid it is to have Jesus being offered a happy family life as opposed to his historical one? That&#039;s more fit for an Adult Swim cartoon. Again, this is simply just portraying Jesus as like everyone else. Nothing exceptional, no real certainty in his ideal, just like every other wishy washy suburbanite faggot today.

Snyder wasn\u2019t great but he brought a larger than life feel that the genre deserves. I can\u2019t think of anyone who could be the fiege type for DC, everyone who is competent doesn\u2019t read or care for comics, those who do partake in DC comics suck, Geoff Johns for example. I think the reality is there shouldn\u2019t be a super interconnected universe. Directors should work in their own corners and do their thing.

It&#039;s cliche, but; &quot;Watching a trainwreck in slow motion - I just can&#039;t look away&quot; explains a bit of mine and I&#039;d wager, a lot of the anons here&#039;s fascination. It&#039;s the very slow and very public death of a young boy turned into something else because of outside interference. This boy was once someone to pity, but he&#039;s turned into such an ugly slob himself, both inside and out, that it&#039;s not hard to pity him. At the end of the day though, he is a creation of his environment and more importantly, the people surrounding him. Probably most likely his mother and father. There are theories here and there, some about molestation, others as some kind of &quot;jewish humiliation ritual&quot;.

In the books Harry mostly experiences interest from Ginny, Cho, Pavarti, and Romalda. In the movies a case can be made that sexual/romantic tension exists between Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna. In the books and movies, as far as what is cannon, these girls are the only ones who make any sense because they are the only ones who want to date Harry back. Someone like Tonks or Katie or Fleur never express interest. In your own fanfiction you can certainly change that but in canon, these six are the only ones shown to want to date Harry back at any time. Any others are faceless gigglers to Harry.<br><br>We don\u2019t really learn much about what Harry finds physically attractive, but instead be tend to find out who he finds attractive. In a physical sense his descriptions of Hermione are mostly neutral in the books. Frissy haired, buck toothed, etc. Luna also experiences similar treatment. While his judgements aren\u2019t harsh, they don\u2019t speak to deep attraction. Protuberant eyes as a description is not flattering. What we do learn is that Harry likes shiny hair. Our best insights into what Harry actually finds physically attractive is found in his musings on Ginny and Cho. He likes athletes. He likes shiny hair.<br><br>Harry\u2019s humor seems to fit the Weasley model the best. Of the six girls to express interest, we know little about Pavarti, Romelda, and Cho\u2019s humor. We do know that Harry has a similar love for pranks as Ginny. Harry is often uncertain if Luna is joking or not, and finds more things humorous than Hermione. The best fit for Harry\u2019s humor is Ginny.", "filename": "WB-HP-F6-half-blood-prince-ginny-harry-in-great-hall", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2300, "h": 1533, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675156445769963, "time": 1675156445, "md5": "h4ibPXshlhAPsOMcmB3Rew==", "fsize": 2711440, "resto": 179970389}, {"no": 179971167, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:15:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179971146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179971146</a><br>Most of Harry\u2019s hobbies are ones he can share with Ron. Ron introduced him to wizarding hobbies. Quidditch, chess, exploding snap, chocolate frog card collecting, etc. We know Ginny and Cho play Quidditch. We also see Ginny participating in these other pastimes. Hermione is show to like reading and knitting. Luna\u2019s hobbies tend to be art, animals, or journalistic. Parvati is linked with Lavender in liking traditionally feminine things like makeup and gossip. We know Romelda is untalented at quidditch from the tryouts in book six. While some of the girls we can\u2019t rule out sharing interests with Harry, the obvious stated front runner is Ginny.<br><br>As far as understanding Harry and the trauma he has experienced, it is clear that Harry and Cho didn\u2019t intuitively know how to comfort one another or help with each others trauma. Ginny, Hermione, and Luna all at different points help Harry when he is emotional to overcome some of his trauma, and are helped by Harry. Hermione has the best understanding of what Harry has been through. Ginny has the best understanding of Harry\u2019s relationship with Voldemort and the self doubt that causes. Luna has the best understanding of Harry\u2019s grief. The other two don\u2019t demonstrate an understanding of Harry.<br><br>It is easily to rule out Pavarti and Romelda at this point.

I mean, Avatar 1 already sunk Titanic a long time ago and THREE (fucking 75%!) of the top 4 movies are already from ONE MAN. That is a GENUINELY HISTORICAL ACHIEVEMENT from Cameron that I think will NEVER be beaten in the history of cinema. In one hundred years from now, film historians will be studying James Cameron. I think Avatar 2 will easily beat Titanic (it&#039;s already VERY close to doing so), but then Titanic will beat Avatar 2 because of its rerelease next month. But that&#039;s irrelevant to Cameron because the third highest-grossing movie of all time is going to be a Cameron movie either way. And Avatar 1 is still the Number 1 movie of all time. So Cameron doesn&#039;t care what happens at this point and neither do I. Frankly, all I really wanted for Avatar 2 was for Avatar 2 to beat The Fart Awakens. And it already did that a few days ago. Cameron is basically just competing with himself at this point by rereleasing Titanic next month while Avatar 2 is still in theaters. Also, even though I thought that Avatar 2 is better than Avatar 1 in some ways, I still hope that Avatar 1 remains the highest-grossing movie of all time and I still think it&#039;s possible for Avatar 2 to end its theatrical run at Number 3 (even after Titanic is rereleased next month). In fact, I hope that Avatar 2 ends its theatrical run at Number 3 so that Endgay can be sandwiched between two Avatar films. lol", "filename": "avatar_always_wins", "ext": ".png", "w": 1628, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1675163173073695, "time": 1675163173, "md5": "RVU64mNQGX0V2MMgOzg9SA==", "fsize": 1426788, "resto": 179958878}, {"no": 179973778, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)06:08:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179973686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179973686</a><br><br>Absolute SLUT.

Precisely 28 days later, Jim wakes up to a different world. He meets Mark and Selena who take him back home the next day. Mark is then killed that evening, and Jim and Selena seek shelter at Frank and Hannah&#039;s apartment. Frank says that the trip to the blockade could take about 2-3 days. The trip takes roughly 2. Frank is killed, and the soldiers take in Jim, Selena and Hannah. We&#039;re right around 31-32 days after the initial outbreak.<br>Major West tells Jim &quot;8 days ago I found Jones with a gun in his mouth. He said he was going to kill himself because there is no future.&quot; This of course is when it is revealed the soldiers&#039; broadcast is all about luring women.<br>So here&#039;s what I realized:<br>Let&#039;s say there&#039;s 32 days since the initial infection at this point.
