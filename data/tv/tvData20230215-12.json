He was a physicist with a medical degree, as well as five or six others, and he owned a lot of patents that made him extremely wealthy. I used to park my car a few blocks from their house in the middle of the night and in my tennis shoes stroll leisurely down the street, vault over their back fence and open the back door, which she left unlatched for me. Her husband was usually asleep upstairs in his room, and I would walk up the back stairs, where she\u2019d be waiting for me, sometimes in the shower. For some reason we conducted a lot of our sex in the bathroom, where she was both athletic and imaginative. Then we\u2019d either go to bed or I\u2019d leave. Being upstairs with her husband so close by added excitement to the adventure. Before dawn I usually got up and hid under her bed in case he came in, and sometimes I would fall asleep, which was taking a chance because sometimes I snored.

Since our kids used to play together, we had almost a familial relationship.<br><br>Lenore\u2019s husband, Arthur, was very intelligent but affected an aw-shucks persona. He pretended to be unsophisticated and said things like \u201cGosh!\u201d \u201cGee whiz!\u201d \u201cGolly!\u201d and \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d On the other hand, he kept a loaded Saturday night special in his room.<br>One summer night, I climbed over the fence and found the door unlatched as usual. After opening it, I turned to tighten the latch; I was supposed to lock the door after entering. While I was doing so, Arthur walked out of the kitchen and was standing two or three feet away from me in the dark when I turned around. I jumped about four feet, and he beat me by at least two feet.

The prop man kept promising to get it right, but one day when he wasn\u2019t looking, I stuffed his horn with Kleenex, and the next time Homolka honked his horn onstage and the prop man, with perfect timing, blew his, there was complete silence. He blew harder and harder. Still no sound. Homolka got red in the face and started bellowing at him from the stage while the prop man reached deeper and deeper into his lungs and blew with all his heart\u2014so hard that he blew his false teeth out of his mouth.

The point is that the relationship is a plot contrivance that is never shown to affect the characters beyond the most simplistic narrative imaginable.

But there&#039;s still so much more. You see, in the Clone Wars it&#039;s explained that this animal is actually owned by a man named Zeeboo Beeboo who had been misfeeding it prior to the events we see in TPM. Coincidentally--he looks a little like Jar Jar and therefore, via this subtle foreshadowing via flatulence, we see the revolutionary embers that will spark the fire of a rebellion (what a set up!). But wait, there&#039;s even more at work here! What can be interpreted as a simple fart joke is actually a direct echo of Luke/Leia&#039;s incestuous kiss (you have to be familiar with Ring theory to truly understand this). But given the architypal nature/machine dicotomy and the performative protest of the animal&#039;s fart, which deftly signals to the audience the coming of rebellion, we see the brother/sister kiss as the symbolic act of defiance against a hegomonic empire!<br><br>Lucas is a genius who layers his films so they work on multiple levels.

KDP allows you to upload your screenplay as an e-book and make it available for purchase on the Amazon Kindle store.<br><br>To publish a screenplay on Kindle, you will need to format it correctly as an e-book. Amazon provides guidelines for formatting e-books using tools like Microsoft Word or Kindle Create. You can also hire a professional formatter to do this for you.<br><br>Once your screenplay is formatted and ready to go, you can sign up for KDP and upload your e-book to the platform. You will need to set a price for your screenplay and choose your distribution options. KDP also provides tools to help you market your e-book and track your sales.<br><br>It&#039;s important to note that while you can self-publish screenplays on Kindle, they may not be as popular as other types of books on the platform. However, if you have a unique and compelling screenplay, publishing it on Kindle could be a way to get it in front of a wider audience.<br><br>Okay now this is actually me now. Something else you could do is print copies (that&#039;s gonna cost ya) and then hand them out to libraries for free so they can can hand them out for free. You could also pay affiliate marketers to get your screenplay &quot;out there,&quot; but this of course is going to cost you a pretty penny.

Something has broken. You no longer feel some thing which until then fortified you. The feeling of your existence, the impression of belonging to or being in the world, is starting to slip away from you. Your past, your present and your future merge into one. You are 25 years old, you have 29 teeth, three shirts and eight socks, 500 francs a month to live on, a few books you no longer read, a few records you no longer play. You don&#039;t want to remember anything else. Here you sit, and you only want to wait, just to wait until there&#039;s nothing left to wait. You go back to your room, you undress, you slip between the sheets, you turn out the light, you close your eyes. Now is the time when dream-women, too quickly undressed, crowd in around you, the time when you reread ad nauseam books you&#039;ve a read a thousand times before, when you toss and turn for hours without getting to sleep. This is the hour when your eyes wide open in the darkness, you hand groping towards the foot of the narrow bed in search of an ashtray, matches, a last cigarette, you calmly measure the sticky extent of your unhappiness. Unhappiness did not swoop down on you, it insinuated itself almost ingratiatingly. How many times you have repeated the same amputated gesture, the same journey&#039;s that lead nowhere? All you have left to fall back on are your tuppeny-halfpenny boltholes, your idiotic patience, the thousand and one detours that always lead you back unfailingly to your starting point. All that counts is your solitude: whatever you do, wherever you go, nothing that you see has any importance, everything you do, you do in vain, nothing that seek is real.
