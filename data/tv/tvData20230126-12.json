Studios consolidated and became streaming services. <br><br>One of the reasons streaming was profitable was the small overhead. When they started making their own mediocre shows and movies, they didn&#039;t realize they relied on traditional productions. That is: movies that were made for theaters. Shows that began on television. <br>The audience want to watch classic blockbusters. Streaming didn&#039;t perfect serialized TV storytelling with actual continuity (as opposed to purely episodic fare from the 70s). That already happened with Breaking Bad, the Wire, the Sopranos. And also, to an unusual extent, sci fi and comedy shows like the Office, Farscape, or Star Trek DS9. <br>Arguably, art has been in decline for a century as mediums get exhausted in creative possibilities (this happened over 100 years ago for the real classical forms, like painting). However, at least cinema struck a golden mean between artistry, popularity, and profit that was honed by decades of market experience. Even if there&#039;s shit, it still produced gold. <br>Now, streaming has took on all this money, and it started producing its own shows in a market that&#039;s not been honed. And worse, it&#039;s gone off the golden mean and into mass production of schlock. Streaming shows are overwhelmingly focused on mass production, and yet such productions are simply too expensive. It&#039;s lost the nice balance of episodic vs. serialized continuity, for &#039;binge-worthy&#039; schlock that turns into meandering soap operas.<br>The thing about people is they actually like quality stories and art. Human beings intuitively know that Rembrandt is beautiful and postmodern art is shit. Nothing esoteric, they just know. <br>Streaming services, even those spun from traditional studios, just aren&#039;t prepared for either the artistry (which the corporations don&#039;t care about nor understand how vital it is for enjoyment) or the overhead and price.", "filename": "roboco", "ext": ".png", "w": 533, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674725529528897, "time": 1674725529, "md5": "fI6c8KIJd0adxYTQOSpNxg==", "fsize": 195711, "resto": 179747938}, {"no": 179749801, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:32:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179749228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179749228</a><br>Any decent web browser will block ads and give you background playback.", "time": 1674725531, "resto": 179747938}, {"no": 179749809, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:32:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179749744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179749744</a><br>You&#039;re almost on point.", "filename": "hitlercomic", "ext": ".png", "w": 684, "h": 2842, "tn_w": 30, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674725552849683, "time": 1674725552, "md5": "Bt6FwNbGE5rpYHCwuaO3Jw==", "fsize": 446198, "resto": 179747938}, {"no": 179749851, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:34:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179749800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179749800</a><br>First paragraph nailed it.

A great deal of mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or \u2018art\u2019 as the Hobbits preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that follows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be quoted.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThis,\u2019 he says, \u2018is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke is not known, all the legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district, especially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and Southern Star.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cHow Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went further from the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the south slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of course, to have done everything before the people of the Shire, whom they refer to as \u201ccolonists\u201d; but in this case their claim is, I think, likely to be true.</span>", "filename": "1669370866707724", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 289, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674711803897304, "time": 1674711803, "md5": "L8VuAujaluaFwDMLNn2SGg==", "fsize": 20997, "resto": 179738032}, {"no": 179744094, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:44:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179744054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179744054</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;...And certainly it was from Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as still passed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting.

It grows abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the North, where it is never found wild, and flourishes only in warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have been carried up the Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and our own days. But even the D\u00fanedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits first put it into pipes. Not even the Wizards first thought of that before we did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago, and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.\u201d</span>", "filename": "hits pipe", "ext": ".png", "w": 390, "h": 477, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674711865531297, "time": 1674711865, "md5": "perMfg4kbDhnqFlIbk3wsw==", "fsize": 308626, "resto": 179738032}, {"no": 179744230, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "he has been banned by a janny... this is beyond my skill to heal, he needs moot medicine", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 1427, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674712118433194, "time": 1674712118, "md5": "c7AzEtOgvLqTVz56dvp6RA==", "fsize": 784758, "resto": 179738032}, {"no": 179744414, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:55:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179743814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179743814</a><br>bump!!!", "filename": "b", "ext": ".png", "w": 527, "h": 344, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 81, "tim": 1674712509631213, "time": 1674712509, "md5": "UBFck2fX7ughV0uW6q8uJA==", "fsize": 319348, "resto": 179738032}, {"no": 179744464, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:56:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179742557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179742557</a><br>very nice anon", "filename": "tolkien shelf", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2379, "h": 1424, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1674712593531577, "time": 1674712593, "md5": "ae1I9mnUsKp2zWt4Pg9tVA==", "fsize": 776909, "resto": 179738032}, {"no": 179744537, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:58:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The thread is finished, my Lord.

My son (10) and I have seen just about every movie we&#039;ve wanted to with pretty much just us. Not just good times watching goofy shit like Sonic, but we went and saw del Toro&#039;s Pinocchio. I didn&#039;t expect it to be such a powerful movie about fathers and sons, and especially with such heavy WW2/fascism vibes, and my kid (obviously) doesn&#039;t know much about WW2. Since we had the place to ourselves, I ended up giving him an impromptu history lesson and we talked pretty seriously about the dads in the film (some good, some bad, with a lot of messages about even though people get angry or upset they&#039;re trying their best and they love you regardless). We&#039;ve never had any arguments, and the worse that&#039;s ever happened is I&#039;ve scolded him for doing some dumb shit (and explained why said shit was dumb), but I could tell he was really taking in everything the movie was saying. He was quiet afterwards, just thinking, and it made me so incredibly happy to see my son understand and digest some heavy themes. <br>I dunno why it never really hit me until then, but I realised how much he loved going to see these movies with me. They weren&#039;t just surface entertainment or something to do, they were something we did together, we&#039;d talk about the movies, what we liked, what we didn&#039;t, what characters were saying or doing. Not like we&#039;ve ever been distant, just that those empty cinemas and conversations were just for us and he cherishes them.

Godfather II examined Michael&#039;s fall with extensive parallels to the romanticised gangster past of Vito (which I also think is present in the first movie). Pacino&#039;s acting in II is widely considered by many to be his best performance for obvious reasons. The music is also a step up and Hyman Roth is a really great villain for Michael that plays on his relationship with his father. The mind games and emphasis on non-verbal communication are really highlighted here and definitely a step up from I. Conflict with Fredo is executed perfectly and the ending is absolute kino. I think the runtime is a bit long but if you have the intermission or are watching at home it&#039;s not that big of a deal. Lastly, Michael in II is one of the &quot;literally me&quot; characters - I&#039;m surprised more people don&#039;t identify with him.<br><br>Godfather I is definitely kino, but I think the perfect execution of the themes, music as well as the acting in GFII elevate it above the first. Personally, I think that the humor in GF I is too lighthearted for me in comparison to the rest of the film (take the cannoli etc.) and the second film&#039;s tone is much more consistent. It&#039;s a matter of preference though and you&#039;re entitled to your opinion - they&#039;re both amazing parts of one of the greatest film series of all time.", "filename": "6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2012, "h": 1170, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1674733465933287, "time": 1674733465, "md5": "L8KBoEZYyD1Q2i5nlBofjQ==", "fsize": 778549, "resto": 179749933}, {"no": 179752693, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179749933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179749933</a><br>reminder in pt II Tom Hagen cucks Michael and impregnates Kay.

I guess I&#039;m more used to character studies in the form of books rather than films. The Goddard stuff I watched is also a character study but there is a much more coherent plot to move the story along which I appreciated. La Dolce Vita reminded me a little of In Search of Lost Time except by virtue of being a 3 hour film instead of a ~4500 page novel it was obviously inferior in both scope and detail. I had thought that there might have been an element of social commentary since the portrayals of paparazzo at the beginning of the film was pretty scathing as was (albeit to a lesser extent) the way the faithful believed the two children who claimed to see The Madonna and how they stampeded and tore apart the tree.<br>I&#039;ll absolutely concede to being a brainlet. Film is a visual medium so I always assume that great films will do something that takes advantage of that.

Identified with Satan, he is full of eyes, a diligent reaper, an old fugitive and wanderer like Cain, a beggar, a pedlar, an Arab nomad, a skeleton capering with sinners and misers in a juggler&#039;s dance.<br><br>But the nightmarish Angel presents a different face to the one who has &#039;died before death&#039;, or who has attained some measure of the apatheia of the saint. We are told that Azrael, Death, appears to our spirit in a form determined by our beliefs, actions, and dispositions during life. He may even manifest invisibly, &#039;so that a man may die of a rose in aromatic pain&#039; \u2013 or of a rotting stench.<br><br>When the soul sees Azrael, it &#039;falls in love&#039;, and its gaze is thus withdrawn from the body as if by a seduction. Great prophets and saints have even been politely invited by Death, who appears to them in corporeal form. Thus it was with Moses, and with Mohammed. When the Persian poet Rumi lay on his deathbed, Azrael appeared as a beautiful youth and said, &quot;I am come by divine command to enquire what commission the Master may have to entrust in me.&quot;<br><br>In fact, a strange connection becomes apparent between Mors and Amor, Love and Death.

Will Smith is the perfect cautionary tale of what happens when you bend the knee to a woman too much. I&#039;ve seen it happen IRL as well. Strong men who tone it down with their women because they love and respect them, or in cases just to avoid the headache of arguments, but over time the women&#039;s self inflated importance snowballs with her lack of respect for the man and she just ends up completely ruining him, de-manning him. They can&#039;t help it either, it&#039;s their nature to challenge men and to be disgusted by weakness. Problem is that men see things more pragmatically and don&#039;t consider it weakness to kneel to a woman they love and respect, they see it as merely a form of reverence for the personification of their love. Will Smith was one of the most charismatic men in the world at one point and look at the state of him. He&#039;s become a complete joke of a man whose masculinity is so damaged he looks like he&#039;s about to cry the majority of the time. Be careful with women, lads. Give them an inch and they&#039;ll not only take a mile but will turn into a witch and gradually suck the soul from you. You think she won&#039;t because she loves you but she won&#039;t even know she&#039;s doing it until it becomes the new natural state of the relationship.

The lore was explored beyond Lex Luthor and General Zod, the romance was explored beyond the usual love triangle between Superman, Clark Kent and Lois Lane, the other characters that permeated the setting were able to shine, and so on. For the first time Superman could reveal to Lois that he was her long-time friend Clark, for the first time Clark could be free to be Superman without having to lie to Lois, for the first time Superman/Clark Kent could date Lois for real, for the first time people could see Superman/Clark Kent and Lois as a couple, for the first time Superman/Clark Kent and Lois could marry. <br><br>This show was able to change the perception on the character and not only that it managed to help make the character grow in the comics as well because it was thanks to this show that DC editors finally relented and let the character become a married man same as the one from the show. Lots of fanboys and that includes tons of comic writers complained about that status quo change. They wanted the character to be stuck doing the same shit. That same Donner shit. But this show was able to change it all.<br><br>I am saying this because this show changed it all during the 90&#039;s. Superman now could be an older man with a wife without any of that annoying love triangle bullshit and have new adventures that doesn&#039;t revolve around just Lex Luthor or General Zod. During the 2000s a bunch of comic writers even tried to change the now prevalent status quo with a half-brained reboot so they could roll back the clock once again, but fans told them they wanted none of that shit.

Characters and story will be very one note because Gunn and the studio are terrified of change/originality and are trying to overcorrect for the complaints against Cavill\u2019s Superman. Incidentally this Superman will end up like Routh\u2019s, outwardly jolly but inwardly depressed (because of daddy issues) and a cuck. Basically Superman Returns but with jokes and musical scores crammed in, and action that will be several notches below MoS. The movie will get good reviews for being decent and from Gunn but overall it\u2019ll fail to excite audiences. In the end the general consensus will be that they should\u2019ve kept Cavill. Oh who are we kidding the company will go under before Gunn can even film, they can\u2019t even get money to promote Shazam 2 which is why you aren\u2019t seeing any ads.
