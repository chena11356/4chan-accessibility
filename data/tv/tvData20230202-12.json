They were seen near the port of Eden in southeastern Australia between 1840 and 1930. A pod of killer whales, which included amongst its members a distinctive male called Old Tom, would assist whalers in hunting baleen whales.[2] The killer whales would find target whales, shepherd them into Twofold Bay or neighbouring regions of coast, and then often swim many kilometres away from the location of the hunt to alert the whalers at their cottage to their presence and often help to kill the whales.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Old Tom&#039;s role was commonly to alert the human whalers to the presence of a baleen whale in the bay by breaching or tailslapping at the mouth of the Kiah River, which is one of the smallest rivers, where the Davidson family had their tiny cottages. This role endeared him to the whalers and led to the idea that he was \u201cleader of the pack,\u201d although such a role was more likely taken by a little known female (as is typical among killer whales).[2] The whale known as &quot;Stranger&quot; described as a leader of &quot;stranger&#039;s mob&quot; was a large 30 ft male.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the harpooning, some of the killer whales would even grab the ropes in their teeth and aid the whalers in hauling. The skeleton of Old Tom is on display at the Eden Killer Whale Museum, and significant wear marks still exist on his teeth from repeatedly grabbing fast-moving ropes.[2]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In return for their help, the whalers would anchor the carcass overnight[4] while the killer whales ate the tongue and lips of the whale, then haul it ashore.[2][3] The arrangement is a rare example of mutualism between humans and killer whales.[2] The arrangement was called &quot;the law of the tongue&quot;.[3] The killer whales would also feed on the many fish and birds that would show up to pick at the smaller scraps and runoff from the fishing.</span>", "time": 1675302711, "resto": 180041491}, {"no": 180047985, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:53:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180047916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180047916</a><br>If that were an anime hentai I would be into it.", "time": 1675302801, "resto": 180041491}, {"no": 180048036, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:54:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180041491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180041491</a><br>did it dead?", "time": 1675302879, "resto": 180041491}, {"no": 180048052, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:55:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180048036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180048036</a><br>ye he dieded", "time": 1675302917, "resto": 180041491}, {"no": 180048075, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:56:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180047734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180047734</a><br>Daddy long legs aren&#039;t spiders, they are broadly arachnids", "time": 1675302963, "resto": 180041491}, {"no": 180048084, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:56:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180047938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180047938</a><br>Shit like this is why I&#039;ve always thought that it might be possible to have an ethical orca show at a sea park.

Survival playing a huge role made every episode feel engaging, the island really felt like a character of its own, the way all the flashbacks culminate in the finale, how we learn about their troubled past, how we see their struggles making it onto that flight only for it to crash, really selling the point that it was fate that brought them all together. Season 1 was the only season with consistently good flashbacks. The god tier cliffhanger of the hatch and WAAAALT. It was perfect. I love season 1 so much.<br><br>Season 2 has some of the best additions in terms of lore but hasn&#039;t held up as well on rewatch because the filler is rough and its the worst kind of filler where the writers insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem meaningful when its not, filler that doesn&#039;t even explore its characters in any interesting way, its just there to seem like something exciting might be happening but it never does. The hatch may just be the peak of the show and the beginning and end of season 2 is excellent, a lot of the material in-between however is not great. Still a good season though <br><br>Season 3 is definitely better than 2 is, its more consistent, while there&#039;s still filler in 3, its done better, episodes like &quot;Tricia Tanaka is Dead&quot; is filler done in the best possible way, that said &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; is worse than any episode from season 2. I&#039;d say the weakest part about season 3 is the island material in the first 7 episodes, all of it feels like filler because the writers were clearly more focused on hydra island at the time. But once Kate escapes and we get &quot;Flashes Before Your Eyes&quot; the island starts getting more interesting again, then of course there&#039;s the barracks and the various dharma stations.

I love that score, and ultimately I really enjoyed the movie, especially the pacing, the build up over time and the human characters. The sets were surprisingly better (to me) than many of the middle era jap films I haven&#039;t watched. It was interesting to see where the Oxygen Destroyer used in Monsterverse came from as a concept. In og, it&#039;s a terrifying WMD the creator is horrified to see brought to mankind, for the consequences and parallels to the atomic bomb used in Japan only 9 years prior to this movie. Most of the japanese audience was alive to see those bombs used on their nation.

The Yattering subjects him to increasingly severe torments, including killing his cats and terrorizing his family, but these efforts all fail.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eventually Jack tricks the Yattering into violating its orders, allowing Jack to take advantage of a loophole and make the Yattering his slave. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Jacqueline Ess: Her Will And Testament&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jacqueline Ess is a housewife who attempts suicide after becoming bored with her life. She recovers only to find that she has an ability to change people&#039;s body shapes with her mind. She accidentally kills her therapist and then causes her husband&#039;s death by willing their bodies to tear apart or fold in on themselves.

If Dylan kills the sheriff then he\u2019ll spare him and his friend but he\u2019s not going to be an outright ally. Dylan and Kim think it through then they come to a conclusion. They contact the president to set something up and at night they go to meet the sheriff in the forest and basically the Sheriff shoots Kim dead and is beating the shit out of Dylan calling him useless and making him feel like shit until kim revealing she was wearing a bullet proof vest (they mentioned it several times before going to the meeting.) gets up and shoots the sherif.

I&#039;ve yet to see any definitive proof that anything which is largely accepted by the trans community is bad for them, and I&#039;m here to address these issues.<br><br>Let&#039;s get a hot topic out of the way first: gender reassignment surgery is as necessary for individuals experiencing severe gender dysphoria as chemo would be for a cancer patient. Yes, some people still unfortunately kill themselves. But, every single person who undergoes surgery who doesnt is a person whose life is saved. It is not cosmetic, it is life saving.<br><br>Secondly, estrogen is not bad for your mind or body in any way as an assigned-at-birth male. There is zero scientific evidence that it is. This is baseless and only serves to scare people away from taking the medicine they need<br><br>Third: it can be &quot;too late to change&quot;. I am 37 and I only began hrt 5 years ago. Within two years I was visually passing and now my voice sounds indistinguishable from any other woman&#039;s.<br><br>Finally, that it is bad for children to transition. Most children have no issue with this and think it&#039;s cool to know a trans individual. And giving children estrogen does in fact make it easier on them psychologically to go through their lives as a woman. There is zero evidence that any child has experienced adverse effects growing up compared to non-trans children.<br><br>I will talk to anyone about any of these things.
