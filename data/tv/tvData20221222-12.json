Every woman can age well, the issue is whether or not they pop out a kid in their late teens/early 20s and what they do about it. The stress, baby weight, and having to take care of a baby will usually make them balloon up like crazy and age 10 years in one year. Happens to every race be it latinas, whites or blacks. If you pop out a kid early and/or you are poor as a woman, you have a high possibility of ending up fat and aging hard from eating like shit and stress. Trailer park trash, ghetto hoes. The reason every latina in hollywood be it full or mixed looks so good is because of genes and being rich enough to be able to take care of themselves, also there is less rampant coke abuse and plastic surgery among minorities in hollywood except for some outliers like Whitney Houston or Michael Jackson for example.

According to Einherjar, Amazon wanted the Conan the Barbarian series to rival Game of Thrones as the platform\u2019s more adult-oriented fantasy series. Meanwhile, their Lord of the Rings series would be more family-focused. This was allegedly the plan made by Jeff Bezos himself as he explained below:<br><br>\u201c[Bezos] wanted something which would enable Amazon to dominate the fantasy market the same way Game of Thrones had done for HBO. To make that dominance complete though, they weren\u2019t looking for just one Game of Thrones, but two. One for the family market and one for the more adult market. One that would quite literally capture the exact same market that were engrossed in Game of Thrones.\u201d<br><br>And, after explaining that Conan the Barbarian was intended to take the Game of Thrones market, he had this to say about how great the show\u2019s development was going:<br><br>\u201cIt was the perfect property to fill the same need as Game of Thrones and they had the perfect showrunner for it, one Ryan Condal, then of Colony fame,\u201d Einherjar details. \u201cAnd the scripts he had written were extremely true to the original Robert E.

Game of Thrones dropped the ball once they ran out of book material, but there is no question that it showed you can make adult fantasy into a successful product. I believe at one point it was the biggest show ever, although I\u2019m not sure how they measure those things.<br><br>I never liked that show, although I freely admit many scenes from the earlier seasons had quality to them. The nastiness of the show turned me off, and while I hate young adult stuff, I wanted something less nihilistic and pointless. Also, the borderline pornographic violence and sexuality of that show was a turnoff, and it without question cannot be made for a young audience.<br><br>To that end the plan was quite logical. They were going to make a hyper violent Conan the Barbarian, probably with lots of sexy wahmens dressed nice and skimpy. That show would have been absolutely fantastic, and maybe the most R rated show ever. Then they would make The Wheel of Time adaptation, which is a series that has some violence, but almost no sexual content and no gratuitous Game Of Thrones style torture scenes. This would capture the kids market, and build them goodwill with their audience.<br><br>It was a great plan.

However, when the film&#039;s producers saw the first rough cut, they realized that it wasn&#039;t working as expected.[4] Inspired by positive response to the kangaroo scene in early test screenings, as well as the marketing campaign behind the recently released Snow Dogs, the production shifted the marketing focus away from that of a dark mafia comedy to that of a family-friendly animal picture. Extensive new footage that replaced the animatronic kangaroo with a new CGI one that rapped was shot, and the film was edited down to a PG-rated family animal comedy.[5] </span><br>What were they thinking", "time": 1671665924, "resto": 178183512}, {"no": 178185771, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:54:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178183512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178183512</a><br>now make theater refunds a thing, too", "time": 1671666882, "resto": 178183512}, {"no": 178185875, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:57:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178183856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178183856</a><br><a href=\"#p178185201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178185201</a><br><br>whats this movie like?", "time": 1671667077, "resto": 178183512}, {"no": 178185959, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:00:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178183674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178183674</a><br>Force Awakens Trailer was the biggest false advertisement", "time": 1671667220, "resto": 178183512}, {"no": 178186017, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:02:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178185183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178185183</a><br>That movie is pure unadulterated kino and you&#039;re a fucking pleb if you wanted anything else than what you got.<br>FACT!!", "time": 1671667350, "resto": 178183512}, {"no": 178186078, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:04:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178185959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178185959</a><br>How so?", "time": 1671667453, "resto": 178183512}, {"no": 178186212, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:08:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178186017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178186017</a><br>I&#039;ll allow you to believe that shit film is anything resembling good.
