I&#039;ve said this months ago but if you really want to cover 30 years for some reason you have to use more seasons but that would require 80+% OC writing. The best thing would be to do a single season with zero timeskips of the events leading up to the war like GOT.<br> The main plot would be in KL and its basically ep 8-10 with all the cut scenes and stuff they didn&#039;t add so it&#039;s 4 to even 6 hours of screentime. That leaves 4-7 hours of screentime for everything else. Cregan&#039;s coup and politics in the reach mainly through the eyes of Daeron are easy options for good stories. Dalton in the stepstones and his story is an outlet for violence and gore that they so desperately need. Then ensure everything is connected neatly like Corlys&#039; injury on the stepstones leads to not only the Velaryon succession crisis but the death of Dalton&#039;s uncle. Then just make sure to set things up for season 2. Daemon&#039;s return to KL should include him meeting the Gold Cloaks and why wouldn&#039;t he. During the drunken celebration of his return to King&#039;s Landing he could have interactions with his future loyalists, meet an ex cop Blood who might do some dirty work for the Gold Cloaks, hint at division with Gwayne Hightower, and an interaction with Lady Mysaria if you want.

Survivor faked love in their interest, you can even see the juxtaposition from their first laying in bed to jump 3 years in the future where this literal Frank is bossing Bill around in what to do with his compound, from selling guns without his knowledge and contacting strangers to invite them into the stronghold. Everything was against their favor and if it had been anyone other than Joel and Tessa they brought over, it would have been over for Frank and Bill&#039;s story all because Frank was freeloading.<br><br>That was kind of the whole point.

Contrary to /pol/s belief, troons and faggots in the jew industry are semi-redpilled and don&#039;t think gay=deus ex machina solving of all social issues.

You&#039;re pretty much saying it&#039;s impossible for Frank to have been over-the-top in order to not leave the compound. That&#039;s 100% guaranteed, and the only opinion anyone would find reason to debate would be Franks authentic gayness. But other than that, there is a strong case to be made Frank didn&#039;t love Bill all that much but rather used him for the compound. In-game lore leads credence to it, and in-show lore leads credence to Bill making 2-day-starving Frank everything he is. <br><br>The writing is pretty clever, first he mentions how he tried to come up with a lie but couldnt. Then he says he wont talk about it to bums. Then he admits it was a lie. In film scripts, overemphasizing a character trait is not done unless you want the viewer to remember something about it. In this case, we are to KNOW Frank is a serial liar.<br><br>And with that, the next big bold statement Frank makes is &quot;I dont want to lay with you just for food&quot; which wouldnt have been said, if not, for him wanting food. Which, he clearly loved, as turning away and walking towards a horde of zombies, would be him turning away an opportunity to stay with Bill.

Norton did not hide his misery on the set, clashing with the crew throughout it, and when the producer handed out gifts to the cast over the movie&#039;s surprisingly strong box office performance, Norton returned the gift with a note stating &quot;Give this to someone you actually like - or someone who actually likes you.&quot; <br><br>Such a prissy little bitch. it was shit but it was fun.<br><a href=\"#p179928308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179928308</a><br>Yeah, because it definitely had a lot of third party titles to compete against on GC lol", "time": 1675081528, "resto": 179927943}, {"no": 179929001, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)07:45:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179927943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179927943</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian job</span><br>I thought it was a french job was it a mandela effect?", "time": 1675082759, "resto": 179927943}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 179927013, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:21:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Cast them", "filename": "1674125379463239", "ext": ".png", "w": 582, "h": 527, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 226, "tim": 1675077710005824, "time": 1675077710, "md5": "h3qt69uiVqH74i07yyNK2A==", "fsize": 266368, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cast-them", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 23, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 18}, {"no": 179927031, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:22:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A turd and a slightly larger turd.", "time": 1675077765, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927106, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bad morning sir", "time": 1675077968, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927126, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:26:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179927013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179927013</a><br>Why is everything in India so funny?", "time": 1675078015, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927142, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:27:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "sirsbros...", "time": 1675078057, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927154, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:28:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179927013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179927013</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beaten by the villager</span><br>Shouldnt have pissed him off", "time": 1675078097, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927173, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:28:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179927126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179927126</a><br>because only posting regular things are boring so no one does", "time": 1675078138, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927189, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:29:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179927031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179927031</a><br>timmy chalamet and zendaya.", "time": 1675078174, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927210, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:30:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;this Hindu boy</span><br>Doesn&#039;t look like a boy..", "time": 1675078228, "resto": 179927013}, {"no": 179927260, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:32:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179927173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179927173</a><br>You don&#039;t see this level of bizarre in any other country.

This is a great thing to talk about!!! I was just thinking about it after the stream.<br><br>The &quot;Three brothers&quot; could be read a few different ways. The clear candidates are Neteyam, Lo&#039;ak, Payakan, and Spider. At various points in the film, there are three brothers. Initially Spider is the third brother, but then he is captured. Payakan then becomes a third brother, and there is explictly brotherly tension between Neteyam and Lo&#039;ak as Lo&#039;ak prefers Payakan, during which they underline the concept of brotherhood itself. Then Neteyam dies and Spider is accepted back into the family (sorta), leaving open the vague possibility of generalized brotherhood between Lo&#039;ak, Spider and Payakan.<br><br>For me Lo&#039;ak&#039;s personal arc is the most important hinging point in the film. He has important alone time to find his way (and is cute besides) and he is the one driving the action forward among the younger set.

But other than that yeah that most recent animated Godzilla series was kino and so were the 4 latest Godzilla vs Kong movies, so yeah I&#039;m just saying big-franchise-wise Godzilla is among the only two or three. That Irish Banshe Lads of Ireland movie was interesting but when was the last decent one-off movie like that, Lighthouse? Godzilla, Game of Thrones, Avatar, Jazz, and I guess Attack on Titan, One Punch and Baki also, but that&#039;s quite literally and unironically it for things I&#039;m looking forward to and other than Jazz they&#039;re all years and years away.<br>But the next Godzilla I think Toho is making another traditional Godzilla movie, and there&#039;s talks of an Apple+ TV series which I&#039;m apprehensive about. It&#039;s the Godzilla brand, which gives me hope it won&#039;t be pozzed, but even if it&#039;s not can Apple really make a good Godzilla show? Idk Godzilla hasn&#039;t ever let me down yet, my least favorite Godzilla stuff is honestly a lot of the Showa era movies, they&#039;re too silly and stupid, Godzilla is best when it takes itself seriously.<br>Oh I lied, the next Godzilla thing is Godzilla vs Kong II in 2024, then later the Toho movie and maybe that Apple series.

Jaron\u2019s pathology stems from early childhood when the seeds were first planted. With the nurturing of his overbearing mother and weak, emotionally distant father, they soon flowered into full-blown psychosis. Jaron\u2019s mother is a narcissist, who neglected her male children in favor of the eldest sibling, the daughter, whom she viewed as a reflection of herself. Young Jaron, sensing this familial dynamic, began play-acting as the sister, the sibling upon whom the mother lavished the most attention and affection. As his mother encouraged this behavior, Jaron soon came to realize that through embracing this fantasy, he could shift his mother\u2019s attentions to him. In this manner, his pathology deepened and broadened, encompassing a veritable stew of neuroses, prominent among them disorders of the histrionic and borderline personality variety, which, combined with the dissociation born of his vivid, parentally-reinforced fantasy, blossomed into acute autogynephilia, wherein merely imagining himself a female was insufficient to sustain the delusion.<br><br>His mother\u2019s own narcissism interacted with Jaron\u2019s burgeoning psychosis and the interpersonal dynamic gave rise to Folie \u00e0 Deux, wherein the shared delusion brought to the forefront the mother\u2019s own incessant need for attention, manifesting in a case of Munchausen by proxy in which Jaron himself is unconsciously complicit.<br><br>So as you can see, this all started with young Jaron\u2019s desire to live within his sister\u2019s ... skin", "filename": "1634770583255 (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 630, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1675069704276085, "time": 1675069704, "md5": "mjVtbHrdp456k4mq2ZTpBw==", "fsize": 67137, "resto": 179901268}, {"no": 179924257, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)04:08:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179922067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179922067</a><br>I thought it was gonna be cringe, but damn not bad.", "time": 1675069722, "resto": 179901268}, {"no": 179924276, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)04:09:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179924253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179924253</a><br>Like the autogynephilic porn addicts that &quot;become&quot; transgender later in life, Jazz is also not truly transgender.

He&#039;s a usurper of identity.<br><br>Jazz didn&#039;t want to become a woman; he wanted to become his sister. In fact, even the name he chose was stolen from her, Ari having played the role of Jasmine in a school production of &quot;Aladdin.&quot; You can see echoes of this behavior in his abortive and confused relationship with a young woman named &quot;Michaela.&quot; Like his sister, Michaela has qualities that Jazz not only admires, but wishes to steal, to make his own. He doesn&#039;t cherish Michaela&#039;s feminine qualities and her talents; he covets them. Like his sister, Michaela is attractive. Like his sister, Michaela is also a talented singer. That&#039;s why it was unsurprising that when Jazz briefly fixated on her, we observed some of his recurrent behaviors resurfacing. He stole from her.
