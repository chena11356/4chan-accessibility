Problem is, we can readily observe this tenacity for life in *every single organism*<br>even some of the not-living things are trying to become alive, it&#039;s clearly just a laugh riot up here!<br>So here again the paradox of life: you want to live, and for you to continue to live, not just one something but many other somethings will have to die. This is a fundamental rule of life, trophic energy levels and all.<br><br>this raises a few key issues:<br>1. there is literally no such thing as ethical consumption. Period. Anything you eat is damned.<br>2. we ourselves willingly consent to be food to higher level organisms than us by participating in this system. We can see that we are part of a food chain, and assume (correctly, for now we think) that we are the top level of the food chain. What happens when we no longer are? When a bigger fish shows up, can we really decline being casually eaten to extinction as we have done to so many species?<br>3. Malthusian Trap. It&#039;s an inevitable problem in every species that we have observed population booming off of resources, and there is no actual reason to think humans are not just some other animal, and therefore not immune to the laws of nature. Our population is currently booming, eating up resources at an unsustainable rate. Unless we break the system somehow, we are also going to have a massive and violent population collapse after resource depletion. Our only hope really is nuclear fusion, which does kinda break the rules of the game of energy-gathering on earth. Unfortunately, that is heavily reliant on helium, which is rapidly depleting, even for scientific purposes. A lot of very smart people are very quietly panicking about this.", "filename": "99f0d5b55fdb423d245aaa1b2cc86b46ec8891fb", "ext": ".png", "w": 1027, "h": 538, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1675829707232718, "time": 1675829707, "md5": "YS6uIzM6QruiK7dlqAqWgA==", "fsize": 141907, "resto": 180308689}, {"no": 180312211, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)23:17:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180312155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180312155</a><br>Hes not thinking correctly because &quot;the will to not die&quot; is an abstraction, not a description of physical reality.

It&#039;s an inevitable problem in every species that we have observed population booming off of resources, and there is no actual reason to think humans are not just some other animal, and therefore not immune to the laws of nature. Our population is currently booming, eating up resources at an unsustainable rate. Unless we break the system somehow, we are also going to have a massive and violent population collapse after resource depletion.

In both Tracee and Jackie Jr\u2019s case, both his Mafia code and his own self-centredness cause Tony to fail to protect either of them. The theme of the season is parenting. Tony fails to parent Jackie, just performatively lecturing him, in part because he himself wasn\u2019t parented properly, but also because time and again Tony chooses Mob drama over his family. In addition, Tony fails to respect the vulnerability of Jackie and Tracee in much the same way he despises vulnerability in himself. He expects men to be tough and brutal like himself.

One pack in the Okavango in March 2016 was photographed by safari guides waging &quot;an incredible fight&quot; against a lioness that attacked a subadult dog at an impala kill, which forced the lioness to retreat, although the subadult dog died.

The way I see it, film is an art-form like music and.. art. A song can be beautiful, relaxing piano music or even total silence. You want proof? Check out 4&#039;33 by John Cage. Art can be a beautiful landscape painting or a brownish square on a red background to signify inequality. Same with film. Why should anything be a certain way? If you prefer watching war films that&#039;s mostly historically accurate, fine. Others might prefer a movie about a dad and his mutant baby. Some might even like both! So why should any character be the same race they are/were irl? <br><br>The only thing that bothers me is it&#039;s always black, mixed/jews playing characters that were/are white. What&#039;s wrong with Asians? Like, why not have Jackie Chan play.. Steve Irwin in a biopic about him? That&#039;s just an example, don&#039;t do it for real. Jackie Chan is the only living Asian actor I can think of rn. Or how about a film about Abraham Lincoln played by *googles Mexican actors* Michael Pena? <br><br>I believe it&#039;s even possible to go further than this. Getting Asians and Mexicans is just one more step. We&#039;ve talked about race, but what about gender if there even is such a thing? How about....*drum rolls* Mr Elliot Page in the role of BISMARK. <br><br>The aim of this idea is twofold. More steps on the way to total artistic freedom and maybe freedom in general? If anyone points out what race or gender (if there is such a thing), maybe the film itself will reveal something about anyone who speaks out against it?<br><br>Come on Hollywood.

The driver, Anna Gallagher, 28, and her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, were both killed instantly.[32][33] He was vacationing with Jennifer Grey, whom he had begun dating in semi-secrecy during the filming of Ferris Bueller&#039;s Day Off; the crash publicly revealed their relationship. He suffered a fractured leg and ribs, a concussion, and a collapsed lung. Grey&#039;s injuries included severe whiplash, which later required surgery to avoid paralysis.[34] [32] Broderick told police he had no recollection of the crash and did not know why he had been in the wrong lane: &quot;What I first remember is waking up in the hospital, with a very strange feeling going on in my leg.&quot; He was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and faced up to five years in prison, but was convicted of the lesser charge of careless driving and fined \u00a3100 (US$175).[32][35][36][37][38]<br><br>The victims&#039; family called the verdict &quot;a travesty of justice&quot;. The victims&#039; brother and son, Martin Doherty, later forgave Broderick amid plans to meet him in 2003.[39] In February 2012, when Broderick was featured in a multi-million-dollar Honda commercial that aired during the Super Bowl, Doherty said the meeting had still not taken place and that Broderick &quot;wasn&#039;t the greatest choice of drivers, knowing his past&quot;.[40]", "time": 1675838478, "resto": 180315341}, {"no": 180316044, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)01:41:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180315942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180315942</a><br>He is a mouthy entitled fucking faggot, but I don&#039;t think he should be charged for murder.

The way I see it, film is an art-form like music and.. art. A song can be beautiful, relaxing piano music or even total silence. You want proof? Check out 4&#039;33 by John Cage. Art can be a beautiful landscape painting or a brownish square on a red background to signify inequality. Same with film. Why should anything be a certain way? If you prefer watching war films that&#039;s mostly historically accurate, fine. Others might prefer a movie about a dad and his mutant baby. Some might even like both! So why should any character be the same race they are/were irl?<br><br>The only thing that bothers me is it&#039;s always black, mixed/jews playing characters that were/are white. What&#039;s wrong with Asians? Like, why not have Jackie Chan play.. Steve Irwin in a biopic about him? That&#039;s just an example, don&#039;t do it for real. Jackie Chan is the only living Asian actor I can think of rn. Or how about a film about Abraham Lincoln played by *googles Mexican actors* Michael Pena?<br><br>I believe it&#039;s even possible to go further than this. Getting Asians and Mexicans is just one more step. We&#039;ve talked about race, but what about gender if there even is such a thing? How about....*drum rolls* Mr Elliot Page in the role of BISMARK.<br><br>The aim of this idea is twofold. More steps on the way to total artistic freedom and maybe freedom in general?
