In civil court a decision not to contest something is not the same as actually admitting it&#039;s true. You can have a lawsuit where someone alleges something against you in their complaint, and you agree that it&#039;s true so you&#039;re not going to contest it, then in a second lawsuit they can allege the same thing, and you can then say it&#039;s not true and fight it. Your admission that it was true in a previous lawsuit can&#039;t be used as evidence, or have the issue precluded.", "time": 1671624579, "resto": 178160322}, {"no": 178162896, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:10:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178162725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178162725</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m so unique </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m so special </span><br>These are the girls posting stupid shite like. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he\u2019s in your DM\u2019s but he is balls deep in my asshole </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we are not the same.</span>", "time": 1671624601, "resto": 178160322}, {"no": 178162908, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:10:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178162757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178162757</a><br>they wouldn&#039;t touch you chud", "time": 1671624631, "resto": 178160322}, {"no": 178162936, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:11:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178162725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178162725</a><br>Who gaslit women into believing that&#039;s attractive to men?", "time": 1671624698, "resto": 178160322}, {"no": 178162948, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:12:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there any law kino that can compare with this trial?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr Depp please explain to the court what a &quot;megapint&quot;

I would like one comfy situational comedy, laugh tracks are allowed if it is primarily from an actual studio audience, I would like the main characters to be of the White race, main dude, his two friends, and a platonic female if necessary, but please limit any &quot;will they or wont they&quot; dynamic if a female is included. No gays, trans, or invalids. There can be a black neighbor or side friend, but it better be limited, with zero white guilt agenda pushing. No eye candy is necessary, I prioritize funny overall. I want zero musical episodes. Those are clearly theater faggots faggying off and no one wants to see that except other theater fags. Sentimental plotlines must be limited to one per season max, but when they do air, they must not be countered with a joke, I want the actual sadness and melancholoy. Shows can be half hour or hour long, any era from 1950&#039;s and beyond. It can be color, black and white, of any quality. Series can be of any length over one complete season.<br><br>For reference, I want the coziness of Cheers, the humor of golden age simpsons, the depth of comedic acting that Charlie Day and Glenn Howerton displayed over the years in Sunny, slapstick is fine. I like funny miniteua, small acting decisions that make a line. I like Seinfeld, but think Curb is tryhard with the gay plots and overall far too jewy. The first couple seasons of The Drew Carey Show had some of these elements. I also enjoy The Honeymooners.<br><br>Thank you.

My brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon.\u201d<br>\u201cPrince Aegon was Rhaegar\u2019s heir by Elia of Dorne,\u201d Ser Jorah said. \u201cBut if he was this prince that was promised, the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a wall.\u201d<br>\u201cI remember,\u201d Dany said sadly. \u201cThey murdered Rhaegar\u2019s daughter as well, the little princess. Rhaenys, she was named, like Aegon\u2019s sister. There was no Visenya, but he said the dragon has three heads.
