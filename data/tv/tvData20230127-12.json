As far as angry politics in movies go I don&#039;t think you can beat the Japanese New Wave, the political and formal radicalism of that period still hasn&#039;t been matched since, imo its the high point of the medium so far. I&#039;d recommend going through Oshima&#039;s run from the sixties to early seventies as a whole but I have to say that his film The Ceremony is right up there with the most bitter and angry movies about politics and generational conflict (specifically between the WWII generation and their children) ever, its not as bombastic as Throw Away Your Books but far more cutting about the state of Japan.

In 2004, the voice actors intentionally skipped several table reads, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode.[15] The strike was resolved a month later[16] and until 2008 they earned something between $250,000[17] and $360,000 per episode.[18] In 2008, production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a &quot;healthy bump&quot; in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode.[18] The dispute was soon resolved, and the actors&#039; salary was raised to $400,000 per episode.[19]", "time": 1674815728, "resto": 179794323}, {"no": 179795090, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:35:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179795060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179795060</a><br>Making her kiss him is probably why he got shot t b h", "time": 1674815745, "resto": 179794323}, {"no": 179795137, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:38:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179795090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179795090</a><br>It is such an awkward interview moment.

Nobody killed themselves over the avengers as far as I know, and to me that speaks to a much more potent psychic power of avatar over content that is merely translatable to fandom and meme culture. The fact that 13 years later enough people were invested enough to bring the sequel to this much success speaks louder than any twitter post ever could. People guzzle capeshit to follow along in the overarching narrative like a tv show, they exist as content drops to satisfy a need for closure and completion which will never come.
