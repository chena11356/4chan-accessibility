So what if we built a cargo delivery device that could then land back on Earth, thus saving us the cost of having to build an entire rocket from the ground up every time we wanted to put something in orbit? <br><br>Two problems. First, you&#039;re now spending a massive percentage of your potential payload on putting your reusable vehicle into space. That vehicle comes back to you but every kilogram of it is wasted cargo potential. Plus you have to use even more fuel to get the thing into orbit. The Shuttle had less cargo capacity than the Saturn V, which sounds insane, but that&#039;s because the Saturn V could spend it&#039;s entire cargo capacity on, well, cargo. <br><br>The second problem is the reason behind two Shuttles crashing. Single use vehicles may be wasteful, but they&#039;re a fuck load safer. That&#039;s because putting something into orbit puts it through a ton of stress. You&#039;re talking massive G forces that cause everything to shake like mad. Then you have re-entry, where your vehicle has to plunge through the atmosphere hoping that your heat shield holds against temperatures that rival the surface of the sun. Putting a vehicle through that multiple times is going to cause some serious cumulative damage. Frankly it&#039;s a miracle more of them didn&#039;t blow up. <br><br>So why keep using them? Because the US was locked into producing them and it would have been a gigantic loss of face to back down and say &quot;Well actually we fucked up, these vehicles are a disaster&quot;.

There&#039;s also Ripley&#039;s quasi-innocent outlook, which is deftly expounded into her characterization giving birth to the very essence of the Film itself--the absurdity of Sartre and Camus is ingeniously woven together with the anti-idealism of one Soren Aabye Kierkegaard, to over simply things a bit. <br><br>The real /tv/ patricians understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity and lived experience to truly appreciate the real depths to which the &quot;movie&quot; plunges. They realize it isn&#039;t just horror but rather a comment on what it means to exist.<br><br>Consequently, people who dislike Alien 3 truly ARE plebian - of course they can&#039;t appreciate the heavy symbolism of Ripley&#039;s death, which is in at least one instance used in reference to the Gnostic/Hermetic ouroboros - an alchemical symbol that references both the cycle of life and the transmigration of the soul. I came a little just now thinking of those myopic troglodytes unable to grasp the deftly layered meaning of what David Giler, Walter Hill, Larry Ferguson and David Fincher have projected from themselves onto countless screens. <br><br>It&#039;s painfully erotic, knowing I and few others are capable of the intellectual intercourse those creators have put forth. And yes, by the way, I do have a Xenomorph tattoo and no, you cannot see it.

It integrates most of what you need in a single application. It has the best color correction tools on the market and fusion is node based so learning on it make learning some specialized tools like nuke easier. Now, i wouldn`t be a good shill if i wouldn`t mention there is a free version would i? well there is one. You should test it out. The full soft is not very expensive either. 300 dollars is a steal and unlike adobe subscription method it`s a one time thing, plus you get access to every single update for free.<br>Granted the community is not as big yet so learning resources are limited and pipelines have yet to fully adopt it but small and mid studios will probably do so eventually because of everything i just mentioned.", "time": 1675428265, "resto": 180105895}, {"no": 180106574, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)07:46:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180106517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180106517</a><br>Shit like this is why I advocate for SPACING, serious fucking space your sentences.

Almost like you are all actors but the characters aren&#039;t totally aware of it. For example I had a word with Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando and he told me that the heart attack in his death scene was actually quite painful and not just pretending. This stage by the way is the only time you can bring up that they are in a movie, if you try to tell them during the actual movie they will become hostile very quickly and can act way out of character. I once got shanked by Gandalf when I told him he was in a movie because I was curious what he would do. When I later in the room asked him what was up with that he did not remember anything.

Like every reply they give to each other is positive and there is no conflict. The dialogue reminds me of elementary school language training exercises.<br>Also the 1 minute runtime for every scene is ass. I don&#039;t know how the animations work though and how much freedom can they give to the language model to direct a scene. Maybe have the model generate a plot synopsis for an episode/scene first and then the script with the synopsis in the context? Continuity between the scenes would be nice. I would be curious to see how they manage the prompting. I dont know what language model they use but proper prompting with adequate context might make this a lot better. A fine-tune that has been fed Seinfeld scripts might be nice if that is a format they can interpret. I know they can&#039;t just blatantly use Seinfeld characters and make money from that but they could just replace the character names with whatever the names are that they use. Of course the model would need to have had stuff like that in its training data.

Neither are any of the e-girls or twitch thots. No one with an onlyfans will ever fuck you. You don&#039;t understand parasocial relationships or the inherent loneliness of the modern world. People say &quot;friend simulator&quot; as an insult, but that&#039;s exactly what it is. Everyone I watch on youtube streams every fucking day now. I have schizoid personality disorder. Rough childhood, a lot of bad relationships with insane women. I live alone, I go out only for groceries, I trust no one, it&#039;s just me, my cats, my video games and the fucking internet. I&#039;m very alone. I&#039;m never going to trust another girl, I refuse to settle for some used up roastie and I&#039;m just getting older. The odds of me dying alone increase every day. I have a son I&#039;ve never met out there somewhere. You know how I spend my days anon? I keep youtube on my 65 inch tv favoring the streams so the house feels less lonely, then I stream stuff from my plex server while shitposting or playing video games. 4chan is like 99% of my social contact at this point. I tweeted something yesterday that got 43 likes and it&#039;s the most validation I&#039;ve felt in years. I haven&#039;t had sex with another human since 2018. The rest of the time, I collect porn on external hard drives I never watch, I fap to girls on chaturbate, then open a folder of pictures of ex-girlfriends and finish imagining one of them I don&#039;t hate because really it&#039;s the emotional connection I miss. I go on Omegle looking for an unstable younger girl to move in with me because frankly, I&#039;ve done it before.<br><br>Every night is the same trained behavior. I feed and pet my cats, I turn off the lights, click the voice button on my firestick remote and say &quot;tv off&quot; and roll over on my futon bed and hug a pillow I imagine is Sophia Lillis.

Escalante&#039;s math enrichment program had grown to more than 400 students. His class sizes had increased to over 50 students in some cases. That was far beyond the 35 student limit set by the teachers&#039; union, which increased its criticism of Escalante&#039;s work.[14] In 1991, the number of Garfield students taking advanced placement examinations in math and other subjects jumped to 570. The same year, citing faculty politics and petty jealousies, Escalante and Jim\u00e9nez left Garfield.[14] Escalante found new employment at Hiram W. Johnson High School in Sacramento, California. At the height of Escalante&#039;s success, Garfield graduates were entering the University of Southern California in such great numbers that they outnumbered all the other high schools in the working-class East Los Angeles region combined.[15] Even students who failed the AP exam often went on to study at California State University, Los Angeles.[14]</span><br><br>Angelo Villavicencio, one of Escalante&#039;s handpicked instructors, took over the program after Escalante&#039;s departure, teaching the remaining 107 AP students in two classes over the following year. Sixty-seven of Villavicencio&#039;s students went on to take the AP exam and forty-seven passed. The math program&#039;s decline at Garfield became apparent following the departure of Escalante, Villavicencio, and other teachers associated with its inception and development. In just a few years, the number of AP calculus students at Garfield who passed their exams dropped by more than 80%. In 1996, Villavicencio contacted Garfield&#039;s new principal, Tony Garcia, and offered to come back to help revive the dying calculus program. His offer was rejected.[14]<br><br>Teaching well is not allowed.", "time": 1675410082, "resto": 180100273}, {"no": 180101018, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:42:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180100970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180100970</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Avildsen</span><br>Well it must be good, probably", "time": 1675410126, "resto": 180100273}, {"no": 180101021, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:42:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180100970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180100970</a><br>Kino duology right here", "time": 1675410130, "resto": 180100273}, {"no": 180101095, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:44:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180101006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180101006</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The math program&#039;s decline at Garfield became apparent following the departure of Escalante, Villavicencio, and other teachers associated with its inception and development.</span><br>This is almost always the case with everything, I feel.
