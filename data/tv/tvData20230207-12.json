Eric has proven in this video that his laptop is his own power source, and now that he\u2019s had it taken away from him and instead being put in cuffs, he knows he\u2019s powerless against the formerly oppressed who are rising up against the ashes. Maxine now knows his weak spot, and she\u2019s going for him with all of her words, and she is gradually defeating her enemy, knowing eventually that the way to defeat him and taking her final swipe, is to NOT swipe at all.<br><br> I&#039;m so glad Maxine is alive. I hope Eric goes to court and finally faces the consequences. I also hope after the whole Eric thing is sorted, the focus turns to Mason. I want him to finally face the consequences for his actions.

He never shies away from talking about his wealth and celebrity acquaintances. Eerily though this leaks into his discussion of his addiction. Is he proud that he takes 800mg of some painkiller they only usually prescribe 30mg to (to terminal cancer patients)? Seems like it sometimes.<br>He does come across as a celebrity who has had the attention of too many sympathetic ears, too many doctors and psychiatrist, adoring hangers on and so forth. All telling him what he wants to hear to keep his friendship or custom or whatever. And he believes his own bullshit. He had a traumatic childhood, he has an incurable disease, only God can save him, etc. It was quite telling how he devoted a page of the book to his argument with Peter Hitchens. Not a Hitchens fan but he was right in his rebuttle to the book: Perry is someone who was not used to being told what they didn&#039;t want to hear. And it you to through your life like that, as a big celeb, and you&#039;re an addict, then yeah, no wonder you end up almost dead multiple times. <br>Another interesting thing about the book is it gives you an idea of how much a big time alchy was drinking. He was drinking a &#039;party bottle&#039; of vodka every two days. I wasn&#039;t sure how much that was in ml but I think 1750ml. About 2.5 normal bottles. He probably only lives because he switched to pills before he died.<br>Matthew Perry was great in Friends and he deserves some respect but it is always tragic to see someone fall from the heights of fame. What&#039;s absent though is an honest account of those talents. He was a one trick pony. Funny, but guy down the bar funny, not millionaire funny.

Caught me totally off-guard with the ridiculously ambitious storytelling, the wild emotions, the mythological characterizations, the frenetic bravado pace. It&#039;s SPRAWLING. It keeps surprising by weaving a completely coherent magical-realist-decades-long depiction of a community through its many near extinctions and ever-evolving dynamics. And after great success, it abandons the broad view and centers on an unlikely and electric love story, while making the viewer root for- suddenly- our literal heroes. It reminded of at times of Amarcord, also Freaks, also They Live By Night, also O Thiasos, also Apocalypse Now. And it&#039;s surely in that company of such spectacular cinema, pretty much impossible to leave anyone who watches it not thrilled. And what music to guide all these affairs! My favorite and best of 2023, and straight to the top of 1997 and near the top of the 90s. I&#039;ll be definitely checking out Jakubisko&#039;s other works ahead. Of the films I&#039;ve watched because of heavy shilling here, it&#039;s second only to The Cremator.<br><br>Very much liked La La Land too, if some leagues below An Ambitious Report. A melancholical musical romance, I specially liked Chazelle&#039;s rhythms and the end section exploring the life that was not. The best thing of the film is the Hurwitz&#039;s score, its dance of vitality and longing. To watch soon the much infamous Babylon, but the three I&#039;ve seen from him all were of my liking.<br><br>All in all, a great night.<br><br><a href=\"#p180239113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180239113</a><br><a href=\"#p180248029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180248029</a><br><a href=\"#p180248571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180248571</a><br>I don&#039;t live inside the general, that&#039;s why.

Might be useful lore to appreciate any Noelle appearances this season for newfags. You lads from the season 6 /jazz/ generals may remember we occasionally checked up on Noelle&#039;s tumblr page for laughs. <br><br>Pic related are posts from around the time when season 6 was airing. His microblogging interests at the time back then included: purity spiraling about communism, being a miserable trans, and suicide baiting for attention. <br><br>As a random dunk on the commie anon who I know browses these threads: cope retard. Transexualism is of the same cloth as communism, as both are seething stupid delusional anti human ideologies. And it is mostly commie or commie adjacent retards who have sympathized, pushed, and popularized trannyism. Noelle is both the quintessential tranny stereotype and the average communism advocate at the same time. He&#039;s a black hole of a person seething at existence and that he&#039;s still alive, with fantasies of violently terrorizing people who are not miserable and broken like him. If he were a Metal Gear character, he&#039;d be The Fury from MGS3 except without testicles or a cool jetpack. No coincidence at all he&#039;s a communist. https://youtu.be/bdLCAbY7Rbg?t=54", "filename": "noelle tumblr", "ext": ".png", "w": 710, "h": 2297, "tn_w": 38, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675746124283457, "time": 1675746124, "md5": "5/Ui2U2DL6Mp1CjX4r5Aew==", "fsize": 386728, "resto": 180269971}, {"no": 180270584, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:04:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180270520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180270520</a><br>I wish we had more recent updates on noelles further spiral into insanity", "time": 1675746245, "resto": 180269971}, {"no": 180270591, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:04:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180270520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180270520</a><br>(2) Anyways to continue the non-update.. Out of curiosity I checked back on the Noelle tumblr to see if there were any funny updates since season 6 finished. Sadly Noelle stopped cringe posting there back in summer 2021. He&#039;s probably on Mastodon if one of you want to check. But this pic is a sampling of some of his last posts. <br><br>As you can see Noelle was still, as of summer 2021, a miserable vapid narcissistic tranny stereotype seething at civilization and humanity in general, who likes virtue signaling about how much of a pure communist he is compared to capitalist scum like Bernie Sanders and AOC. The only things sustaining him are 1) Animal Crossing New Horizons and 2) hatred of white Christian cis capitalist giga-Staceys who mog him. <br><br>But what&#039;s this? He&#039;s going by the name Gwen now, cis scum. So don&#039;t you dare use the dead name Noelle. Very typical tranny urge to change one&#039;s name again and again. You see &quot;Noelle&quot; just didn&#039;t have that special person ring to it like Gwen does, plus it reminds him of the most evil holiday on earth known as - Christmas. You better keep up with those name updates if you want to be a good ally like Sander &quot;Not Gay&quot; Jennings. Previously he had the name &quot;Noelle Jaclyn&quot; at the top of his tumblr page. Now where that name used to be he has written &quot;what??&quot;. It&#039;s very profound, you just wouldn&#039;t get it. <br><br>Oh and Noelle discovered he&#039;s autistic. Which he believes is a rare and super special combo to be both an autistic and a tranny. You cis chuds might not know it&#039;s even possible to be both trans and autistic, it&#039;s so uncommon and special a combo. But now you know it is indeed possible and Noelle is up there with the exceptionally rare victim-hierarchy elites such as Chris Chan.
