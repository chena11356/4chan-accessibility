At the international box office has made 600m and this equals to 246m in profit, so the grand total is 384m in profit, and this is still half of what it needs to recoup the budget.

You might experience nausea. Be not alarmed. This is expected. It is a sort of spiritual vertigo, if you will. You might find yourself asking what it all means, and while truth must be experienced to truly be appreciated, we offer you this:<br><br>The meaning is that it&#039;s all meaningless, and only Those Who See have any hope of making it meaningful. We could. We choose not to. As a species, we could be expanding out into the cosmos, embracing actual science, purging the many pseudosciences that have adhered to that powerful concept like parasitic growths. We could be expanding our consciousness with truth and revelation, attaining real enlightenment. We could become something as far elevated above current humanity as we now are from the chimp. Those Who See understand all of this, more, but we also understand that ultimately, we will not. No, mired in delusion, flawed ideologies, and petty, nonsensical (not to mention manufactured) division, we will collapse back upon ourselves, a human ouroboros forever consuming its own dwindling tail as humanity willingly, gleefully embraces atrocity in the name of tolerance, abomination in the name of inclusion, and skips hand-in-hand to the charnel house, their purpose served and too sterile to birth a new one from their atrophied dreams, leaving behind only those who manipulated them as the heirs of humankind. Imagine their horror when they realize that their victory is ash, meaningless without those who could have given it meaning. They shall reach out with plastic hands that convey sensation to minds that can no longer feel, no longer dream, no longer seek meaning, and what hilarity that will be, that last grand, cosmic joke.<br><br>We could stop this. We choose not to, because in the end, we all get what we deserve, and what we deserve is to end not with a bang or a whimper, but a honk.", "filename": "1635989470167 (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 217, "h": 122, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672130246643600, "time": 1672130246, "md5": "t1cmaR4wdG2oe/eDrLgcTg==", "fsize": 6907, "resto": 178391252}, {"no": 178391891, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)03:38:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178391788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178391788</a><br>Yeah he&#039;s gigabased.

If you knew the movie, you and him would be friends. It became a totemic title in his life, and he decided if he ever made a war movie, that would be the title. Quentin is a terrible speller and writes his scripts longhand, so when he finished his draft of the script, he&#039;d misspelled the title.

I know that that&#039;s the mainstream, accepted judgement on the season (especially on reddit), but I never really felt that way. It&#039;s often cheap-looking (mostly the sets and costumes) and has some dated dialogue and general cheesiness, but to me that isn&#039;t a problem, because that&#039;s exactly what TOS was like. It&#039;s funny, I feel that 9/10 reasons that people shit on season 1 of TNG, those exact same complaints could be applied to TOS as well, and significantly more so, but people give that a pass.<br>I find the more overtly dated, stilted aspects of season 1 to be charming and adds to the comfiness of it.<br>I also feel that it&#039;s the only season of TNG that genuinely captures a feeling of true utopianism and peaceful exploration and discovery.", "filename": "ezgif-5-b428fdb4b6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 350, "h": 262, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672144548227731, "time": 1672144548, "md5": "lFnMFzuehC6yLzyO9T+1AQ==", "fsize": 31576, "resto": 178384959}, {"no": 178396276, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)07:36:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178396214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178396214</a><br>Ugh.", "time": 1672144586, "resto": 178384959}, {"no": 178396436, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)07:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How would Kirk have handled Barclay if he was on his ship instead?", "filename": "1671665274335322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 184, "h": 230, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672145112132539, "time": 1672145112, "md5": "ha4NYW7esHn6CKLTn1s+Jg==", "fsize": 47255, "resto": 178384959}, {"no": 178396452, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)07:45:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178396436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178396436</a><br>similarly to Bailey", "time": 1672145155, "resto": 178384959}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 178392072, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)03:47:44", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "His Dark Materials", "com": "Season 3 just ended, am I the only one still watching?", "filename": "E5DD51C6-D498-49F4-A830-D30102734B78", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672130864513156, "time": 1672130864, "md5": "oQLrVwhh0e8CyR7scMn+eg==", "fsize": 240463, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "his-dark-materials", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 37, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 178392120, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)03:50:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You got past the first episode of season 1?", "time": 1672131015, "resto": 178392072}, {"no": 178392168, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)03:52:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178392120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178392120</a><br>I got about halfway through episode three before dropping it<br><br>I cant understand how they managed to make it so dull", "time": 1672131147, "resto": 178392072}, {"no": 178392241, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)03:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178392120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178392120</a><br>It is horrible but I have to see how much worse it gets.

A homemade porn film had been spliced into a Vietnam flick. The barracks full of unsuspecting marines cheered a screen full of jungle carnage as the on-screen marines charged a VC bunker, then in midcinematic combat frenzy the barracks went silent when the screen turned from overwhelming firepower to the sleek power of sex. After a few seconds, the room erupted. The marines were elated that the amateur smut had made it past the censors, it was another coup! But the excitement only lasted until the marine whose wife had sent him the movie noticed something about the hooded woman, and what he noticed could have been a mole on her ass or the way she moaned or how she threw her head back as she came, but that coming woman was his wife, and the man was his neighbor, and he began to scream, &quot;That&#039;s my wife! That&#039;s my wife fucking the neighbor, a goddamn squid!&quot; At first the jarheads laughed, because they thought he was joking, but when he continued to scream and then began weeping, they knew that it really was his wife, and someone had the decency to turn the video off. But tonight they want a replay, because why not, the damage is done and when is the next time you&#039;ll be able to witness infidelity? And fuck that poor jarhead anyway.

Wellington House had a staff of 54 people, which made it the largest British foreign propaganda organisation.[47] From the Wellington House came to the publication The War Pictorial, which by December 1916 had reached a circulation of 500,000, covering 11 languages.
