Have the GL third movie lead into Blackest Night, the first big crossover movie of the new reboot. <br>Bring in whatever other characters they want for Blackest Night.<br><br>Once the Blackest Night crossover movie is done, give Flash and Wonder Woman and Martian Manhunter and whoever else their own single stand alone movie, all of which have hints of Darkseid.<br>Then do an infinity war style Final Crisis adaption where Darkseid &#039;wins&#039; at the end. And by &#039;infinity war style&#039; i mean have it be 4-5 completely separate story lines that merge into 2 storylines by the end where both teams fail to stop Darkseid.<br>Second Final Crisis movie would start much like the middle of Final Crisis where most of earths heroes are under Darkseids control.<br><br>Theres your multi billion dollar idea James Gunn.

Gunn had the latter, we can see why Zaslav hired him but it\u2019s not paying off, Gunn doesn\u2019t care what\u2019s best for the brand or the company, he wants to eat his own cake. Now WB won\u2019t have enough capital at the end of 2023 to follow through with Gunn\u2019s plan. The Snyder cut allowed for a positive outlook among greater audiences and potential for brand rejuvenation. The past few months it seemed to be going right with Abdy and De Luca making the right calls in the stead of no DC president, bringing Cavill back, possibly bringing Ben back, using The Flash for a small soft reboot to reorganize the Universe and clean up continuity, eventual Justice League movie, decoupling from previous canon but carrying over the hype. Plus we could have had a Keanu Constantine Pierce Dr Fate crossover. I blame the rock attaching himself to the DCEU and Gunn tickling Zaslavs ear convincing him that the DCEUs success was dependent on BAs success. It was a standalone with no connections to previous DCEU stuff about a D tier character general audiences are unfamiliar with and a Rock movie which are notorious for bombing.

As a matter of fact\u2014although of course I always knew that paederasty was a disgusting custom of many ancient nations\u2014I never heard of homosexuality as an actual instinct till I was over thirty\u2026which beats your record! It is possible, I think that this perversion occurs more frequently in some periods than in others\u2014owing to obscure biological &amp; psychological causes. Decadent ages\u2014when psychology is unsettled\u2014seem to favour it. Of course\u2014in ancient times the extent of the practice of paederasty (as a custom which most simply accepted blindly, without any special inclination) cannot be taken as any measure of the extent of actual psychological perversion.

Honda appeared to be suffering from cold symptoms at the party and contacted his son Ryuji in New York. Ryuji believed Honda was drunk and thought it strange that he called him.[99] Then, in mid-February 1993, Kurosawa, Honda, and Masahiko Kumada, the unit manager, attended a screening of The Stranger, Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray&#039;s last film, at an art-house cinema.[99] After watching the film, Kurosawa invited Honda to his house for dinner and drinks, but Honda felt sick and went home. Honda was declared healthy following a checkup in December 1992, and no major illnesses were suspected. Although his cough kept getting worse, his family doctor diagnosed him with a common cold.[100] Initially, Honda stayed in bed for a week, but after he lost his appetite, he underwent X-rays and blood tests. Honda was immediately told to seek hospital treatment following the results. Knowing something was wrong with his health, Honda had already packed his bags. Within ten minutes of leaving home, he was taken to Kono Medical Clinic, a 19-bed facility in Soshigaya. Because the major hospitals were full, he was placed in a tiny room.[100]</span>", "time": 1671540098, "resto": 178122511}, {"no": 178122739, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:41:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178122610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178122610</a><br>Same movie", "time": 1671540119, "resto": 178122511}, {"no": 178122750, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:42:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178122731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178122731</a><br>&lt;&gt;A room in a bigger hospital was about to be assigned to Honda, so his friends could visit him.

The actors, which some of you had the audacity to call talented, were just plain trash and I am pretty sure most of the female (and some of the male ones) were hired based on a different kind of oral talent. Which in itself wouldn&#039;t be so bad if they could at least act a little.

Your freedom as an ALT entirely depends on the Japanese teacher, and more often than not if you suck ass at teaching they recognize it and relegate you to the role of a human pronunciation machine. At my school I teach grammar points in English, help students one-on-one with speech competitions and college prep, conduct full lessons on western culture, and lead speaking activities. I\u2019ve also been invited by the Tokyo Board of Education to interview new Japanese teachers of English, facilitate group discussions following guest lectures, and help conduct entrance exams for international students. Why? Because I\u2019m good at English and good at explaining shit in terms ESL learners can understand. Meanwhile there\u2019s another JET at my school who\u2019s gradually gotten her freedom taken away from her because she doesn\u2019t know much about proper grammar, teaches about shitty pop culture like Star Wars and Marvel, and makes students uncomfortable. Even then, she\u2019s a good resource for the teachers and helps students by letting them hear native speakers talking in English.<br>As regards the textbooks, I only see unnatural speech or outdated/arbitrary grammar rules very rarely. 99% of the time the textbooks are correct, and the Japanese teachers explain the grammar points correctly. There are some overly simplistic constructions and vocabulary that they learn early on that make them sound a bit juvenile, but that\u2019s the case with any language taught as a second language. By their last year they\u2019re on average far better at English than most Americans students are at the second languages they learn in high school.

Don&#039;t get excited, it happens off screen, we just see her in the outfit and the guys standing behind her.

Modesty forbids us to say so, but there are times when we think pretty well of ourselves. And yet, if we examine it more closely, our enthusiasm turns out to be all a sham. We don&#039;t want to conquer the cosmos, we simply want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the frontiers of the cosmos. For us, such and such a planet is as arid as the Sahara, another as frozen as the North Pole, yet another as lush as the Amazon basin.

A single world, our own, suffices us; but we can&#039;t accept it for what it is. We are searching for an ideal image of our own world: we go in quest of a planet, a civilization superior to our own but developed on the basis of a prototype of our primeval past. At the same time, there is something inside us which we don&#039;t like to face up to, from which we try to protect ourselves, but which nevertheless remains, since we don&#039;t leave Earth in a state of primal innocence.

Instead the show has a huge focus on Yennefer (thus taking away the focus from Geralt doing Witcher contracts), plus you also have the issue of S1 being unchronological. The show would have been better served by introducing Yennefer (without such a heavy focus on her backstory and in general) and Ciri in S2. By S3 the show could have moved away from the episodic format towards to more season-long stories (including the focus around Ciri). You have other issues - namely casting and costume design - though fundamentally the writing is the biggest problem; many people would be more accepting/forgiving of the other problems if there was better writing. Altogether you just get the impression, from what we see in the show and what we hear from bts, that the showrunners have either no understand and/or respect for neither the source material and fans.
