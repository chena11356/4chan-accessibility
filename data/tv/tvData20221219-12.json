Aegon, Aemond, Helaena and Daeron would meet at Harrenhal with 4 dragons and have complete control over the riverlands. The Winter Wolves wouldn&#039;t last a day. The riverlords can be sent back to control their castles whilst the others hold Harrenhal.

The old man had inherited Gizmo as a teenager himself. The family were philosophers and were wealthy back in China(where philosophy was more about &#039;think but get money&#039; a lot sooner than in the West), but centuries of &#039;incidents&#039; with their &#039;ancestral Mogwai&#039;(actually alien) led them to be weary of technological progress that the monsters thrived on. The family survived off self-sufficiency and selling their belongings, sometimes as antiques, until the old man who now has them all in a shop, Gizmo included. <br><br>It&#039;s like the Gremlins are designed to be massively dangerous in advanced societies. In primitive ones with daily routine dictated by available light, responsibility given to children early and treated seriously, longer folk-memory due to oral traditions and no mass-media all mean no Mogwai would ever progress to cocoon and be kept with the preserved food is to stay dry. Life and death choices were a daily thing, the mindset different. Letting a Mogwai progress nearly always meant at least some deaths, but killing one was not an option for the old man&#039;s family when they came to possess it. We also haven&#039;t ever seen a Mogwai die in either film; all the villains become Gremlins. For Gizmo though what would be a satisfying answer for why he&#039;s the only one that&#039;s good would be; he was taught to be, and he learned to ignore the impulses of his kind but always feels them.

Now is the time when dream-women, too quickly undressed, crowd in around you, the time when you reread ad nauseam books you&#039;ve a read a thousand times before, when you toss and turn for hours without getting to sleep. This is the hour when your eyes wide open in the darkness, you hand groping towards the foot of the narrow bed in search of an ashtray, matches, a last cigarette, you calmly measure the sticky extent of your unhappiness. Unhappiness did not swoop down on you, it insinuated itself almost ingratiatingly. How many times you have repeated the same amputated gesture, the same journey&#039;s that lead nowhere? All you have left to fall back on are your tuppeny-halfpenny boltholes, your idiotic patience, the thousand and one detours that always lead you back unfailingly to your starting point. All that counts is your solitude: whatever you do, wherever you go, nothing that you see has any importance, everything you do, you do in vain, nothing that seek is real. Solitude alone exists, every time you are confronted, every time you face yourself&quot;</span>", "filename": "The.Man.Who.Sleeps.1974.avi_snapshot_00.21.00_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 608, "h": 448, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1671449610767595, "time": 1671449610, "md5": "Dj8xddIeJuJl8yf7uhlzgg==", "fsize": 42925, "resto": 178077272}, {"no": 178078876, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:38:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178077272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178077272</a><br>trash humpers<br>gummo<br>slackers<br>american psycho", "time": 1671449895, "resto": 178077272}, {"no": 178078936, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:41:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178077376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178077376</a><br>And then they give you a strange look and later recount to their friends and family the weirdo who said hi to them", "time": 1671450065, "resto": 178077272}, {"no": 178078974, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:42:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178077376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178077376</a><br>its 4 am", "time": 1671450135, "resto": 178077272}, {"no": 178079043, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:45:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178078974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178078974</a><br>what about this<a href=\"#p178077399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178077399</a>", "time": 1671450311, "resto": 178077272}, {"no": 178079072, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:46:11", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "51NhfGdSj7L._AC_SY450_", "ext": ".png", "w": 317, "h": 450, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671450371094605, "time": 1671450371, "md5": "gtGWeNXQHyxnVYSgKeaHZg==", "fsize": 255033, "resto": 178077272}, {"no": 178079096, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178077376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178077376</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dude just go outside and make some stranger uncomfortable</span><br>do normalfags really?", "time": 1671450444, "resto": 178077272}, {"no": 178079165, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:50:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178077272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178077272</a><br>Not a movie but &quot;Welcome to the N.H.K.&quot;.

Dolby\u2019s 3D glasses were developed using a process called Six Primary 3D that interprets six different wavelengths of color, three to each eye, which creates what Dolby calls stereo contrast to eliminate ghosting and provide a clearer image. It\u2019s two to four times brighter than the others and takes advantage of Dolby\u2019s HDR, meaning the image has brighter brights and darker darks. Avatar: The Way of Water was created using the Dolby Vision 3D system and Dolby partnered with James Cameron\u2019s production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, to provide the studio with the tools and technology it needed to create 3D for Avatar. In the simplest terms, Dolby 3D can be seen as a native 3D format for the film.

And while it is well known that the Dallas leg of JFK&#039;s Texas trip was sponsored by the Citizens Council (CC), the elite business group that ruled Dallas, the little-noticed evidence shows that two of the three key figures who dominated the CC were Jewish \u2014not &quot;WASPs,&quot; as the legend of Dallas would have it.

In fact, the official published history of a major Zionist arms smuggling operation, the Sonneborn Institute, reports its agents smuggled aircraft parts out of Texas to Israel. This was happening when a then recently discharged Army Air Corps aircraft mechanic, Jack Ruby, was re-settling in Dallas in 1947, the year prior to Israel&#039;s birth, then Sonneborn&#039;s activities were at a zenith.

Thus, later, when the &quot;patsy&quot; was in custody, there was a plausible explanation as to how he knew JFK would pass by his workplace. That an assassin quite probably fired on JFK from the Dal-Tex Building is most relevant in the context of an Israeli connection. Co-owned by David Weisblat, a major financial backer of the Israeli lobby&#039;s Anti-Defamation League, Dal-Tex housed, on different floors, a niumber of firms that utilized the telephone number of Morty Freedman, an attorney, garment manufacturer, and activist in Jewish affairs. Since JFK was working to stop Israel&#039;s nuclear arms program\u2014which received smuggled uranium from U.S. sources\u2014it is notable that one Dal-Tex firm linked to Freedman was the Dallas Uranium &amp; Oil Company. It is also intriguing that one of Freedman&#039;s Dal-Tex business partners was Abe Zapruder, the Jewish dress manufacturer who filmed the assassination and profited immensely. Today there are some who now believe Zapruder had advance knowledge of the assassination.<br>Once the accused assassin was in custody, it was----you guessed it \u2014Sam Bloom, who had earlier maneuvered JFK into the kill zone, who pressured Elgin Crull, the city manager, to in turn pressure Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry into making Oswald accessible to the press and to move him publicly from the Dallas police station to the city jail. Thus, the situation was in place for Jack Ruby to move in for the kill. There are several sources, including Dallas FBI agent James Hosty, who stated Bloom and his backers were the forces behind this. When the police searched Ruby&#039;s home, they found a slip of paper with Bloom&#039;s name, address and telephone number on it.<br><a href=\"#p178074674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178074674</a><br>you sure were quiet when others were implicating the Russians, CIA, etc", "filename": "7E74517E-7836-49B9-BF14-A286469D34A4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1557, "h": 2020, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671436620571635, "time": 1671436620, "md5": "tiFVH+UaX6iklbMfzh6d7Q==", "fsize": 542477, "resto": 178072384}, {"no": 178074775, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)02:58:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178074734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178074734</a><br>Kek&#039;d", "time": 1671436708, "resto": 178072384}, {"no": 178074870, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:02:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178074674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178074674</a><br>The sound of a Jew in distress", "time": 1671436978, "resto": 178072384}, {"no": 178074988, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178074754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178074754</a><br>keep going", "time": 1671437286, "resto": 178072384}, {"no": 178075152, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:14:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178074674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178074674</a><br>Getting exposed is uncomfortable.", "time": 1671437672, "resto": 178072384}, {"no": 178075204, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:17:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178074351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178074351</a><br>Naw.

While a careful review will show that it does not support the official version, the circumstantial aspect of the case is equally compelling. <br><br>The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, based on the witnesses they interviewed, that Lee Harvey Oswald had an association of unspecified nature with David Ferrie and Clay Shaw before the assassination. This confirmed the earlier findings of the New Orleans District Attorney&#039;s Office, which found multiple witnesses who saw Oswald with Ferrie and / or Shaw. Some of them testified under oath at the Shaw trial, with no conceivable gain (and considerable risk, as the D.A.&#039;s witnesses were subject to a pattern of threats, harassment, and violence - which seems quite strange, if one is to believe the case against Shaw was based in fantasy).<br><br>Both Ferrie and Shaw were on record denying any relationship with Oswald, or each other for that matter (despite the fact that witnesses to a Shaw / Ferrie association are well into the double digits). Yet the House Committee concluded Oswald, Ferrie, and Shaw knew each other, meaning the latter two lied to investigators. I can&#039;t fathom an innocuous explanation for that, and when both men turn out to have extensive ties with the Central Intelligence Agency some more sinister possibilities become apparent.<br><br><a href=\"#p178077814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178077814</a><br>&quot;Police found footprints and cigarette butts behind the stockade fence which still stands above the knoll, but called off their search of the area when Oswald\u2019s 6.5-millimeter rifle was found inside the Depository.&quot;<br>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la<wbr>-xpm-1991-12-22-tr-1151-story.html<br><br>Unfortunately (and rather inexplicably), none of this was analyzed by forensics. <br><br>Does it mean anything on its own?
