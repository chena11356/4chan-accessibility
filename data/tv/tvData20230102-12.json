With Blockbuster, you would pre arrange the visit, you would call your friends to see if they want to come and watch a movie. The atmosphere on a friday night at Blockbuster was great, the horror section had young couples, the thriller had middle aged married couples - all friendly and there for the same reason you are. They usually had a recent release playing on a screen somewhere, so you&#039;d watch it for 5 minutes. Then on the way back you would maybe grab a McDonalds then go home and watch your film - and heres the big clincher - if the movie is shit? so what you would watch it all and maybe have your mind changed by the end.
