We Indian Hindus love Cameron&#039;s Avatar franchise even more than Marvel capeshit (inb4 poo memes/sir memes/do not redeem memes). The inspiration for Avatar was blue-skinned Hindu gods (like Vishnu and Shiva) according to Cameron himself. Also, the word &#039;avatar&#039; itself means &#039;divine incarnation&#039; in the ancient Sanskrit language of India. An &#039;avatar&#039; is a Hindu concept that refers to the descent of a divine being from the realm of spirit to the realm of matter where we all dwell. When Avatar 1 was released, James Cameron during one of his speeches in New Delhi mentioned &quot;I just have loved everything, the mythology, the entire Hindu pantheon, seems so rich and vivid.&quot; He continued and said, &quot;I didn&#039;t want to reference the Hindu religion so closely, but the subconscious association was interesting, and I hope I haven&#039;t offended anyone in doing so.&quot;<br>Furthermore, when Cameron was asked what exactly the word &#039;avatar&#039; means, he said \u201cIt&#039;s an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human&#039;s intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\u201d (source: https://www.jagrantv.com/en-show/av<wbr>atar-the-way-of-water-is-the-story-<wbr>related-to-matsya-avatar-cameron-sp<wbr>iritual-connection-with-india-rc103<wbr>7160)<br><br>Also, that liquid in Avatar: The Way Of Water which stops aging is called &#039;amrita&#039; and &#039;amrita&#039; is a Sanskrit word meaning &#039;immortality&#039;. In Hindu mythology, amrita is the nectar of the gods and the reason why the gods are immortal (or at least have very long lives by human standards).<br><br>&quot;I just like blue.

Your screen shakes a bit but quickly, and especially when it really starts shaking, the enemies are too dazed to actually pose a threat and you just do an easy jump before you&#039;re back in a cutscene. I don&#039;t really mind though if a game with fun gameplay has some cutscenes and cool setpieces sprinkled in. The problem I have is when people praise the story in those games that utterly fail to take advantage of the medium to convey it. At the risk of sounding like a whiny faggot, I think people touting games like TLOU as proof video games are art or the showrunner saying it&#039;s hands down the best story in video games is genuinely harmful to the medium. I think video games are capable of giving experiences and telling stories that other mediums really can&#039;t yet people are limiting them to aping movies and TV.<br><br><a href=\"#p179023466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179023466</a><br>Exactly.

They grinned and licked their lips and hooted at her as she went limping past, her breasts heaving with the effort of the climb. Some shouted obscene proposals, others insults.

Even Robert, Robert never loved me, but he saw that I was beautiful, he wanted me.<br>She did not feel beautiful, though. She felt old, used, filthy, ugly. There were stretch marks on her belly from the children she had borne, and her breasts were not as firm as they had been when she was younger. Without a gown to hold them up, they sagged against her chest. I should not have done this. I was their queen, but now they\u2019ve seen, they\u2019ve seen, they\u2019ve seen.

What&#039;s more likely is he created a telepathic communication network as himself as the core. The mutes communicate with eachother telepathically and it could possibly be done without the mutes needing to be wargs themselves. Euron is kinda repeating the experiment with all the religious and spiritual men he has locked along with Aeron. He wants them to pray (telepathically communicate) probably to use them to lure in a kraken. Maybe he believes they&#039;ll amplify his abilities, idk, we&#039;ll have to wait and see what happens in Winds to know more about how. He&#039;s got them locked away in the dark drinking shade of the evening which are both known to awaken telepathic abilities.

He just sees the oddities amongst white people, that white people don&#039;t see in themselves.<br>Take the movie get out for example. It&#039;s actually based on a book.(or at least that&#039;s my theory) The book is set in the old American south. One of the characters is a black live in maid. Or what is known as a &quot;mammy&quot;. And this mammy character does voodoo, and can see ghosts, and she&#039;s the total magical negro stereotype. The climax of the book, is when the mammy tells the little white girl &quot;if something happens to me, then eat my eyes&quot;. And the little 12 year old girl is terrified by the notion. She *loves* the mammy character and doesn&#039;t want to think about her dying, or having to eat her eyes.<br><br>Well of course, a few chapters later, the mammy dies mysteriously off screen to the ghosts. And the little girl literally eats her eyes. Which then gives her the ability to see ghosts too, and become the hero of the story, fighting back against the ghosts and saving the white family. I think Jordan Peele was inspired by this book, and that&#039;s why the core of all the black guy&#039;s problems, comes from the white photographer wanting his eyes.<br><br>There are a lot more parallels between the book and Get Out that I&#039;m not mentioning. I just want to get the main point across. That the book, despite sounding rather liberal for an old southern white author, still relies on the death of a magical voodoo mammy to prop up the white family. And many white people don&#039;t see any problem with this. They&#039;re like &quot;what&#039;s the big deal?&quot; It takes someone like Jordan Peele to re-contextualize the story to shed light on it.
