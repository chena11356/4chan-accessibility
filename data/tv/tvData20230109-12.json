A lot of hacks think that to make a villain they have to make him corrupt, and Jim didn&#039;t fall for that trap.<br>Instead he made a G.I. Joe action figure and puzzled out the way to make this Real American Hero into a believable antagonist without betraying what a Joe is at his core.<br>The result was Quaritch. A hero, a soldier, as honorable as one can be during a war, whose only known grudge was against the protagonist for what is undebatably his betrayal.<br>Of course, Jake wasn&#039;t evil either. He saw how corrupt the RDA was and got out of there out of an infatuation of Pandora and its people, not least of all Neytiri, of whom he fell in full blown love. Quaritch also saw RDA&#039;s corruption but swore an oath that defined him, and unlike Jake believed that the RDA despite its flaws worked toward the greater good of humanity. So not only did betrayal pit Quaritch against Sully, but also his own loyal bond, a bond that he made years before, that he had no intention of breaking.<br>Therein lies the loophole. The new Quaritch, with all of his memories, didn&#039;t physically swear this oath.

Their leaders engage in rhetoric all the time, trying to find new arguments to keep the flock in line. Particularly muslims, since they are more cruel and culturally regressed. Atheists have the harder argument to begin with, because they do not have this flock to continually speak to. There are less of them and more of the religious. So atheists get caught constantly having to explain to others why god does not exist. It SHOULD be on the religious to explain how something that there&#039;s ultimately no evidence for exists. But since there are so many believers, atheists always have to make arguments against what everyone else believes without evidence. It is kind of insane, if you think about it. But yeah, atheists are at the disadvantage by default. Shows like this don&#039;t really prove anything except one is a better rhetorician than the other. I have seen first hand, too, that the religious use emotional manipulation to keep their followers dull to any arguments against faith, and emotion is the one thing to stimulate to entrench people. There is way to much going against an atheist to begin with. I don&#039;t even argue anymore. I don&#039;t hate the religious and don&#039;t even care that they worship. Doesn&#039;t bother me. When someone asks to argue, it is usually to convert me, to try to play some rhetorical game to reassure themselves, or to try to prove to others that I&#039;m wrong by &quot;winning&quot; a single argument with no bearing on the reality of the situation.

With the right mindset, anyone can find success within their means. If you have an IQ of 90, you won&#039;t excell in an academic career, but you might still get a practical skillset and make good money in a trade. If you fucked your life up for whatever reason and you find yourself without easily marketable skills or prospects (as I did at one point in my late twenties), you can start out in unskilled work (barkeeping in my case) and work your way up into skilled work.

Successful, high-value labourers are smart, hard-working, good people, unsuccessful, low-value labourers are not. <br><br>So my reply is making the point that labour, and its value, exists within the nation-state&#039;s framework (ie, peoples&#039; labour doesn&#039;t necessarily have intrinsic value, only relative value within the society and the market), and that the nation-state itself, responsible for the raising of productive individuals, often fails those individuals, specifically in this case in the quality of their education. <br><br>Your point comes in as a total non-sequitur. In a conversation about individual labour value and responsibility you say that society needs grunts. Okay, but society&#039;s needs aren&#039;t a part of the conversation. Nobody&#039;s arguing that society doesn&#039;t need grunts, the argument is: whether society needs grunts or not, if you are a grunt, is it your fault?<br><br>You then say that )working-class) workers should have dignity, respect, and quality of life. Okay, but this is just a vague platitude. Workers DON&#039;T have that. The very fact you call them grunts points to a cultural contempt for workers, but giving that culture is abstract...

More than a year of that was with one bunkie, whom before long I wanted to kill. An elderly man, short, blue-eyed, big nose, missing two fingers. He&#039;d always say &quot;I used to be the right hand of Satan, now I&#039;m tryin&#039; to be a left foot for God!&quot; He used religion to compensate for the dark shit he&#039;d done. He was serving a ten year sentence for molesting his 8 year old grand daughter. Oh, he denied he did it, but his story made it clear he did. I&#039;ll just quote him. &quot;She asked me to tell her how to play strip poker, so I did. Then she asked me to teach her how to &#039;give a peter kiss and a vagina kiss&#039; a-and I told her that was inappropriate, but she told her mom I told her and showed her so now I&#039;m in prison!&quot; But all of his stories belied this same obsession. He was obsessed with little girls, girls peeing, and tiny vaginas. He was a former Navy officer who had been stationed in Korea and said repeatedly he wished they&#039;d just let him go back as when he was there, all the women were whores. I kept trying to tell him that was when it was a poor war-torn nation, but he wouldn&#039;t let anything dispel his fantasy. Had all these disgusting stories that always ended in some little girl trying to show him her pussy. Then he&#039;d see the look on my face like I was about to kill him and he&#039;d bluster and go &quot;A-and of course I told her no! Th-that that was wrong!&quot; He was a taxi driver to the Amish, did it for access to their kids. They called him &quot;the candy man&quot;. Creepy motherfucker. You think I&#039;m making this up?

Then I got really depressed when I didn&#039;t get my judicial and I put on like sixty pounds. Kept working out, but started eating less healthy. The food in there is absolute garbage. They had this fake onions meat they would make into everything, like they would form it into patties and sausages and claim it was all kinds of meat but it always tasted the same, no seasoning either so everything tasted like shit.

They let you order certain shit from catalogs and books and such from Amazon, but they wouldn&#039;t even let me order a pillow. Even in the &quot;well-behaved&quot; pod violence was a constant. I went fucking primal mode in there. I felt like some little lapdog that got abandoned in the jungle and had to remember how to be wild. Everyone&#039;s a con man in there, either trying to get money or ass. And I came out of there way more racist than I went in because you&#039;re exclusively around all the niggers that are the basis for all their negative stereotypes.

Anderson\u2019s Event Horizon (1997) would serve our purposes here, but there\u2019s no way it\u2019s getting picked over his masterpiece, Resident Evil: Retribution. A lithe sugar rush of conceptual and formal experimentalism, the film delivers on the fleetingly glimpsed promise of the previous film (Resident Evil: Afterlife, 2010), itself a welcome surprise given the franchise\u2019s inauspicious origins. For this fifth entry, Anderson throws caution to the wind, dropping any pretence of narrative cohesion for a balls-to-the-wall symphony of movement and abstraction in thrall to its leading lady, Milla Jovovich.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anderson has previous in the video game adaptation race, but none come close to Retribution\u2019s thematic engagement with the form. Effectively beginning at Afterlife\u2019s save point, the film sees long-dead characters return as part of an exhaustive conceptual design, an infinite loop of multiple, parallel realities. Video game logic that sees the dead \u2013 and the undead \u2013 rise to fight again ad infinitum? Sure, but also nifty commentary on the inexhaustible nature of franchise cinema.</span><br>Event Horizon is good, but it&#039;s the product of a young, hungry, inexperienced director. Also, Anderson wrote some of the better lines, but it isn&#039;t Anderson&#039;s script. It&#039;s only when you combine Anderson&#039;s direction with Anderson&#039;s script that you get films that truly examine the human condition.

At that time they were mostly under occupation. He was a Nazirite, an extremely strict sect of Hebrews who followed every commandment to the T. God promised that He would send someone to deliver them from their occupation, and through Samson this was fulfilled. Samson was given what we would call today superhuman strength and endurance. He killed over 1000 men on the battlefield with just a jawbone of a donkey as his weapon. He wrestled a lion and killed it. In accordance with his upbringing, he did not cut his hair ever and was supposed to be strict in observing God&#039;s laws. He later proved to basically violate every law there was. He killed, he ate from wild things in the wilderness (they were seen as unclean things to God), and he ended up sleeping with beautiful yet promiscuous women. Eventually, one of the enemy philistine women seduces him and tries to get the secret to his power. Eventually, though mostly aware of these attempts he gives in and tells her his hair is the secret. His hair is cut in his sleep and he awakes to enemy soldiers taking him into custody. Powerless, he&#039;s taken into the royal temple of the Philistines. There, the King had many idols and worship dedicated to their pagan god Dagon. They planned to sacrifice Samson to Dagon. Before that they wanted to torture and humiliate him for his previous victories, so they cut his eyes out and made him grind corn or grain (can&#039;t remember exactly) with a mortar stone. They then chain him by the arms between two massive pillars in their temple for all the royalty and observing crowd to see, kinda like a trophy display at a grand celebration. They had a pagan feast/orgy before sacrifice. There Samson remembered God for the first time in a long while. Throughout his victories and indulgence in the spoils of them he forgot to be faithful.", "time": 1673261189, "resto": 178973715}, {"no": 178975745, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:47:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178974104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178974104</a><br><a href=\"#p178975714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178975714</a><br>(Cont)<br><br>Now in his darkest hour, Samson calls out to God. He doesn&#039;t ask God to smite the Philistines, nor does he ask to be saved. He asks God to let him die with them. God sends him his strength one last time and Samson brings down the pillars which causes a reaction that destroys the whole temple in moments. He killed more people in that temple than he ever did on the battlefield. And since the philistine leadership was there, Israel had been effectively freed from Philistine occupation, thus fulfilling God&#039;s promise. So the point of the story? There&#039;s a few; but deep down, Samson realized he wasn&#039;t worthy of the strength bestowed to him. He gave into sin many times. Though the mighty strength made him invulnerable, he forgot that it was never really his to begin with. Though his hair had returned, his strength didn&#039;t come back until he reached out to God. The point is that it never was about the hair to begin with, it was about the strength that comes when one truly walks with the Lord. And by obeying God&#039;s commandments do we walk that road. Like everything else in the OT, this story is a preview of Jesus Christ and what He did and does for us. When you walk with Christ you gain the most power of all, which is eternal life. Samson shows us a picture of Christ in some ways. Christ succeeded where Samson failed, but both shared similarities. Both were sent to liberate their people from the enemy, both did so with their deaths. Both had godly power, but one was stronger than death itself. Both were judges sent by God with a predestined purpose.", "time": 1673261266, "resto": 178973715}, {"no": 178975915, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:54:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "for me it&#039;s<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;christ</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;job</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;samson</span>", "time": 1673261685, "resto": 178973715}, {"no": 178975927, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:55:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178975714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178975714</a><br><a href=\"#p178975745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178975745</a><br>Based informative poster", "time": 1673261707, "resto": 178973715}, {"no": 178975979, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178974104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178974104</a><br><a href=\"#p178975714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178975714</a><br><a href=\"#p178975745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178975745</a><br><br>However imo, the most interesting reflection from this story is from the whole time Samson is captured until his death. This is an amazing depicture of a preview of what the world and we Christians will go through in the end times great tribulation. In the end we will be all but defeated, captured and rounded up by the enemy (the AntiChrist and his One World Order). They will celebrate our demise and declare themselves victorious in the presence of their demonic god. It will be in that time when we remember God. When we realize how carried away we got with our indulgences, without real punishment from God. It usually happens that way when someone goes through their darkest moments. When their ego has been stripped of them. They cry out to God. Likewise so will we and God will hear us. He sends Jesus Christ once again for the final time. The final judgment.

However unlikely, \u201cFoundry\u201d did begin shooting in late September of 2021 so there was concurrent overlap making it possible Andy Serkis played Snoke again.
