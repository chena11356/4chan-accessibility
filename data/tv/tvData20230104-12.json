Arisu and all the others were people who were in-between life and death temporarily - their hearts stopped - and they all experienced a shared near-death-experience based on their collective unconsiousness. Those who died in the games passed on and didn&#039;t make it, those who survived were resuscitated and woke up in the real world alive again, but lost their memories of the events in the Borderlands. They were still changed by the experience though, having found their reasons for living or a will to live etc. Usagi and Arisu run into eachother in the hospital and feel strongly that they&#039;ve met before, and end up going on a date. Kuina reunites with her family, Chishiya decides he might try being less of a dick. Niragi will probably still rape but who knows. So in the end, the Borderlands are quite literally the border between life and death. The sequel manga (Alice on Border Road) explores this concept of shared life or death experiences in more detail and soldifies the idea that it&#039;s the boundary between being dead and alive.</s>", "filename": "aliceroadgamon", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 847, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672833680431329, "time": 1672833680, "md5": "+LBMYKiv1FIKRMwkUj1ulA==", "fsize": 290015, "resto": 178749211, "spoiler": 1}, {"no": 178756181, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:05:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178756048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178756048</a><br>dietary estrogen isn&#039;t the stuff that feminizes you<br>common misconception", "time": 1672833901, "resto": 178749211}, {"no": 178756553, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:20:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178756096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178756096</a><br>Cheers for the summary.<br>I wasn&#039;t expecting something that... exoteric?

There are a few safety features to fully disengage the motor when the doors open as well. <br>Now, take a -close- look at the tread.
