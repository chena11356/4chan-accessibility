Some nasty old lady. She&#039;d literally hit us, make fun of us, call us dead meat, slap us around. One day she grabbed my friend out of line (he was talking!) punched him in the face and threw him into a wall and started screaming at him. After (these are third graders) me and a couple other kids rallied the class to write letters to the principal. We told our parents about it, everyone. Imagine getting beat up by a teacher you&#039;d go crying to mom. Which is exactly what I did but she didn&#039;t believe me. I ended up just not doing work and just being defiant in class so I got all E&#039;s so my mom took my N64 away and made me go to bed at 7pm and I couldn&#039;t hang out with my friends. Sun would still be up and I&#039;d see my friends playing outside and I couldn&#039;t get out of bed. Start of the school year til like spring which was when we wrote the letters. So we write the letters say she&#039;s a sick bitch and our parents won&#039;t help us and she beats us etc. a huge stack from the whole class like 25 kids and I put them in the principal&#039;s drop box. Dumb vile old whore who had apparently been working there for decades quit and she never came back to class. We ended up getting a really hot young teacher who was great for the last couple months of the year and it was great. So in the end, since the weather was warm we went on a field trip and my mom came as a chaperone with a bunch of other parents and my mom talked to the other mothers and realized it was all real and gave me my N64 back and let me go outside. I was excited then, but looking back on it whooptie do I lost like a year of my life as a very young kid being beaten in school all day and coming home to madness and abuse and looking out my window and watching the sun go down but I &quot;get to play Nintendo again!&quot; Fuck you mom, you demented bitch.", "filename": "550", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673670890242318, "time": 1673670890, "md5": "/ATK0j9G9XgUqlup8tmenw==", "fsize": 34507, "resto": 179186743}, {"no": 179193190, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:36:08", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "i_am_jazz", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 775, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673670968144868, "time": 1673670968, "md5": "8XvsGLngAXM6SLTI8HBkzw==", "fsize": 474388, "resto": 179186743}, {"no": 179193271, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179189451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179189451</a><br>based mom", "time": 1673671121, "resto": 179186743}, {"no": 179193306, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:40:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179187585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179187585</a><br>Unironic delusion.

This typically occurs during moderate and severe hypothermia, as the person becomes disoriented, confused, and combative. They may begin discarding their clothing, which, in turn, increases the rate of heat loss.[21][22]<br><br>Rescuers who are trained in mountain survival techniques are taught to expect this; however, people who die from hypothermia in urban environments who are found in an undressed state are sometimes incorrectly assumed to have been subjected to sexual assault.[23]<br><br>One explanation for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body temperature. Another explanation is that the muscles contracting peripheral blood vessels become exhausted (known as a loss of vasomotor tone) and relax, leading to a sudden surge of blood (and heat) to the extremities, causing the person to feel overheated.[23][24]&quot;", "time": 1673659533, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186340, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:25:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179184687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179184687</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So what exactly is it thats disappearing all the people in the national parks?</span><br>Aliens, chupacabras and serial killers.", "time": 1673659546, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186542, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:30:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179184687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179184687</a><br>some unknown transmission vector between humans and jimsonweed is causing people to occasionally completely lose their shit when they&#039;re out on a hike, resulting in their eventual death", "time": 1673659835, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186571, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:31:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A year after Cian McLaughlin, 27, was last seen in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, his family and park officials are reigniting the search for the missing Irish man.<br><br>https://www.irishcentral.com/news/c<wbr>ian-mclaughlin-search-reignited", "filename": "cropped_cropped_cropped_cropped_Missing_Cian_McLaughlin_via_National_Parks_service", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 575, "h": 405, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1673659864649923, "time": 1673659864, "md5": "Pg/wdlv6XJHSGgbg5sbZXw==", "fsize": 47725, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186604, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:31:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186282</a><br><br>Post photo or video of a UFO/UAP that is detailed enough that it can&#039;t be &quot;almost anything&quot; and which hasn&#039;t been debunked.", "time": 1673659918, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186615, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:32:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186331</a><br>ok now watch the doc and try to apply that reasoning to the disappearances", "time": 1673659937, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186659, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:33:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186604</a><br>Does the alien need to show a valid drivers license and proof of residency too?", "time": 1673659998, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186662, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:33:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186604</a>", "filename": "C504C2A6-6804-4750-93EC-F3CB45289101", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 5523, "h": 3786, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1673660000256680, "time": 1673660000, "md5": "YWA7wGi2xcJHpf9pjHU80Q==", "fsize": 2809689, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186697, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:34:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186542</a><br>keyed", "filename": "ahm8dCxUiqhuCbpngmFSeuWRWfQ", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1400, "h": 2100, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673660045809606, "time": 1673660045, "md5": "BML41ZUn5g2nzV3lXH//Lg==", "fsize": 278167, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186737, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:35:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186662</a><br>wow a frisbee in black and white, great &#039;proof&#039;", "time": 1673660102, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186740, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:35:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "missing 411 is a very good television show", "time": 1673660107, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186751, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:35:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "when it&#039;s my time to go, i&#039;m going to hike out into the thickest wilderness i can and try to survive for as long as i can. it&#039;ll be like a judge taking the long walk across the cursed earth. i&#039;ll probably die of exposure in less than 24 hours.", "time": 1673660126, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186783, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:36:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186571</a>", "filename": "McLaughlin-Missing-Person-Flyer-2022.pdf", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 960, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673660168597425, "time": 1673660168, "md5": "lM5NMD9KIxmM3TE6L+k+Ow==", "fsize": 133784, "resto": 179184687}, {"no": 179186787, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:36:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179186659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179186659</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does the alien need to show a valid drivers license and proof of residency too?</span><br><br>The could be &quot;could be almost anything&quot; prohibition is to filter out the media that is so low quality is shows a blob moving around...something.
