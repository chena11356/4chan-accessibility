Shell-shock is a form of PTSD almost exclusive to WW1 because of how psychologically fucked up it was to sit in a trench and be shot at by artillery for hours. Yes, you&#039;d spend days and weeks bored in the trenches. And every now and then one of your buddies lets the boredom get the better of him and has his head blown off in front of you because a sniper caught a glimpse of him. When it rains, your trench turns into a disease-riddled swamp. If you don&#039;t get tuberculosis, you&#039;re still guaranteed to get trench foot and you better hope you&#039;ll get switched out from front service soon so your foot doesn&#039;t just rot away. When you try to sleep, rats will nibble away at any exposed body part. Or some enemy trench raider managed to sneak in and murders you in your sleep.

Castles fell out of military use because artillery became too powerful, building an O or U shaped mud wall behind a trench is just asking to get blasted by artillery while your infantry stays out of musket range. Once there is only a trench left, you charge as a narrow line at the trenches. The whole deal with early fire weapons is that they take long to reload, are imprecise and prone to misfire. The whole line formation thing is about concentrating fire and negating those things. If your men are spread out in a U shape in a narrow trench, they can&#039;t concentrate fire and will barely be able to pick off the enemy who is charging at them from one direction. Use cavalry to kill off any stragglers, because the enemy cavalry is necessarily dead from being a huge target that didn&#039;t fit in the trenches and got blown away behind the mud wall.", "time": 1671881244, "resto": 178280979}, {"no": 178285796, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:29:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;my artillery pins you down as my overwhelming infantry force storms your trench</span><br><br>Yes yes well done well done...HOWEVER<br><br>I have planted barrels of black powder in the ground directly ahead of my trench and detonate them just as your force passes over them", "time": 1671881346, "resto": 178280979}, {"no": 178285827, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:30:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285796</a><br>https://youtu.be/x5fbYJMEyes?t=60<br><br>K I N O", "time": 1671881441, "resto": 178280979}, {"no": 178285855, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:32:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285796</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have planted barrels of black powder in the ground directly ahead of my trench and detonate them just as your force passes over them</span><br>ok, so the first assault wave dies, and so do all the guys in your trench. i march the remainder of my force past your corpses.", "time": 1671881523, "resto": 178280979}, {"no": 178286142, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:46:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285316</a><br>at this point you have effectively formed a square.<br>guess how squares were countered historically?<br>cannon.", "time": 1671882387, "resto": 178280979}, {"no": 178286469, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)07:03:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178281459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178281459</a><br>thats not how it went down though.

Yes, some people still unfortunately kill themselves. But, every single person who undergoes surgery who doesnt is a person whose life is saved. It is not cosmetic, it is life saving.<br><br>Secondly, estrogen is not bad for your mind or body in any way as an assigned-at-birth male. There is zero scientific evidence that it is. This is baseless and only serves to scare people away from taking the medicine they need<br><br>Third: it can be &quot;too late to change&quot;. I am 37 and I only began hrt 5 years ago. Within two years I was visually passing and now my voice sounds indistinguishable from any other woman&#039;s.<br><br>Finally, that it is bad for children to transition. Most children have no issue with this and think it&#039;s cool to know a trans individual. And giving children estrogen does in fact make it easier on them psychologically to go through their lives as a woman. There is zero evidence that any child has experienced adverse effects growing up compared to non-trans children.<br><br>I will talk to anyone about any of these things. I&#039;m just sick of seeing baseless bullshit spewed about us on this board. Seeing that stuff early on in my transition made me think about some things I never want to think about again.

Coruscant is one of the more convincing images on screen we have today of Isaac Asimov&#039;s conception of the world-girdling city of Trantor. Coruscant is a planet-covering open-air city, while Trantor&#039;s buildings are all subterranean or under domes due to worsening weather conditions. Asimov&#039;s Trantor thus differs from Coruscant in that Trantor is more practically adapted to inclement weather, although weather control devices are used on both planets. It should be noted that there is a planet called Trantor in the Star Wars universe, and it is also an ecumenopolis.</span>", "time": 1671879064, "resto": 178282847}, {"no": 178285628, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:21:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178284118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178284118</a><br>you wish tranny", "time": 1671880861, "resto": 178282847}, {"no": 178286158, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:47:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178284296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178284296</a><br><a href=\"#p178285628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285628</a><br>It was trans writers and fans...<br>Why deny reality?<br>Just like SW is for homos, the normal males that rub dicks in butts.", "time": 1671882456, "resto": 178282847}, {"no": 178287012, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)07:32:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178282847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178282847</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;mogs Star Wars</span><br>Show me a single main female character dressed like this and that it has become an icon", "filename": "slave-leia-bikini", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1142, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1671885138791671, "time": 1671885138, "md5": "mfcniyEZ6vpEA/yt5YmCFA==", "fsize": 142378, "resto": 178282847}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 178285854, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:31:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "how do you respond without sounding mad?", "filename": "the.banshees.of.inisherin.2022", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1671881514213007, "time": 1671881514, "md5": "FvN5a75f3dnkNE+xDTFFzw==", "fsize": 192034, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-do-you-respond-without-sounding-mad", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 36, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 27}, {"no": 178285877, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:33:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285854</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I didn&#039;t realise we liked each other</span>", "time": 1671881595, "resto": 178285854}, {"no": 178285883, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:33:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285854</a><br>Burn his house down", "time": 1671881614, "resto": 178285854}, {"no": 178285924, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:35:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285854</a><br>Do you think if he could&#039;ve done it all over again he would have just tolerated the goat shit stories or cut off all his fingers and lost his house a second time", "time": 1671881737, "resto": 178285854}, {"no": 178285954, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:36:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285854</a><br>*any more", "time": 1671881819, "resto": 178285854}, {"no": 178285967, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:37:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "get in line, Pops", "time": 1671881854, "resto": 178285854}, {"no": 178286042, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:40:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285854</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think you might be a little depressed, and I won&#039;t give up on you.</span>", "time": 1671882054, "resto": 178285854}, {"no": 178286079, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are we rowin&#039;?!", "time": 1671882181, "resto": 178285854}, {"no": 178286538, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)07:07:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178286042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178286042</a><br>how did he not manage to have ANY friends outside of Colm?

Hughes promised that he could make the movie for less than $10 million, considerably less than most feature film production budgets of that era. Concerned that the film might exceed that amount, Hughes met secretly with 20th Century Fox before production to see if they would fund the project if Warner proved inflexible. According to executive producer Scott Rosenfelt, a copy of the script was &quot;clandestinely&quot; delivered to Fox, bypassing the legal restrictions that would have otherwise prevented Fox from seeing it until the project was in turnaround.[16] Early in production, the budget grew to $14.7 million. Warner demanded that it be cut by $1.2 million; the producers responded with a memo arguing that the budget could not be cut any further. Budget cuts resulted in cast member Joe Pesci playing two different characters in the film - Harry Lime, the thief, and the police officer who visits the McCallisters at the beginning of the film</span><br><br>there you go", "time": 1671882479, "resto": 178285800}, {"no": 178286200, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:49:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285800</a><br>they were twin borthers, one good, one evil", "time": 1671882596, "resto": 178285800}, {"no": 178286234, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:51:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178285800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178285800</a><br>I thought he was staking the place out", "time": 1671882712, "resto": 178285800}, {"no": 178286244, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:52:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178286234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178286234</a><br>that&#039;s absurd", "time": 1671882735, "resto": 178285800}, {"no": 178286288, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178286234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178286234</a><br>How does that make any giving sense?", "time": 1671882915, "resto": 178285800}, {"no": 178286462, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)07:03:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Harry pretended to be a cop so he could ask people if they would have been at home or go somewhere to celebrate holydays, so he and Marv could have robbed their homes undisturbed. <br><a href=\"#p178286172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178286172</a> <br>In this way they got the chance to insert this plot twist.", "time": 1671883405, "resto": 178285800}, {"no": 178286554, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)07:08:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The fuck do you people mean?

Women are the closest thing to God that can possibly exist in this universe (religion isn&#039;t real). I would honestly put 10,000 men to their death if it meant saving a single pretty woman. <br>And if she doesn&#039;t choose to be with me, even upon learning of my sacrifice, that would be OK. Simply knowing that I saved a woman and to know that she is thriving would be enough to give meaning to my life. <br><br>That&#039;s how it is, always been, and always will be.", "time": 1671845153, "resto": 178262181}, {"no": 178270584, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:31:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178263549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178263549</a><br>It show a recent youtube layout/colors with square pics, youtube has used round pics since before they changed the like/dislike barr from green/red to blue/grey.

Jackie is a gang-fighter. Lee was known (or mythologized) as a one-to-one guy in early hometown fights (against other tiny, underfed asian dudes). Jackie and co were all well-fed because the Opera School was well funded and they drilled stage-acrobatics and dance all day. They were coordinated and other street scrappers were gang fighters too.<br><br>Samo Hung was apparently a real mean bastard in street fights and used his ballooning weight to his advantage. Jackie was always considered &quot;big&quot; among his peers too. He was called Pou Pou or something like that, meaning &quot;cannon ball&quot; because his head was so big and solid (also his dad was a chef in an embassy, so he was getting lots of food from day one). Look at his other buddies Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah, they were considered tiny and skinny, and they map closest to Bruce Lee in terms of acrobatic speed and flexibility on screen (particularly in the Green Hornet where he moves a million miles an hour - very similar to Biao and Wah in the earlier movies). It was in his later movies that Lee tried to push into the new &quot;coiled spring&quot; figure with a boosted muscle load.<br><br>As filmmakers, I&#039;d say they&#039;re on par with each other. But each mastered a different sub-genre of martial arts movies. Jackie is the better stuntman (obviously), but Lee had the superior story-sense of how a fight should unfold. That holding back is just as important as that final wild energy. You can see Jackie attempting these Lee moments when he had a guy like Benny Urquidez to work with, but it would still spiral into those amazing acrobatic moves. And it was better for him to follow that road than keep living in Lee&#039;s (screen) shadow. He was a master of marshaling chaos on screen, while Lee was a master of stripping things down to bare essentials.", "time": 1671863954, "resto": 178270592}, {"no": 178279834, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:45:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178279531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178279531</a><br>He won the European championship in karate once.", "time": 1671864304, "resto": 178270592}, {"no": 178279880, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:46:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178273397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178273397</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you met Bruce Lee?</span><br>This is not how knowledge is accumulated or formed, dropkick.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Did you meet Julius Caesar?

To the ancients it was one of the Pillars of Hercules (the other pillar is far less impressive), the gateway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic. Today it is a British outpost at the bottom of Spain, one of the last remnants of an empire that once spanned the globe. I visited there some years ago, on one of my tours through Spain and Portugal, and found the place just as fascinating in person as I had in print. It\u2019s the home of the Barbary apes, who will hop on your back and steal your hat and eyeglasses if you let them. There are British pubs and fish-and-chip shops all over the town at the Rock\u2019s foot, as well as some amazing Spanish restaurants. And INSIDE the Rock\u2026 it\u2019s not just a big hunk of stone, y\u2019see\u2026 are 34 miles of tunnels, more than 150 halls, chambers, and caves, Napoleonic gunports and cannons looking out over land and sea, stalagmites and stalactites, World War II bunkers, a concert hall/ ampitheatre, a hospital (WWII era), and ancient mines.</span>", "filename": "s-l500", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 342, "h": 500, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671873964210578, "time": 1671873964, "md5": "v4AF5YVSbqL4iqRW7pQO/w==", "fsize": 40672, "resto": 178262347}, {"no": 178283319, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:26:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;George R.R.

The Eyrie, Winterfell, Storm\u2019s End, they all have formidable defenses\u2026 but none of them can match Casterly Rock. When Harren the Black built Harrenhal, he thought his immense new castle could defy even dragons. Stone does not burn, he reasoned.

And Balerion\u2019s flames proved hot enough to turn Harren\u2019s massive towers molten.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But Casterly Rock is a mountain, and its chambers and halls are buried deep inside, under tons of solid stone.

Obviously, it\u2019s also kind of a tiny bed, and the frame looks very childish. Not a bed you can invite a man into. Has she given up? Does she just expect to stay single forever?

But I watched TWOW just cause nothing else was on and I really did not expect to be THAT impressed by the CGI and overall production quality. I think this film is even further ahead in terms of spectacle and special effects compared to other 2022 films, than the first film was compared to other films from 2009. And after over a decade of near constant soulless regurgitated slop by Marvel that feels like it gets uglier and less creative as years go by, Avatar 2 is just a genuinely well made classic blockbuster with as much attention as possible paid to making a spectacle that wows with every shot. While the story is very basic, I even found myself enjoying the characters and liking things like the fact there is a respectable and caring father figure portrayed on film, or a simple yet effective coming of age story for a group of likable new young characters. I think I will watch it again so I can see if 3D makes a difference, but really even in 2D I am happy to have a film that is genuinely worth going to the cinema for, the only one this year after Top Gun Maverick.", "time": 1671873906, "resto": 178283227}, {"no": 178283310, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:25:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178283227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178283227</a><br>So it\u2019ll make a billion less than the original.

Because whatever they touch \u2013 and they touch everything \u2013 they\u2019ve debased. This is the way it was until the final victory. Until the triumphant end. Acquire debase, debase, acquire.

Then they saw and understood that if this was so, then they themselves do not exist either! You see, I reckon this may have been the moment when we can say that were extinguished, they burnt out. Extinguished and burnt out like the fire left to smolder in the meadow. One was the constant loser one was the constant winner. Defeat victory defeat victory and one day here in the neighborhood I had to realize, and I did realize, that I was mistaken, I was truly mistaken when I thought that there has never been and could never be any kind of change here on earth.

[2000] and in J.S.A., the investigator wasn\u2019t a female character in the original novel\u2014I consciously turned her into a female character. So I did have a feminist side to me, just not in such a pronounced way. But the reason I said that was because after I made Oldboy, I realized that the only character who is not privy to the entire truth in that film was the female character; she was the only female character in the film, and she was excluded from the truth. That made me so uncomfortable in such a big way that is spurred me on to developing Lady Vengeance. That was the genesis from which I went on to make other films with strong female characters. So to simplify things, I said it like that, that Oldboy was the moment when I turned into a big feminist.</span>", "time": 1671874246, "resto": 178245727}, {"no": 178283481, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:34:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178283409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178283409</a><br>Parkbros......how the fuck do we cope with this one?", "time": 1671874457, "resto": 178245727}, {"no": 178283547, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:37:35", "name": "sage", "com": "<a href=\"#p178283481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178283481</a><br>Judging films, not interviews", "time": 1671874655, "resto": 178245727}, {"no": 178283588, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:39:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Test", "time": 1671874769, "resto": 178245727}, {"no": 178283616, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:41:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178270493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178270493</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s an ingenious play on the genre</span><br>But it&#039;s not a play on the genre?

Rewatching it afterwards left me very turned off from further movies. But I watched TWOW just cause nothing else was on and I really did not expect to be THAT impressed by the CGI and overall production quality. I think this film is even further ahead in terms of spectacle and special effects compared to other 2022 films, than the first film was compared to other films from 2009. And after over a decade of near constant soulless regurgitated slop by Marvel that feels like it gets uglier and less creative as years go by, Avatar 2 is just a genuinely well made classic blockbuster with as much attention as possible paid to making a spectacle that wows with every shot. While the story is very basic, I even found myself enjoying the characters and liking things like the fact there is a respectable and caring father figure portrayed on film, or a simple yet effective coming of age story for a group of likable new young characters. I think I will watch it again so I can see if 3D makes a difference, but really even in 2D I am happy to have a film that is genuinely worth going to the cinema for, the only one this year after Top Gun Maverick.", "time": 1671878301, "resto": 178284756}, {"no": 178284802, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:39:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178284756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178284756</a><br>Any movie that&#039;s well made and not capeshit is an automatic 7.
