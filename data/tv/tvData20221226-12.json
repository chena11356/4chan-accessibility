Voyager gets a bad rap, but I unironically think it&#039;s the series most in line with what Gene actually was trying to create, with how it maintainst the optimism of the future, without skipping past the part of how everyone got to understand eachother and work as equals, by creating a crew where practically the entire main cast is an outsider to some degree other than Janeway, as the only other proper Starfleet officers are Tuvok, the Vulcan, and Harry Kim who&#039;s on his first real asignment. The way they all find their place in the crew over time is I think a lot more in line with the spirit of the show Gene talked about in &quot;The Star Trek Dream&quot; which is one of the segments of Inside Star Trek: https://youtu.be/rpHAUcVC9qk?t=3006<wbr> (Basically the 50 minute mark, if it doesn&#039;t auto jump there for you.)<br>I feel like letting the characters actually be outsiders to eachother, and run into issues because of this and learn to work past them is a much more powerful and interesting to watch approach to Star Trek&#039;s vision of an inclusive and understanding future, than what too many modern shows, films and even books do, where characters are made in a way that they&#039;d no doubt be seen as outsiders for the way they are by most of society today, but no one in the story actually encounters any issues with them.<br>Ironically, there is nothing to relate to, in a character who is &quot;like you&quot;, but doesn&#039;t face any of the struggles you face, and ends up feeling like all the cookie cutter stories about depression where the solution turns out to be &quot;just don&#039;t be sad&quot; or &quot;just get help from your pre-existing deeply reliable and trusted friends/family&quot;, where for many these aren&#039;t straightforward options.<br><br>It&#039;s got a few really meh episodes (mostly Chakotay ones), but to my mind, the Doctor is the best character in the whole franchise, and almost any episode focusing on him is instant gold.<br><br><br>In place of a TL;DR, instead: Have fun, Anon, and Merry Christmas!", "filename": "Doctor", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 439, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 68, "tim": 1672002575667492, "time": 1672002575, "md5": "KNwBAW4QrCIQwNzK/e9jqw==", "fsize": 452709, "resto": 178322964}, {"no": 178336254, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)16:11:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178336197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178336197</a><br>Name one bad Chakotay episode", "time": 1672002693, "resto": 178322964}, {"no": 178336334, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)16:13:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178332900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178332900</a><br>That\u2019s not even judys posting style you retard.

It&#039;s better than what I had heard. Not as good as DS9, but I can&#039;t remember a single episode that bored me enough to lose interest. Some points I&#039;ve noted:<br>- The Kazon are the shittiest hostile race in all of Star Trek and I&#039;m glad they&#039;re finally gone from the show. How the fuck are they able to control so much territory when they&#039;re basically troglodytes who escaped slavery a mere 50 years ago? All their tech is stolen and they&#039;re too stupid to get water of all fucking things, yet they&#039;re able to operate and repair ships. How was Culluh even able to keep up with Voyager&#039;s speed?<br>- The Doctor is hands down the best character in the show and perhaps the entire franchise. I also like Neelix a lot, but I feel he&#039;s been losing a lot of screentime lately. Seven of Nine seems interesting so far. Chakotay is very boring and one-dimensional, he&#039;s little more than Janeway&#039;s goody two-shoes yesman. Everyone else is alright.<br>- Suder should have stayed as a semi-regular character.<br>- The use of technobabble is way too excessive and annoying here compared to the previous series.<br>- I&#039;m sure this has been mentioned many times before, but it kinda breaks my suspension of disbelief that Voyager gets repaired so quickly, and always off-screen. They also seem to have an infinite supply of torpedos and shuttles (maybe they can build more with replicated parts?).<br>- I&#039;m still in disbelief at Harry being the only one left from the &quot;original Voyager&quot;.

Its not the good old days where people gradually learned how to pirate by starting out with napster, then kazaa and then piratebay and always had a brother or friend who could teach them new and better ways. Even then, if it more complicated than just installing a program, downloading a file pressing start to start downloading people would be confused by the tutorial. Usenet adds a step of complexity since simply installing nzbget isn&#039;t enough, you have to actually set up shit like your account, server, encryption port and so on. Make any mistake and the software doesn&#039;t tell you what you did wrong like a person would, it just pits out some error code you have to look up in the message log to find and you gotta google what that means and then go through the settings to see what you did wrong, assuming you did anything wrong.

That doesn&#039;t make their work best or to be exact best for this particular franchise. For the record I like both GMK and Shin Godzilla.<br>1)Anno of course has a recognizable style, he brings with him his cast and crew like the plagiarist composer guy. For some time Toho wanted to turn Shin Godzilla into the new default version but it didn&#039;t stick. And it could never work. It&#039;s clearly a stand alone film, cleverly made but unlike the 1954 movie it&#039;s all subtext with no text. I mean that it&#039;s very clearly HIS film. Ishiro Honda is still the best Godzilla director in franchise history. Was he a company man? He was a huge filmmaking talent with unrealized potential due to studio politics and he didn&#039;t enjoy the same freedom.<br>2)Kaneko is a Gamera guy, he did great things with Gamera and he pretty much remodelled the entire series the way he wanted. I know his pitch for the Gamera revival was rejected but before we see the anime we won&#039;t know how much it owes to his vision of Gamera because I feel like he managed to basically became something like the second original creator of Gamera. But he could never do the same with Godzilla who&#039;s a different caliber. <br>3)Higuchi said some unkind things about Heisei Godzilla and Koichi Kawakita but worked with both Anno and Kaneko on their Godzilla movies. Now he directed Ultraman and I heard a rumor that he&#039;s helping with Gamera anime.<br>Basically their takes on Gamera, Ultraman or (supposedly) Kamen Rider is closer to the core of the characters than their Godzilla movies. So I&#039;m glad that Toho picked that other guy to be the next go to Godzilla director because he&#039;s known for putting Godzilla cameos in his movies and he&#039;s a fan of the original movies.

There, The Last Samurai opened on 6 December 2003 and was met with high box-office returns and favourable reviews. For example, the film grossed USD111,127,263 in the American market (24.3% of its total revenue), and was ranked 20th in the U.S. box-office movies list. In Japan, the movie grossed USD119,268,595, which surpassed the U.S. figures. This movie was the second most popular movie in Japan in 2003, based on box office sales.1 Critics of the film magazine Kinema Junp\u014d listed The Last Samurai as the fifth best foreign film of 2003, while their readers voted it the second best foreign film of the year, beating out blockbusters such as Chicago [Marshall 2002] and Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers [Jackson 2002] (Kinema Junp\u014d 2004).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While The Last Samurai elicited a variety of critical and popular responses from admiration to simple indifference, one of the most common reactions of both critics and popular reviewers was one of tears. For example, Ochi Michi\u014d, writing in the film magazine Kinema Junp\u014d, seemed profoundly moved: &quot;What&#039;s surprising about this movie is how even one week after watching a preview screening, scenes from the movie keep playing in my mind and continue to be alive. Moreover, my tears start to pour out when I think of them&quot; (Ochi 2003: 35). In addition, many Japanese-language members posted similar reactions on the Yahoo!Japan discussion board. A user, Joker6818 noted that he could not stop crying during the last hour of the movie. Another reviewer, nf7to0268 noted that the audience could not move after the film was over because they were too emotionally drained from crying.</span>", "filename": "DC220468-BAA7-41F6-9824-AAAEE84DD685", "ext": ".png", "w": 3381, "h": 2055, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 75, "tim": 1672046953905716, "time": 1672046953, "md5": "RSpq0HMfe0XXo+o3g/u73g==", "fsize": 1712961, "resto": 178354803}, {"no": 178355393, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:30:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178355305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178355305</a><br>Asians from Asia don\u2019t tend to have the type of insecurities seething Asian Americans have.", "time": 1672047016, "resto": 178354803}, {"no": 178355426, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:32:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178355342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178355342</a><br>Thank you for your stunning contribution anon, I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t die alone", "time": 1672047131, "resto": 178354803}, {"no": 178355451, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:33:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178354821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178354821</a><br>I&#039;ve never seen much white male jap woman jav porn, but theres lots of blacked jav porn.

Each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others.

The Harry Potter series might be anti-Christian (or not), but it\u2019s certainly the anti-James Bond series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to face that fact.

Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right.

Though both Brawl in Cell Block 99 and Dragged Across Concrete are long movies, the latter certainly overstays its welcome.<br><br>I think it\u2019s because of the fact that Brawl focuses on a single character and his ordeal while Dragged Against Concrete focuses with multiple people and does not manage to give each character proper depth and empathy. Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn were amazing in their roles, but Tory Kittles and Michael Jai White felt insignificant which came as a surprise cause one of them, Henry, survives the ordeal than either Gibson\u2019s character Ridgeman or Vaugh\u2019s Lurasetti who got the most screen-time and objectively the most attention. (I suppose the director foreshadows their deaths by having Jennifer Carpenter\u2019s mother character Kelly Summer killed so quickly while giving her so much story, even more so than the black characters.) The other two black characters didn\u2019t make me feel much sympathetic for them considering one of them (Michael J White\u2019s character) does not even get much time for audience connection.<br><br>Whatever the case, after Vaughn\u2019s character gets killed, the film takes a nosedive in quality only sustained by Mel Gibson and the question if he would come out of the standoff with his life. But then he gets killed later on which felt extremely cheap to me. Earlier Vaughn\u2019s death too was a little unbelievable. I cannot fathom that the two experienced cops would not have got a little bit suspicious when they saw the hostage crawling towards them. The killing of the two most likable protagonists felt subversive in a way cause I expected at least one of them to live. One could argue it fits the theme of \u201ccrime does not pay\u201d, but if you are going to kill to your most interesting characters, no amount of kowtowing to THEME is going to save your story.<br><br>Overall the experience was pretty forgettable.

My children live with an unconscious fear that they may not live out their natural lives. I am not saying that fear is good. I am trying to find a way to deal with that anxiety. An architecture that puts its head in the sand and goes back to neoclassicism, and Schinkel, Lutyens, and Ledoux, does not seem to be a way of dealing with the present anxiety. Most of what my colleagues are doing today does not seem to be the way to go. Equally, I do not believe that the way to go, as you suggest, is to put up structures to make people feel comfortable, to preclude that anxiety. What is a person to do if he cannot react against anxiety or see it pictured in his life? After all, that is what all those evil Struwwel Peter characters are for in German fairy tales.<br><br>CA: Don&#039;t you think there is enough anxiety at present?

There was nothing. What I&#039;m suggesting is that if we make people so comfortable in these nice little structures of yours, that we might lull them into thinking that everything&#039;s all right, Jack, which it isn&#039;t.

Nobody has ever shown you a video of a nuclear bomb being deployed from a plane and then detonating in such a way that you can observe a massive self-sustained reaction causing a massive explosion. This would be not only possible but very easy, especially considering many nuclear bombs are said to be deployed with parachutes that slow their rate of descent. You&#039;ve never seen anything like this - in fact the vast majority of &#039;nuke bomb&#039; footage is of stationary sites on the ground, barges, or tower-mounted bombs - in all cases the actual &#039;nuclear warhead&#039; is never visible, and it&#039;s never clearly shown that there isn&#039;t a pile of conventional explosives set up. Nuclear weapons testing was moved from the US test sites to the south pacific at bikini atoll because the lack of visible landmarks makes it harder to perceive and critically measure the size of these explosions. It also creates more impressive &#039;Wilson&#039; clouds (or &#039;condensation clouds&#039;), which have now been propagandistically linked in most people&#039;s minds with nukes - even though these are also produced by conventional explosives. Leo Szilard in the 1930&#039;s wrote plans for a &#039;secret society&#039; which he called &#039;The Society of the Covenant&#039;, he wanted this secret society to take over major world governments and to use propaganda to establish global &#039;peace&#039; and world government - one subplan was to use HG Wells style &#039;atomic bombs&#039;, which didn&#039;t exist except in fiction at the time. HG Wells himself had advocated repeatedly for an &quot;open conspiracy&quot; to establish a &quot;New World Order&quot; (his words) or &#039;World Government&#039;.

All countries claiming to have nuclear weapons are simply bluffing. The US, UK, and Russian nuclear programs all involved significant sharing of information and in many cases the core scientists involved in all projects worked on other countries projects. In other words, the narrative of countries &#039;competing&#039; to independently develop this technology is mostly fiction - they were sharing scientists.

People still read the seventh book and watched the movies but they stopped being super fans in 2007.
