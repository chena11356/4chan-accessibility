I watched the first sequel once and wasn&#039;t impressed, not too interested in the rest. Other random observations (repeating some from a recent thread):<br><br>-In the first scene, a truck (driver) causes the stocky, black curly-haired Franklin to fall down. He gets banged up a bit and covered with dust/straw. The exact same thing happens to Leatherface at the end. There&#039;s probably something here about Saturn/Cronus being the god of harvest...<br><br>-In the normal world, Franklin is the &quot;odd one out&quot;. In the killer&#039;s world, it&#039;s Sally who&#039;s the odd one out.<br><br>-Franklin operates as a &quot;medium&quot; between the two worlds. Even though he generally can&#039;t go where the able-bodied normies can (inside the gas station, second floor of old Franklin place, actually in other house) he understands both worlds, and also suggests the killers (wields a knife like hitch, stocky and curly hair like Leatherface, in chair like grandpa).<br><br>-In contrast, Kirk is the most &quot;normal&quot; of the group. He&#039;s the one who overtly taunts and insults Franklin, he&#039;s the one dumb enough to think picking up hitch is a good idea. It&#039;s only fitting he dies first.<br><br>-Kirk invites hitch into his &quot;house&quot; (the van), slamming the van&#039;s metal door shut. Kirk then invites himself into the other house, and has a metal door slammed shut on him.<br><br>BOTH GROUPS TREAT THE OTHERS&#039; HOUSE LIKE THEIR OWN PROPERTY. A conflict. The Franklin place has been &quot;marked&quot; as the killers&#039; territory with bones. The normies feel free to come on the killers&#039; property, just walk into their house and demand help.<br><br>-When Franklin and Sally leave the van for the last time, they leave the DOOR OPEN and the LIGHTS ON. It&#039;s as if they subconsciously realize there&#039;s no point in ever trying to come back, or in trying to secure their property.<br><br>-The disc of the sun/FULL moon brackets the film at six points. They&#039;re long cuts, some 10-20 seconds at a time.

As you know, the \u201cFORCE OF OTHERS\u201d has two halves: Ashla, the good, and Bogan, the paraforce or evil part. Fortunately, Skywalker came to know the good half and was able to resist the paraforce; but he realized that if he taught others the way of the Ashla, some, with less strength, might come to know Bogan, the dark side, and bring unthinkable suffering to the Universe. For this reason, the Skywalker entrusted the secret of THE FORCE only to his twelve children, and they in turn passed on the knowledge only to their children, who became known as the Jedi Bendu of the Ashla: \u201cthe servants of the force.\u201d For thousands of years, they brought peace and justice to the galaxy. At one time there were several hundred Jedi families, but now there are only two or three.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BIGGS: Why didn\u2019t the \u201cFORCE OF OTHERS\u201d help the Jedi to put things right?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;LUKE: Because a terrible thing happened. During one of his lessons a young PADAWAN-JEDI, a boy named Darklighter, came to know the evil half of the force, and fell victim to the spell of the dreaded Bogan. He ran away from his instructor and taught the evil ways of the Bogan Force to a clan of Sith pirates, who then spread untold misery throughout the systems. They became the personal bodyguards of the Emperor. The Jedi were hunted down by these deadly Sith knights. With every Jedi death, contact with the Ashla grows weaker, and the force of the Bogan grows more powerful.</span>", "filename": "Lucas", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1333, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668630873501458, "time": 1668630873, "md5": "5YCn40EWTeLANY7cHcLGUA==", "fsize": 1707834, "resto": 176872963}, {"no": 176881979, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:36:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p176881818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;176881818</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The parts where that&#039;s clear from your gay writings</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;George&#039;s own fault</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implies by it&#039;s name</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you don&#039;t think</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But Lucas himself flipped the script</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So instead</span><br>Okay ESL.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unironically</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pretends to understand Lucas&#039; intents but also ignores everything Lucas did with the prequels and afterwards</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even though &quot;the balance of the Force&quot; from the start is a concept that essentially began in the prequels</span>", "filename": "1663931021265955", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 447, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1668630984232884, "time": 1668630984, "md5": "rNdXTBBOePPs1gcv1LUcxg==", "fsize": 32234, "resto": 176872963}], "last_modified": 1668630984}, {"no": 176851655, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)18:56:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it the best operator movie?", "filename": "p11539968_p_v8_ae", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668556619144350, "time": 1668556619, "md5": "rYJpjPABN5uM/FDFLM7IXA==", "fsize": 489021, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-it-the-best-operator-movie", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 142, "images": 48, "omitted_posts": 137, "omitted_images": 47, "last_replies": [{"no": 176881414, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:18:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p176880818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;176880818</a><br>name of movie?", "time": 1668629885, "resto": 176851655}, {"no": 176881561, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:22:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p176881414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;176881414</a><br>Clear And Present Danger.", "time": 1668630179, "resto": 176851655}, {"no": 176881621, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:24:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ronin<br>Black Hawk Down<br>Strike Back (first five seasons)<br>Sicario <br>Ultimate Force <br>Mosul <br>Zero Zero Zero <br>Tears Of The Sun<br>The Punisher (2004)", "time": 1668630287, "resto": 176851655}, {"no": 176881651, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p176856351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;176856351</a><br>Fed him the full 10,000 rounds", "time": 1668630327, "resto": 176851655}, {"no": 176881972, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:36:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Who Dares Wins (1982)<br>Nothing like Cold War era SAS<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;from the latin phrase &#039;Qui audet adipiscitur&#039;</span><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3w<wbr>oLvvYQxg", "filename": "who-dares-wins-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 675, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668630971393888, "time": 1668630971, "md5": "lH0YYdkAc5tU6bpVkpGjrA==", "fsize": 140935, "resto": 176851655}], "last_modified": 1668630971}, {"no": 176878924, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What did /tv/ think of Cy Tolliver?", "filename": "cy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2545, "h": 1330, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 130, "tim": 1668624398256117, "time": 1668624398, "md5": "0bH3TEvfx1F/hUMcG27yFw==", "fsize": 233069, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-did-tv-think-of-cy-tolliver", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 17, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 12, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 176881242, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "DON&#039;T FUCK WITH THE FUCKING DEITY LEON", "time": 1668629512, "resto": 176878924}, {"no": 176881360, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:16:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p176878924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;176878924</a><br>In the end I was not sure what his character was about and where his arc was supposed to go.
