When Leah suffers a mysterious seizure, Maja fears their whirlwind romance might be cut short and decides to follow Leah back to her home in London. There, Maja meets her new downstairs neighbour: Leah\u2019s mother, Chana. An overbearing, seemingly religious and highly secretive woman, Chana seems resistant to all of Maja\u2019s attempts to win her over. And as Maja notices strange occurrences in the building, she begins to suspect that Chana\u2019s secrets could be much darker than first anticipated. </span><br><br>Starring that ugly girl from Game of Thrones? <br><br>Only on private trackers!", "filename": "ellie-kendrick-photo_137135_28664", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1067, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675928462504814, "time": 1675928462, "md5": "yyzx/jF3hngu2JpjVbRTFQ==", "fsize": 688954, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "a-white-woman-falls-in-love-with-a-jewish-and", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 69, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 33}, {"no": 180357736, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)02:45:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180357651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180357651</a><br>Ellie Kendrick is not jewish so you lost that round.<br><br>Also she&#039;s gay irl.", "time": 1675928723, "resto": 180357651}, {"no": 180357778, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)02:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any tits?", "time": 1675928830, "resto": 180357651}, {"no": 180357795, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)02:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180357736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180357736</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ellie Kendrick is not jewish</span><br>-ick last names are usually jewish and she has heavy jewish features.

It has been a hotbed of various forms of digital mischief, from hacking to trolling, and is often referred to as the birthplace of internet culture. While many of the individuals who frequent the site can be clever and creative, they are also often seen as a destructive force in online communities<br><br>One of the latest examples of this is the obsession with the release of Avatar 3. Despite being several years away from hitting theaters, trolls on 4chan have already started counting down the days until its release. This countdown has become something of a running joke on the site, with members frequently posting about the film&#039;s progress and speculating about what it will entail.<br><br>While this may seem like harmless fun, it is actually a sad commentary on the state of internet culture. These trolls are eagerly anticipating the release of a film that has been criticized for its racist and transphobic themes. The Avatar series has been accused of perpetuating harmful stereotypes and using indigenous cultures as mere backdrop for a white savior narrative.<br><br>What&#039;s more, this behavior perpetuates the idea that the internet is a place where negative behavior is accepted and even encouraged. It is a reminder that the anonymity of the internet can bring out the worst in people, and that the behavior of individuals on 4chan is not representative of the online community as a whole.<br><br>In conclusion, the fact that 4chan trolls are counting down the days until Avatar 3 is released is a sad reflection of the state of internet culture. It is a reminder that while the internet can be a place of creativity and positivity, it can also be a breeding ground for negativity and harmful behavior. We should all strive to create a better online community by promoting positivity and discouraging negative behavior.

There are plenty of pieces that were intended as art, but not perceived as such. And there is plenty of contention about what constitutes art even among observers of identical pieces, including in Ebert&#039;s own field. Starship Troopers famously flew over his big, dumb head, for instance. The argument also fails to account for the fact that the interactive experience is taken into account by the artist, and that many modern art pieces that are universally recognized as art have interactive components.

But more so in the sense that one character is the constant butt of the joke, and it just really isn&#039;t funny. The setting itself is decent, as long as no-one is talking. You can tell it&#039;s somewhat a labor of love, it&#039;s just that the love is abusive. But compare that to Discovery, which goes out of its way to be as un-Trek as possible, unleashed a media campaign to tell OG Trek fans they were smelly nerds and astro-turfed Reddit with shitty bots, and is constantly mugging at the camera about how smart it is and how good its characters are. Lower Decks feels like a cynical Trek fan trying and failing to be funny while adding too much head canon. Discovery feels like someone actively making a product to be as offensive to Trek fans as possible. I haven&#039;t watched Picard, but all the clips I&#039;ve seen from it are identical to Discovery in this respect. Cheap, generic sci-fi sets throw together without care, plot that insists on being overarching to the entire setting so you can&#039;t ignore it in the canon, petty characters who are constantly, constantly bickering with each other, retroactively changing the history of major characters.<br><br>Imagine you&#039;re a kid, and you tell your parents you want a dog.

I was quick to point out to my daughter that the person in the underwear wasn\u2019t really me, though that clarification seemed inconsequential. We kept watching, and, despite my best intentions to give context to the uncomfortable bits, I didn\u2019t elaborate on what might have gone on under the table. She expressed no curiosity in anything sexual, so I decided to follow her lead, and discuss what seemed to resonate with her more. Maybe I just chickened out. But I kept thinking about that scene. I thought about it again this past fall, after a number of women came forward with sexual-assault accusations against the producer Harvey Weinstein, and the #MeToo movement gathered steam. If attitudes toward female subjugation are systemic, and I believe that they are, it stands to reason that the art we consume and sanction plays some part in reinforcing those same attitudes.</span><br><br>there was a scene where teacher sees hot bitch in school&#039;s pool, but ringwald bitched<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the shooting script of \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d there was a scene in which an attractive female gym teacher swam naked in the school\u2019s swimming pool as Mr. Vernon, the teacher who is in charge of the students\u2019 detention, spied on her. The scene wasn\u2019t in the first draft I read, and I lobbied John to cut it.

Jimmy and myself are 30 and 28 respectively and we met in Elementary School. A little later in life, we would hang out after school, mostly either play videogames at one of our house&#039;s or talk about them. When the time came, he went to one high school but I went to another. Due to this we slowly drifted away which is quite natural, but he was really fucking fighting it and I didn&#039;t mind at the time. Both met loads of new people but at the end of the day, I&#039;d be his shoulder to cry on and I even felt &quot;proud&quot;, in a very vain and self centered way. However, I soon came to the realization that Jimmy and myself had shared no interests other than videogames. And every topic of conversation was a videogame. As he started a job and I was getting ready for college, it dawned on me how incredibly dull most of the conversations we had were and are. I went to college to a different state altogether but this didn&#039;t stop Jimmy from texting me all the time about some random bullshit. I&#039;d take days to respond to let him implicitly know that I don&#039;t want to talk about it. Then later on I would even tell him that I don&#039;t want to do that. Yet Jimmy persisted. <br>Last time the two of us went for drinks or anywhere really was more than 5 years ago. Yet still he texts me random jokes and videogame puns that the two of us loved 15 years ago. I sometimes take a month to answer. Somewhat recently my birthday came and he texted me &quot;happy birthday my guy, hope you have an excellent one, hope you get to fuck bitches left and right haha&quot; (I have a long term girlfriend) and follows that up with &quot;really wish you were back in our hometown, it&#039;d be really cool to hang out like we did in the old days haha :)&quot;.", "time": 1675937707, "resto": 180359568}, {"no": 180360675, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:16:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180360637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180360637</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jimmy and myself are 30 and 28 respectively and we met in Elementary School</span><br>damn, how many times did you guys have to redo the 6th grade?", "time": 1675937812, "resto": 180359568}, {"no": 180360764, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:20:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180360637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180360637</a><br>I only thanked for the birthday wishes and ignored everything else.
