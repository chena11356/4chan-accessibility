I think they had the right idea of splitting up the films, that way TWOW serves as an audience reintroduction to the world + lays foundation for the rest of the saga in one movie. 3 is supposedly a lot darker and features malevolent Na&#039;vi. The sully kids are only children/teens in this 2 film chapter.<br><br>4 and 5 on the other hand were written as their own self sustained chapters and will feature Lo&#039;ak, Kiri, Tuk, Tsireya and Spider + a 6 year time skip; this means Lo&#039;ak, Kiri and Tsireya will be fully grown Na&#039;vi and Tuk will be Kiri&#039;s age in TWOW. Will definitely be interested to see how these characters act with more experience on them (not to mention the actors themselves who are mostly newcomers.)

I think it&#039;s incredibly impactful precisely because loak gets his father to believe in himself, tells him &quot;you can do this dad&quot; (and then the scene cuts to kiri going &quot;trust me&quot;, which is just a perfect edit) and then he and Jake make it out with the help of his whale buddy. Jake acknowledging him after that hit way harder than I&#039;d the ending had just been Jake telling loak to believe in himself out of nowhere. Reminds me of how God of War Ragnarok flipped the tables by having Atreus be the one to take care of his dad instead of having kratos shoulder all the burdens on their journey by himself, so then when kratos tells atreus that the reason they won was because of the choices that atreus made, it feels like a much greater victory. <br><br>I think it&#039;s nice because you don&#039;t get the sense that the story was made by someone that sought a coddling narrative that would double as therapy for people with a chip on their shoulder any never having been appreciated by their parents.

Not sure if it began with Enchanto but that movie is the first that I remember couldn&#039;t be summed up in an interesting sentence like &quot;A princess must come to terms with having magical powers that alienate her from society and those she loves&quot; or &quot;A strong-willed teenage girl pretends to be a man to take her sick father&#039;s place in the army while facing a Hunnic invasion&quot;. The only thing I kept hearing about Enchanto was &quot;all Latino cast!&quot;, &quot;its so progressive!&quot;. Yeah but what about the fucking plot? Garbage. And the songs, Christ alive I&#039;ve never heard worse disney songs than those. Not a single memorable one among them, all awful. Animated movies usually get dubbed in my country and the people responsible have a long history of putting a tremendous amount of effort into getting the right voices and rewriting the songs to be memorable. A lot of people would tell you without hesitation that our voice for Aladdin&#039;s Genie was a million times better than Robin Williams&#039; portrayal, and that songs like &quot;Zero to Hero&quot; from Hercules is far, far better than the American counterpart in terms of voices and lyrics.<br><br>But with Enchanto, everyone just gave up. It didn&#039;t seem realistic to write good lyrics for the songs because so many of them were just rapid dialogue set to music that barely fit, and the music was incredibly poorly written to begin with. It was arguably as bad or worse in my language and that&#039;s the biggest indication if a grade-A flop there is, because those dubbing companies have salvaged mediocre films before. There was no saving Enchanto.<br><br>They also got a woman to voice the fat grubhub negro in Strange World, no idea why but I&#039;m guessing because they couldn&#039;t tell it was a man, or lack of voice actors willing to work on the film.", "time": 1672227557, "resto": 178436200}, {"no": 178437710, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)06:42:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "OH LAWD DEM WORLDZ", "time": 1672227743, "resto": 178436200}, {"no": 178437725, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)06:43:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178436423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178436423</a><br>COLONIZED", "time": 1672227791, "resto": 178436200}, {"no": 178437883, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)06:50:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p178436765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;178436765</a><br>I thought the movie looked rather nice.

Also while his voice had changed slightly in presentation over almost a decade he almost didnt get on tgwtg because people hated the way he spoke, how slow he spoke and the monotonous nature of his early vids. It didnt change his personality he kept it just increased his audio quality and (its very obvious mac and me was recorded by a man in a house with family, friends or loved ones nearby and he was embarrassed about being found it.

Marvelspeak and Whedonspeak are abused to absurd levels and it ruins tension in many scenes.<br>The story is supposed to be serious (it&#039;s about ragnarok, so of course), but characters act like everything is a joke and no one takes anything seriously. There are more noticeable comic relief moments peppered throughout the game that feels like a shallow attempt to appeal to broader, younger audiences.<br>The hero of the story, Kratos, has like no agency in the story. The big problem with the game is that there&#039;s too many &#039;protagonists&#039; and the writers cant seem to decide who is actually the main character or whose journey is most important. Kratos has no agency and just reacts to things happening around him that are out of his control. Atreus is roped into a separate journey far away from Kratos but he is a whiny teen dipshit and is not compelling at all as a protag. Freya is also given a lot of attention in the story and a lot of the story is focused on building up her confrontation with Odin, even though she isn&#039;t the main character. Too much shit happening with no clear focus.<br>The villain, Odin, is a subversive take on the evil mastermind, but the writers failed because instead of making him actually unique or subversive, he just comes across as some pathetic Woody Allen esque new york jew that you cannot take seriously as a threat, even at his absolute worst or menacing.

Your father and I used to doubleteam her at the end of every successful campaign during the Clone Wars and once in a while we&#039;d have the whole 501st run a train on her, part of official Jedi &quot;training&quot; of course. In time, she learned how to handle a meatsaber better than anyone in the Jedi Temple. She wore a miniskirt every day so we told her there were no panties in space, and since she was constantly doing acrobatics you&#039;d get a glimpse of her orange pussy mid flight as she&#039;d do a flip while slicing a B2 Super Battledroid in half.
