They dress and act like skydemons. They draw the entirety of their modern culture from skydemons. They copy the sassy body language of skydemons. They sing songs in worship of skydemons. Their biggest event of the year involves throwing parties in honor of a skydemon uniting the clans. They use skydemon slang like &quot;bruh&quot; and &quot;cuz&quot;.

They worship their ZOGbot avatar \u201csympathisers\u201d disproportionately filled with skydemons and their global police force of soldiers filled with skydemons. Their men run around using skydemon technology while their women lay around fucking skydemon avatars. They worship skydemons like jake sully and miles quaritch jr and norm and the late grace augustine while attacking the na\u2019vi who actually built their tribe before skydemons took over. Their song chords are filled with skydemons and their children are half skydemon. They send skydemons to the battlefield and celebrate when the skydemons win because those skydemons are true red blooded omatikaya skydemons. They watch skydemon porn to a point where &quot;RDA&quot; does not make them think of an international mining company but about rigid demon anaconda.

I think the deadliest western religious conflict was the thirty years war, which accounts for like 6% of total war casualties since 400AD. WW1 and 2 account for 50%. We have actually gotten a lot better at killing eachother for retarded reasons as time has gone on. <br><br>I\u2019m also not sure how existence in the spirit tree works. Grace seems to be really alive and is able to talk to kiri, unless it\u2019s not some mental projection eywa is using to communicate with her. And especially in pic related scene, neteyam doesn\u2019t seem fully aware or conscious of the fact he\u2019s dead. Which leads me to think it\u2019s either a snapshot of a memory from a specific point in time (he could still be conscious, but it\u2019s his child self from that moment existing perpetually and he\u2019s unaware of anything else) or maybe he\u2019s in some sort of blissed out dream state of forever being an ignorant child just sort of existing in memoryscapes. Or maybe it\u2019s eywa reconstructing all this for jake and neytiri? What does neteyam do when they aren\u2019t there? I like how vague it is honestly, an afterlife shouldn\u2019t be presented as too concrete or \u201creal\u201d because it loses its mystery and transcendental feeling. I\u2019m going to assume he does live on, but in a dreamlike and incomprehensible way to mortals. He\u2019s part of eywa now and probably doesn\u2019t have the same degree of individuated separate existence he did before, that was its happy but still also sad, they can\u2019t know and love their son in quite the way they did when he was living, even if he goes on.", "filename": "0D5010D2-8093-4D5D-9575-1B5B9D26BB3D", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 62, "tim": 1673927936969238, "time": 1673927936, "md5": "L24s5Yf1OY+y/4k0/qvUSA==", "fsize": 1577189, "resto": 179328738}, {"no": 179333331, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:00:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179333262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179333262</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m also not sure how existence in the spirit tree works.</span><br>its literally like a computer network where they upload and download memories and stuff", "filename": "5y45y45y45y", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 1355, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673928055322713, "time": 1673928055, "md5": "lopCXg31tivLLQLt+Icb8A==", "fsize": 277787, "resto": 179328738}, {"no": 179333362, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:01:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179333207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179333207</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From the first bite of a McDonald&#039;s Big Mac&quot; you&#039;ll be transported to a world like no other.

The idea of preserving a snapshot of a set of mental states is also strange. How does eywa recreate the specific brain chemistry and consciousness, if this all works materially?

However now its just 100% completely normal filmmaking. And not since before it had film been so revolutionized as with Citizen Kane. I assume. And supposedly one or two movies came out right before 400 Blows from the same scene.

Truffaut was actually inspired by that one, and Godard most likely saw it too. Of course Godard was the one to popularise it plus his aimless non-story, and most importantly the editing techniques were indeed revolutionary so I&#039;m not saying he didn&#039;t do shit or anything.
