If you\u2019re actually catholic you should be aware of the philosophy of mind coming from thomism, which would not argue that a bigger and more complex brain = more intelligent. And i\u2019m pretty sure that is standard theology for catholics, thomism does not deny physicalist and biological explanations for consciousness, it simply posits that reflexive self awareness is an immaterial faculty. Thomas aquinas was aware that people can get brain damage and that it augmented their personality, because fundamentally your brain is instrumental in processing and generating consciousness- he just says that the entire complexity of consciousness cannot be reduced to the brain, which is how he distinguishes a sensory or animal soul which is identical to the properties of its current sense data, where as a human brain can abstract and reflexively observe such things. I think you\u2019re being a little too black and white about the interplay between materiality and immateriality in a way that is unlike most catholic thinking, again, thomas himself started with physical accounts of things. I think these movies offer a scientific account but simultaneously present that the human outlook on reality is one track and flawed- they dismiss the spirituality of eywa because they are reductionist and consider the aliens \u201cprimitive\u201d and superstitious. In reality the na\u2019vi clearly understand something about eywa the humans mindset blinds them to.

All he knows is slavery, painted in the inoffensive cloak of compliance. The very notion of freedom is a horror to him.\u2019<br><br>\u2018Traitor,\u2019 Russ hissed.<br><br>Angron stood tall, still grinning. \u2018Do we give choices to those we slaughter? A true choice? Or do we broadcast that they must throw their weapons into the fires of peace and bow down, faces pushed into the mud like beggars, thanking us for the culture we force upon them? We offer them compliance or we offer them death. How am I a traitor, wolfling? I fight as you fight, as loyal as you are. I do the tyrant\u2019s bidding.\u2019<br><br>\u2018We offer them freedom.\u2019 Russ spoke through clenched teeth, the moon bright in his eyes. \u2018You are mutilating your own sons and stealing their minds \u2013 now you preach of the Emperor\u2019s tyranny? Are you lost so far in your delusions?\u2019<br><br>Angron\u2019s smile faltered, fading away. His face seemed slack, his eyes staring past Russ. Defeat was etched upon features still twitching in pain. \u2018You are free, Leman Russ of Fenris, because your freedom matches the Emperor\u2019s will. For each time I wage war against worlds that threaten the Imperium\u2019s advance, there comes another time when I am told to conquer peaceful worlds that wish only to be left alone. I am told to destroy whole civilisations and call it liberation. I am told to demand millions of men and women from these new worlds, to make them take up arms in the Emperor\u2019s hordes, and I am told to call this a tithe, or recruitment, because we are too scared of the truth. We refuse to call it slavery.\u2019", "filename": "angron", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3840, "h": 2721, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1674562304148586, "time": 1674562304, "md5": "504EmqVY7fjjrbKlvTKdjw==", "fsize": 2343767, "resto": 179651179}, {"no": 179660919, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:12:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018Angron\u2026\u2019 Russ snarled.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018Be silent!

His only renowned work on Breaking Bad was not written by him, and it was supervised by Vince Gilligan. Tony Gilroy is a pretentious british faggot - which is nuff said in and of itself, but he made the antithesis of what George conceived Star Wars as. He made a bleak, soulless, completely devoid of fun and adventure, tedious slog.

The easiest way is to find groups for hobbies that you have. That way you mostly talk about the hobby and can avoid talking about yourself. I learned to be a good listener and ask questions so people will talk about themselves instead of me. From there it is about developing enough trust to feel comfortable with being more vulnerable, which often comes with reciprocating states of vulnerability, most people have shit they are going through, and being able to share that stuff with each other in a sincere and safe way and creating that connection is a big part of feeling human imo.

It&#039;s an emotional relief or just plain fun to see a &quot;bad guy&quot; get their comeuppance. The reward for their arrogance and behavior is misery. Real life rarely has bad things happening to bad people so it&#039;s enjoyable to see it happen in fiction. The way the fat boomer guy died in JW was weak and unsatisfying. Sure it was fun to see him try and pull an Owen before getting his arm bitten off but it was still not as enjoyable as it could have been.<br><br>People dying undeserved deaths can be absolutely hilarious if played right. Holocaust movies do it really well. That woman in Schindlers List trying to manage a work site being executed for trying to do her job is great. The hilarity comes from the fast change in tone. The scene goes from workplace dispute to public execution in a few seconds. The surprise and unexpected death is what makes surprise deaths funny. If the Nanny in JW had a more involved role, played the part of an actual character and was suddenly killed unceremoniously in a moment of perceived safety it would have been funny. She was a side-side-side character who everyone knew was dead the moment she was picked up in a dangerous situation.

Imagine the utter shock at discovering that your fifth rape victim of the day isn&#039;t appalled, but actively into it, and then reliving that pleasure as many times over as you like, and if you get bored you can always go looking for another woman who is massively into violent sex with strangers.<br><br>All it takes is some dedication and imagination, /tv/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A mind not to be chang&#039;d by Place or Time.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The mind is its own place, and in it self</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can make a Heav&#039;n of Hell, a Hell of Heav&#039;n.</span>", "filename": "1828280433", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1401, "h": 1745, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674562555900914, "time": 1674562555, "md5": "R7HttGarw5n/I8l3mA2RvQ==", "fsize": 547578, "resto": 179657709}, {"no": 179661041, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:17:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179657709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179657709</a><br>Yes, 33+ years of the same day would be fucked.", "time": 1674562670, "resto": 179657709}, {"no": 179661119, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:20:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179658875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179658875</a><br>is it really a bad town? i adored such american small towns as a kid", "time": 1674562845, "resto": 179657709}, {"no": 179661254, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:25:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179657709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179657709</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CTRL + F: &quot;Rape&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5 results found</span><br>That is all i came for and you didn&#039;t disappoint /tv/", "time": 1674563155, "resto": 179657709}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 179661246, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:25:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Was he?", "filename": "maxresdefault", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674563137601167, "time": 1674563137, "md5": "42ER0NdpLiMrgwCYHDmCcQ==", "fsize": 91074, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "was-he", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 179657233, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:06:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Always laughed when they portrayed this fat little manlet as some sort of badass bruiser", "filename": "hank", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 362, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 181, "tim": 1674551182707780, "time": 1674551182, "md5": "WOrOMTXeCD6GfvFZVrhDmQ==", "fsize": 3890063, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "always-laughed-when-they-portrayed-this-fat", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 24, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 179657251, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:07:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "post body", "time": 1674551242, "resto": 179657233}, {"no": 179657288, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:08:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179657251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179657251</a>", "filename": "1521531049654", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674551339599607, "time": 1674551339, "md5": "ie1u6TiRGsmR9d4mMYIj0g==", "fsize": 161821, "resto": 179657233}, {"no": 179657343, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:11:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179657251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179657251</a>", "filename": "IMG_20230122_194328_369", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674551488497529, "time": 1674551488, "md5": "HtMHdgt0/7Ci2Q/UlWiXAw==", "fsize": 78989, "resto": 179657233}, {"no": 179657369, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:12:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179657233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179657233</a><br>Poor man\u2019s Vic Mackey", "time": 1674551553, "resto": 179657233}, {"no": 179657390, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:13:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p179657233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;179657233</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5&#039;7</span><br>Damn.

Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it.

Genes set our maximum height but whether or not we reach that depends on our diets in childhood and adolescence. <br>Lots of things can interfere with this; certain diseases, medications, and smoking have all been proven to prematurely end or slow growth.<br>There&#039;s also sex differences. Women grow faster than men but men grow for far longer. Most girls have finished growing by 14 but it&#039;s not uncommon for men to keep growing until their mid-20s, but with most growth happening by 16. After that it&#039;s only a few mm a year until max height is reached.<br>The trigger for growth is also complicated. Girls with a high muscle and fat to weight ratio triggers puberty so sporty girls usually are the first to enter adolescence, whereas boys aren&#039;t completely understood (although environmental stress can prompt early puberty). <br>It&#039;s assumed that male puberty takes longer because girls are born with all their sex organs and the body just needs to switch them on, whereas boys need to develop our testicles, prostate, adrenal glands, etc further.<br>Testosterone is our growth hormone and its precursor is cholesterol. We need 10\u03bcm cholesterol /kg of bodyweight to grow (as adults), which isn&#039;t a lot (there&#039;s 200\u03bcg in a single egg so a few eggs a day will provide a growing boy with what he needs).
