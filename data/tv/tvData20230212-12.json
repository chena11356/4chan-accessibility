But then anyone could hide from the map by taking a new alias. Not that anyone knows about the map or would care to do this, but at least Pettigrew might have, as he knew about the map and was paranoid and frightened enough to remain a rat for many years. But forgetting that, Pettigrew does have an alias: Wormtail. Nobody ever or very rarely calls Ron &#039;Ronald&#039;, yet that&#039;s what comes up on the map, Ronald Weasley. In fact the map always puts everyones full name. So that makes me think the map will always put the name you were given at birth... right? Wrong. Married women on the map who have officially had their surname changed by the man they married, Molly Weasley for example, are updated - but people who go by a nickname more than their real name are NOT recognised by the map. So what does that mean? It means there is a truth to the connection between a person names and their identity, at least according to the creators of map. So to answer your question, it&#039;s not whether the map would deadname trannies, but whether James and Sirius would (as they were the leaders), and I think we both know the answer is <s>yes</s>.", "time": 1676200968, "resto": 180476387}, {"no": 180483765, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)06:53:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180476681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180476681</a><br>Everybody with a brain knew WW2 was coming years before it happened.<br><br><a href=\"#p180478438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180478438</a><br>Fred and George had an entire cabinet of the things that they were selling in their shop, any tracking is pretty limited.

This is worsened by Western culture&#039;s late stage imperial moment, similar to those undergone by post-Zhou China, and the post-Graecian classical empire (Rome). In these systems, a circular logic of force justifying itself and the similar collapsing of is and ought takes place, with vae victus and the notion in China of the mandate of sky command (the &quot;mandate of heaven&quot;), wherein the emperor is emperor because heaven wants him to be emperor and this is shown because if heaven didn&#039;t want him to be emperor he wouldn&#039;t be the emperor.

Additionally, any Cardassian or Ferengi actors who are really old is asking a lot as applying and wearing all that makeup is a shit ton of work that they may not be up to. Its probably even true for Martok who is really old and seems like he had more makeup than most Klingons.<br><br>That functionally leaves us with Worf (I consider this borderline and we&#039;ll see how he does in PIC), Bashir &amp; Ezri &amp; brother, Jake &amp; Kasidy, Miles &amp; Keiko &amp; Molly (take your pick), and Morn.

Like we know Cardassia got buttfucked and Bajor was actually doing alright and getting their feet underthem. So add some new characters to play like the &quot;next generation&quot; of bajorans and cardassians and have the old cast get involved in the bullshit. Like maybe Bajor is there trying to do humanitarian shit. And they move Terek Nor there to act as a base to run their operations from (they&#039;ve built a new cooler station near the wormhole for their religious stuff because they never liked it being Cardi originally). Miles gets called out to help them figure out something he jury-rigged decades ago that no one else can make heads or tales off and he ends up sticking arounf for &quot;reasons. Obviously Keiko and Molly could be party to that. Kira being there should be obvious. Bashier and Ezri seem almost as obvious a fit (medical and psychological help to the people of a collapsed society they already had ties to). This would allow plenty of cameos for old Cardassian characters, even holovids and memorial shit for dead ones. Jake being a reporter/writer fits both in the disaster relief side as well as the moving of a legendary station and we know Kasidy&#039;s cargo routes took her to planets all around there. Shakaar could be leader of the Bajoran government and like give a speech or issue orders to Kira or something as a cameo. Maybe a we could get a cameo about Quark selling his bar and Brunt being involved in that (allows references to Rom and Zek). Only people that don&#039;t immediately fit in that would be the Klingons and Section 31, but I think that&#039;s fine.", "time": 1676159370, "resto": 180460764}, {"no": 180464984, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)18:50:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180464597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180464597</a><br>Is that?", "filename": "Star Trek b (4)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 810, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676159446281726, "time": 1676159446, "md5": "vhS/8Js5dAMxf39Xp0Xh3w==", "fsize": 109886, "resto": 180460764}, {"no": 180465089, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)18:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180461028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180461028</a><br>Why is it that only northerners and midwesterners say y\u2019all but act like southerners do it?", "time": 1676159671, "resto": 180460764}, {"no": 180465152, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)18:56:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p180465089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;180465089</a><br>Are you saying southerners don&#039;t say y&#039;all?

The simplest unit of memory is an &quot;engram&quot; just two neurons firing together. You add a third neuron and the three can fire in a plethora of different sequences. You add several million and the whole group can fire in a complex manner which &quot;stores&quot; memories. Giving someone memories is giving them this effect. You actually give them your brain by training the neurons to fire in the specific sequence that stored the memory. Saying &quot;it wouldn&#039;t have the same brain as you&quot; is the thing that&#039;s false. Even if you didn&#039;t know this, think of the meaning of a memory (experience). Say I&#039;ve learned self control around fire. Why? Because I touched a flame as a child, burned my finger, and now have a memory of that event and of the unpleasantry of the pain and I refuse to touch fire again.

It&#039;s not just about remembering that someone was injured when I drove drunk, it&#039;s the despair I felt when I had hurt someone that caused be to never want to do it again.

The detective says and does contradictory things- he orders his coworkers to not eat expensive meals but brings expensive sushi for the suspect.

The growing disconnect between the detective and his wife is seen when the director takes away the focus from the detective having sex with his wife to a sex scene on the TV with only the girl in view, showing how the sexual relationship has only one interested party left. The focus then shifts to sex with a skeleton insisting on how the love between the couple has died. This follows up with the detective lying to his wife about the case.
