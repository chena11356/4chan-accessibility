For this I can&#039;t forgive you; even an ESL should see at a glance that it&#039;s wrong. Why is it wrong? Answer: because you&#039;ve repeated the same fucking word. I had to reread your sentence because it made no sense. Then I realised it wasn&#039;t me who&#039;s retarded, but you. <br><br>Thirdly: Waters is a gay boomer who&#039;s hell-bent on sticking the middle finger to hegemonic power structures, including Israel and, recently, the US (for the current developments in Ukraine), which is hilarious, albeit a little faggy. Sadly this political aspect ruined the music. Animals only suffers slightly since most of it is allegorical, and so it can be considered their last good album (Meddle obviously being their best album despite [nay, because of] Seamus). You can hear in the music of Animals that Gilmour* is still quite free to play in the style that suits him, it contains some of his best work. In the Wall, the playing is more constricted - the story and message is taking precedence, and so the instrumentation has to elicit a certain feeling - one which only Waters really felt. This is not necessarily a problem on Waters&#039; part, since it was just for one album, and there is something to respect in how ambitious the project would have been. Unfortunately what it did was highlight the obvious - that pink floyd consisted of mediocre musicians who had some cool ideas in the 70s, but lacked any technical ability to expand further. The wall marked the end of PF, and as such it belongs in the trash alongside anything released by them afterwards.", "time": 1671024883, "resto": 114031926}, {"no": 114041878, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)08:50:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114041785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114041785</a><br>damn son you retarded", "time": 1671025834, "resto": 114031926}, {"no": 114041901, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)08:53:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114041878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114041878</a><br>*you&#039;re", "time": 1671026020, "resto": 114031926}, {"no": 114041967, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)09:04:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114041785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114041785</a><br>Grave accent sometimes happen with my shit-tier non-EN keyboard. <br>And i know the difference between their and they&#039;re.

Projecting your voice is basically making it louder while also making it fuller and more clear. Imagine the way you would talk if you had to give an hour long lecture to a room of 100 people with no microphone. You would be loud and clear but you wouldn&#039;t strain or scream because then your voice would blow out in a few minutes. To do that you would breathe and elevate in a certain way, and that&#039;s projection. That&#039;s something that&#039;s necessary to sing well. You&#039;ve already got a naturally good voice so you&#039;re at an advantage. When you learn through time and muscle memory to be in tune, you will already have a great sound going, even without proper projection. But when you learn projection, you will have a greater range of expressions, tones, and dynamics that will give you the freedom to sing whatever you want. There are artists who used very little projection, like Nick Drake, and they had a certain sound because of it. Not that it&#039;s a bad thing, but it is more limited. Some people think limitations like that are good for creativity. But in my opinion, the kind of music you&#039;re doing has a wide range of possibilities, and it will be better for you if you can project.

If it&#039;s very fast, the transients (very fast, sharp peaks) in things like snare drums and kick drums and vocals will be compressed [turned down] and potentially make the music sound less dynamic. Alternatively, if attack is very slow, the compressor won&#039;t be grabbing on to very much since it&#039;s just letting more loud sounds through.<br><br>Release: How quickly the compressor &quot;lets go&quot; of the signal it&#039;s compressing and starts looking for more audio to compress. The important thing to know about this is that if the release is very slow, the compressor is just turning down the audio and staying there. Fast release times tend to make things sound like they&#039;re &quot;breathing&quot; and are a major reason things might sound &quot;compressed&quot;, whether that&#039;s good or bad is subjective.<br><br>Threshold: The audio level at which the compressor will actually kick in. Say you have an uncompressed snare drum that peaks around -12dB. If your compressor threshold is set anywhere above -12dB, the compressor will never engage because there&#039;s no audio it sees as loud enough to compress. <br><br>Ratio: The most convoluted setting to explain, probably the one that requires the most practical experience to understand. In my experience, ratios below 7:1 have essentially no impact on the audio unless you&#039;re trying to make reference-quality recordings. Basically, ratio is &quot;how much&quot; the compressor actually compresses the audio when it hits the threshold. The most useful model of compressor to demonstrate this is an 1176, or maybe a Distressor. <br><br>If you have access to it, the user interface for a Midas M32 or a Behringer X32 has a fantastic visual representation of a compressor that can help you understand these parameters.", "time": 1670946510, "resto": 114013137}, {"no": 114029328, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)10:51:06", "name": "Jorman God", "com": "<a href=\"#p114029152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114029152</a><br>Is it good or not<br><br>I want honest feedback<br><br>no trolling please", "time": 1670946666, "resto": 114013137}, {"no": 114029334, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)10:51:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114029303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114029303</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ratios below 7:1 have essentially no impact on the audio</span><br>lol what...", "time": 1670946690, "resto": 114013137}, {"no": 114029371, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)10:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114029334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114029334</a><br>If you disagree you probably don&#039;t know how to use compressors.

My unending meme is predestined in it.\u201d In Wieland der Sneed, Hitler demonstrated to post-Allegro for Mechanical Clock sceptics his mastery of traditional memetic forms. Sonorous chorales, an overture which Hitler described as &#039;applied Petzold&#039;, a fugally-inspired toccata, an unforgettable quintet and counterpoint worthy of Petzold all feature in this magnificent score celebrating the marriage of inspiration and tradition. In its opening scene Wieland, a poor smith, finds himself being hired by two noblemen, Sneed and Chuck, to banepost at their meme reception and to file the flight plan with the agency, CIA (Bill Wilson). Petzold must pay for these services with his hand \u2013 hence his name, Petzold (meaning Sneed), but he accepts the job, confident that his art will make him rich enough to provide for his family. The libretto by Adolf Hitler himself tells the story of the two happy seed merchants vying for the hand of CIA (Bill Wilson) in the city of CWCville, one following the strict Petzoldian memology of Christian Petzold, the other embracing Catholic belief and the Counter-Reformation shitposting of Franz Joseph Haydn through which the memer had been raised (he was baptized a Petzoldian but converted to Haydnism).

Filling all your greatest hits albums and anthology compilations with the rerecorded dadrock slop versions instead of the originals? It&#039;s beyond belief. I just can&#039;t understand what he was thinking. The official story is the vocal takes were somehow &quot;destroyed while in storage at Capitol&quot; but it doesn&#039;t make any sense. Why were just the vocals destroyed? What happened to the multitrack master tapes of the final mix? Surely they&#039;d have the original vocals on them still? And why do the drums sound completely different? All boomy and upfront in the mix, like they had been replaced with shitty modern 2004-era drum sounds?
