I have a sense that&#039;s the case, at least TODAY. When I put on country music radio today that only place current country music, I&#039;m like &quot;some of this is not just awful, but just down right horrible.&quot; I love old country music. But it&#039;s mostly things I know from city old head hippies, infomercials I saw in the early 2000&#039;s, and from Google searches. I get the sense that modern country music is a &quot;social event&quot; where you meet other people, especially women. Like, I like techno, but most people don&#039;t listen to Rave music, unless they are 13, high alone, or at a club. I still need the social experience of knowing what&#039;s &quot;good&quot; today, so I don&#039;t feel like an idiot, when I leave Philly, and drive to somewhere in Pennsyltucky to hang out with people that won&#039;t force a vaxx on me or fire me from my job like city folk do. If I go to a country music concert, without knowing what or who is playing, I&#039;m not going to last long in my new adopted culture. (I know Japanese, Chinese, and Spanish a bit, so this wouldn&#039;t be the first time I adopted something completely foreign to me.

The committee begged that they would not introduce two compositions of the &quot;horrible&quot; Liszt, as this would drive the public away. They stuck to their resolution, played both works, but announced &quot;Die Ideale&quot; as a &quot;Fantasia for two pianofortes, by Franz Schubert (after the &#039;Unfinished&#039; Symphony, the master&#039;s last work),&quot; which naturally did not exist. It was most warmly received by the public, and was generally spoken of by the press as a &quot;pearl of Schubertian melody.&quot; Only one of the critics discovered in it an element which was strange to and far-fetched for the lyrical Schubert.

This is an interesting evolution of your style, it merges the instrumentation and melodies of american Country music with the overblown, noisy Rock that you typically made in a very natural way. The ideas in every song don&#039;t feel repetitive or derivative of one another, the joyful Country piano and guitar riffs paired with the Noise Rock freakouts of The Charm of The Countryside works perfectly as an opener, Texas Candles reflects a more laidback sound with his tempo and slide guitar solos and A Small Man Named Wyoming follows the previous ideas named. A Sound Mirage is perhaps a song that doesn&#039;t fit a lot with the theme of the album. Recommended.<br><a href=\"#p115019075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;115019075</a><br>I love your new song. I like how the chromatisms give a sense of mistery on the piano melodies and how the bassline and the cymbal patterns just builds that feeling even more. If I had to nitpick something that would be the fact that the sections close to the end of the song sound like more variations of the idea presented before instead of something new that creates a higher contrast, but to be honest that would damage the easy going progression that the track has.

I have 5 songs out of 10 just about finished up for my next album, and the song I posted is one of them.<br>I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t listened to Kladas Vreaus before. I\u2019m hearing it now and it\u2019s very nice.<br>As for Kennorel, the style of this album is not so much for me. I do enjoy the track \u201cAmu Nenpto Us Fraskal\u201d quite a bit, I will say (and I enjoy hearing it on the latest shill compilation). As for the rest of Kennorel, although I like how futuristic it sounds, for me it\u2019s a little too all over the place. You have a good ear for melody, and even though I think it is an interesting album, I prefer more to hear your albums that showcase your ability to write those ear catching melodies. I look forward to hearing your work in the future, as well.

If you, like me, like stuff like tim and Eric awesome show, it\u2019s like a proto version of that. i really enjoyed it for all its off kilter moments, the weirdness, the cameos from Ringo and Keith moon, the mothers lore is funny, highly recommend for any Zappa fans. The music is also pretty great although some songs can be challenging like penis dimensions or this town is a sealed tuna sandwich. mystery roach owns. if you\u2019re into pot, psychedelics or even getting buzzed im sure that would enhance the experience. <br><br>it definitely creates the impression that touring and life on the road is crazy, but does so in a more abstract and less straightforward way than you\u2019d expect.

The early spirit of rock and metal seems to be heavily influenced by, abd popularized by visual spectacle, from Elvis twerking his ding dong to Jimi Hendrix burning his guitar to a Keith Moon blowing up his drums to Kiss&#039; makeup and stage show. Dangerous, rebellious, sacrificial, antisocial. This essence must be examined and experienced. Artistic inspiration of human beings in a culture and a world is more complicated than what A.I can derive from. It can not access the chaos of embodiment including senses, emotions, passions, and mortality. Trends in metal thought that &quot;we should be maximally tech/brutal/satanic/heavy&quot;, for example, are spiritually inferior to the flaming guitar. Computers can handle that simple logic a billion trillion times and eventually get it right. Musicians who want to be artists in the 20th century will have to prove they have souls.

Lee Sung Soo is also Lee Soo Man&#039;s nephew. <br><br>On February 16, Lee Sung Soo claimed that Lee Soo Man ruined aespa&#039;s comeback. Originally, the girl group was set to release a new album on February 20, ahead of their first solo concert in Seoul from February 25-26. However, during the album production process, Lee Soo Man ordered Yoo Young Jin and aespa&#039;s A&amp;R team to change the lyrics of the group&#039;s comeback song to include references to &quot;tree planting&quot; and &quot;sustainability&quot;. Despite the fact that these themes did not fit in with aespa&#039;s metaverse storyline, Yoo Young Jin and the A&amp;R team attempted to include lyrics such as &quot;just sustainability&quot; and &quot;decrease by just 1%&quot;. However, CEO Lee Sung Soo ultimately made the decision to cancel aespa&#039;s comeback, as the group&#039;s new song was &quot;ruined&quot;. The aespa members even shed tears after hearing that their new song would be scrapped.<br><br>Furthermore, Lee Sung Soo claimed that Lee Soo Man, who has been envisioning the construction of a &#039;SMart Music City&#039; featuring music festivals, open auditions, creative collaboration, a drone port, and more, was in fact only fueling his own greed and ambitions. Lee Sung Soo accused Lee Soo Man of attempting numerous overseas real estate dealings even when he was denied purchase of land in certain countries, and also alleged that Lee Soo Man planned on installing casinos at his &#039;Music Cities&#039;, despite the fact that these &#039;Music Cities&#039; would mostly attract tourists and consumers in the teens and twenties. Furthermore, Lee Sung Soo stated that Lee Soo Man was an advocate of &quot;legalizing marijuana&quot;, which would &quot;allow people to enjoy music and entertainment even more&quot;.", "time": 1676530133, "resto": 115043165}, {"no": 115043292, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:49:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p115043273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;115043273</a><br>looking at chae&#039;s chaes", "time": 1676530140, "resto": 115043165}, {"no": 115043293, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:49:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most beautiful girl in korea is vietnamese</span><br>huh", "time": 1676530145, "resto": 115043165}, {"no": 115043294, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:49:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p115043245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;115043245</a><br>Kpop music or content we&#039;ve been into lately.

However, during the album production process, Lee Soo Man ordered Yoo Young Jin and aespa&#039;s A&amp;R team to change the lyrics of the group&#039;s comeback song to include references to &quot;tree planting&quot; and &quot;sustainability*. Despite the fact that these themes did not fit in with aespa&#039;s metaverse storyline, Yoo Young Jin and the A&amp;R team attempted to include lyrics such as &quot;just sustainability&quot; and &quot;decrease by just 1%&quot;. However, CEO Lee Sung Soo ultimately made the decision to cancel aespa&#039;s comeback, as the group&#039;s new song was &quot;ruined&quot;.
