<br><br>recently i\u2019ve been trying to do marketing REALLY fucking objectively. for example, if you look at imbred\u2019s popularity score on musicstax, he has 1% which is the same as me, and i\u2019ve paid less than $50 total for ads in my lifetime, just experimenting. the results are always the same \u2014 low conversion, negative engagement, and when the reward for conversion ($0.00001 per listen or whatever) is so low, it\u2019s completely unsustainable anyway.<br><br>so this past couple of months, i\u2019ve been trying busking in sydney. the pay is REALLY GOOD ($66+/hr consistent), and the reach is wider than any ad will get you (thousands of people see you per day, and we get at least 2 followers a session), but in terms of targeting the specific community of your microgenre, it\u2019s pretty crap.<br>in fact, i have two busker friends with 2,500 and 70,000 listeners respectively, and they both have the SAME amount of sydney listeners (500), which goes to show that people who GENUINELY have an engaging experience with a busker as an ARTIST, is capped at 500 per city, even if you busk for years. the one with 70k listeners is taking home $10,000+ a year passively through streams, but i wonder why a person like that isn\u2019t on a label?<br><br>like, even if i reach her level of success, will i still have to be entirely independent and entrepeneurial, to the point where i still feel like music ISN\u2019T my job? i\u2019d love to be able to REALISTICALLY envision a future where i can stop busking and make a consistent long-term income with stable label support like my indie rock faves iceage and jeff rosenstock and liz phair and be a modern elliott smith type dude and bla bla blahhhhhh. but who decides that, when i have friends that are just as big as them that don\u2019t have that security?", "filename": "Sky-F-640x475", "ext": ".png", "w": 639, "h": 475, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1672283565686991, "time": 1672283565, "md5": "dH8XqgCTx6De/1h9VqWrKw==", "fsize": 584558, "resto": 114249862}, {"no": 114254447, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)22:14:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114254424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114254424</a><br>Go back", "time": 1672283666, "resto": 114249862}, {"no": 114254466, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)22:16:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114254424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114254424</a><br>[2/2]<br>i know i\u2019m being an entitled sack of shit, too. you can easily make more than a college graduate as a busker. i just wish it felt like a real job that no one laughed at. or that i didn\u2019t feel so ashamed of still making music in my mid 20s. whatever. it\u2019ll all work out.<br><br>besides street performing (especially outside of concerts), i can\u2019t think of anything else that would reach the international indie rock audience to a significant degree, so please anons, share your tips. also here is the single we\u2019re gonna put out in february: https://vocaroo.com/1iyS0EEnrRfu <br><br>and here\u2019s our current biggest song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYt<wbr>UQw84gXc <br>I DUNNO.

Dead is better has a great use of atmosphere with that acoustic guitar riff and the sinister vocals, it&#039;s even catchy, but in my opinion goes for too long without adding a lot of notorious changes, it kind of becomes a little tedious to listen to, this doesn&#039;t happen to tracks like The Comet or Contact, which they don&#039;t drag for too long. The Folk songs are nice touch and give variety while listening to the album.

The through-composed product of two weeks of solitary brainstorming at the Long Island home Coltrane had established with his new wife Alice, it&#039;s meditative rather than freewheeling, with each member of his classic quartet instructed to embark on his own harmonically mapped excursion and the title set to a chanted four-note melody you could hum in your sleep. I&#039;m on my fourth consecutive play with no signs of tune fatigue as I write, plus my wife loves it. All true, all remarkable. But how much you value it, I expect, depends on how much faith you place in your own spirituality.

The rhythms of early Jazz can already be heard in Anglo-Saxon operettas of the 19th Century. It is true to say that there have been some magnificent and even revolutionary black performers of Jazz, though more rarely in Rock&#039;n&#039;Roll with the possible exception of Chuck Berry. What is undeniable is that whites have promoted all phases of its evolution.<br><br>Rock&#039;n&#039;Roll is rhythmically-augmented Scotch Irish folk. Rock was blacks doing an impression of hillbilly music rather than hillbillies doing an impression of &quot;black music&quot;. Even the supposed &quot;blues notes&quot; and tonalities come straight out of Scotch Irish music.(there is no blue note in West African music, meanwhile it has been a norm in the folk music of Great Britain for centuries)<br><br>Musicologists tend to ascribe some unique quality to African rhythm when it isn&#039;t there. The difference between African and Western music isn&#039;t in the rhythm, but in the focus on percussion. African music is tribal and meant to be accompanied by dance. Primitive music in all areas of the world started as highly percussive because that&#039;s what comes readily to us as human beings. Western music had centuries of development and went astray from those percussive roots long ago.<br><br>While Western music was exploring dissonance after entering the modern period, blacks in America started using Western theory and instruments to return to basic human impulse: the rhythm. Turning the focus towards percussion exploded in black music&#039;s popularity because Western art music became inaccessibly experimental and dissonant to general audiences. Jazz and Blues&#039;s percussive focus caught on hard because rhythm comes to us instinctively. The &quot;We Waz Rawkers and shieet&quot; myth is as solid as a bowel after eating too much Taco Bell.", "time": 1672291570, "resto": 114254292}, {"no": 114255917, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:29:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p114255883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;114255883</a><br>this is a Moroccan ballad from the 16th century, albeit played in the typical gnawa style of the black community of North Africa, which only began to proliferate in the late 16th century.
