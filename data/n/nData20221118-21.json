So it&#039;s moderately desirable. <br><br>Beyond that, fit, and you probably want something that has rack mounts in the rear and fits 28mm tires if you want to commute on it. Which is many road bikes. <br><br>Condition is probably the most important thing. Drivetrain condition is major. You can visually see when chainrings are quite bad, meaning the entire drivetrain needs replacement soon/now. They wear differently so you can compare to one another. And look out for shark toothing. You might also get a chain wear tool (cheap) and if it&#039;s worn to 1.0, that means the cassette is shot too. <br>Wheel condition is the other major issue. On rim brake bikes you&#039;re looking out for rims that are concave or significantly visibly worn down. Also loose spokes and badly out of true is a red flag. Bearing condition also, which is quite hard to gauge just by spinning a wheel. Really you want to remove one (the front is easy) and turn the axle in your hand. <br><br>Tires. Tread and look for small cracks on the sidewalls (it&#039;s dead). It&#039;s ok to buy a bike with bad tires or bad bartape as nice fresh ones will be a major improvement for you, but just don&#039;t pay for &#039;good condition&#039; if it doesn&#039;t have good condition tires. <br><br>As for derailer and brake caliper condition, try wiggle them. If they have much slop in them they&#039;re worn out. Shifters rarely wear out, and can usually be resucitated with some spraying with piss, and poor shifting/braking is usually a re-cable issue (again, it&#039;s good to have fresh anyway, so not a red flag). On shifters brake hood condition is probably the big thing. If they&#039;re gross to touch it usually means the bike has done high hard miles and well, they&#039;re gross to touch. You can replace them though. <br><br>The piece of spec to look for on modern-ish road bikes is a compact crank (50/34 chainrings), or semi-compact (52/36)", "filename": "shimano shifters", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1828, "h": 2262, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668812201265538, "time": 1668812201, "md5": "unRhn1jrPTs1rCNU7qEbYg==", "fsize": 632049, "resto": 1867049}, {"no": 1869569, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)18:08:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1869544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1869544</a><br>but yeah.

They had some racing heritage, even so this isn&#039;t the reason they went under. They had success before and during the bike boom but this made them too comfortable. During the bike boom, the U.S. enjoyed a better selection of racier, lighter bikes from recent import from Europe and Japan, and American customers sort of realized that American bike manufacturers, even if they made bikes that looked like road bikes (Varsity, Continental, Super Sport etc), were about 5-10 years behind in terms of technology especially regarding frame tubing. Boomers will cope and say that they are heavy because they are bomb-proof, but the maybe small drop in durability of the foreign bikes was worth the weight savings. These American &quot;racy&quot; looking bikes were just absolute boat anchors, and even shitty Peugeot gaspipe shitters were lighter. American tastes had changed a little by the end of the bike boom. <br>Eventually Schwinn realized the changing market but was a little late to react to the change. They pretty much never recovered from this. Eventually they tried to get people back with cheaper and sportier frames made in Taiwan and Japan, but the damage had already been done. Their reputation as low-tech, heavy bikes went with them into the 80s. This foreign manufacture also sort of ruined their image as The American Bicycle Manufacturer. What was the point of the company if half their frames were foreign?This meant that from the 80s on was all an effort to slow down how hard they were falling. It&#039;s a shame because they really made some nice stuff in the late 80s/early 90s, especially the Japanese stuff. <br>TLDR Schwinn got too comfortable from their success from having a monopoly on American sales for decades, and didn&#039;t advance their tech fast enough.

Many of these things were the result of a relatively conservative population, for example voting against the subway project in the 1970s. The high level of attention public transport gets in Switzerland is in no way limited to leftist governments, as cities or regions that are more conservative still tend the same policies. <br><br>Most cases of bad urbanism stem from undoing the good work of pre-WW2 era, rather than from progressive/leftist policies, which, though generally less car-oriented which is good, suffer from a lack of pragmatism. For example, Barcelona is working to reduce car-centric urban design, but all the while barely expanding public transit, which is extremely saturated within the city and very inconvenient on certain itineraries. Of course you&#039;re not going to get people out of their cars if the alternative to a 20 minute drive is an hour riding two buses. The result is that traffic has actually gotten worse in the past couple of years, and more and more people are using scooters which are then parked on the widened sidewalks, making the whole work of expanding those sidewalks pointless. Meanwhile a bunch of bike paths which only appeal to the yuppies who can still afford to actually live in the city center aren&#039;t resolving anything, either, just taking away space direly needed for wider bus lanes, because the existing ones are so narrow the buses still get stuck in traffic as they can&#039;t overtake the cars.

Instead, they didn&#039;t manage to conceive a good enough project for the Rosengarten tram, and only thought of proposing a car tunnel which was way expensive and citizens ended up voting against it, so the whole tram master plan for the next 50 years has been made impossible as this essential trunk line won&#039;t be built, and the borough in question will still have a huge throughfare right through the middle.
