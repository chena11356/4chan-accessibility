The second one was my masseuse in Salt Lake City. As we were talking it changed from small talk to her getting really flirty. After I was dressed and leaving she got really touchy, told me she liked me, and asked if she could come to my room for the night.

They&#039;re not great for walking around, but it was no great task to untie my shoe &amp; pull the insert.

The machine &#039;paid for itself&#039; after the first bag I figure. I had one pair of panniers (my Ortlieb grocery getters), but ended up making two new pairs to get what I wanted. In the same way that the framebag fits the frame, the panniers are the largest that fit my racks, no heel strike, stiff, external &#039;drying&#039; features, etc.<br><br>I also made a fanny pack (my &#039;purse&#039;), and a hammock setup.

By selling this as the formation of miles upon miles of well manicured lawn space in the middle of the city, which you can enjoy en route to a place where you work for a living, metropolitan areas can easily justify the expense of adding a comprehensive mass transit system to the masses.", "filename": "consider the following", "ext": ".png", "w": 285, "h": 158, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1649569997873, "time": 1649569997, "md5": "V/MIiYmUN8NweCTdF4pOxA==", "fsize": 130871, "resto": 1784670}, {"no": 1784891, "now": "04/10/22(Sun)03:02:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;summer comes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;grass dries up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trams stopped because of fire hazard</span>", "time": 1649574145, "resto": 1784670}, {"no": 1784919, "now": "04/10/22(Sun)04:40:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1784871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1784871</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is their love of a nice lawn</span><br>Uhhh..... no thanks.

In its final implementation under Obama that rule was severely watered down thanks to the class I lobby and their pocket GOP congresscritters, so that it only covered petroleum trains and not trains carrying other extremely nasty shit like vinyl chloride. Then Trump goes and rolls back even that regulation in 2018, so now class Is have 0 incentive to implement electronic braking systems at all.

The air inside the brake pipe moves very fast out to the atmosphere in emergency, even on very long trains. That pressure drop signal is not the same thing as the time it takes for pressurized air to move out of each car&#039;s emergency reservoir and into the brake cylinder and begin actuating the brake shoes, which takes a few seconds at best and isn&#039;t affected by the ECP system. Essentially, plugging the train with ECP is barely different than without. In-train forces will be slightly higher on the non-ECP train. The ECP train will probably stop slightly faster than the non-ECP one.<br><br>The advantage to ECP isn&#039;t better train handling in emergency brake applications, it is the ability to smoothy and quickly set air across all cars at once for service reductions, which DOES take longer with normal brakes, as the air inside the brake pipe is still regulated by the automatic brake valve&#039;s rate of exhaust and moves much more slowly from front to rear.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s a shitty excuse not to implement a better and more reliable braking system,</span><br>The reason they&#039;re not doing that is cost.

If a DMV licenses someone to operate a motor vehicle, certifying to the public that said driver is capable and responsible, and they then damage a third party, and the driver fails to pay full restitution, how the fuck can the DMV not be liable to pay the balance of the damages?

Besides, it\u2019s tradition and good coffee is great, especially in these crisp months that get colder and colder. Personally I would say don\u2019t skip breakfast or do any intermittent fasting type stuff. If you\u2019re trying to shed some weight to get quicker in the long term and conquer hills easier, then cycling fasted isn\u2019t a terrible idea. BUT it won\u2019t feel as good and you\u2019re in much greater danger of bonking early, and your performance will likely suffer if stats and individual rides matter to you. Imo the balanced approach is best, don\u2019t get bloated or stuffed but something no less than an hour prior and maybe a one small snack (sugary is best) during if you go for a couple hours or more hard. Hydration and fuel becomes more critical in the heat and when you\u2019re still adapting to new training demands. At home don\u2019t ruin your efforts by inhaling the fridge but you can enjoy quite a bit of carbs. After hard rides (such as those with lots of steep climbing) upping your protein for recovery is nice, such as having a shake. Mid ride (esp for long ones or if underfed prior) I like clif bars or the equivalent as they provide a nice variety of macros and types of carbs. Pure protein bars won\u2019t give you as much useable energy in the short term and are better for simply staving off starvation and making you feel less hungry, not the best for quick recovery protein either. I do eat probably an excessive amount of junk (White Castle sliders, rice Krispees, ice cream, soda, candy) but if you manage a century or something like that and/or are going hard all week it\u2019s much more excusable.<br><br>The question was more about food but water is really important so it should be underscored Drink plenty in total and drink often.

Its really basic airmanship in text form, but maybe its of interest to you. <br><br>I also have had LASIK, which I originally got in pursuit of the USAF but I never joined. Between LASIK and PRK, PRK is safer with an apparent month heal time, where LASIK \u201cless safe\u201d and works instantly, a week heal time. Go PRK if you have the time to heal and don\u2019t have to do real vision shit while you wait (driving, reading, etc). I have had zero issues with my LASIK, though in the 8 years since, my vision has degraded about 10 feet per eye, its the same degradation you\u2019d have with or without. LASIK is 99.99% safe in the modern day, as a machine performs the procedure, and the doctor oversees the machine and charges you for the pleasure. All boomer myths about LASIK dangers only applied when it was done by a doctor by hand, the only remaining danger is your eye \u201cflap\u201d never fully heals after LASIK, which is why PRK is slightly safer. Good news, with this flap, you can get LASIK again when your vision degrades enough to justify the cost again. At the conclusion of the procedure, have the eye doc fill out FAA 8500-7, make copies of it, and forward it to FAA OKC, and either keep it on you, or bring it to your AME at your next medical. Its unclear to me if you need a new medical immediately, or can go without until yours expires. The safest route is to get a new medical after LASIK, unless you\u2019ve never had a medical in the first place, then it doesn\u2019t really matter, keep a 8500-7 in case it ever comes up in the futue.<br><br>Outside of military aspirations, there is no \u201creal\u201d benefit to LASIK in the cockpit.", "time": 1676569700, "resto": 1889845}, {"no": 1891064, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)13:53:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1891042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1891042</a><br>Hopefully they just wash them out of the training class.", "time": 1676573603, "resto": 1889845}, {"no": 1891065, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)13:54:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1891049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1891049</a><br>The problem with 152s is a lot of parts aren&#039;t being made any more, so you have to salvage other aircraft to keep yours going.

They make you stay in halls for &#039;phase 1&#039; (3 or 4 months if i remember right) in a building which looks like a prison block. The rooms are small, you can hear your neighbours and showers are shared. There is a new halls building next to it which is \u00a340 a week more but has en-suite showers and bigger rooms which you might consider. The canteen food is also mostly shit. The main college building, simulators and short course facilities are mostly very nice.

If you choose the foundation degree route you&#039;ll probably have slightly older classmates, I was 24 at the start and the median was probably early 20s. If you go HND or HNC there will still be older guys but also lots of 17-18 year olds. Maybe it won&#039;t bother you but having to wear uniform and socialising with a bunch of teenagers did make me feel like a kid, luckily for me we were sent to learn from home during covid and that got me out of halls.

But but the rope can be unwoven and split into multiple paths (but that complicates things a lot and throws out the heat calculation). The loops need to be a specific length for a specific voltage as the combination of both determine the peak temp.

It doesn&#039;t make a difference which train operator you choose to buy your ticket from, as they&#039;ll all charge the same price for the same journey.<br>~Trainline (thetrainline.com) - probably the best option for overseas visitors wishing to purchase train tickets. A little pricey, as they charge a booking fee, but they&#039;ll support your language and payment card.<br>~Openrailwaymap (openrailwaymap.org/) - invaluable for finding past and present railway infrastructure.<br>~Signalbox (map.signalbox.io) - look at them go! It works by guesstimating train positions based on their last known location and timetable, but it&#039;s mesmerising to watch.<br><br>So what&#039;s going on? - the Crossrail megaproject has been completed, and is open to passengers; it&#039;s due to begin a more intensive timetable next year.

minimum hours per week or whatever, can accept or deny orders on your own schedule with no notice beforehand but must complete once youve done so obviously<br>-no need to brand yourself with their logos and shit, can wear what you want and use whatever heat bags you want<br>-paid every tuesday, costs 50p extra to withdraw at any other time<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;JustEat</span><br>(still waiting for my phone call with them but looking on their website more thoroughly and also on the deliveroos subleddit):<br>-two payent options, per delivery and hourly:<br>-per delivery gives you almost or as much flexibility as the roo, think you might have to pre-book shifts though but you can cancel them whenever or cancel individual orders within a shift, dont think the same is true for hourly where you have to stick to the schedule you arrange<br>-think you have to wear their branded kit, which includes the jacket and bag, probably makes getting away with multiapping a little more difficult<br>-for hourly have to commit to 15 hours a week, dont think you get to cancel shifts once theyre booked in<br>-so basically hourly you lose any freedom and flexibility in exchange for

It&#039;s really not complicated anon. There is a battery a motor and a controller which is a computer and regulates power and tells the motor what to do. Everything plugs into the controller. You&#039;re going to need a 3000w motor and a 72v battery if you want to go that fast. Also I&#039;m not sure how stealthy it will be since you&#039;re going to need a big battery.Every battery has a limit on how much power it can put out. If you do a 3000w motor you&#039;re going to want a battery that can put out 3000-5000w. It can handle higher power because 3000w is the reated sustained power. Meaning you could put 3000w through it forever and nothing bad will happen. Often ebikes have a peak power that is higher because any motor can take more power it will just start to heat up. But between the passive cooling and the fact that you wont be outputting that much power constantly, going a bit over is typically fine. The motor controller also has a power limit so pay attention to that. <br>If you need to find watts and you only see a number for amps then multiply volts and amps and you get watts. Remember that 72v batteries actually charge to 84.4v and are dead at 60v. 72v is the nominal voltage aka 50%. <br>That should get you started<br><a href=\"#p1879670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1879670</a><br>pussy", "time": 1672790667, "resto": 1860529}, {"no": 1879679, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)19:05:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1879662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1879662</a><br>A BBSHD mid drive kit capable of that speed with a good 52v battery (not unknown branding) costs nearly 2k total shipped from Lunacycle.

There&#039;s way stronger mid drives but the BBSHD is considered the most economical option considering the power it outputs for the price.

Thousands of years of evolution have allowed conductors to filter out nigger-riggers with incredible efficiency. Even trammies who \u201cpass\u201d look dilapidated and unnatural to a shipwrights and conductors. Your construction is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a new guy home with you, he\u2019ll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your fresh water, moldy bilge. <br><br>You will never be happy. You wrench out a broken windshield every single morning and tell yourself it\u2019s going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a worried passenger, ready to sink you under the unbearable barge.<br><br>Eventually it\u2019ll be too much to float- you\u2019ll buy a gallon of incorrect diesel, get a funnel, put it inside your tank, and plunge into the cold waters. Your shipwrights will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable maintenance and hassle. They\u2019ll beach you with a sign marked &#039;FREE SCRAP<br>, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a boat is buried there. Your metal will rust and go back to the fall apart, and all that will remain of your legacy is a hull that is unmistakably aquatic.<br><br>This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no floating back.", "time": 1672279118, "resto": 1840048}, {"no": 1878989, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)12:49:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1877749\"

Those aromatics are a diverse array of terpenes. I did a quick search and it doesn&#039;t seem likely to polymerize.

I kept the chain lubed often except for one day where I forgot to lube resulting in faint chain noise.

Most money circulation and movement is exchanged between wealthier \u201csafe investment\u201d countries and if not that, in a group of \u201cworld cities\u201d that compete to attract capital and investment. ultimately these beautiful cities are ideal for transport, living, and society, but they don\u2019t line up with our current system of how money works. More people are willing to live a miserable life in Paris, New York, London, or Tokyo, where they will have a high salary. In contrast less people are willing to live in these beautiful cities, because that\u2019s just not where the money is.<br><br> I live in corte rn, beautiful city, walkable, a bit car dependent but still has a rail network, it stays relevant because it has a university, but if this were not the case it would probably also be experiencing major population decline. ultimately there are two possible \u201csolutions\u201d to this. Somehow get people with money to change the way they make their investments and purchases (cultural change within a capitalist system) or we rely on institutions and individuals from these small neglected populations to change the cities to bring them within the global market.
