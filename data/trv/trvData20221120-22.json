St Catherine is in the middle of South Sinai, on Egypt&#039;s Sinai Peninsula. Busses leave once daily from Cairo&#039;s Torgamon bus station at 9:30am. My ticket was 175 Egyptian, ~9USD. Bus took exactly 7 hours, few stops along the way, more than half empty but I bought my ticket the day in advance to be safe.<br><br>The two main things to do in the town are climbing Mt Sinai (picrel) and visiting the monastery. Climbing the mountain was incredible and one of the best experiences I&#039;ve had over 40+ countries. Takes about 4 hours to the top if you&#039;re relatively fit, and I got up in time for the sunset which was magical. You have to (read: have to) take a Bedouin guide up the mountain. Mine was really nice and very liberal with time, bought snacks, and took all the photos I wanted. Guide costs 450 all in, which I was happy with because he was lovely.<br><br>Monastery is interesting enough and worthwhile for the icon gallery (museum) which has a cool collection of religious iconography and an old treaty signed by Muhammad promising to protect the monastery.<br><br>Blatant deception and assorted jewry from some of the local Bedouin population is a blemish on the trip, though. Camp/accommodation owners will essentially force you to take their ludicrously priced drivers from the camp to the monastery/mountain. 350 Egyptian for a 10 minute taxi, same on the way back. The owners of the place I stayed (450 Egyptian per night, Bedouin camp style place) had a massive shouting match with some woman who was staying there because she called them a mafia. Apparently she tried to take a local cab to the monastery and they found out and demanded she pay them as well as the local taxi, lmao. Standard tourist prices and disingenuous swindling behaviour apply throughout the town, expect things to be double the price of Cairo.

For some reason, they always have good deals. The rooms are nice and the mall downstairs has good food. The only downside is that parking is pretty far, at least a mile each way from the rooms to the parking garage. <br><br>Definitely go downtown at night and check out Fremont Street. It&#039;s fucking wild, especially on the weekends. There are always several free bands playing outside at night.<br><br>If you&#039;re into skateboarding, bring a board and go check out the free skateparks around town. There are like a dozen of them. Some are open all night. <br><br>Arizona Hotsprings is an awesome hike into a slot canyon to see some hot springs you can bath in. You can hike all the way to the colorado river. We saw big horn sheep last time we did it.<br><br>Don&#039;t go to the strip for hookers. Go to an asian massage parlor on Spring Mountain and get jerked off. $40 for the massage, $50 tip for the handjob.

I just did a month in Italy and honestly it wasn\u2019t really much cheaper than just flying places, and it takes longer. I thought I\u2019d get the authentic European experience taking the train everywhere, but really all that happened was me being crammed into airplane style seats with obnoxious Italians taking up 3/4 the row despite being half my size. They will also just take your window seat if they arrive there first. Also, the windows are dirty half the time to the point you can\u2019t see particularly well outside of them anyways. The internet on them doesn\u2019t work for shit, and cell service is spotty. Overall, it felt pretty pointless. If it\u2019s only an hour or two, like Rome to Florence, sure why not. But any longer and I fail to see the advantage over flying besides not having to go through security. And security at FCO was way more efficient and nice than anything TSA manages back home in the states.<br>Personally I\u2019d listen to the anon that recommended renting a car so you can go wherever and stop anywhere, but if not I\u2019d say flying is the move for anything over an hour or two. My 4 hour train ride back from Venice to Rome was complete ass. Tickets one way are anywhere from 30\u20ac-100\u20ac depending on when you book - make sure you book a couple weeks ahead at the very least. I do not think any of the train tickets are cancellable either, and if you need to change your ticket you either need a more expensive one or pay an extra fee when you do so.

A significant factor in your credit score is number of applications for cards sent out and concurrent years as a member which means cancelling an account will impact your overall credit and can hurt you financially in the future when you cancel. The best thing to do is to downgrade a card of a specific company to save up on annual fees, so if you want to stop paying $695 on an amex platinum, you downgrade to their shittiest card and save about $600 a year.

The answer to that is obviously fuck no. Even speaking as someone who grew up near there, actually likes it, and can appreciate the history/culture. Because the taxes and the auto insurance rates are so high in the metro Detroit area, it makes it hard to justify the drop in your standard of living you get when you move there. However, it\u2019s probably a lot better than you\u2019re expecting it to be in terms of living conditions, especially in certain parts of the city.
