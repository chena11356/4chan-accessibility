Epcot needed the transformation its going through now 30 years ago. However, i don&#039;t think they are ever going to make it better than it once was. Disney is literally ruining everything about all their parks with IP integration because Disney IPs are literally all fake and gay. Imagineering was once great because they had better ideas than the company itself, including anything Walt ever thought of. And Walt was fake as well. He took credit for everything people more creative than hims came up with.<br>He didnt even design Disneyland like everyone thinks, it was Cornelius Vanderbilt Wood.<br>His original idea for Epcot was some globalist freemason utopia faggotry.<br>Thank god imagineers said fuck that dumb shit and built a permanent worlds fair instead.<br>And now the company just uses the parks as advertisements for their IPs so they can sell the company as a streaming service to Apple.

It&#039;s being done as an example to the shareholders that the company is moving away from expensive maintenance and operating costs in favor of streamlined low cost and bare minimum crowd appeasement.<br>You see, a technocratic corporation such as Apple for example, would have little interest in continuing to invest large portions of the company&#039;s investments in the parks. So all the animatronics and original themed attractions will continue to be phased out in favor of reducing operating costs and making the Disney brand more valuable to the big buyer, which will definitely be a streaming giant since Disney+ is the company&#039;s main focus.<br>Obviously this also means that virtually nothing from the original Splash will remain. Imagine Frozen Ever After but longer since the layout is the only thing being recycled and that is exactly the attraction youre going to get. There will be a handful of actual animatronics but nothing like the previous amount. And they will mostly be projection mapped and screens will replace the physical sets.<br>Disney is essentially throwing the towel in to Universal as far as maintaining an equal or competitive quality for the attractions. Their assumption is that they can cut the costs of the parks to appease investors and still maintain the park attendance and money flow that comes from them.<br>And they are probably right. Look at your average Disney shill, even the casual ones. They will say everything was a worthy replacement regardless and continue to blow their savings each year taking their family because the brand is already engrained into their feeble brains and they will always be loyal no matter what.<br>In the eyes of the park enthusiasts Universal is about to become leaps and bounds ahead of Disney but that will never translate to fiscal consequence because the vast majority of money generated from Disney parks has nothing to do with these opinions.", "time": 1675090185, "resto": 2398143}, {"no": 2398831, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)10:09:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Orlando (&amp; Tampa) Theme Park POWER RANKINGS<br><br>1.

I recovered from COVID no problem. It was only when I took the J&amp;J that I started having problems. The minute I took the vaccine my heart started pounding rapidly. I told the people and they were worried for me. Told me to stay half an hour. I did pass out or anything so I just went home. For like 3 months I just had a rapid heart. Like the feeling of your heart when you stayed up 36 hours and you drink a can of monster to stay awake alittle longer. That is how my heart felt from awaking up until I went to sleep. Plus just constant fatigue. I couldn&#039;t walk for 5 minutes without feel like I ran for 40 mins. I use to like running. I stayed away from physical activity as much as I could. This heart thing was like the issue for a few months. After that for 1 month, I had what I think was brain fog. Like it was just terrible I couldn&#039;t think without it being a struggle to not have a weird feeling in my head. So for that month I stayed in bed and tried not to think. Like even watching TV was bothersome, but at the point the heart thing became less an issue and would only pump hard when walking 5 mins or more. After that, I started to recover. Slowly I was able to walk more and more, go further and further away from my house. Eventually I was able to attend Uni in person like normal. I missed come lectures since it was exhausting, but it was like I was getting my body back to be stronger to do normal things like walk for 15 mins than sit down for 2 hours.even that was something I couldn&#039;t do months earlier. At one point in the early months, I had a stiff neck, which I heard is another vaccine side effect. It felt like a tingle going down my spine in a line when I turned my head. But that went away doctor said it was a muscle issue not blood clots. Doctors checked me out and I guess I have no blood clots. He said my heart looked healthy.

But in another way it was like that feeling on impending doom. Like the fear of not knowing what&#039;s wrong with me. Like in a weird way it would be more comforting to know what exactly is the problem. Even if the problem is more serious it&#039;s better to know, than for it to not be serious but not know. At this point I&#039;ve recovered a lot. But I&#039;m not the same I was before. Like before I was fit, I would workout because I enjoyed working out and trying to be healthy. Like I wasn&#039;t born rich, but being born healthy was a consolation price. Now I don&#039;t even have that. I regret this, I didn&#039;t want to take it but I was pressured by a program in Uni. Honestly my injury is mostly why I&#039;m taking some time to bounce around SEA for a while.

If you&#039;ve never been in a developing country before (or even if you have), you might be the type of person who wants to stay in a comfortable bubble - restaurants with English menus, hotels with air conditioning and hot water close to restaurants/bars, taking taxis/Grab instead of figuring out local buses, etc. If you use mid-range hostels or the cheapest hotels, order Food Panda and local restaurants for most of your meals, and limit drinking alcohol is bars and restaurants, you can get by with a budget of $20-30/day (half of that on rent), depending where you are.

Looking at Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, all of these countries technically only allow 30 days upon entry. (I think Thailand is currently 45.) Thailand has free entry for most passports, Cambodia is $36, Vietnam is $25. Taking a bus between these countries is currently $25-35 one way.<br>In Thailand, you can extend your visa-free entry by another 30 days for $55 without leaving the country. In Cambodia you can extend another 30 days for about $35 without leaving the country. You can&#039;t currently extend in Vietnam. You can leave and re-enter Thailand twice by land borders every calendar year, unlimited times by air, but there&#039;s always the chance that Thai immigration will turn you back. One way to lessen this is to pay for a 60 day single entry visa (which can also be extended for 30 days without leaving the country) or a 180 day ME visa (which has more application requirements and a big cost). You can do visa runs with Cambodia and Vietnam indefinitely - they don&#039;t care.<br>So on the surface it will seem you can spend the most time in Thailand without doing expensive border runs, but Thailand is the country that&#039;s harder to live skint. Their whole economy is designed to suck money from farang, and even in remote areas you&#039;ll find yourself getting gouged and being resented if you barter too hard. There are places you can still do it (Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai are very budget and backpacker friendly, along with almost all the north). And if you get a Thai gf, which will be inevitable unless your tastes lean towards men or katoey, she will show you how to make your money go further.<br>Cambodia and Vietnam are easier to live on a budget, in my opinion, for various reasons. Don&#039;t expect as smooth an experience getting to different parts of them by local transport.

There is no conclusive research, but there is a strong correlation between older men who use sildenafil being twice as likely as men the same age to show some hearing loss. There&#039;s a theory that the same mechanism of sildenafil that makes blood flow easier could also affect the longevity of ear hair follicles that are used for hearing. Using a high dose of sildenafil daily would put a similar strain on your hearing as working in a loud environment. But this is just a theory because it doesn&#039;t seem to affect all men the same way. There might be a genetic factor because, for whatever reason, it seems to happen more to men in the US population than in the UK and Europe.<br>A sudden onset of loss of hearing after using sildenafil is rare, usually affects one ear, and appears within 24 hours. It&#039;s a rare side effect - about as common as getting priapism from sildenafil. It&#039;s thought to be reversible if you get medical attention soon enough.

Hongdae I was mostly doing tourist things. On last halloween there were so many people getting rowdy in the streets of Itaewon that over 100 people died, I heard it died down after that. My friend said NYE was sorta dead, and there were tons of police monitoring crowds. I had a lot of fun there though. Lived there for a few months, now I am living out of Seoul further south.<br>This is all during covid too, so its going to be way more fun for you. Sorta jealous.

There&#039;s also a lot more clubs and bars in Hongdae, much more compact too. There&#039;s a main drag in Itaewon that parallels the main road, which is where &gt;90% of the action is vs Hongdae which is multiple roads packed full of clubs, bars, norebangs, food, whatever. Just full of a ton of stuff. Itaewon is more expensive and has stricter dress codes, which is likely due to Hongdae mostly being very young college kids. <br><br>Mike&#039;s Cabin is mandatory for all foreigners to visit. They play latin music, but its very foreigner friendly, great drinks, cheap, big, and because it&#039;s so foreigner friendly all the Koreans there are going to be more receptive to you. From there you have other options depending on what music you like. Aura and Cocoon, which play electronic music--unless you go the Aura Bar which is connected but separate from Aura. NB2 and Sinkhole are hiphop clubs. <br><br>I highly recommend you club hop. Do not stay at just one place. You could literally go to, and I have, all the clubs I previously mentioned in the same night and have a fantastic time, Clubs pick up after 10 pm, peak at around ~1-2 AM, drop off at around 3-4am, and die completely by 5 am unless you go to a place like Madholic.

To give a full response, your post is filled with sophomoric stereotypes about South Korea that show you<br>1) Know very little about the country<br>2) Never spent much time there<br>3) Never bothered researching much about the country<br>It is obvious from several claims you made. First, you claim Korea is &quot;highly urbanized&quot; which is laughable if you&#039;ve ever been outside of Seoul. Most of the country is not urbanized. If you want nature, just leave the city. Fuck, you don&#039;t even have to leave Seoul to see nature. Bukhansan national park is literally 30 mins north of the city, and that&#039;s one of the best national parks in Korea.<br>Second, you try to point out the positives and negatives of Korea. But your list is ... just dumb? It&#039;s what someone would write if they knew very little about the country. You mention &quot;clubbing is good, but google maps is bad&quot;, which is exactly what someone who spent &lt;1 week there would say. If you spent longer in the country, you would know the positives, and understand the negatives more intricately. <br>Third, you claim the food is better in &quot;better at Szechuan or Japan&quot;, which is completely wrong, as someone who spent months staying in Korea, China, and Japan each, the food in Korea is on-par with Japan and China. I&#039;ve routinely had amazing food in Korea. If you had bad food in Korea, that&#039;s because you didn&#039;t know where to go. Which makes sense, because you know little about the country.", "time": 1675398427, "resto": 2389874}, {"no": 2400845, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:36:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Part 2 because of character limit<br><a href=\"#p2400176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2400176</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; you wanted to know why</span><br>I never asked this, you are projecting. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most people avoid south korea and go to every other asian country, perception is king.</span><br>And this shows you don&#039;t get it. Go ask your normie friends which of the countries you listed they would prefer to visit (Korea, Japan, vietnam, thailand, laos). And those normies will pick Japan and Korea over the rest. Korea has a very good perception among normies. Korea wins because of Kpoop, Kdramas, and every IG travel vlogger posting their trips there.<br>Look at what activities are A-tier in Korea:<br>* Eating with friends - Korean food is meant for sharing. It&#039;s also CHEAP. Because there too many food options, restaurants compete on price, presentation, and service. Food is top tier.<br>* Instagrammable meals - Due to competition, restaurants invent and serve novel foods, which make amazing IG posts.<br>* Eating at cute coffee shops &amp; cafes - Seoul has the most coffee shops per capita in the world. <br>* Chilling with friends at a noraebang<br>* Clubbing<br>* Transit - Excellent subways, easier to use &amp; cheaper than Tokyo. And taxis are cheaper. Comparable to T1 cities in China.<br>* Shopping &amp; Fashion - malls are world class and shopping is tax free<br>* Attractive girls<br>* Kpop &amp; Kdrama cultural pilgrimage - only for koreaboos<br>All of the above are perfect for normies, not /trv/elers. And that is the REAL reason why Korea isn&#039;t talked about much on this forum - /trv/ is not a normie forum, and it&#039;s a mismatch of preferred activities. Weebs prefer Japan over Korea. Coomers prefer easier and cheaper countries, such as Thailand/Philippines. Nature lovers will prefer places with more varied landscapes. History nerds will prefer storied pasts (the Mediterranean comes to mind).<br>In conclusion, the real reason is: the best activities in Korea are normie activities, and people on this forum are not normies.", "time": 1675398971, "resto": 2389874}, {"no": 2400847, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:38:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2400284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2400284</a><br>imo your plan is fucking retarded (just stay at a normal place) but if you plan to go through with it, make sure you download the 1330 tourist hotline app. It is a FREE 24/7 TRANSLATION SERVICE.

We have most likely passed all the actual winter weather this year, but the later you go the better it will be. If you can swing late March or April I really really would.

Sure, but we are extremely used to that here ain\u2019t nothing gonna shut down for rain. Olympia is a bit of a shithole for a capitol, you will prolly want to hit Seattle or portland(which isn\u2019t really that far from where you are) for shit to do city wise.

Public transport is cheap and you can get most popular fast foods such as ramen, takoyaki etc. extremely cheap compared to the West.

In Japan you could get that for 1000 yen or around 7\u20ac and then you could pick extra eggs, noodles, pork, you name it for 100-300 yen per item. At the ramen restaurant that sell 15\u20ac bowls 4 takoyaki balls costs 7\u20ac and for that in Japan you&#039;d get double, if not triple.<br>Then again sushi is around the same if not even more expensive in Japan, but the size of the fish slice they give you there justifies the high price.

Restaurant beer is around 8\u20ac here<br>It&#039;s all relative and as everything some things are cheaper, some are more expensive.

If you are doing 90 days and don&#039;t have a huge itinerary and don&#039;t mind a little discomfort then you can do some different transportation arrangements. For example I took the Shinkansen to Nagano to see the snow monkeys, snowboard, and go to Kusatsu Onsen. You can do all that via bus for pretty cheap. Way faster on the Shinkansen but there&#039;s other logistics. Like the Shinkansen takes you to Nagano but then you need another 1 hour bus ride to get to Kusatsu which is a direct bus route from Tokyo. For 80-90 days you aren&#039;t exactly speed running. You can stay in Airbnbs on the outskirts of town and take a 45 minute train ride to do stuff for the day. 2 hours is a lot for someone that&#039;s only staying a week or two. Also know that with your tourist visa you can only do very basic stuff. Trying to rent anything or use certain services etc is likely very difficult if not impossible. You can basically do all the basic stuff a tourist can. Also translate is usually only one way. If you have translate on your phone you can ask questions and gesture but people usually don&#039;t have a way to translate back. Maybe get a Japanese keyboard or something. Best to just avoid complex questions or older people kek. Also travel light. I know you are going to be here for 3 months but try and stick to maybe just a backpack or backpack + suitcase max.

Also cat track routes are green and they typically don&#039;t go I&#039;m a straight line and curve around the map. If you are on a snowboard, try and avoid these if you can. Lots of flat spots and if you brake it can mean you are going to have to clip out and walk a bit. Stick with greens until you can easily switch between toeside and healside or if skiing then very little pizza and no extremely wide turns. Once you get to blues start going fast and mess around with terrain parks, moguls, and open tree runs.

Muslim families tend to be more conservative but it\u2019s the trend in general, and definitely nowhere near as similar in outskirt villages and towns.

However, rental prices in Mumbai are significantly more expensive than elsewhere in India. You&#039;ll pay more and get less than you would in Delhi or Bangalore. However, an Rs. 60,000 housing stipend should be sufficient alone to rent a reasonably comfortable apartment. <br><br>If you&#039;re staying or working in a more central area, paying an additional $200-300 out-of-pocket should net you a spacious, modern property. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How easy is it to travel to other parts of India from Mumbai? </span><br>Mumbai is a Tier-1 city and Alpha global city.

Making friends in India is reasonably easy. However, the sorts of people who are most likely to approach you in the street will be interested in you because you&#039;re &quot;different.&quot; You can sometimes meet decent people this way, but you might not have anything in common. Furthermore, they might simply want to show you off as their &quot;cool foreign friend.&quot;<br><br>Dating is a slightly different story. Living in India longer-term makes dating easier, especially if you&#039;re looking for something serious--many women won&#039;t want to go out with someone who&#039;s only here for a few weeks or a few months. <br><br>Other than that, well--it completely fucking depends on you. You can certainly find White fetishists in a city like Mumbai--girls who only date White men, and will sleep with any reasonably attractive foreigner. They&#039;re a very small percentage of the overall population, but if you look half-decent, they&#039;ll proactively seek you on dating apps. <br><br>I met some of these women when I was single, and they are fucking insufferable.

However, the early Naxalite movement was effectively curbed before and during the political Emergency of the 1970s. During this period, many Naxal sympathizers and cadres were arrested, imprisoned, or summarily executed. <br><br>While the initial movement was waning in Bengal, hardcore Maoist sympathizers began actively surveying other regions for the location of a potential &quot;guerrilla base.&quot; So far as I can recall, in Maoist war strategy, a guerilla base is an isolated, inaccessible area, from which militants can amass strength and began waging a protracted war of attrition against the urban, industrial state. <br><br>Since many early Naxalite cadres were Telugu speakers, they began making inroads into isolated tribal communities in East-Central India. The Gonds, for example, are among the largest tribes in the region; their language doesn&#039;t have any widely-used written alphabet. However, since Gondi is somewhat similar to Telugu, the Telugu-speaking cadres were able to gradually learn the language and begin &quot;fixing&quot; certain problems relating to corruption and resource exploitation. <br><br>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Naxalites began establishing a significant presence in the historical Dandakaranya region. Much of this region has been neglected by governments for hundreds of years, from the Mughals to the Raj to the early, post-Independence administrations. <br><br>Today, the Maoists find the most support among tribal people--people who might not understand or care about the Maoists&#039; ideological values, but believe that their lifestyles and cultures are being threatened by the state.", "time": 1674717905, "resto": 2378371}, {"no": 2396779, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)02:31:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2396777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396777</a><br>cont. <br>For context, the most heavily-affected regions, in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, are incredibly rich in mineral resources.

That&#039;s pretty on-brand for the Medellin dating scene. Most women are too proud to say they accept money in exchange for sex. Doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t accept a de facto sugar baby relationship. They swipe right on any American with a pulse and go on a date. Then she starts making up all sorts of shit to squeeze money out of you. Here&#039;s some of the ones I&#039;ve heard personally:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a job interview on the other side of the city, can you send me cab money?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a weekly appointment with a psychologist. But I suddenly can&#039;t afford it. Could you help me with that? </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just started at my waitressing job and dropped a tray full of plates. They&#039;re docking it from my pay. She doesn&#039;t ask for money here, but how could you not offer to help? </span><br><br>At least with a proper sugar baby relationship, you can plan out exactly how much you&#039;re gonna give her in exchange for sex. There is no expectation of fidelity on either side, unless you agree to it. There is stability. <br><br>Medellin girls will start asking for all sorts of outrageous amounts, you&#039;ll never know what they&#039;re gonna come out with next. And if you don&#039;t pay up, you&#039;re in the doghouse: no pussy for you. This is enough to get the majority of simps in line. <br><br>Then there&#039;s the hypocrisy. They&#039;ll insist on keeping clothes and shoes over at your place. The unspoken reason for this is so you can&#039;t carry on a relationship with any other woman. Meanwhile they&#039;re getting railed by three other gringos and their actual boyfriend. She can only see you once a week, because she works twelve hour shifts every day; but once you offer to take her on a trip, her schedule clears up overnight. She&#039;ll get offended if you ask her to put a picture of the two of you on her Instagram: don&#039;t you trust her? <br><br>https://www.infobae.com/colombia/20<wbr>23/01/26/valentina-trespalacios-con<wbr>ocio-por-tinder-a-john-poulos-segun<wbr>-la-mama-de-la-dj/", "filename": "28049125502", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 535, "h": 544, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675654658521919, "time": 1675654658, "md5": "o7/7IY3VMiRRcKy5GRJyeQ==", "fsize": 22895, "resto": 2396168}, {"no": 2402703, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)22:51:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2402346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2402346</a><br>OP Here. i&#039;m a digital nomad so i&#039;ll also be working while im there. i can do my job shitfaced/hungover.", "time": 1675655515, "resto": 2396168}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2402417, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)14:26:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me, born and raised in sault MI</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;largest population center in like 200mi, have never been anywhere else</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;imagine how wonderful other places in the world are </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;flash forward to last month, visit ohio cause i hear good things from fudgies </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everyone is fat and stupid</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;monolingual</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;syrup&quot; is literally just sugar sludge </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;play football instead of hockey, refs cry and shit their pants at the sight of blood</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;barely anyone has ever been skiing, they call me rich for regularly attending local trail</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uninspired protestant churches instead of beautifully intricate catholic architecture </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no glorious freighters traversing the tourist corpse filled waters of st. mary&#039;s river, just nepo rich kids on a speedboat in a polluted lake</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no dispensaries or casinos</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bud light or bust, apparently </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;candy shops and *REAL* ice cream parlors are a rarity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no greek restaurants, pizza is trash</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;regularly get fucked over by state gov, never riot, just allow themselves to get cucked</span><br>how have we been in a feud with ohio for so long when we are obviously superior?", "filename": "DD9C2DEF-C262-4717-B5D7-9BBE318AAC53", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 150, "h": 203, "tn_w": 150, "tn_h": 203, "tim": 1675625201758541, "time": 1675625201, "md5": "5MhhVT1LBIBONPbmDBl3Eg==", "fsize": 6038, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "be-me-born-and-raised-in-sault-mi", "replies": 16, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 2402437, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)14:56:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2402417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2402417</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sault MI</span><br><br>how often do you go to canada for stuff?", "time": 1675627015, "resto": 2402417}, {"no": 2402439, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)15:02:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2402417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2402417</a><br>Fuck off with your shitty bootleg wish.com Canada.

Don&#039;t get me wrong there will be dodgy people who will take you without it but not really worth the risk imo, sure you could snorkel the surface but kinda boring.<br>I&#039;ve not been to Bonaire but I did Honduras, pretty cool and they have awesome whale sharks but it&#039;s a bit trickier to get there and all in all unless you&#039;re just in the area it&#039;s a faff.

I went to the dangerous ghettos and this is what travel is about - feats of courage. Do you have the courage to go to a black ghetto? How about the drug zones? How about Camden? Yes, Philadelphia is great for other reasons too (historical sights, pretty buildings, etc) but for men this is a must visit to show your courage. In Philly you can see beauty and destitution in one trip.<br><br>2) Pittsburgh - Yes, Pennsylvania made a big affect on me. And anyway, what a beautiful city - the bridges, the hills, the rivers. The Cathedral of learning was splendid and there was a felling in the air I could not shake. I love this city.<br><br>3) Santa Fe- I love pueblo homes and Santa Fe did not disappoint. And such a great jumping off point to explore the wonderful New Mexico. Such a cultured city. <br><br>4) Charleston - This city has real southern charm unlike boring atlanta and it is not as filled as Savannah (which I also loved).

And for me I felt so magical here. But of course it is also crime ridden and lots of drug addicts. But, as somebody who enjoys feats of courage, this was no problem for me. The fog is enchanting. <br><br>6) Las Vegas - I don&#039;t even gamble much but this is the strangest city. It is a playground in the desert. And from Las Vegas you can easily reach some great national parks. I loved the feeling of this place very much. It is like a movie.<br><br>7) Gary - Can you tell that I love American urban decay? Well, maybe Gary isn&#039;t a &quot;city&quot; anymore because of population decline. But you must visit this if you are near Chicago. I was so giddy with excitement the whole time. The aesthetic is post-apocalyptic, absolutely!<br><br>8) Boston - A great and historical city. I loved the freedom trail, there is a line on the sidewalk and you simply follow it to see the different historical sights. I think this city is beautiful. <br><br>9) San Diego - Los Angeles was a disappointment. San Diego some say is &quot;boring&quot; but it is a nice and safe place. There are no feats of courage here, mostly just relaxing and enjoying this comfortable city.<br><br>10) Washington DC - This almost went to Seattle but it has to go to DC. If you are into the truth about Satanic powers then you will enjoy this place. I sense evil here but that makes it invigorating. Like at any moment I could &quot;disappear&quot;. Also it is fun to rent the scooters here and go drive around the Georgetown neighborhoods and embassy row.

MNCs function in such a way that every national branch is its own company. They bill shit to each other, and either compete with, or work in fields that aren&#039;t quite the ones back home. <br><br>For example, a lot of MNCs will have folks working sales abroad to sell the products produced back home. And the people they will hire are obviously locals because they might be cheaper or just more at ease with communicating with the locals. Also, hiring an equivalent foreign worker is pound to pound as skilled as a local is considered bad practice and is starting to get heavily curbed in Asia.<br><br>Therefore, differentiation is key.

Foreign internships, exchanges and double diplomas during your studies can help if you take the necessary steps professionally to make it work. <br><br>In a nutshell, anything that makes you a better person than a local works. And that also goes by evening the playing fields. Some countries have visa schemes that facilitate foreign hiring for skilled workers. Speaking the local language in a professional capacity also helps leveling the playing field and beating other foreign contenders. Again, you don&#039;t necessarily need to do all that to try your luck.

The real question is whether or not, ultimately, you&#039;d rather go abroad and settle for less (but definitely not less than the people working the same field there) or stay at home. <br>If you think TEFL is an easy solution, it&#039;s not, and will ultimately yield you the same problem. You will do overtime, unpaid meetings, and getting any form of raise beyond compensation for inflation will be way more difficult. Career-wise, if you ever want back in, you had better made it temporary before people do not find you worth hiring anymore. And also, teaching kids is EXHAUSTING.

Great city and quite cheap overall, here are some basic recommendations if you have a couple of days:<br><br>-Buda Castle, free and provides nice views of the city. You can often see the ceremonial Horse Guards do their rounds, which is fun. There is also a museum of Hungarian art within the castle grounds which is quite cheap and well worth seeing.<br>-Thermal Baths: if you can only do one, do Sz\u00e9chenyi. Its the biggest and has a nice variety of hot pools, cold/medium pools and sauna/steam rooms. When you arrive, don&#039;t get confused and think that its only an outdoor pool- you have to go indoors and look around to find all the pools. If you have time to do two, do Gellert as well, it is smaller but less crowded and in a prettier setting.<br>-Ruin Bars: there are several, the most famous is Szimpla, which will pretty much always be busy during drinking hours. Stroll around its area and you&#039;ll find others each with their own quirks, as well as a kind of Hungarian food court/area that tends to be around there. <br>-Orsokahz: Hungarian parliament, a really magnificent building. Even if you aren&#039;t interested in architecture or history this is well worth checking out, it dominates the skyline of the city and is just breathtakingly beautiful and magnificient, especially as you cross into the city at night and see it for the first time. You can only go in with a guided crowd tour, but its worth doing. Slightly expensive by Hungarian standards but not too bad, but be sure to book well in advance because English tours fill up. <br><br>Whatever you do, be sure to walk the banks of the Danube by Parliament and cross the Chain Bridge and Princess Margaret Bridge.", "time": 1674732607, "resto": 2396592}, {"no": 2396848, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2396592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396592</a><br><a href=\"#p2396840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396840</a><br>2/2<br><br>Other good stuff:<br><br>-Go the the Zwach distillery and get a tour, its cheap and they can get you pretty hammered if your guide is feeling like it. Zwach is also a very uniquely Hungarian beverage and there&#039;s rarely even anyone at the distillery. Fair warning: most people find regular Zwach pretty fucking foul, but the plum and coffee varieties are good shit. On the topic of food and drink, be sure to try the following: Tokay, which is Hungarian sweet wine, Langos fried flatbreads with toppings (go to Retro Langos for these), goulash, and Palinka (pear brandy which I personally think is foul but they like it). <br>-Gul Baba street, one of the steepest streets in major European cities, which ends with the tomb of an old Muslim theologian/scholar, also a pilgrimage site and rose garden. <br>-Citadela, where you&#039;ll see the big soviet statue, old fort that has the best views of the city and a nice hike to get up there<br>-Margaret Island, which is a cool island in the Danube with gardens and an assortment of stuff, good spot for picnics <br>-Fisherman&#039;s Bastion, which are the white fortifications you&#039;ll see, you can enter for free and if a turret/tower tries to charge for entry you can generally just come back at sundown and they won&#039;t be charging any more. <br><br>I think you can get to Bratislava by boat very easily from Budapest, but I&#039;ve never been. <br>Don&#039;t take taxis, they are a literal cartel designed to scam people. <br>Also get some turkish food while you are there and use trams instead of the subway.

It&#039;s going to be full or tourists, but I can imagine it&#039;s fun for young people. The &quot;food court&quot; is called &quot;Street Food Karavan&quot;-- it&#039;s at the end of the street that Szimpla is on. If you&#039;re at one end of the block, and there&#039;s no food court, it&#039;s on the other end. From Szimpla, if you keep going in the same direction, then turn left when the road ends, you&#039;ll pass by a nice brunch place called Cirkusz that is sadly crowded all the time, and then if you turn right you&#039;ll end up a Gozsdu udvar, which could also be described as a kind of food court area.

Bush, the old stock exchange (on your right), and the fortress-like US embassy (on your left). At the opposite end of the square, there&#039;s a memorial to the German occupation of Hungary. You can then continue ~200 meters along Oktober 6 street, pass by George Soros&#039;s university, and you&#039;ll soon be able to see the square in front of Saint Steven&#039;s Basilica.

If you can&#039;t afford it then you can&#039;t go. Second, where are you going and for how long? You can split your budget by number of days and then check if you have enough money for accomodations, food, tourism, flight, transportation or if it will be unafforadble for you at which point you need to work more and delay your trip. You&#039;re from EU so that passport should open a lot of doors for you, some countries may still require you to apply for a visa so check before you buy a ticket if you need to or don&#039;t. Also, check restrictions on time limits for visa-free travel (can&#039;t go in visa free and stay indefinitely, many places have a 90 day limit).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what about a place to stay?</span><br>hostels, airbnb&#039;s, cheap hotels, expensive hotels are all options.

You have the internet available, so use it. You can go minimalist and winging it or you can make a full day by day itinerary where you pick certain stops per day and plan a route to visit all of them. If you search online you may find sample routes for places you want to go to which you can alter at will based on your own interests. Look up lists of landmarks, museums, historical sites, hidden gems, hot spots in town and then find out which ones you want to go to and which ones you can skip on. Once you know where to go, find ways to connect them. If they&#039;re all in a circle around your accommodation, divide that circle into quadrants and explore it in a loop so you hit your interests and see the town on the way to and back. You can even find quality restaurants ahead of time per area and go to those the day you head out. It&#039;s really no different from mapping out a day in your own town. Something like:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;want to go see city hall in my small town</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh and there&#039;s a museum a few blocks away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s even a really beautiful park further down from the museum</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s going to be around lunchtime when I go, theres a restaurant with great reviews between the museum and park so i can stop there</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;after the park i&#039;ll need to make my way back, but ill return in a circle instead of a straight line back to check out a church and another museum before I leave</span><br>It&#039;s that simple, people really overestimate planning for travel. It takes a few hours at most to have everything ready, from bookings to day-to-day itineraries. <br><br>Speaking of bookings, do not use sites that book for you.

You really need to spend the time to crunch numbers because even though you have enough to go, you don&#039;t know if you have enough to go for 30 days. Some stuff will be more expensive too, so if you want to go to a ryokan or go to a hot spring town and get a hot spring hotel for a night, that will up pricing. You really need to budget before you go. As for 30 days in Tokyo, lmao you clearly didnt listen to us and try to plan shit out. You should be moving around since you&#039;re staying so long.<br>A good sample itinerary for you would be:<br>4 days Tokyo &gt; daytrip to fuji &gt; train to Kyoto and stay 5 days &gt; train to Osaka and stay for 4 days &gt; bus to the nakasendo trail and try to stay at a post town at the end of the hike &gt; bus to Gero and stay a few days for hot spring relaxation &gt; bus to takayama &gt; daytrip to shirakawa-go &gt; continue northeast or loop back to tokyo. <br><br>This is the way you should be thinking of your trip. You allocate days based on what you want to see per city/town and some time for travel within the country. The SIM card at the airport will be a must for internet on the go.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story. Maybe look at the job situation so you can make it there.

The destruction of the environment is a major trope in cyberpunk; places with lots of smog, terrible weather, rivers of trash, e-waste will definitely fit this. <br><br>Other tropes are the feeling of isolation in a densely packed area, orwellian surveillance and the &#039;sin city&#039; factor, especially if it&#039;s open-air/ungoverned/state sanctioned.<br> Think the 7 sins: <br><br>Lust: escorts, massage parlors, love hotels, easy access p0rn, hypersexuality, gay bath houses, ladyboys<br>Gluttony: fast food, binge drinking, gold plated food, silver facials, excessive materialism/consooming<br>Greed: crypto, casinos/gambling, stock market, hustlers, gig economy, cash4gold, various scams, black market (silk road, organ harvesting), <br>Sloth: high automation, widespread apathy/nihilism, indifference to cruelty/bystander effect (watching people die, ignoring untouchables), promoting laziness<br>Wrath: war propaganda, political/ethnic/religious scapegoats blasted on media, eye 4 an eye mentality, cheering on violent/self-destructive behavior, sanctioned gangrapes, crimewave, gangs, police brutality, rudeness<br>Envy: sports cars, bling, expensive bags, photoshopped models, paradise packages, high rise condos next to slums, celebrities<br>Pride: social media, taking pride in degeneracy, ethno-narcissism, hyper-nationalism, religious zealots, promoting vanity<br><br>Which cities come to mind?

A white guy probably will be better treated than a black one. A women will have much more people inclined to help in case of need.

One way or another, I don\u2019t really know why Indians who have other opportunities would bother with Canada, were it not for the easy visa. Most of my Indian friends with in-demand degrees and international work experience have said that the Canadian job market is hyper-competitive and that salaries are far lower than what you\u2019d get doing the same work in America. <br><br>(of course, America has its own problems. IMO, the States get pretty top-quality Indian immigrants, with younger generations being much more willing to assimilate and intermingle with Americans than their boomer predecessors. The downside is that work-based green cards have country-specific quotas, so there are 15+ year backlogs. I know people who\u2019ve done their PhDs in America, gotten good job offers, and haven\u2019t even reached the point where they\u2019re eligible to apply for permanent residency)", "time": 1674369653, "resto": 2391810}, {"no": 2394600, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:53:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2394580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2394580</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Indians don&#039;t look the same either the clothes and food and dishes and jewelry are different</span><br><br>Try going there.
