I only came here occasionally over the years for escapism, but should I travel to the Philippines and cheat on my tranny gf who cheated on me 10+ times over the course of 2020?<br><br>I met &quot;her&quot; in 2019 off grindr and I was a NEET so when she invited me to go to PH with her for a month I was like &quot;ok&quot; so we went and fucked like everyday. This allowed me to familiarize myself with how things work over there. We used grab for uber, globe for cell service, and were in Makati so I got a good idea of how 60 year old losers can walk around with 18 yr old girls and no one bats an eye. <br><br>In 2020 she began to cheat on me throughout the year. In late 2021 I found out after someone at the bar showed me pictures but she lied and I believed her when she said it was only 3 guys and only one she actually met up with and they only hugged and kissed even though the guy at the bar showed me pictures of them naked in bed with dried cum on her stomach. <br><br>In January of 2022 I decided to snoop further and that&#039;s when I saw that she was basically fucking a different guy every week in reality. She had said she was working late for covid so she couldn&#039;t hang Friday nights. In reality she was going to bars and the uber trip log showed coming back at 3AM. Then she would flirt with guys on tinder the following morning when she woke up horny and would fuck a lot of them. This would play out on Sunday as well when I had to go work. <br><br>Perhaps the saddest thing was that she was talking about swallowing their cum, something she never let me do. There was even one conversation wherein the guy shows a face pic, and then 45 mins later she is texting him a video of him fucking her in the ass without a condom--essentially she let him come right over and fuck her raw. I asked her if she had ever bothered to get an HIV test and she said not until late last year, meaning if she had contracted I would&#039;ve guaranteed gotten it too.

I tore my ACL last year and it still has not healed and physical therapy is not working so it may needd surgery. To make matters worse I recently tore my shoulder labrum. I also quit my job to study for a license right before I found out about how much worse the cheating was than I thought. So now I essentially sit in my room like a starfish desperately trying not to make my injuries worse, crying due to everything that&#039;s happened, and obviously not getting anywhere studying.<br><br>Perhaps I should get a new job, but if so then what better time to take an excursion to SEA than now before I start working again? (My last job I couldn&#039;t even take one day off) I also am plagued by the thought of cheating, something I had been so strongly against my whole life and have never done before. I don&#039;t know if I have the heart for it and I would probably feel very guilty to the point where I might confess, but at the same time this is clearly a shit relationship now so who cares?<br><br>I&#039;m thinking about learning tagalog since her family likes me a lot anyway. Does a globe sim card require you to get a new phone number? Because that would blow my cover. Is Makati the best place to do something like this? The girls I saw when we went out looked very high-volume and I&#039;d be worried about catching herpes and bringing it to my partner. (Both clean) Is it realistic to fire up tinder and get a guaranteed match? (I&#039;m 5&#039;11 160lbs with a 7.5 inch dick) Ideally to minimize risk of stds I&#039;d like to meet a hot girl and maybe she shows me around and we go on an excursion to some beach area. Is this realistic? I think my biggest weakness will be my lack of social skills and my difficulty faking good energy due to sadness from what is happening to me right now.

I do a VERY specific type of maintenance for a specialized server and got a job in Tokyo right before covid. Since I know many of you are weebs who have never had the chance to go to Japan, I will answer questions here. While I spent 90% of the time in Japan, I was able to travel around Asia as well.<br><br>Key takeaways:<br><br>1) Japan is hands down the best place for a white person to live in Asia, IF you have money. The food quality and safety is excellent. Prostitution, while more expensive than anywhere else in Asia, provides whores who know how to please you. Geisha culture has not been completely extinguished from modern Japanese culture so you can have some wonderful experiences with prostitutes, better than Europe and far better than anything in America.<br><br>What is very interesting about Japanese services and restaurants is that everyone specializes in one thing and does that for their entire life, becoming excellent at whatever they do. Since Japanese work so much (notice I did not say &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;smart&quot;, but &quot;much&quot; meaning that they are forced to spend many hours at work even if it&#039;s unproductive), they highly value &quot;experiences&quot; such as eating out, shows, etc, whatever. This puts a very high pressure on the service industry to deliver quality, meaning that if you&#039;re a westerner living in Japan, making a lot and working relatively little due being in a specialized field, you get to reap immense benefits from their service industry. These services were designed for Japanese people to enjoy, for their OWN people, but due to globalization you can now siphon off the cream from their society for your own benefit.

While white/European &quot;racism&quot; comes from an actual superiority to other races in terms of cultural, scientific, and artistic achievement, Japan&#039;s racism and supreme arrogance comes from not wanting to be associated with Chinese culture, from which they are HEAVILY influenced by even to this day, and wanting to be accepted by Anglo-Saxon power. There is a deep rooted hatred for China in Japan despite almost all Japanese culture being based upon Chinese culture (Japan was a vassal state of China until about 1100 AD), particularly the philosophy which is rooted in Confucianism.<br><br>This creates a very interesting interaction dynamic with Japanese if you are white. You notice that they intensely discriminate against Chinese and Koreans (younger generations lesser so due to k pop), and almost comically fawn over white people and culture. And yet, their disdain for their yellow brothers creates an intense sense of self-hatred, making them servile to whites, almost slave like, in the presence of whites. This was fascinating because you don&#039;t see this behavior with chinese or koreans. While you can obviously tell that both groups are less sophisticated than Japanese, they don&#039;t have this kind of sniveling pandering servile attitude towards whites. They are genuinely curious to be around whites, especially rural koreans and chinese, but it&#039;s in a way where they view you as alien rather than a supreme master.", "filename": "1655374629922", "ext": ".webm", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674611601843105, "time": 1674611601, "md5": "vfiafzJhnFAyPXCt/vmCGw==", "fsize": 855307, "resto": 2396183}, {"no": 2396187, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:54:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "3) The two largest draw backs of Japan are that it becomes boring very quickly once the &quot;fantasy&quot; wears off, and the women. Japan is wonderful at first, and it still is, but once the novelty fades and you start seeing it for what it is, which is simply a slightly higher developed asian country, it becomes boring. The temples are boring, the shrines are boring, the food gets boring, the conversations in particular gets SUPER boring once you realize that Japanese people are somewhat uncultured and ignorant of many things due to their insular society and culture. Japanese appear to be very smart, and they definitely are in certain regards, but much of this image has to do with them not opening their mouths or commenting on things.

However, after bedding them I still prefer white women. Not only because I find them more attractive, but they are also more interesting and independent. Lots of people here want &quot;trad wives&quot; and while there is truth to that, you also want someone who you can talk to and debate with, and have interesting conversations with.

What&#039;s the worst treatment you can remember?<br>If I were to visit Japan and live there for a month, what places would suggest are a priority to experience and what things or places would you recommend to stay away from?<br>And another weird question, what is the fitness scene like?

Japan is wonderful at first, and it still is, but once the novelty fades and you start seeing it for what it is, which is simply a slightly higher developed asian country, it becomes boring. The temples are boring, the shrines are boring, the food gets boring, the conversations in particular gets SUPER boring once you realize that Japanese people are somewhat uncultured and ignorant of many things due to their insular society and culture. Japanese appear to be very smart, and they definitely are in certain regards, but much of this image has to do with them not opening their mouths or commenting on things. Once you hear their opinions on certain matters, you realize that they are somewhat uncultured, though still more cultured than their neighboring asian countries</span><br>Deffo a poltard. This is one thing I like about the Japanese. White Westerners (and brown ones too) pretend to be cultured and well-informed but only have a superficial understanding of any topic they talk about. It makes for good conservation at a dinner party but prod them further and they are talking out of their arse.

It&#039;s a superiority complex. If it was inferiority then gaijin would get preferential treatment which we most certainly do not.

English teachers wouldn&#039;t be a complete and utter joke. &quot;Whito piggu go homu&quot; demonstrations wouldn&#039;t be a thing. No foreigners apartment rental policies wouldn&#039;t be a thing.

I live in a pretty middle-class neighborhood, and there&#039;s never a moment I don&#039;t doubt or realize that I&#039;m in India (right now, for instance, there&#039;s a neighborhood mela and festival ongoing--I am being forced to listen to literally window-shaking devotional music while people scream, shriek, and dance on the road).", "time": 1674221514, "resto": 2391810}, {"no": 2393670, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)08:36:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2393667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2393667</a><br>cont. <br>As India&#039;s economy continues to somewhat strengthen, these visible indicators of inequality will--most probably--become less visible. But I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to happen any time soon. India isn&#039;t going to magically transform into an unrecognizable destination overnight. The next several decades will doubtlessly bring some improvements, but I doubt India is going to become a Westernized or entirely modern country in our lifetimes. <br><br>(it&#039;s also worth noting that the current political landscape in many states is dominated by Hindu nationalist parties and politicians, almost all of whom are opposed to so-called Westernization, at least when such Westernization doesn&#039;t impact their personal earning opportunities) <br><br><a href=\"#p2391822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2391822</a><br>In respect to clothes and whatnot: this is very, very prevalent, especially in rural areas.<br><br>I do think it&#039;s worth noting that Western dress among men is very widespread.

Traditional dress isn&#039;t commonly worn except by persons working in certain professions and for special occasions (again, there are many exceptions--I haven&#039;t spent as much time in South India as I have elsewhere, but I think farmers and whatnot customarily and very regularly wear lungis. Lower-income Muslim men are another very noticeable exception, as many wear typically Islamic clothing).<br><br>(again, can&#039;t generalize. I wouldn&#039;t bat an eye at a guy wearing a lungi or dhoti in many neighborhoods. It&#039;s not uncommon at all) <br><br>The trend is different for women.

But I would say the best months in southeastern states are april-june and september-november. Not too hot or cold and not too much rain. In S\u00e3o Paulo it can get near 0 C, but usually 5-10C in cold winter days and 35C in hot summer days. Rio get 15C in cold days and 40+C in hot summer days. Bear in mind that 10C in Brazil is much colder than 3C in European countries. We usually do not have heating inside houses and shops so it does feel cold.<br>I just advise to rent a car if you want to travel to smaller cities like from SP to southern MG and Paraty. Inside cities just use uber/taxi. If you go from capital to capital just fly. <br>Not really sure about hotels. Like anywhere else I just look for the ratings, location and hotel class. You won&#039;t have a problem booking 4+ stars hotels. If you&#039;re looking for cheap places, take care. We have motels (love hotels) that are used for having sex and places that attract low level scum to use drugs.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story.

You have the internet available, so use it. You can go minimalist and winging it or you can make a full day by day itinerary where you pick certain stops per day and plan a route to visit all of them. If you search online you may find sample routes for places you want to go to which you can alter at will based on your own interests. Look up lists of landmarks, museums, historical sites, hidden gems, hot spots in town and then find out which ones you want to go to and which ones you can skip on. Once you know where to go, find ways to connect them. If they&#039;re all in a circle around your accommodation, divide that circle into quadrants and explore it in a loop so you hit your interests and see the town on the way to and back. You can even find quality restaurants ahead of time per area and go to those the day you head out. It&#039;s really no different from mapping out a day in your own town. Something like:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;want to go see city hall in my small town</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh and there&#039;s a museum a few blocks away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s even a really beautiful park further down from the museum</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s going to be around lunchtime when I go, theres a restaurant with great reviews between the museum and park so i can stop there</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;after the park i&#039;ll need to make my way back, but ill return in a circle instead of a straight line back to check out a church and another museum before I leave</span><br>It&#039;s that simple, people really overestimate planning for travel. It takes a few hours at most to have everything ready, from bookings to day-to-day itineraries. <br><br>Speaking of bookings, do not use sites that book for you. Always book directly with an airline/hotel. If there&#039;s a problem and you book directly, then the place that fucked you has to deal with you themselves.

I really liked those guys, so I went with them to kyoto the next day.&quot;", "time": 1673933768, "resto": 2391137}, {"no": 2391799, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:00:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2391779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2391779</a><br>kino points", "time": 1673935233, "resto": 2391137}, {"no": 2391863, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:15:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2391399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2391399</a><br>losing hotel room key is not a problem, as long as you have an ID with yourself you can just ask at the reception to get you another (usually those are just magnetic cards anyway).

One good advice I can give from several dozen travels I did is to always keep your stuff together, if you unpack don&#039;t throw your stuff around in your room.

I just want to stress the same points that other people made, bring only a backpack (40L-55L max imo, go to r/onebag for more info and realize that you can do laundry abroad) so that you can stay mobile and avoid spending extra money for checked baggage. In addition, I highly agree with being spontaneous. I personally like to AVOID planning too much beforehand because you end up spoiling a little bit of what you&#039;re going to see; however, I personally mark places on google maps near where I am staying such that I can do something in case I am bored. Again friend, I hope you end up going through with this trip, I can guarantee that you won&#039;t regret it if you stray outside of your comfort zone by trying new things and talking to people within your hostel or just on the street. I know this is 4chan and all of us are socially inward/outcasts in some way, but I can personally tell you that traveling by myself to a foreign country has done wonders to my self confidence (second to boxing) and I find myself far more comfortable with social situations and just talking to complete strangers. Being by yourself in a foreign country makes you lonely, which ends up forcing you to talk to other people you meet (which is a good thing!). <br><br>I&#039;m personally jealous that you&#039;re able to go to Japan and for so long!

You really need to spend the time to crunch numbers because even though you have enough to go, you don&#039;t know if you have enough to go for 30 days. Some stuff will be more expensive too, so if you want to go to a ryokan or go to a hot spring town and get a hot spring hotel for a night, that will up pricing. You really need to budget before you go. As for 30 days in Tokyo, lmao you clearly didnt listen to us and try to plan shit out. You should be moving around since you&#039;re staying so long.<br>A good sample itinerary for you would be:<br>4 days Tokyo &gt; daytrip to fuji &gt; train to Kyoto and stay 5 days &gt; train to Osaka and stay for 4 days &gt; bus to the nakasendo trail and try to stay at a post town at the end of the hike &gt; bus to Gero and stay a few days for hot spring relaxation &gt; bus to takayama &gt; daytrip to shirakawa-go &gt; continue northeast or loop back to tokyo. <br><br>This is the way you should be thinking of your trip. You allocate days based on what you want to see per city/town and some time for travel within the country. The SIM card at the airport will be a must for internet on the go.

MNCs function in such a way that every national branch is its own company. They bill shit to each other, and either compete with, or work in fields that aren&#039;t quite the ones back home. <br><br>For example, a lot of MNCs will have folks working sales abroad to sell the products produced back home. And the people they will hire are obviously locals because they might be cheaper or just more at ease with communicating with the locals. Also, hiring an equivalent foreign worker is pound to pound as skilled as a local is considered bad practice and is starting to get heavily curbed in Asia.<br><br>Therefore, differentiation is key. Differentiation through diplomas (Prestigious ones), differentiation through specialization (PhDs in certain fields of expertise that are needed there, for example, or at least +5 year in a field but more is better).<br><br>If you&#039;re ballsy enough you can point out a certain need in a foreign branch, explain how to fill it so they can tailor a job offer for you there, too. <br>This being said, a lot of people manage to get to work abroad if they have +5 years exp in dev, sometimes less. Foreign internships, exchanges and double diplomas during your studies can help if you take the necessary steps professionally to make it work. <br><br>In a nutshell, anything that makes you a better person than a local works. And that also goes by evening the playing fields. Some countries have visa schemes that facilitate foreign hiring for skilled workers. Speaking the local language in a professional capacity also helps leveling the playing field and beating other foreign contenders. Again, you don&#039;t necessarily need to do all that to try your luck.

The real question is whether or not, ultimately, you&#039;d rather go abroad and settle for less (but definitely not less than the people working the same field there) or stay at home. <br>If you think TEFL is an easy solution, it&#039;s not, and will ultimately yield you the same problem. You will do overtime, unpaid meetings, and getting any form of raise beyond compensation for inflation will be way more difficult. Career-wise, if you ever want back in, you had better made it temporary before people do not find you worth hiring anymore. And also, teaching kids is EXHAUSTING.

Great city and quite cheap overall, here are some basic recommendations if you have a couple of days:<br><br>-Buda Castle, free and provides nice views of the city. You can often see the ceremonial Horse Guards do their rounds, which is fun. There is also a museum of Hungarian art within the castle grounds which is quite cheap and well worth seeing.<br>-Thermal Baths: if you can only do one, do Sz\u00e9chenyi. Its the biggest and has a nice variety of hot pools, cold/medium pools and sauna/steam rooms. When you arrive, don&#039;t get confused and think that its only an outdoor pool- you have to go indoors and look around to find all the pools. If you have time to do two, do Gellert as well, it is smaller but less crowded and in a prettier setting.<br>-Ruin Bars: there are several, the most famous is Szimpla, which will pretty much always be busy during drinking hours. Stroll around its area and you&#039;ll find others each with their own quirks, as well as a kind of Hungarian food court/area that tends to be around there. <br>-Orsokahz: Hungarian parliament, a really magnificent building. Even if you aren&#039;t interested in architecture or history this is well worth checking out, it dominates the skyline of the city and is just breathtakingly beautiful and magnificient, especially as you cross into the city at night and see it for the first time. You can only go in with a guided crowd tour, but its worth doing. Slightly expensive by Hungarian standards but not too bad, but be sure to book well in advance because English tours fill up. <br><br>Whatever you do, be sure to walk the banks of the Danube by Parliament and cross the Chain Bridge and Princess Margaret Bridge.", "time": 1674732607, "resto": 2396592}, {"no": 2396848, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2396592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396592</a><br><a href=\"#p2396840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396840</a><br>2/2<br><br>Other good stuff:<br><br>-Go the the Zwach distillery and get a tour, its cheap and they can get you pretty hammered if your guide is feeling like it. Zwach is also a very uniquely Hungarian beverage and there&#039;s rarely even anyone at the distillery. Fair warning: most people find regular Zwach pretty fucking foul, but the plum and coffee varieties are good shit. On the topic of food and drink, be sure to try the following: Tokay, which is Hungarian sweet wine, Langos fried flatbreads with toppings (go to Retro Langos for these), goulash, and Palinka (pear brandy which I personally think is foul but they like it). <br>-Gul Baba street, one of the steepest streets in major European cities, which ends with the tomb of an old Muslim theologian/scholar, also a pilgrimage site and rose garden. <br>-Citadela, where you&#039;ll see the big soviet statue, old fort that has the best views of the city and a nice hike to get up there<br>-Margaret Island, which is a cool island in the Danube with gardens and an assortment of stuff, good spot for picnics <br>-Fisherman&#039;s Bastion, which are the white fortifications you&#039;ll see, you can enter for free and if a turret/tower tries to charge for entry you can generally just come back at sundown and they won&#039;t be charging any more. <br><br>I think you can get to Bratislava by boat very easily from Budapest, but I&#039;ve never been. <br>Don&#039;t take taxis, they are a literal cartel designed to scam people. <br>Also get some turkish food while you are there and use trams instead of the subway. The trams are great, run everywhere and are cheap, the subway fucking sucks, everything is ancient and last time I took it a train caught fire.

It&#039;s going to be full or tourists, but I can imagine it&#039;s fun for young people. The &quot;food court&quot; is called &quot;Street Food Karavan&quot;-- it&#039;s at the end of the street that Szimpla is on. If you&#039;re at one end of the block, and there&#039;s no food court, it&#039;s on the other end. From Szimpla, if you keep going in the same direction, then turn left when the road ends, you&#039;ll pass by a nice brunch place called Cirkusz that is sadly crowded all the time, and then if you turn right you&#039;ll end up a Gozsdu udvar, which could also be described as a kind of food court area. If you put the names into a search engine, you should be able to see the locations.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orsokahz</span><br>Orszaghaz. Book the tour online and print out the tickets. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s great. If you&#039;re there, you might as well walk across Szabadsag ter. Check out the monument to the Soviet liberators of Budapest, the statues of Reagan and H.W. Bush, the old stock exchange (on your right), and the fortress-like US embassy (on your left). At the opposite end of the square, there&#039;s a memorial to the German occupation of Hungary. You can then continue ~200 meters along Oktober 6 street, pass by George Soros&#039;s university, and you&#039;ll soon be able to see the square in front of Saint Steven&#039;s Basilica. The basilica is pretty cool, but it&#039;s expensive to tour. There are a bunch of tourist trap restaurants in that area, but, if you&#039;re there around lunch time, I recommend hummusbar on Oktober 6.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zwach</span><br>Zwack is the distillery.

The point isn&#039;t MSA or English or French, but the &quot;redneck dialects&quot; you&#039;re talking about. That&#039;s the one people SPEAK and THINK with. They&#039;re languages Their existence predates certain modern European languages. It is deliberately under-developed because of political reasons. Which in turn forces everyone in the country, leaders included, to speak in an overly-simplified, orally-based doublespeak, which in turn impacts the way you think and view things. <br><br>&quot;Just speak French or English bro&quot; isn&#039;t enough. 99.99% of the population will never reach a level of fluency akin to the language you were raised with. Managerially speaking, it will always be far more efficient to speak your local language, and just switch to English when stuff gets techincal... Which is what literally every country does. It would be counter-productive wouldn&#039;t tell to tell Swedes to drop their own written language and focus on English. <br><br>In terms of workload, it would just mean that instead of studying French, MSA and English, you&#039;ll just drop the french and learn your &quot;&quot;dialect&quot;&quot; instead. French is obsolete as a lingua franca or as the language of intellectuals for the same reason MSA is, except MSA takes precedence for obvious religious reasons.

Probably a meme story on /trv. I went through a long list of terrible life events, both by my own fault and out of my control.

My apartment lease was up and I moved my stuff to storage, decided to go to Japan for a few months and maybe end it afterwards or along the way.

Used her as a tour guide and went to a love hotel a few times. It was casual and I met another girl, who was clingy and (I soon discovered) crazy. Met another. Made friends with Japanese guys and girls (and some expats) and developed a social circle - which didn&#039;t last longer than my trip, but amazed me by how easy it was when I wasn&#039;t wrapped up in my own head. <br>Decided that life really wasn&#039;t so bad, at least as long as it stayed interesting. And decided not to kill myself and instead looked for ways to earn a living remotely. Applied for jobs until I got one.<br>In my opinion, the destination I chose was irrelevant.

But you will like pay out of the nose for the experience since many of the rich globetrotters likely love it as well, driving up prices just like with top Broadway productions.", "time": 1671216726, "resto": 2365767}, {"no": 2373939, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:40:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Favs:<br><br>Hong Kong:<br><br>Skyscrapers, hiking trails, hill views, easy coom, the food was amazing and cheap in the local places, interesting history and culture, every neighborhood has it&#039;s own vibe and story. crazy public transportation, rice fields, anything for everyone really whether you&#039;re an anxious pussy who wants a safe trip or someone who wants to try the local life<br><br>Berlin:<br><br>History, poverty / gang tourism (I like to see uglier parts of a city), international food, lots of asian sluts throwing themselves at you, crazy nightlife, easy drug scoring, interesting people<br><br>Manila:<br>insane coom (woke up to 300+ notifications), poverty tourism, great nightlife, manila bay is gorgeous, very cheap luxury hotels with bay views<br><br>Worst:<br><br>Amsterdam:<br><br>I am sure this is going to be a shock to all the virtual travellers in here but it&#039;s a seriously boring city.

Basically it&#039;s an old railway tunnel that is now a walking/cycling path. It quite long and it&#039;s always pretty cold inside, even during the summer.

It&#039;s a very, very classical English village. There&#039;s a pretty church and a cemetery. Then continue along towards Dundas Aqueduct. There the Bath canal crossed river Avon. There&#039;s also a railroad underneath and it&#039;s a good spot if you&#039;re into trainspotting. You can&#039;t miss it, it looks bigger than any of the photos in person. There you have the option to go to either Bradford on Avon as signed off with teal for a daytrip. There&#039;s another aqueduct on the way there, albeit it is less impressive. It gets more wooded after Dundas going towards Bradford, so if that is your jam you&#039;ll like it. Otherwise follow the blue line, along the canal, to go back to Bath. It&#039;s a very, very nice cycling trip all around. You&#039;re mostly following level ground too as you go directly under the hills in the first stage and then circumvent them going back.<br><br>Best done on a sunny day for full kino.

On that device you&#039;d use a VPN (preferably to a friend&#039;s home network in your home country, but maybe ExpressVPN will work for you since many of their exit nodes are partnered with local ISPs). Then you connect your work laptop to that router/gateway device. Your work laptop connects to the company VPN and your company VPN sees it coming from the personal/ExpressVPN address your router/gateway is using. If you do this route, you need a router/gateway that with a killswitch that will completely drop your internet interface if the VPN drops.<br>I think your big problem is having flaky work software that require you to bring the laptop to the office to fix.

International roaming depends on your carrier&#039;s agreement with some local carrier to provide you service in order to work. So when you try to log in, it&#039;ll show that country&#039;s location. <br><br>And it&#039;s not a guarantee you&#039;ll be able to get 5G wherever you go. Even in Europe.

This means banks and security work are probably a no-go for you (though there are surely exceptions). You should be looking for a new job constantly anyway, so that your compensation is as high as it can be. <br><br>Many companies won&#039;t allow you to work from abroad, if only to save themselves the tax and legal troubles they would have to figure out in another country.

You can have the same experience much better else where and although Thailand and Bali are &quot;party places&quot; you don&#039;t have to party, there&#039;s plenty of spots in both countries that are chilled out and quiet.

But the popular trails in those parks are basically a conga line of people, it&#039;s very off putting and also annoying having to or being unable to pass people. Meanwhile in Yellowstone the main attractions are never far from the road, usually on a boardwalk or paved path so it doesn&#039;t really feel like I&#039;m going out into the wild and other people being around doesn&#039;t bother me.

For me, &quot;the fear&quot; is that the person I bought from or the people I shared with / sold to are actually cops / informers, and I&#039;m going to be arrested. I was a small time drug dealer when I was young, have been to jail, and a couple of my friends did federal time (as a result of an informer) in the US.

If you know locals they can show you private beaches. Plenty of seafood, the local dish is clam showder. The stores have fresh lobster in them if you want to cook yourself. Whale watching is the major summer activity, whales are really cool. Please try local ice cream, bagels with cream cheese, and clam chowder. If you go out there&#039;s a renaissance fair each year, King Richard&#039;s fair. If you want fresh apples or pumpkins hit up the orchards or pumpkin patches come autumn. Cranberries are a local product so get cranberry juice, and in the winter the bogs freeze over and you can skate on them. And if you go up to Boston, try to museum of science, and the duck boats.

However, rental prices in Mumbai are significantly more expensive than elsewhere in India. You&#039;ll pay more and get less than you would in Delhi or Bangalore. However, an Rs. 60,000 housing stipend should be sufficient alone to rent a reasonably comfortable apartment. <br><br>If you&#039;re staying or working in a more central area, paying an additional $200-300 out-of-pocket should net you a spacious, modern property. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How easy is it to travel to other parts of India from Mumbai? </span><br>Mumbai is a Tier-1 city and Alpha global city. It has an international airport with flights across the country. You can also take the train to most places. There are regular buses--across a variety of budgets--running to other cities in Maharashtra, Goa, and so forth. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And how easy is it to make friends/date as a Westerner?</span><br>Completely depends on you. Making friends in India is reasonably easy. However, the sorts of people who are most likely to approach you in the street will be interested in you because you&#039;re &quot;different.&quot; You can sometimes meet decent people this way, but you might not have anything in common. Furthermore, they might simply want to show you off as their &quot;cool foreign friend.&quot;<br><br>Dating is a slightly different story. Living in India longer-term makes dating easier, especially if you&#039;re looking for something serious--many women won&#039;t want to go out with someone who&#039;s only here for a few weeks or a few months. <br><br>Other than that, well--it completely fucking depends on you. You can certainly find White fetishists in a city like Mumbai--girls who only date White men, and will sleep with any reasonably attractive foreigner. They&#039;re a very small percentage of the overall population, but if you look half-decent, they&#039;ll proactively seek you on dating apps. <br><br>I met some of these women when I was single, and they are fucking insufferable.

You can&#039;t just &quot;visit&quot; a Naxalite camp. Outside of a scarce few areas, the Maoists do not maintain any permanent military outposts. During the monsoon, they usually entrench themselves in sympathetic villages that cannot be easily accessed by outsiders, including the Indian security forces. For the rest of the year, and especially in the winter, they camp in rugged jungles during the day and then move into hamlets for provisions and support at night. <br><br>While the Naxalites do have something akin to a &quot;parallel government&quot; in parts of Dandakaranya--do a Google search for &quot;Abujmarh&quot;--outsiders cannot simply stroll in for a tour.

However, the early Naxalite movement was effectively curbed before and during the political Emergency of the 1970s. During this period, many Naxal sympathizers and cadres were arrested, imprisoned, or summarily executed. <br><br>While the initial movement was waning in Bengal, hardcore Maoist sympathizers began actively surveying other regions for the location of a potential &quot;guerrilla base.&quot; So far as I can recall, in Maoist war strategy, a guerilla base is an isolated, inaccessible area, from which militants can amass strength and began waging a protracted war of attrition against the urban, industrial state. <br><br>Since many early Naxalite cadres were Telugu speakers, they began making inroads into isolated tribal communities in East-Central India. The Gonds, for example, are among the largest tribes in the region; their language doesn&#039;t have any widely-used written alphabet. However, since Gondi is somewhat similar to Telugu, the Telugu-speaking cadres were able to gradually learn the language and begin &quot;fixing&quot; certain problems relating to corruption and resource exploitation. <br><br>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Naxalites began establishing a significant presence in the historical Dandakaranya region. Much of this region has been neglected by governments for hundreds of years, from the Mughals to the Raj to the early, post-Independence administrations. <br><br>Today, the Maoists find the most support among tribal people--people who might not understand or care about the Maoists&#039; ideological values, but believe that their lifestyles and cultures are being threatened by the state.", "time": 1674717905, "resto": 2378371}, {"no": 2396779, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)02:31:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2396777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396777</a><br>cont. <br>For context, the most heavily-affected regions, in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, are incredibly rich in mineral resources.

Paris is now kind of a dump, it used to be great. Many of the places that were awesome because they were \u201cuntouched\u201d are now flooded with tourists. Still a great country for tourism generally speaking but equal to tons of other places in Europe. There are also places that are in fact cheaper and just as good. If it continues its downward spiral it will be in the bottom half of Europe destinations before 2030, but you still hear people talk like it\u2019s still top tier.

The point of watching that kind of content isn\u2019t to practice reading lines, it\u2019s to understand context, phrasing, colloquialisms and conversational flow.<br><br>I also subscribed to new channels on YouTube like el pais and bbc mondo. I listen to a shitload of music with spanish lyrics, not only does it help with vocabulary, but native speaking\u2019s think it\u2019s crazy when you can recite the lyrics to a banda song or even know about a group like hombres G.
