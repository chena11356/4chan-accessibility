Then you went on telling that you couldn&#039;t pull for shit. Now we&#039;re getting somewhere, because we now have a realistic metric of what you&#039;re actually capable of fucking. And so I gave you the realistic answer of &quot;You probably won&#039;t fuck more than in Japan&quot;. It&#039;s not hostility, just frustration at seeing that my theory was proven true, i.e you&#039;re not really that attractive, you&#039;re just an average dude who has trouble getting actual dates in Asia. And had you told that right off the bat, you would have reasonable, realistic answers about your chances from the start.<br><br>My advice to you is to maybe stick with those 6 months in Japan, that you can spend learning Japanese and looking for TEFL work that might possibly give you a visa (consider JPLT). If you want actual conversational skills and social circles which will in turn be your best ally to find a relationship, you have to stop going everywhere and anywhere for a while. It will also help you understand the Japanese mindset deeper, which will in turn help with the dating also.", "time": 1670855128, "resto": 2370937}, {"no": 2371652, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:51:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2371637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2371637</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now your saving grace is that they might think you&#039;re saying this so you don&#039;t make them look like they&#039;re the 100th slut on your hunting board, so it&#039;s all good.</span><br>Oh, this was a conversation between guys.

I mentioned this in a previous thread but I think the biggest thing that Wizarding World fucking nails is the wish fulfillment aspect. HP has a rabid fanbase that wishes they got their Hogwarts invitations and shit, and now they can pretend they actually did and do all the things they dreamed of when reading the books/watching the movies. There&#039;s personal stakes there. I remember there was talk about Epic Universe a while back and someone was wondering why they decided to go for a How to Train Your Dragon-themed land when Dreamworks has so many different IPs they could use, why limit it to just that one. It&#039;s the same thing. You could argue Shrek is by far the most famous and well-known Dreamworks property, but people aren&#039;t wishing they could live in the swamp or hang out with these fairy tale weirdoes. They like it as a movie and that&#039;s it. HTTYD is not only probably the most critically well regarded franchise they have, but it also has a big core fanbase like HP (albeit not as huge), but it most importantly fulfills that wish fulfillment aspect. The dragons in the movies (especially Toothless) are lovable and cute and make people want them, but also literally everyone has dreamed about flying at some point in their lives. Being able to fly on the back of a dragon is just such a simple idea that hits an extremely large group of people. I think that&#039;s one of the big reasons people love Flight of Passage despite the fact people are mostly lukewarm on the Avatar franchise.", "time": 1671280677, "resto": 2361815}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2371380, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)21:15:31", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Israel - Tel Aviv", "com": "How is travelling to Israel?

Open brothel district where you can see all the girls sitting at the front of their shops, and you pick one and go.

Matsushima Shinchi, also in Osaka, is the same, but there are fewer shops, and the quality of the girls isn&#039;t at the same level. Tobita&#039;s level of girls is super high; some are idol- and model-tier and would be the kind of girls you see at luxury/high-end soaplands. Tobita is by far my favorite if you&#039;re mainly concerned about looks and want to get the prettiest and cutest girl possible without risking getting baited by photoshopped/old pics (soaplands are notorious for this). Service can feel a little distant because they&#039;re so pretty and in high demand, but some of the best fucks I&#039;ve had were a matter of finding the right girl. And going at nighttime with all the lights and just seeing a huge variety of girls (little loli type, slutty gyaru, shrine maiden outfits, nurses, kimonos) is intoxicating.<br><br>Soaplands are better if you want to have more time and a less rushed experience, but the quality of girls can vary a lot, and you have to pay top dollar to fuck the prettiest ones. A bit more Japanese is necessary to enter and to schedule things, but it can be done. Yoshiwara in Tokyo is probably your best bet as a foreigner, and that place is kind of well-known for having girls that do NS (No Skin) and NN (Nakadashi), so raw sex is possible, although that might not be an option for you if they&#039;re wary about you because you&#039;re a foreigner.<br><br>Delivery/Hotel Health where girls are delivered to your selected love hotel is good and can be priced fairly, but you&#039;re paying for the love hotel.

Pic related<br>Not too far from the Chocolate Hills there&#039;s something called Pangas Falls.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also places for food/entertainment, I will try anything.</span><br>In Cebu City, check out 8flix &amp; Chill. There they serve Tuslob Buwa. To spoil it for you, it&#039;s basically pork brain mixed with chili, onion and onions sauce. It turns into a gravy which you dip &quot;puso&quot;, or rice balls in. As disgusting as it might sound to most, it&#039;s actually really good. Imagine dipping bread in a buttery gravy full of umami. That&#039;s pretty much what it is. It&#039;s dirt cheap too, $4 for 10 piece of rice balls and unlimited gravy.<br>Top of Cebu is another nice restaurant to check out. <br><br>In Bohol, Mist is a cool interesting restaurant made in the vernacular style. Molly Bistro is similar, though they primarily serve a Filipino/Viet BBQ fusion.<br>Bamboo place is usually where the nightlife is in Alona/Tawala.<br>Be on the lookout for Beefarm Ice cream along Alona Beach. Really delicious. And on that topic, The Buzzz Cafe is pretty nice. Check out Halang Halang, a Bisaya soup similar to Tom Kha Gai.<br><br>If you go to Balicasag, don&#039;t fucking eat anything there. I am an advocate for promoting Filipino food and even I found the food there very mediocre. Also it&#039;s a ripoff, $10 for a single plate of an awful meal. If they still sell barbecue in Virgin Island, I suggest you to avoid the touts.

If you see a van, bus or any big car approaching you fast, steer to the right shoulder to let them pass. These drivers have no brains, but you don&#039;t want them to harm you either.<br>Before you rent a bike, check that both the front and rear brakes are good, that means you shouldn&#039;t have to squeeze/press them too hard to actually stop. Check for air in the tyres, they should be rock hard.<br>Ask the renters to check oil.<br>Honk whenever you are passing someone, or think someone who is at perpendicular interchange haven&#039;t seen.

Probably a meme story on /trv. I went through a long list of terrible life events, both by my own fault and out of my control.

My apartment lease was up and I moved my stuff to storage, decided to go to Japan for a few months and maybe end it afterwards or along the way.

Used her as a tour guide and went to a love hotel a few times. It was casual and I met another girl, who was clingy and (I soon discovered) crazy. Met another. Made friends with Japanese guys and girls (and some expats) and developed a social circle - which didn&#039;t last longer than my trip, but amazed me by how easy it was when I wasn&#039;t wrapped up in my own head. <br>Decided that life really wasn&#039;t so bad, at least as long as it stayed interesting.

Big, cosmopolitan and international, modern yet loads of incredibly beautiful streets and neighbourhoods.

I took a few trips but honestly found the country to be pretty boring and uninteresting, and I didn&#039;t really have time to travel anyways. So I just decided to save money and spend it elsewhere. My only real expense was groceries and the occasional night out, so it was easy to save ~$1800 a month. I just sent my whole salary home every month and barely touched it.<br><br>After that I went to work in Vietnam. Got a job teaching at a good language center since I had IELTS experience from my certification. Initially took a pay hit, but the hourly rate was way higher and I didn&#039;t have to work as much. Plus cheaper cost of living. Once I got my hours up to around 20-25 I was making more than Korea. And since your employer doesn&#039;t own your visa like in Korea you can hustle if you want for extra cash. Saved about $1500 a month maybe since I traveled a lot more and had to pay rent. <br><br>Now I work at a private school in Thailand making about the same as Vietnam, but with more work since I&#039;m salaried and have to be at school all day. I like the routine better though since I hate hourly work with timetabling and subbing and all that other bullshit. Probably going to stay here for a bit then try to get a scholarship for an MA TESOL or diploma or something. We&#039;ll see.<br><br>Anyways on a TEFL salary spending vs. saving is really just a lifestyle. I&#039;m frugal I guess but I&#039;m not miserly. I spend a lot when I&#039;m in vacation mode, but I only really travel to cheap locations. Last vacation was to India for a month where I spent maybe $2000. Most of my hobbies are cheap and I don&#039;t splurge when I go out.

However, this isn&#039;t always the case - there are many jobs that will expect you to make your own lessons and deliver them without assistance.

It would be better to do the course and find out that TEFL is not for you, than to fly to another country to work and discover it there.<br><br>Of course, you should keep in mind that you can always quit a job. In the worst case scenario where you are miserable/depressed in a foreign country, you can just head to the airport and get on the first flight home.

But there are many examples of such teachers being employed elsewhere in Asia, though they are litteral wageslaves without any legal rights. They can be deported when the school doesnt need them anymore. <br>And salaries in Laos and Cambo are low, because those countries are undeveloped and being heavily invested into by China. Lots of construction is going on there. It means there is some potential for future development yet local population is still poor as fuck. <br>And no school would provide you with housing. Its not China. There are schools providing a shitty room in the campus. Thats it. Food is possible, at least Viet and Thai schools provide lunches. <br>Teaching in Laos is mostly voluntary job for either backpackers or opioid addicts. Are you one of them? Are you ready to be transported to Bkk by helicopter in case you break your leg or get seriously sick? Lao hospitals are for military, if you want to get treated, you have to order a helicopter. <br>Anyway, are you ready to live and work in Laos for 500-600 dollars a month? Paid in lao kips. And there would be almost no carreer development in this field because you lack that fucking degree. <br>If you are willing to do it, maybe i can help you to get employed, but competition is fierce even in Laos. Farangs are everywhere and they want to eat and live comfortable lives. <br>Have you got a teaching certificate? What about vaccine certificate? Whats your citizenship and race? They do want white snowflackes. They do prohibit their white monkeys to get tanned. This is Asia. <br>In conclusion, you may expect 500-600 dollars in Laos or Cambo, without housing alowance, without any expenses, maybe even without health insurance.

For the majority of people, working in either country is basically volunteering and earning enough to cover your expenses and live okay by local standards - i.e. not enough for your flights. There are decent jobs but you will need a degree for them. When I worked in Cambodia, I was at a university in the countryside and got just over $1000/month. It was a cushy gig but there are maybe 20 jobs like that in the entire country. The majority of English teachers are backpackers or retirees who wound up in the country and earn $500/month. To get those jobs you just need to be in the country.<br>It&#039;s similar in Laos - there&#039;s a handful of good jobs in Vientiane, but they aren&#039;t hiring people without degrees and experience. A big difference from Cambodia is the government doesn&#039;t make it easy for backpackers to get hired. Most English teachers in Laos are more likely to be with volunteer agencies and NGOs than anything else.<br>Having said all of that, you could lie about your degrees and experience, but you&#039;d have to be pretty convincing to get through the interviews. I&#039;d say most of these positions are filled by referrals.<br>And that part about needing to be snowflake white is just hyperbole.

We try to take long trips when we are doing big life changes. ie: moving to a new city. While everything is packed up on boxes, you might as well just store it and go.

You don&#039;t lose your job because you are already going to quit when moving between cities. <br><br>I plan these big ones years in advance and save diligently for them, where we go has a huge impact.

Otherwise, most of our time is spent in cheap places like Turkey, Kazakhstan, Basic Bitch SEA (Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia), Philippines, and Indonesia.

Each time, I called Chase and spent hours speaking with various members of their team.

But they do have a tricky task to perform, determining within milliseconds whether any one of a billion-plus transactions a day should be disallowed, especially considering the near-total protection they offer consumers against fraudulent use of their cards. Complicating matters further for American issuers, our credit cards can generally be used without four-digit PINs, unlike cards in many countries. The Belgian researchers could not say for sure, but they told me it was reasonable to assume that, all other things being equal, a transaction with a PIN code would be less likely to be flagged for fraud than one without.<br><br>\u201cWe look at a multitude of factors when making a decision to block a transaction for potential fraud,\u201d Mr. Lussier, the Chase spokesman, told me.

Also, travel with multiple cards. I\u2019d add you might even want to bring three, if you have them \u2014 two to carry, and one, perhaps an A.T.M./debit card, to leave in the hotel for emergencies.

However, it&#039;s a fantastic place to visit if you have some patience and aren&#039;t expecting anything other than a typical third-world country with typical third-world country inconveniences. All things considered, people tend to be friendly and welcoming. <br><br>Everything that people say about touts and scams is true, but it&#039;s also completely overblown. I&#039;ve traveled extensively across most parts of India, and I&#039;ve found that these sorts of hassles are borderline nonexistent outside a scarce handful of areas. For example, you&#039;ll be almost constantly bothered by travel agency touts in places like Delhi&#039;s Paharganj neighborhood, the Pink City in Jaipur, and anywhere within shooting distance of the Taj Mahal. However, other parts of the same cities--especially those that see few foreign tourists--are comparably tame, and you can explore without having to worry about strangers&#039; poor intentions. <br><br>People in more rural areas will either be quasi-autistically excited to see you or ignore you altogether (although they&#039;re usually very friendly if you speak some of their language and say hello). <br><br>IMO, a lot of India&#039;s so-called travails can be avoided by simply doing your best to blend in and look confident. I&#039;ve spent so much fucking time here that I can speak Hindi and two other Indian languages reasonably well. I&#039;m as White as they come, but a lot of people--somehow--assume that I&#039;m either Indian or Anglo-Indian (i.e., my family stayed here after the British Raj came to an end). Literally nobody bothers me when I travel by myself. This isn&#039;t because I&#039;m special, it&#039;s just because I look comfortable in my surroundings.

Varkala is absolutely worth a stop for a few days. It&#039;s just a spectacular natural environment that I&#039;ve never seen anywhere else. The cliff is fun with a lot of restaurants and shops. You can go kayaking or boating in the lakes, and there&#039;s some other stuff to do nearby like Jatayu rock. You&#039;ll definitely have to rent a scooter though.<br><br>Allepey/Kumarakom are quite famous as well and for good reason. The backwaters are beautiful and there are a lot of nice resorts along the lake. There&#039;s a bird sanctuary nearby that&#039;s worth seeing if you like nature walks. You can also stay in the villages around Kottayam if you want a more &quot;authentic&quot; experience away from the tourist spots. Aymanam has a lot of pretty homestays/farmstays and you can just bike around the villages. Honestly this was the highlight of the trip for me; walking around backwater towns at sunset, crossing rickety homemade bridges, kids herding goats in the street, families performing their nightly prayers etc... Really cool experience.<br><br>There are some nice beaches in Mararikulam, and also Cherai which is up near Kochi.

I would suck it up and pay for a taxi because the buses are not safe. Really beautiful area though, especially post-monsoon where spices and coffee grow like weeds and the waterfalls are in full flood. We went to Periyar National Park which was pretty cool. They have a lot of activities like bamboo rafting and night walks, but it&#039;s pretty expensive and you can&#039;t just wander around on your own so plan ahead if you want to go there. And as with most parks don&#039;t expect to see any animals besides deer and birds. It&#039;s also infested with leeches which the reviews don&#039;t mention lmao. The town of Kumily is pretty boring though so just go to the park and head out.<br><br>Munnar is another really popular hillstation in the Western Ghats. It is absolutely worth seeing but DO NOT STAY IN MUNNAR. The city is an overcrowded disaster and you will be miserable. Stay nearby in Idukki which is within driving distance and much quieter and calmer. Usually in Munnar people just rent a car or jeep and hit all the tourist spots. You can do this over two days since there are some really cool places in Idukki too. Most of the attractions here are tea plantations, waterfalls, dams, lakes, and viewpoints. Do some research and avoid the tourist traps like Top Station. Eravikulam National Park is here and it was...okay. You take a terrifying bus ride up to a winding mountain path. There are some goats and pretty scenery and a cafe and small museum. You walk around a bit and then you leave. Like the beaches most of the mountain tourism is really seasonal. If you go after the monsoon it will be lush and verdant but probably overcast and drizzly.

Expect everything to taste like coconut lol. The coastal areas are of course famous for seafood, so try to eat your fill because it really is some of the best I&#039;ve had in the world. Any tourist areas will be full of North Indian and western restaurants also so you can eat whatever you&#039;d like. Breakfast will just be idly, puttu and dosa pretty much everywhere, which gets old after about one day. I really fucking hate puttu but I kept giving it a chance at each new place I stayed. Shoulda just asked for eggs or something.<br><br>English is pretty ubiquitous but the accent incredibly thick and hard to understand (imo). Anyone working in hospitality/service will speak Hindi as well, and if your girlfriend speaks Malayalam you&#039;ll have no issues. <br><br>Toddy is worth a try if you&#039;ve never had it before. Toddy shops can be kinda fun if you wanna chit the chat with the locals. There&#039;s also some weird fucking wines in the mountains, like cashew wine and nutmeg wine. <br><br>Anyways, we stayed for I think six weeks and I felt like we saw most of what I wanted to see in the state.

There aren&#039;t even many public buses that run from major cities to the hill stations desu (and the ones that do exist are at odd hours), so your only options are taxis and private buses. Buses are really unsafe especially around the monsoon; idk if you&#039;ve ever been to the mountainous regions of India but people drive like fucking maniacs and there are one lane roads with hairpin turns and no guardrails. Me and my girlfriend actually missed a bus from Munnar to Kochi and we were really pissed because we had to stay an extra day at our accommodation. Literally three hours later our AirBNB host called to tell us that that exact same bus drove off a cliff and a bunch of people died.

DO NOT trust people on the street trying to sell you shit......best case scenario, they&#039;ll sell you a half gram of dirt weed for 20-30 dollars, medium case scenario they&#039;ll run off with the money, worst case they&#039;ll try to set your ass up<br><br>Another thing to consider if you do manage to score some weed is where are you gonna smoke it? Most likely your gonna be staying in a hotel or condo, and many of those are non smoking. Forget about smoking on the street.....Filipinos are notoriously NOSEY and will inquire as to what your doing at any and all times. Even weak bud.... it stinks and .the smell wafts and lingers..... and theirs always at least 38 guards in any given hotel or condo snooping around. I really would only suggest smoking if you had a private house that your gonna be staying in for a while so you can remove the smell before you move out<br><br>Lastly , if you do ever get involved in drugs here, even if it just smoking pot for recreation NEVER EVER EVER tell anyone you use drugs. You keep that between whoever you buy it from and yourself. Never let whoever you buy from know where you are staying.....tell him you are staying in caloocan when really you stay in pasay, use an alias and/or a fake facebook account. DO NOT offer drugs to your bitches, they can and will use it against you if you have a fight....they can easily snitch and get you deported", "time": 1670227240, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368056, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)03:17:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368024</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marrying a flip</span><br>Pathetic.", "time": 1670228254, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368057, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)03:18:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368053</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all</span><br>True story.....I met a younger whiteboy from Michigan at 7/11 like 3 years ago.

Lots of foreigners here. Split between 2 beaches....White Beach and Panagsama. White beach is more suitable to swimming as its less rocky, but you&#039;ll have less choice of accomidation and they will be of lower quality. Panagsama beach is a bit more rocky, but they have better accommodation/food choices there. It&#039;s one of the few places in the province that has some semblance of a nightlife. Chili bar is nice during sunset, and they used to have a disco that had lots of beautiful women in there, both pinay and foreign, but I&#039;m not sure if it survived the pandemic.

Today&#039;s topic is MALLS. I know I know.....many of you despise malls because you&#039;re coming from America/Europe/Australia and the malls there are dead at best, and souless centers of consumerism at worst...but hear me out. Malls in the Philippines serve many functions. MOST (not all.....all you conyo Filipinos shut the fuck up, sit down and listen) Filipinos can&#039;t actually afford anything in the larger malls. They go there because it&#039;s one of the few places they can get free aircon/wifi, people watch, window shop, variety of foods etc. They are some of the cleanest and best maintained places in the Philippines. This being said, these are some of the most densely populated places, and if your mission is hunting for a girl/boy/ladyboy WHATEVER, these are great places and must not be overlooked. Not only do malls provide traditional shopping, but they provide fianancial services (money transfers.....western union, money gram etc), and package delivery (DHL, UPS etc), along with being transportaion hubs for public utility vehichles (PUVS). This combination insures these places are always filled with people from opening to close. <br><br>I will share every mall in Cebu city proper with a brief description. Firstly, their are tiers of malls, and you will find a different type of person depending on the tier. <br>1. Ayala malls<br>2. Sm malls<br>3.Robinsons<br>4. Gaisano <br>5. Random shit.

Ayala Center: This is the best mall in cebu city. Centrally located in the buisness district and equipped with a beautiful courtyard. Their are many nice hotels situated within walking distance to this malls. Freelance hookers can be found prowling, especially around bo&#039;s coffee, tgiFridays, and the Social (bar/lounge located on the top level.....infamous for foreigner hunters). Many food options here ranging from classic Filipino, to Greek. They have a cinema if going to the movies is your thing. Must visit if in Cebu city. <br><br>2. SM CITY: Oldest major mall (I think) in Cebu. Located on Ouano avenue (a main artery of Cebu). Every person will know how to get here by instinct, I would consider this as the proverbial heart of Cebu. The Radisson blu is connected to the mall (nicer hotel with great lobby), and the bayfront hotel is across the street (midrange hotel). The mall itself is showing it&#039;s age. They have a bowling alley and cinema for entertaining your family.<br><br>3. SM Seaside: Newest major mall situated on the main road leading out of Cebu City. It&#039;s also connected to the newly constructed bridge (CCLEX), so it&#039;s the closet major mall to those living/staying in LapuLapu city/Cordova. Nice complex with a kino roof area/lounge. Seaside has a cinema and a ice skating rink. The cebu ocean park is also connected to the mall......an okay aquarium by international standards, but with a nice restaurant attached.....kino views and very instagramable for your girlfriend.", "time": 1670340331, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368785, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)10:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368769</a><br>4. Robinsons Galleria: Located just up the road from SM City. Has a decent hotel attached to the complex (summit galleria) . Has a tgifridays AND denny&#039;s (many memories of drunken fights at 3am in my local dennys in Miami.....here in the Philippines its a &quot;classy&quot; resturant LOOOL). <br><br>5. Robinsons Fuente: Located in Osmena circle, right up the street from the infamous mango square. On the first floor, theirs a vendor who sells &quot;TOBACCO&quot; pipes and rolling papers.....other than that it&#039;s not much in there except your standard fastfood and grocery store. <br><br>6. Parkmall: Located in Mandaue adjacent to BAI hotel. Mixed indoor/outdoor mall with a grocery store and lots of food options. Major transportation hub for PUV&#039;s. Good people watching in the afternoon for a more local flavor<br><br>7. City Times square: This can be considered part of parkmall as it right across the street. Outdoor stripmall type......has a few good bars and restaurants attached. Queensland hotel is here as well, for all your short time boomboom needs. <br><br>8. Pacific mall MANDAUE: Located just off the bridge coming from lapulapu city. Medium sized mall with your standard Jolibee/chowking offerings. Transportation hub for those headed into the northern suburbs of cebu <br><br>9. J Centre Mall (Jmall): Medium sized mall located in Mandaue. Most notable feature is their Bureau of Immigration office. If you live here as a foreigner for a while you will need to come here eventually. Decent hotel attached, and a nice bar (SENTRAL) located 1 minute walk away. <br><br>10. Elizabeth mall (Emall): Located adjacent to the south bus terminal. Smaller mall. Has a ghetto public school (ACT) attached, good place to people watch. For some reason I see ALOT of Africans in this mall, I can&#039;t fucking explain it, but I&#039;m working on figuring it out.", "time": 1670341983, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2369016, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:22:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368785</a><br>11. Ayala Central Block: Newer mall situated in IT park across the street from the park social and sugbu mercado. Lots of call center people open to foreigners around this area. Make sure to tell your driver AYALA in IT PARK, because if you just say &quot;Ayala&quot; they will take you to the Ayala center for sure.<br>12. JY Centre: Smaller mall in the Lahug neighborhood with a few food options, and a Mcdonalds for the Amerimutts. This is mainly used a jump off point for those going up into the mountains to see the TOPS viewpoint. Lots of motortaxi drivers will hang out here and try to take you up the mountain on a tour<br><br>13. Gaisano country mall: Outdoor Shopping area located in Mandaue. I&#039;ve driven by this many times but never went in, so I can&#039;t really report as to what&#039;s there, but it IS THERE. <br><br>14. Gaisano Main/138 mall/Colonade: I&#039;ve included these all together as they are in the same general vicinity (walking distance). All three of these are on, or very near to Colon street. Most Gaisano &quot;malls&quot; are not really malls so to speak, but more like big department stores. 138 and colonade sell a bunch of cheap knockoff shit from China, but theirs some good looking girls in there I&#039;LL TELL YOU WHATTTTT<br><br>15.Gaisano Tisa/Gaisano jai alai/Gaisano mandaue central/Gaisano mandaue north: YEA theirs like 10 of these things in the greater Cebu area, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some, so cebuBros correct me if I&#039;m missing anything. These are more ghetto malls, your gonna see lots of flip flops, basketball shorts, knockoff basketball jerseys, and ankle bracelets.

SM Consalacion: Smaller Sm mall located on the northern outskirts of Cebu. Kind of out the way if your staying in the city center, but it&#039;s the last stop before you start heading into the northern provinces. <br><br>17. Marina Mall: Located in LapuLapu city. This is mall in closet proximity to the airport. Standard jolibee/ chowking affair, nothing special. Their is another mall across the street (it&#039;s a gaisano mall), but as their is ANOTHER gaisano mall located a few meters down the road, I refer to both as Marina mall. The drivers have lived in the neighbnorhood their whole life and they still get the 2 malls mixed up, so just say Marina mall. <br><br>18. Gaisano Island mall: Located on lapu lapu a few meters from marina mall.....Known locally as Island mall. Theirs a beauru of immigration office inside, so if you live in lapulapu, its much more convient than going all the way into the city for your visa extensions. <br><br>19. Tamiya: This is an outdoor outlet style mall. On google maps, this is marked as &quot;THE SHOPS AT PUEBLO VERDE&quot;, or &quot;PUEBLO VERDE&quot;. If you tell a driver to take you to Pueblo verde, he will look at you like your stupid. For some reason everyone calls this area tamiya, you have to say tamiya or they won&#039;t know where the fuck you&#039;re talking about. I have many fond memories in Tamiya. Pre-pandemic they used to have a disco and a restobar in here, and I picked up quite a few girls just drinking in front of the 7/11 there (not hookers just horny young women). It&#039;s a bit more subdued now, but it&#039;s still a major transportation hub for LapuLapu city and they have several large factories nearby, so this place gets packed with people in the late afternoon. LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS who work in factories making 200 dollars a month praying and hoping you&#039;ll save them can be found in this area.

In the state of SP, Ilhabela. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, besides the capital, there&#039;s the colonial town of Paraty and Angra dos Reis, great places to spend some money chartering a boat (there&#039;s more than 365 islands in Angra dos Reis and places in Paraty like saco do mamangua and Ilha dos cocos; google it). Also Buzios and Petropolis if you\u2019re interested in Brazil\u2019s imperial past.<br>Some colonial towns in Minas Gerais, like Ouro Preto, might be nice for chilling for a few days. Lots of beaches in northeastern, although I think it&#039;s not worth it. Also, Len\u00e7ois Maranhenses, Jalap\u00e3o, Pantanal, and some jungle resort in the Amazon (you could spend 2 days in Manaus too). Oh, there&#039;s Salvador if you want to see a more African Brazil. I hate it actually.<br>People are usually very nice toward foreigners. In some touristic places, like Rio, people might try to rip you off. But normal people will treat you well. No difference for americans.

Don&#039;t wear watches and jewelry, avoid drawing attention, and use your phone inside stores. I mean, I have walked through S\u00e3o Paulo at 2 a.m. getting out of bars while drunk and nothing happened to me. That said, been raised here I\u2019m kinda streetsmart and also a bit lucky. You should be more careful. Kidnaps for the past decades have been really low, nothing to worry about. Murder has never been a problem desu. Not because it does not exist (it does happens a lot), but it actually about poor people killing poor people due to drugs and things related. It does not affect the middle class and would not affect you as a tourist. The problem is robbery attempts. Just be low profile and uber to places, specially at night. Oh, if you decide to rent a place instead of getting a hotel suite, rent a house in a gated community. <br>It would be better if you learn portuguese. As I\u2019ve said, most brazilians do not speak english. <br>Like USA, we\u2019ve received people from all over the world. Difference is that we had all permutations possible. So yes, there are hot women from every race and every mix between races. That said, when americans are not fat I would say that, in average, they look better. The top 5% brazilian women are very pretty though. The top 1% are gorgeous. But there are lots of differences between states, regions and social classes. Women here are also getting fatter (not many morbid obese though). But gym culture is also strong here, specially in Rio de Janeiro. Tl;dr I would say that women in eastern europe (russia, Poland, etc.) are the most beautiful if you sample random 1000 women from any country in the world.

The language is difficult, though, with no living relatives, so communication with about 70% of the population isn&#039;t necessarily easy, although you may meet guest workers who&#039;ve come back from Italy, Greece, or Germany, in that order, if you speak any of those, and lots of young people obviously study English. <br><br>Romania, still unable to get into Schengen, is quite civilized nowadays in the nice parts of Bucharest or Sibiu or Brasov or wherever... people also say nice things about Timisoara, but I&#039;ve never been there.

There are ATMs in LA where you can&#039;t go without a car because chance is almost guaranteed that you get robbed once you leave by foot. Also god damn hobos knocking on my car window at each traffic light. Not to mention that once someone broke the window of my rental car to steal my bag and camera. And that was at a small rural town in the nowhere.. a place where you wouldn&#039;t expect any crimes like that. All this never happens in Germany. You can park your car in any place and nothing gonna happen to it. You can take nightwalks which I would never do in the US.<br><br>And then you have school shootings, all the homeless, addicts and so on anywhere anytime. People in the US are crazy.

And remember that that airfare represents about how much money those cheapskates would spend in three days of their cheapskate hostel tourism where they eat mostly oatmeal or cereal(cheapest, quickest meal option), or spend time making more elaborate time consuming meals(and spend little time outside the hostel&#039;s kitchen). <br><br><a href=\"#p2371989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2371989</a><br>That poster isn&#039;t me. <br><br>---<br><br>In general I don&#039;t think tourists ever learn much about the countries they visit.

If a woman is willing to come to the place you designate it&#039;s a good step 1 for getting her into bed.<br><br>Occasionally did a dinner date when I wanted to try something new. Dinner is this big thing for Korean women and it can ge very involved if you do BBQ or anything with self cooking, but they enjoy it a lot and it puts them in a domestic mood if they are cooking meats and veggies for you then feeding it to you. <br><br>I experienced a couple women simply asking to come to my apartment, which I obliged. They were after foreigners like me, obviously. These women were not all that attractive, but who am I to turn down free no effort pussy?<br><br>Never used a condom once in Korea, and was never asked to. I did also experience a couple of women who were extremely demanding of an internal creampie, and spasmed and threw their heads back when I dropped my load in them, as if it was some sort of drug. Idk if just really good acting or what but they turned stupid for a few minutes and then completely lovey dovey after that so it seemed like a real good orgasm.

Objectively speaking there&#039;s little reason to go there when you could just stay in neighboring Europe instead and experience more natural beauty, history and culture virtually anywhere with a lot more comfort and less stress. Tunis is well-connected to Europe by cheap ferry lines though and Tunisia, despite all its problems, is a beginner-friendly country by African standards, so it was kind of a nobrainer for me to check it out.

I&#039;ve used black borders between states and dark grey borders between counties. Aside from this, there are no major changes to the map, but some islands have had their connecting lines redrawn to be attached to their proper county.

I&#039;ve prioritized location over form, so two neighbouring counties similar in size might look very different on the map, or an otherwise square county might look elongated, but they usually border each other where they should. Virginia, with its whopping 95 counties and 38 (!) independent cities, was particularly difficult. New Kent and Charles City for example are located next to each other on the map, despite being north-south of each other in real life. New York City is another case, where their five bouroughs also functions as counties, but they should be recognizable enough on the map. I was in doubt whether Richmond County (i.e. Staten Island) should be delineated by a black or grey border, I chose black since it&#039;s an island.

A square around it would probably be best, because as of now it looks like a subdivision of Haiti, but that creates a new problem with the rest of the USMOI, which should then have borders too, for consistency&#039;s sake. Problem is they&#039;re too spread out for a single square, and unlike for example the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, there isn&#039;t a larger territory that could have a square, with the rest of the smaller islands connected to that. Separating them isn&#039;t a good idea if you ask me. It&#039;s treated as a single territory, and most Real Travellers will be lucky to visit even one of them in their lifetime. They&#039;re uninhabited and mostly off limits to ordinary people, and separating them would also open the door for separating the aforementioned French southern islands.
