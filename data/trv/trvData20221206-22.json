Robinsons Galleria: Located just up the road from SM City. Has a decent hotel attached to the complex (summit galleria) . Has a tgifridays AND denny&#039;s (many memories of drunken fights at 3am in my local dennys in Miami.....here in the Philippines its a &quot;classy&quot; resturant LOOOL). <br><br>5. Robinsons Fuente: Located in Osmena circle, right up the street from the infamous mango square. On the first floor, theirs a vendor who sells &quot;TOBACCO&quot; pipes and rolling papers.....other than that it&#039;s not much in there except your standard fastfood and grocery store. <br><br>6. Parkmall: Located in Mandaue adjacent to BAI hotel. Mixed indoor/outdoor mall with a grocery store and lots of food options. Major transportation hub for PUV&#039;s. Good people watching in the afternoon for a more local flavor<br><br>7. City Times square: This can be considered part of parkmall as it right across the street. Outdoor stripmall type......has a few good bars and restaurants attached. Queensland hotel is here as well, for all your short time boomboom needs. <br><br>8. Pacific mall MANDAUE: Located just off the bridge coming from lapulapu city. Medium sized mall with your standard Jolibee/chowking offerings. Transportation hub for those headed into the northern suburbs of cebu <br><br>9. J Centre Mall (Jmall): Medium sized mall located in Mandaue. Most notable feature is their Bureau of Immigration office. If you live here as a foreigner for a while you will need to come here eventually. Decent hotel attached, and a nice bar (SENTRAL) located 1 minute walk away. <br><br>10. Elizabeth mall (Emall): Located adjacent to the south bus terminal. Smaller mall. Has a ghetto public school (ACT) attached, good place to people watch. For some reason I see ALOT of Africans in this mall, I can&#039;t fucking explain it, but I&#039;m working on figuring it out.", "time": 1670341983, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2369016, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:22:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368785</a><br>11. Ayala Central Block: Newer mall situated in IT park across the street from the park social and sugbu mercado. Lots of call center people open to foreigners around this area. Make sure to tell your driver AYALA in IT PARK, because if you just say &quot;Ayala&quot; they will take you to the Ayala center for sure.<br>12. JY Centre: Smaller mall in the Lahug neighborhood with a few food options, and a Mcdonalds for the Amerimutts. This is mainly used a jump off point for those going up into the mountains to see the TOPS viewpoint. Lots of motortaxi drivers will hang out here and try to take you up the mountain on a tour<br><br>13. Gaisano country mall: Outdoor Shopping area located in Mandaue. I&#039;ve driven by this many times but never went in, so I can&#039;t really report as to what&#039;s there, but it IS THERE. <br><br>14. Gaisano Main/138 mall/Colonade: I&#039;ve included these all together as they are in the same general vicinity (walking distance). All three of these are on, or very near to Colon street. Most Gaisano &quot;malls&quot; are not really malls so to speak, but more like big department stores. 138 and colonade sell a bunch of cheap knockoff shit from China, but theirs some good looking girls in there I&#039;LL TELL YOU WHATTTTT<br><br>15.Gaisano Tisa/Gaisano jai alai/Gaisano mandaue central/Gaisano mandaue north: YEA theirs like 10 of these things in the greater Cebu area, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some, so cebuBros correct me if I&#039;m missing anything. These are more ghetto malls, your gonna see lots of flip flops, basketball shorts, knockoff basketball jerseys, and ankle bracelets.

SM Consalacion: Smaller Sm mall located on the northern outskirts of Cebu. Kind of out the way if your staying in the city center, but it&#039;s the last stop before you start heading into the northern provinces. <br><br>17. Marina Mall: Located in LapuLapu city. This is mall in closet proximity to the airport. Standard jolibee/ chowking affair, nothing special. Their is another mall across the street (it&#039;s a gaisano mall), but as their is ANOTHER gaisano mall located a few meters down the road, I refer to both as Marina mall. The drivers have lived in the neighbnorhood their whole life and they still get the 2 malls mixed up, so just say Marina mall. <br><br>18. Gaisano Island mall: Located on lapu lapu a few meters from marina mall.....Known locally as Island mall. Theirs a beauru of immigration office inside, so if you live in lapulapu, its much more convient than going all the way into the city for your visa extensions. <br><br>19. Tamiya: This is an outdoor outlet style mall. On google maps, this is marked as &quot;THE SHOPS AT PUEBLO VERDE&quot;, or &quot;PUEBLO VERDE&quot;. If you tell a driver to take you to Pueblo verde, he will look at you like your stupid. For some reason everyone calls this area tamiya, you have to say tamiya or they won&#039;t know where the fuck you&#039;re talking about. I have many fond memories in Tamiya. Pre-pandemic they used to have a disco and a restobar in here, and I picked up quite a few girls just drinking in front of the 7/11 there (not hookers just horny young women). It&#039;s a bit more subdued now, but it&#039;s still a major transportation hub for LapuLapu city and they have several large factories nearby, so this place gets packed with people in the late afternoon. LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS who work in factories making 200 dollars a month praying and hoping you&#039;ll save them can be found in this area.

That said, its not a good place nowadays and since you&#039;ll go to Rio is not worth imho. There&#039;s Paranapiacaba, which may be nice for a local to take a look at village built by the english railworks in the XIX century but I also don&#039;t think is anything special for a foreign tourist. There&#039;s some trails in parque da cantareira, one of the biggest urban parks in the world. It can take half a day to do the longest one and since you like fitness stuff it may be worth to hike it. There&#039;s some nice views from the observatory. You could uber there from where you are or take the tube to the first station (northernmost) of the blue line and uber from there. <br>If you want to drive and leave the city, you could go to Campos do Jord\u00e3o, where there is also some hiking. This city is famous due to having a high altitude (brazilian standards) and used as a winter destination for paulistanos (people from the city of SP). Besides it I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any city worth visiting by the city itself.<br>I mean, you could hike in lots of places and do stuff like rafting in Brotas or go parachuting in Boituva. That&#039;s pretty much it, though.<br>Most of our countryside has nothing really interesting. We just go there to our country houses, to some festivities when we know locals from those cities or if we have some activity in mind. <br>Like I said before Ilhabela is very nice. But its a good place to spend some days, at least a weekend. Daytrip would be really tiresome. Paraty, a city between Rio and SP, is also very nice. Colonial buildings, nice islands, great for boating and with some /out/ stuff.

Australia is not so great for long distance train travel, we don&#039;t have high speed trains like Europe or Asia. So a simple trip from Sydney to Melbourne can take like 11 or 12 hours by train, whereas it takes 90 minutes in the air. For this reason most people fly, only poorfags or very elderly people take the train. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do some flights between capitals cost less than some trains/ferries?</span><br>Train and coach are usually cheap. But flights are reasonable because plenty of competition, lots of available seats and demand. Of course it also depends on the route and the time of the year. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are busses a better option than trains?</span><br>I&#039;ve never been interstate on train so I can&#039;t make a good comparison. But when I was a poorfag student I did go down to Melbourne via coach and it was an overnight trip, it took about 12 hours. The bus make about two stops along the way at big roadside petrol station/truckstops. So you can get off the bus, stretch your legs, take a piss and buy a snack.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What occurs at interstate checkpoints and how much time is wasted at them?</span><br>Nothing. If you fly the only &#039;checkpoint&#039; as such will be airport security. If you drive then it is pretty much nothing. Sometimes between NSW and QLD they warn you not to bring in fresh fruit from interstate, but I&#039;ve never actually seen a roadside checkpoint enforcing this. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how much money can I carry onto a plane</span><br>When you enter Australia as an international passenger then you will need to declare if you are carrying more than $10,000 in cash, cabin crew will give you an incoming passenger card on your arriving flight and the card will tell you what you need to declare.

A security pajeet may approach you and ask to swab your hands and bag for residue, this takes a minute. Once that is done then you are airside and can wait at the boarding gate, there is usually no further security.

The tourist zone only operates in summer months; complete ghost town in the winter (also wouldn&#039;t recommend driving the road between anchorage/fairbanks in the winter unless you&#039;re experienced, it&#039;s remote, no cell connection, and cold, ie dangerous.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How affordable is it to visit Alaska?</span><br>Assuming leaving from SF, LA, Seattle, or Portland, round trip flight to anchorage is like $400 economy? Hotels are probably cheaper than what you&#039;d find in downtown major cities in US, maybe $80-$200/night. Food is probably slightly more expensive than any other metro US area. Though, significantly cheaper than other northern cities you&#039;d find in canada, europe, etc. Attractions are mostly outdoors and free, though I believe DNP requires a park pass? Not sure, one isn&#039;t needed if you stay in tourist/highway corridor. Rental cars are expensive as fuck. Like $100/day or more.<br>Public transit outside of the Anchorage and Fairbanks metro areas is basically non-existent, with the exception of the Alaska Railroad, which you should probably look into. It&#039;s not super cheap, but it operates all along the Seward Highway, through Anchorage and up to DNP and to Fairbanks. They have sleeper cabins, food, etc. <br><br><a href=\"#p2366530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2366530</a><br>If you&#039;re most concerned with moving to Alaska or DNP, I believe a bunch of the resorts hire international workers for like summer gigs. They give you a place to sleep (or an allowance and you find a place), and then you work at the resort during the day.
