I recovered from COVID no problem. It was only when I took the J&amp;J that I started having problems. The minute I took the vaccine my heart started pounding rapidly. I told the people and they were worried for me. Told me to stay half an hour. I did pass out or anything so I just went home. For like 3 months I just had a rapid heart. Like the feeling of your heart when you stayed up 36 hours and you drink a can of monster to stay awake alittle longer. That is how my heart felt from awaking up until I went to sleep. Plus just constant fatigue. I couldn&#039;t walk for 5 minutes without feel like I ran for 40 mins. I use to like running. I stayed away from physical activity as much as I could. This heart thing was like the issue for a few months. After that for 1 month, I had what I think was brain fog. Like it was just terrible I couldn&#039;t think without it being a struggle to not have a weird feeling in my head. So for that month I stayed in bed and tried not to think. Like even watching TV was bothersome, but at the point the heart thing became less an issue and would only pump hard when walking 5 mins or more. After that, I started to recover. Slowly I was able to walk more and more, go further and further away from my house. Eventually I was able to attend Uni in person like normal. I missed come lectures since it was exhausting, but it was like I was getting my body back to be stronger to do normal things like walk for 15 mins than sit down for 2 hours.even that was something I couldn&#039;t do months earlier. At one point in the early months, I had a stiff neck, which I heard is another vaccine side effect. It felt like a tingle going down my spine in a line when I turned my head. But that went away doctor said it was a muscle issue not blood clots. Doctors checked me out and I guess I have no blood clots. He said my heart looked healthy.

Like in a weird way it would be more comforting to know what exactly is the problem. Even if the problem is more serious it&#039;s better to know, than for it to not be serious but not know. At this point I&#039;ve recovered a lot. But I&#039;m not the same I was before. Like before I was fit, I would workout because I enjoyed working out and trying to be healthy. Like I wasn&#039;t born rich, but being born healthy was a consolation price. Now I don&#039;t even have that. I regret this, I didn&#039;t want to take it but I was pressured by a program in Uni. Honestly my injury is mostly why I&#039;m taking some time to bounce around SEA for a while. My thinking is if I could die in the next 5 years, then I want to get that experience I was planning on later in life. Even now as I type this I have a very faint weird feeling in my heart area.

You&#039;ll need cash for street and cheap restaurants, most bars, night markets, prozzies, etc.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any services to specifically take/avoid? (especially getting from the airport to hotel, how do I not get scammed/overcharged?)</span><br>Fly in BKK and take the metro in the basement of the airport directly into the city. You&#039;ll probably take it to Phaya Thai, where you walk through a connecting tunnel to connect to the BTS. Make sure your hotel is near a BTS or MTS station.<br>Don&#039;t use taxis. They&#039;ve gotten better in recent years but you&#039;ll always have less problems sticking with Grab.<br>Whenever someone tries to sell you something, say &quot;my krop&quot;. The &quot;my&quot; part means &quot;no&quot; and &quot;krop&quot; is a respectful word that makes anything polite. (Women say &quot;ka&quot; - don&#039;t imitate female Thai or you&#039;ll be a joke.) Adding &quot;krop&quot; takes the edge off anything you say, and even a drunken Thai looking to start something will probably look elsewhere<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are there any cooming forums?

Itaewon is more expensive and has stricter dress codes, which is likely due to Hongdae mostly being very young college kids. <br><br>Mike&#039;s Cabin is mandatory for all foreigners to visit. They play latin music, but its very foreigner friendly, great drinks, cheap, big, and because it&#039;s so foreigner friendly all the Koreans there are going to be more receptive to you. From there you have other options depending on what music you like. Aura and Cocoon, which play electronic music--unless you go the Aura Bar which is connected but separate from Aura.

You&#039;re from EU so that passport should open a lot of doors for you, some countries may still require you to apply for a visa so check before you buy a ticket if you need to or don&#039;t.

You have the internet available, so use it. You can go minimalist and winging it or you can make a full day by day itinerary where you pick certain stops per day and plan a route to visit all of them. If you search online you may find sample routes for places you want to go to which you can alter at will based on your own interests. Look up lists of landmarks, museums, historical sites, hidden gems, hot spots in town and then find out which ones you want to go to and which ones you can skip on. Once you know where to go, find ways to connect them. If they&#039;re all in a circle around your accommodation, divide that circle into quadrants and explore it in a loop so you hit your interests and see the town on the way to and back. You can even find quality restaurants ahead of time per area and go to those the day you head out. It&#039;s really no different from mapping out a day in your own town. Something like:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;want to go see city hall in my small town</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh and there&#039;s a museum a few blocks away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s even a really beautiful park further down from the museum</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s going to be around lunchtime when I go, theres a restaurant with great reviews between the museum and park so i can stop there</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;after the park i&#039;ll need to make my way back, but ill return in a circle instead of a straight line back to check out a church and another museum before I leave</span><br>It&#039;s that simple, people really overestimate planning for travel. It takes a few hours at most to have everything ready, from bookings to day-to-day itineraries. <br><br>Speaking of bookings, do not use sites that book for you.

You really need to spend the time to crunch numbers because even though you have enough to go, you don&#039;t know if you have enough to go for 30 days. Some stuff will be more expensive too, so if you want to go to a ryokan or go to a hot spring town and get a hot spring hotel for a night, that will up pricing. You really need to budget before you go. As for 30 days in Tokyo, lmao you clearly didnt listen to us and try to plan shit out. You should be moving around since you&#039;re staying so long.<br>A good sample itinerary for you would be:<br>4 days Tokyo &gt; daytrip to fuji &gt; train to Kyoto and stay 5 days &gt; train to Osaka and stay for 4 days &gt; bus to the nakasendo trail and try to stay at a post town at the end of the hike &gt; bus to Gero and stay a few days for hot spring relaxation &gt; bus to takayama &gt; daytrip to shirakawa-go &gt; continue northeast or loop back to tokyo. <br><br>This is the way you should be thinking of your trip. You allocate days based on what you want to see per city/town and some time for travel within the country. The SIM card at the airport will be a must for internet on the go.

I only came here occasionally over the years for escapism, but should I travel to the Philippines and cheat on my tranny gf who cheated on me 10+ times over the course of 2020?<br><br>I met &quot;her&quot; in 2019 off grindr and I was a NEET so when she invited me to go to PH with her for a month I was like &quot;ok&quot; so we went and fucked like everyday. This allowed me to familiarize myself with how things work over there. We used grab for uber, globe for cell service, and were in Makati so I got a good idea of how 60 year old losers can walk around with 18 yr old girls and no one bats an eye. <br><br>In 2020 she began to cheat on me throughout the year. In late 2021 I found out after someone at the bar showed me pictures but she lied and I believed her when she said it was only 3 guys and only one she actually met up with and they only hugged and kissed even though the guy at the bar showed me pictures of them naked in bed with dried cum on her stomach. <br><br>In January of 2022 I decided to snoop further and that&#039;s when I saw that she was basically fucking a different guy every week in reality. She had said she was working late for covid so she couldn&#039;t hang Friday nights. In reality she was going to bars and the uber trip log showed coming back at 3AM. Then she would flirt with guys on tinder the following morning when she woke up horny and would fuck a lot of them. This would play out on Sunday as well when I had to go work. <br><br>Perhaps the saddest thing was that she was talking about swallowing their cum, something she never let me do. There was even one conversation wherein the guy shows a face pic, and then 45 mins later she is texting him a video of him fucking her in the ass without a condom--essentially she let him come right over and fuck her raw. I asked her if she had ever bothered to get an HIV test and she said not until late last year, meaning if she had contracted I would&#039;ve guaranteed gotten it too.

I tore my ACL last year and it still has not healed and physical therapy is not working so it may needd surgery. To make matters worse I recently tore my shoulder labrum. I also quit my job to study for a license right before I found out about how much worse the cheating was than I thought. So now I essentially sit in my room like a starfish desperately trying not to make my injuries worse, crying due to everything that&#039;s happened, and obviously not getting anywhere studying.<br><br>Perhaps I should get a new job, but if so then what better time to take an excursion to SEA than now before I start working again? (My last job I couldn&#039;t even take one day off) I also am plagued by the thought of cheating, something I had been so strongly against my whole life and have never done before. I don&#039;t know if I have the heart for it and I would probably feel very guilty to the point where I might confess, but at the same time this is clearly a shit relationship now so who cares?<br><br>I&#039;m thinking about learning tagalog since her family likes me a lot anyway. Does a globe sim card require you to get a new phone number? Because that would blow my cover. Is Makati the best place to do something like this? The girls I saw when we went out looked very high-volume and I&#039;d be worried about catching herpes and bringing it to my partner. (Both clean) Is it realistic to fire up tinder and get a guaranteed match? (I&#039;m 5&#039;11 160lbs with a 7.5 inch dick) Ideally to minimize risk of stds I&#039;d like to meet a hot girl and maybe she shows me around and we go on an excursion to some beach area. Is this realistic? I think my biggest weakness will be my lack of social skills and my difficulty faking good energy due to sadness from what is happening to me right now.

In the state of Rio de Janeiro, Angra dos Reis (if you have money to charter a boat; there are more than 1000 beaches and 360 islands) and Paraty (also a colonial town and boat related stuff).<br>In northeastern region there are lots of beach resorts.

But I would say the best months in southeastern states are april-june and september-november. Not too hot or cold and not too much rain. In S\u00e3o Paulo it can get near 0 C, but usually 5-10C in cold winter days and 35C in hot summer days. Rio get 15C in cold days and 40+C in hot summer days. Bear in mind that 10C in Brazil is much colder than 3C in European countries. We usually do not have heating inside houses and shops so it does feel cold.<br>I just advise to rent a car if you want to travel to smaller cities like from SP to southern MG and Paraty. Inside cities just use uber/taxi. If you go from capital to capital just fly. <br>Not really sure about hotels. Like anywhere else I just look for the ratings, location and hotel class. You won&#039;t have a problem booking 4+ stars hotels. If you&#039;re looking for cheap places, take care. We have motels (love hotels) that are used for having sex and places that attract low level scum to use drugs.

However, rental prices in Mumbai are significantly more expensive than elsewhere in India. You&#039;ll pay more and get less than you would in Delhi or Bangalore. However, an Rs. 60,000 housing stipend should be sufficient alone to rent a reasonably comfortable apartment. <br><br>If you&#039;re staying or working in a more central area, paying an additional $200-300 out-of-pocket should net you a spacious, modern property. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How easy is it to travel to other parts of India from Mumbai? </span><br>Mumbai is a Tier-1 city and Alpha global city. It has an international airport with flights across the country. You can also take the train to most places. There are regular buses--across a variety of budgets--running to other cities in Maharashtra, Goa, and so forth. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And how easy is it to make friends/date as a Westerner?</span><br>Completely depends on you. Making friends in India is reasonably easy. However, the sorts of people who are most likely to approach you in the street will be interested in you because you&#039;re &quot;different.&quot; You can sometimes meet decent people this way, but you might not have anything in common. Furthermore, they might simply want to show you off as their &quot;cool foreign friend.&quot;<br><br>Dating is a slightly different story. Living in India longer-term makes dating easier, especially if you&#039;re looking for something serious--many women won&#039;t want to go out with someone who&#039;s only here for a few weeks or a few months. <br><br>Other than that, well--it completely fucking depends on you. You can certainly find White fetishists in a city like Mumbai--girls who only date White men, and will sleep with any reasonably attractive foreigner. They&#039;re a very small percentage of the overall population, but if you look half-decent, they&#039;ll proactively seek you on dating apps. <br><br>I met some of these women when I was single, and they are fucking insufferable.

For the rest of the year, and especially in the winter, they camp in rugged jungles during the day and then move into hamlets for provisions and support at night. <br><br>While the Naxalites do have something akin to a &quot;parallel government&quot; in parts of Dandakaranya--do a Google search for &quot;Abujmarh&quot;--outsiders cannot simply stroll in for a tour. You will almost certainly be detained and turned around by the CRPF, District Reserve Guard, or another state security force. Even if you pay a local to help you around established checkpoints, you wouldn&#039;t get much farther inland without a genuine contact and legitimate connections.<br><br>Here&#039;s what would most probably happen: once you enter a so-called &quot;liberated zone,&quot; you&#039;d be stopped by sympathetic villagers or members of a local Maoist militia. You probably can&#039;t speak Hindi, so you wouldn&#039;t be able to explain why you&#039;re there. Even if you can speak Hindi, you wouldn&#039;t be allowed to travel within a Naxal-dominated area unless you&#039;d received prior &quot;permission&quot; from higher-ranking Maoists. You&#039;d be kept overnight and then told to leave the area in the morning. <br><br>Conceivably, you could just go &quot;hiking&quot; across Bailadila and &quot;accidentally&quot; end up across the Sukma border. But even if you came across the Naxalites, they wouldn&#039;t be willing to entertain some random, retarded foreigner.", "time": 1674716209, "resto": 2378371}, {"no": 2396767, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)01:56:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2396766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396766</a><br>cont. <br>You&#039;d be interrogated, held overnight, and--again--told to piss off at first light. In a worst-case scenario, they could use you as a bargaining chip (although the Naxalites have only held foreign tourists for ransom once in the last 50-60 years--and that kidnapping was staged by a former Naxalite commander who had already been kicked out of the main Maoist organization for provoking communal violence in Odisha). <br><br>If you know the right people--journalists, villagers, and so forth--they could take you to heavily-affected areas. But if any word got back to any government official that your stupid ass was actively trying to meet Maoists, you&#039;d almost certainly be either deported or restricted from ever re-entering India. <br><br>I cannot adequately express how heavily militarized certain parts of Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh area. In so-called &quot;hardcore&quot; Naxal areas, there are police encampments every 2-3 kilometers. If you try to circumvent said encampments, you will probably be stopped by villagers. In certain parts of Abujmarh and adjacent areas, there is also a minute risk that you could step on a landmine or improvised explosive device. <br><br>It&#039;s really not a good idea. <br><br>However, you can still very easily visit peripheral areas as a tourist--and that&#039;s something I&#039;d really recommend doing, because many parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have incredibly unique tribal cultures.

However, the early Naxalite movement was effectively curbed before and during the political Emergency of the 1970s. During this period, many Naxal sympathizers and cadres were arrested, imprisoned, or summarily executed. <br><br>While the initial movement was waning in Bengal, hardcore Maoist sympathizers began actively surveying other regions for the location of a potential &quot;guerrilla base.&quot; So far as I can recall, in Maoist war strategy, a guerilla base is an isolated, inaccessible area, from which militants can amass strength and began waging a protracted war of attrition against the urban, industrial state. <br><br>Since many early Naxalite cadres were Telugu speakers, they began making inroads into isolated tribal communities in East-Central India. The Gonds, for example, are among the largest tribes in the region; their language doesn&#039;t have any widely-used written alphabet. However, since Gondi is somewhat similar to Telugu, the Telugu-speaking cadres were able to gradually learn the language and begin &quot;fixing&quot; certain problems relating to corruption and resource exploitation. <br><br>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Naxalites began establishing a significant presence in the historical Dandakaranya region. Much of this region has been neglected by governments for hundreds of years, from the Mughals to the Raj to the early, post-Independence administrations. <br><br>Today, the Maoists find the most support among tribal people--people who might not understand or care about the Maoists&#039; ideological values, but believe that their lifestyles and cultures are being threatened by the state.", "time": 1674717905, "resto": 2378371}, {"no": 2396779, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)02:31:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2396777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396777</a><br>cont. <br>For context, the most heavily-affected regions, in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, are incredibly rich in mineral resources.

I live in a pretty middle-class neighborhood, and there&#039;s never a moment I don&#039;t doubt or realize that I&#039;m in India (right now, for instance, there&#039;s a neighborhood mela and festival ongoing--I am being forced to listen to literally window-shaking devotional music while people scream, shriek, and dance on the road).", "time": 1674221514, "resto": 2391810}, {"no": 2393670, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)08:36:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2393667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2393667</a><br>cont. <br>As India&#039;s economy continues to somewhat strengthen, these visible indicators of inequality will--most probably--become less visible. But I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to happen any time soon. India isn&#039;t going to magically transform into an unrecognizable destination overnight. The next several decades will doubtlessly bring some improvements, but I doubt India is going to become a Westernized or entirely modern country in our lifetimes. <br><br>(it&#039;s also worth noting that the current political landscape in many states is dominated by Hindu nationalist parties and politicians, almost all of whom are opposed to so-called Westernization, at least when such Westernization doesn&#039;t impact their personal earning opportunities) <br><br><a href=\"#p2391822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2391822</a><br>In respect to clothes and whatnot: this is very, very prevalent, especially in rural areas.<br><br>I do think it&#039;s worth noting that Western dress among men is very widespread.

Traditional dress isn&#039;t commonly worn except by persons working in certain professions and for special occasions (again, there are many exceptions--I haven&#039;t spent as much time in South India as I have elsewhere, but I think farmers and whatnot customarily and very regularly wear lungis. Lower-income Muslim men are another very noticeable exception, as many wear typically Islamic clothing).<br><br>(again, can&#039;t generalize. I wouldn&#039;t bat an eye at a guy wearing a lungi or dhoti in many neighborhoods. It&#039;s not uncommon at all) <br><br>The trend is different for women.

MNCs function in such a way that every national branch is its own company. They bill shit to each other, and either compete with, or work in fields that aren&#039;t quite the ones back home. <br><br>For example, a lot of MNCs will have folks working sales abroad to sell the products produced back home. And the people they will hire are obviously locals because they might be cheaper or just more at ease with communicating with the locals. Also, hiring an equivalent foreign worker is pound to pound as skilled as a local is considered bad practice and is starting to get heavily curbed in Asia.<br><br>Therefore, differentiation is key.

And that also goes by evening the playing fields. Some countries have visa schemes that facilitate foreign hiring for skilled workers.

Again, you don&#039;t necessarily need to do all that to try your luck.

Nothing you&#039;re saying is extremely novel or surprising. Your issue is that you want an American wage outside of America, and it took you two years to realize that it&#039;s not something that can be done easily.<br>America is not only just an economic superpower, it is the foremost leader in term of industry and high tech. You guys gain between 2 to 3 times the salary of an engineer in Germany or France. There&#039;s a reason why half the world tries to get to America. Pound for pound, when all expenses are taken into account, living in America is still preferable. <br><br>Finding a job isn&#039;t incredibly hard, but getting the cake and eating it too is. The real question is whether or not, ultimately, you&#039;d rather go abroad and settle for less (but definitely not less than the people working the same field there) or stay at home. <br>If you think TEFL is an easy solution, it&#039;s not, and will ultimately yield you the same problem. You will do overtime, unpaid meetings, and getting any form of raise beyond compensation for inflation will be way more difficult. Career-wise, if you ever want back in, you had better made it temporary before people do not find you worth hiring anymore. And also, teaching kids is EXHAUSTING.

If you&#039;re staying a while you can use Western Union, too, but for 1-2 weeks just bring $1000-$1500 and you&#039;ll be set.

Epcot needed the transformation its going through now 30 years ago. However, i don&#039;t think they are ever going to make it better than it once was. Disney is literally ruining everything about all their parks with IP integration because Disney IPs are literally all fake and gay. Imagineering was once great because they had better ideas than the company itself, including anything Walt ever thought of. And Walt was fake as well. He took credit for everything people more creative than hims came up with.<br>He didnt even design Disneyland like everyone thinks, it was Cornelius Vanderbilt Wood.<br>His original idea for Epcot was some globalist freemason utopia faggotry.<br>Thank god imagineers said fuck that dumb shit and built a permanent worlds fair instead.<br>And now the company just uses the parks as advertisements for their IPs so they can sell the company as a streaming service to Apple.

It&#039;s being done as an example to the shareholders that the company is moving away from expensive maintenance and operating costs in favor of streamlined low cost and bare minimum crowd appeasement.<br>You see, a technocratic corporation such as Apple for example, would have little interest in continuing to invest large portions of the company&#039;s investments in the parks. So all the animatronics and original themed attractions will continue to be phased out in favor of reducing operating costs and making the Disney brand more valuable to the big buyer, which will definitely be a streaming giant since Disney+ is the company&#039;s main focus.<br>Obviously this also means that virtually nothing from the original Splash will remain. Imagine Frozen Ever After but longer since the layout is the only thing being recycled and that is exactly the attraction youre going to get. There will be a handful of actual animatronics but nothing like the previous amount. And they will mostly be projection mapped and screens will replace the physical sets.<br>Disney is essentially throwing the towel in to Universal as far as maintaining an equal or competitive quality for the attractions. Their assumption is that they can cut the costs of the parks to appease investors and still maintain the park attendance and money flow that comes from them.<br>And they are probably right. Look at your average Disney shill, even the casual ones. They will say everything was a worthy replacement regardless and continue to blow their savings each year taking their family because the brand is already engrained into their feeble brains and they will always be loyal no matter what.<br>In the eyes of the park enthusiasts Universal is about to become leaps and bounds ahead of Disney but that will never translate to fiscal consequence because the vast majority of money generated from Disney parks has nothing to do with these opinions.", "time": 1675090185, "resto": 2398143}, {"no": 2398831, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)10:09:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Orlando (&amp; Tampa) Theme Park POWER RANKINGS<br><br>1.

Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story. Maybe look at the job situation so you can make it there.

The destruction of the environment is a major trope in cyberpunk; places with lots of smog, terrible weather, rivers of trash, e-waste will definitely fit this. <br><br>Other tropes are the feeling of isolation in a densely packed area, orwellian surveillance and the &#039;sin city&#039; factor, especially if it&#039;s open-air/ungoverned/state sanctioned.<br> Think the 7 sins: <br><br>Lust: escorts, massage parlors, love hotels, easy access p0rn, hypersexuality, gay bath houses, ladyboys<br>Gluttony: fast food, binge drinking, gold plated food, silver facials, excessive materialism/consooming<br>Greed: crypto, casinos/gambling, stock market, hustlers, gig economy, cash4gold, various scams, black market (silk road, organ harvesting), <br>Sloth: high automation, widespread apathy/nihilism, indifference to cruelty/bystander effect (watching people die, ignoring untouchables), promoting laziness<br>Wrath: war propaganda, political/ethnic/religious scapegoats blasted on media, eye 4 an eye mentality, cheering on violent/self-destructive behavior, sanctioned gangrapes, crimewave, gangs, police brutality, rudeness<br>Envy: sports cars, bling, expensive bags, photoshopped models, paradise packages, high rise condos next to slums, celebrities<br>Pride: social media, taking pride in degeneracy, ethno-narcissism, hyper-nationalism, religious zealots, promoting vanity<br><br>Which cities come to mind?

It will get lonely sometimes there&#039;s no denying that. If you get energy from being at bars with people and close interactions with friends then you&#039;ll struggle. But for me as an introvert I love travelling alone. No one cares, you can eat by yourself and have a book or magazine or something and no one will even look at you. By being alone you can explore sites at double (or half!) pace as you wish. It&#039;s great being able to wake up and go and do exactly what you want without compromise to keep everyone happy.

Depending on what background you have, travelling alone might be quite natural or quite scary. You don&#039;t know what you don&#039;t know, but I would encourage everyone to try a solo trip and see how they like it. There are places that are far more easy to do solo travel than others. I&#039;d say western European cities are super easy to do it. Try London, Rome or Paris for the easiest options, or city like Amsterdam or Stockholm for a slightly more adventurous time (but lots of English spoken). Next up venture to eastern Europe and countries like Greece, Croatia and all countries around there. From there expand your horizons to somewhere like Thailand or Central America/Mexico. Finally travelling in countries in Africa or more remote places in Asia can be challenging (logistically and culturally) but can offer the most satisfying rewards. <br><br>People don&#039;t steal things when you go for a swim. Leave your fancy watch and laptop at home. Get a (decent) but cheap mid range android cell phone you don&#039;t mind losing. Travel booking websites like Expedia and banking apps work better on phone than they do on full websites now anyway. Take a couple of credit cards leaving one in your luggage and one with you for daily needs. Take minimal cash (most everywhere takes cards now, you&#039;ll never need cash in 90% of situations).", "time": 1675027917, "resto": 2398257}, {"no": 2398455, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:46:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2398332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2398332</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve lost 2 of my very best friends after we went travelling through SEA for 6 weeks and fell out badly on the way back.</span><br>Story time?", "time": 1675028777, "resto": 2398257}, {"no": 2398462, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:59:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2398455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2398455</a><br>We were 3 good friends (lived together at university) on a 7 week trip to Thailand, one of us was going to go home early after 5 weeks (always was the case as they had a job lined up - totally fine) but one day before, the other person decided they were going to change their ticket and fly back with them too leaving me alone for the last 2 weeks.

Its the biggest and has a nice variety of hot pools, cold/medium pools and sauna/steam rooms. When you arrive, don&#039;t get confused and think that its only an outdoor pool- you have to go indoors and look around to find all the pools. If you have time to do two, do Gellert as well, it is smaller but less crowded and in a prettier setting.<br>-Ruin Bars: there are several, the most famous is Szimpla, which will pretty much always be busy during drinking hours. Stroll around its area and you&#039;ll find others each with their own quirks, as well as a kind of Hungarian food court/area that tends to be around there. <br>-Orsokahz: Hungarian parliament, a really magnificent building. Even if you aren&#039;t interested in architecture or history this is well worth checking out, it dominates the skyline of the city and is just breathtakingly beautiful and magnificient, especially as you cross into the city at night and see it for the first time. You can only go in with a guided crowd tour, but its worth doing. Slightly expensive by Hungarian standards but not too bad, but be sure to book well in advance because English tours fill up. <br><br>Whatever you do, be sure to walk the banks of the Danube by Parliament and cross the Chain Bridge and Princess Margaret Bridge.", "time": 1674732607, "resto": 2396592}, {"no": 2396848, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2396592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396592</a><br><a href=\"#p2396840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2396840</a><br>2/2<br><br>Other good stuff:<br><br>-Go the the Zwach distillery and get a tour, its cheap and they can get you pretty hammered if your guide is feeling like it. Zwach is also a very uniquely Hungarian beverage and there&#039;s rarely even anyone at the distillery. Fair warning: most people find regular Zwach pretty fucking foul, but the plum and coffee varieties are good shit. On the topic of food and drink, be sure to try the following: Tokay, which is Hungarian sweet wine, Langos fried flatbreads with toppings (go to Retro Langos for these), goulash, and Palinka (pear brandy which I personally think is foul but they like it). <br>-Gul Baba street, one of the steepest streets in major European cities, which ends with the tomb of an old Muslim theologian/scholar, also a pilgrimage site and rose garden. <br>-Citadela, where you&#039;ll see the big soviet statue, old fort that has the best views of the city and a nice hike to get up there<br>-Margaret Island, which is a cool island in the Danube with gardens and an assortment of stuff, good spot for picnics <br>-Fisherman&#039;s Bastion, which are the white fortifications you&#039;ll see, you can enter for free and if a turret/tower tries to charge for entry you can generally just come back at sundown and they won&#039;t be charging any more. <br><br>I think you can get to Bratislava by boat very easily from Budapest, but I&#039;ve never been. <br>Don&#039;t take taxis, they are a literal cartel designed to scam people. <br>Also get some turkish food while you are there and use trams instead of the subway.

It&#039;s going to be full or tourists, but I can imagine it&#039;s fun for young people. The &quot;food court&quot; is called &quot;Street Food Karavan&quot;-- it&#039;s at the end of the street that Szimpla is on. If you&#039;re at one end of the block, and there&#039;s no food court, it&#039;s on the other end. From Szimpla, if you keep going in the same direction, then turn left when the road ends, you&#039;ll pass by a nice brunch place called Cirkusz that is sadly crowded all the time, and then if you turn right you&#039;ll end up a Gozsdu udvar, which could also be described as a kind of food court area. If you put the names into a search engine, you should be able to see the locations.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orsokahz</span><br>Orszaghaz. Book the tour online and print out the tickets. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s great. If you&#039;re there, you might as well walk across Szabadsag ter. Check out the monument to the Soviet liberators of Budapest, the statues of Reagan and H.W. Bush, the old stock exchange (on your right), and the fortress-like US embassy (on your left). At the opposite end of the square, there&#039;s a memorial to the German occupation of Hungary. You can then continue ~200 meters along Oktober 6 street, pass by George Soros&#039;s university, and you&#039;ll soon be able to see the square in front of Saint Steven&#039;s Basilica. The basilica is pretty cool, but it&#039;s expensive to tour. There are a bunch of tourist trap restaurants in that area, but, if you&#039;re there around lunch time, I recommend hummusbar on Oktober 6.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zwach</span><br>Zwack is the distillery.

Go up the castle for a cool view, visit the alt culture center of Metelkova on a thu/fri/sat to see Ljubljana nightlife at its best, walk around the city center for a bit. For museums the national art gallery is by far the best so I recommend visiting that, for the rest it&#039;s going to depend on your interests.

In Europe it might be slightly less cucked because you&#039;re legally granted compensation if the delay exceeds 3 hours. However, this pretty much never happens. It all begins when you notice that the vast majority of delays are in the 1-2 hours range. Once you get past that mark, all issues with the flight mysteriously resolve and you&#039;re ready to depart. Why?<br><br>It&#039;s obvious that, insofar as no compensation is required by law, the airlines gain nothing by arriving on time. Why? 1) There is virtually no competition between airlines, since a single airline typically holds a monopoly over a certain route, except for the very busiest 2) you don&#039;t have a choice between flying and other means of transport either, because even with the programmed delays flights are much faster than anything else 3) even if there was an airline which wasn&#039;t crooked and decided to stand up to this system, it wouldn&#039;t matter because delay by 1 company can cause a domino effect of delays for others.<br><br>Given that arriving on time takes more effort than on a 1-2 hour average delay, it&#039;s obvious even to an infant that they&#039;re saving money by cutting corners on logistics resulting in delays. <br><br>However, the ultimate redpill is that they&#039;re ACTIVELY making money from this. Think about what arriving late entails. You get hungry or thirsty so you&#039;re more likely to buy food/beverages on the flight. Second, local transport and accomodation companies are most likely part of the conspiracy as well. Delays means that you might miss the last leg of your trip so you have to spend extra money on an Uber or even a hotel. Clearly, there&#039;s a ton of money to be made from delays, and nothing to lose as long as you don&#039;t exceed the threshold for legally required compensation. There&#039;s only one possible result to all this and we&#039;ve witnessed the airlines get better and better at exploiting it over the years.", "filename": "Delayed", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1675022046639659, "time": 1675022046, "md5": "WQLM2VX5vvZ3g9prpuS1qA==", "fsize": 744917, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "airlines-profit-off-delays", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 2398412, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)15:22:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2398399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2398399</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/pol/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/pol/</a>", "time": 1675023768, "resto": 2398399}, {"no": 2398415, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)15:26:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2398399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2398399</a><br>Nice schizo ramble. <br><br>I worked in airline logistics. <br><br>Airports have a use it or lose it policy. If one flight is delayed, then there will be a domino effect for the next flight. Meaning it will need another gate. Often airports will work at extremely high capacity, and will not have enough gate agents, off-loaders, operations and dispatchers to deal with multiple flights that shouldn\u2019t be there at the same time. <br><br>One delayed flight might lead to 20 more throughout the duration of the day. That\u2019s more people that need paying for their time. More pay for cleaners. More pay for gate agents. More pay for stewards/stewardesses, more pay for pilots, so on and so fourth. It adds up ridiculously. <br><br>Imagine for example, at an airport as a gate agent or baggage agent, you\u2019re assigned a flight at 1 then another flight at 3. Now both flights turn up at 3 and both will end up going substantially later. <br><br>Most of the time, flights are delayed for two reasons. First one is because staff haven\u2019t turned up. Maybe stuck in traffic. Maybe called in sick last minute. Might be ground agents. Might be an issue with a passenger. Something like that. <br><br>Second one is technical. Any single part (in the hundreds of thousands of monitored plane parts) is showing as having an issue. Then you can\u2019t take off until A) there\u2019s a replacement plane or B) someone fixes it. <br><br>Usually major airlines will have their own dedicated technicians on standby 24/7 at all airports just in case of a situation like this, but there are always cases where they can\u2019t resolve the problem and it needs further investigation.

While I spent 90% of the time in Japan, I was able to travel around Asia as well.<br><br>Key takeaways:<br><br>1) Japan is hands down the best place for a white person to live in Asia, IF you have money. The food quality and safety is excellent. Prostitution, while more expensive than anywhere else in Asia, provides whores who know how to please you. Geisha culture has not been completely extinguished from modern Japanese culture so you can have some wonderful experiences with prostitutes, better than Europe and far better than anything in America.<br><br>What is very interesting about Japanese services and restaurants is that everyone specializes in one thing and does that for their entire life, becoming excellent at whatever they do. Since Japanese work so much (notice I did not say &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;smart&quot;, but &quot;much&quot; meaning that they are forced to spend many hours at work even if it&#039;s unproductive), they highly value &quot;experiences&quot; such as eating out, shows, etc, whatever. This puts a very high pressure on the service industry to deliver quality, meaning that if you&#039;re a westerner living in Japan, making a lot and working relatively little due being in a specialized field, you get to reap immense benefits from their service industry. These services were designed for Japanese people to enjoy, for their OWN people, but due to globalization you can now siphon off the cream from their society for your own benefit.

While white/European &quot;racism&quot; comes from an actual superiority to other races in terms of cultural, scientific, and artistic achievement, Japan&#039;s racism and supreme arrogance comes from not wanting to be associated with Chinese culture, from which they are HEAVILY influenced by even to this day, and wanting to be accepted by Anglo-Saxon power. There is a deep rooted hatred for China in Japan despite almost all Japanese culture being based upon Chinese culture (Japan was a vassal state of China until about 1100 AD), particularly the philosophy which is rooted in Confucianism.<br><br>This creates a very interesting interaction dynamic with Japanese if you are white. You notice that they intensely discriminate against Chinese and Koreans (younger generations lesser so due to k pop), and almost comically fawn over white people and culture. And yet, their disdain for their yellow brothers creates an intense sense of self-hatred, making them servile to whites, almost slave like, in the presence of whites. This was fascinating because you don&#039;t see this behavior with chinese or koreans. While you can obviously tell that both groups are less sophisticated than Japanese, they don&#039;t have this kind of sniveling pandering servile attitude towards whites. They are genuinely curious to be around whites, especially rural koreans and chinese, but it&#039;s in a way where they view you as alien rather than a supreme master.", "filename": "1655374629922", "ext": ".webm", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674611601843105, "time": 1674611601, "md5": "vfiafzJhnFAyPXCt/vmCGw==", "fsize": 855307, "resto": 2396183}, {"no": 2396187, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:54:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "3) The two largest draw backs of Japan are that it becomes boring very quickly once the &quot;fantasy&quot; wears off, and the women. Japan is wonderful at first, and it still is, but once the novelty fades and you start seeing it for what it is, which is simply a slightly higher developed asian country, it becomes boring. The temples are boring, the shrines are boring, the food gets boring, the conversations in particular gets SUPER boring once you realize that Japanese people are somewhat uncultured and ignorant of many things due to their insular society and culture. Japanese appear to be very smart, and they definitely are in certain regards, but much of this image has to do with them not opening their mouths or commenting on things.

However, after bedding them I still prefer white women. Not only because I find them more attractive, but they are also more interesting and independent. Lots of people here want &quot;trad wives&quot; and while there is truth to that, you also want someone who you can talk to and debate with, and have interesting conversations with.

The temples are boring, the shrines are boring, the food gets boring, the conversations in particular gets SUPER boring once you realize that Japanese people are somewhat uncultured and ignorant of many things due to their insular society and culture. Japanese appear to be very smart, and they definitely are in certain regards, but much of this image has to do with them not opening their mouths or commenting on things.

Japs definitely do not see themselves as below whites - quite the opposite. Anyone who spends a modicum of time learning how to adapt to Jap culture will see this. Speak very basic Japanese or use chopsticks and they&#039;ll shit themselves in amazement. Why? Not because you&#039;re a white God. It&#039;s because in their collective hive mind Westerners are filthy uncultured barbarians who couldn&#039;t possibly in a million years learn muh unfathomably sophisticated Japanese or operate any eating utensils other than a fork. It&#039;s a superiority complex. If it was inferiority then gaijin would get preferential treatment which we most certainly do not. NHK wouldn&#039;t have segments on tv showing how gaijin pronunciation of &quot;this is a pen&quot; contributes more to the spread of covid. English teachers wouldn&#039;t be a complete and utter joke. &quot;Whito piggu go homu&quot; demonstrations wouldn&#039;t be a thing. No foreigners apartment rental policies wouldn&#039;t be a thing. The only Japs who place us on pedestals are self hating gaijin hunting whores from the Hub with daddy issues.

Gritty, dirty big city, juxtaposed against a majestic, historic and captivating place full of winding old streets. Beautiful beaches, weird commie anarchist neighbourhoods, vibrant music/arts/history, riot police on every corner at all times, crumbling post-modern architecture and beautiful outdoor cafes. Also beautiful girls, cheap whores and good food. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Barcelona, Spain. </span><br>Not going to go down well on /trv/ but I\u2019ve never had a bad vibe in this city. Big, cosmopolitan and international, modern yet loads of incredibly beautiful streets and neighbourhoods.

On that device you&#039;d use a VPN (preferably to a friend&#039;s home network in your home country, but maybe ExpressVPN will work for you since many of their exit nodes are partnered with local ISPs). Then you connect your work laptop to that router/gateway device. Your work laptop connects to the company VPN and your company VPN sees it coming from the personal/ExpressVPN address your router/gateway is using. If you do this route, you need a router/gateway that with a killswitch that will completely drop your internet interface if the VPN drops.<br>I think your big problem is having flaky work software that require you to bring the laptop to the office to fix.

International roaming depends on your carrier&#039;s agreement with some local carrier to provide you service in order to work. So when you try to log in, it&#039;ll show that country&#039;s location. <br><br>And it&#039;s not a guarantee you&#039;ll be able to get 5G wherever you go. Even in Europe. I paid my American carrier for unlimited roaming internet while abroad (again, it was a French carrier providing me the actual service, you can only do this a few months before they cut you off anyway), and I bought a French SIM card, and even then, the best I could get was 4G. <br><br>Besides that, if your company really is anal about security then there&#039;s no way in hell you&#039;ll be able to hide the fact that you&#039;re abroad from them.

This means banks and security work are probably a no-go for you (though there are surely exceptions). You should be looking for a new job constantly anyway, so that your compensation is as high as it can be. <br><br>Many companies won&#039;t allow you to work from abroad, if only to save themselves the tax and legal troubles they would have to figure out in another country.
