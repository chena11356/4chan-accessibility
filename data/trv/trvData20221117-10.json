A significant factor in your credit score is number of applications for cards sent out and concurrent years as a member which means cancelling an account will impact your overall credit and can hurt you financially in the future when you cancel. The best thing to do is to downgrade a card of a specific company to save up on annual fees, so if you want to stop paying $695 on an amex platinum, you downgrade to their shittiest card and save about $600 a year.

Typically the only person who will do this is the check in agent when you check bags/get boarding pass.

Also I noticed that money doesn&#039;t impress nearly the same in Mexico City - in a few neighborhoods, like Polanco and Santa Fe, the girls came from families with more money than I&#039;ll ever see in my life.

I stupidly bought a flight there to meet with a girl I met online. We had been talking a lot over the summer. When I told her I&#039;d be in her city she essentially stopped talking to me. Maybe she would respond to a joke I made every couple of days, but never really initiated contact again.<br><br>When I got there last month, it was a nice city but I felt so stupid and lonely there because she didn&#039;t respond to me when I get there. Then I got kinda depressed and drank for 3 days. Then I fell ill with maybe covid, and just flew back home. Then I got depressed for wasting time/money and drank at home for another week or so.
