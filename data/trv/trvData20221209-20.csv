Don&#039;t listen to what the other anons are saying, it&#039;s not actually that bad if you keep your wits about you and you&#039;re not a total retard.<br><br>To be fair, Harare is a shithole. If you visit, definitely do not stay in the city center. Generally the northeastern suburbs are the nicest and you should look for a hotel/airbnb there. Barring that, you can stay in Belvedere to the west of the city, which is where I stayed and is somewhat cheaper. It&#039;s a largely Indian and Chinese community. The Harare Gardens are also beautiful and worth strolling around (during the day of course).<br><br>Bulawayo might be a better city for Rhodesia nostalgia (it was Zim&#039;s biggest city until the 30s). Bulawayo is generally quite a pleasant town and you can see a lot of Rhodesian heritage just walking around. You can visit the railway museum which is for spergs but it&#039;s still kind of cool to see the old Rhodesian locomotives. I also stopped for a drink at the &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; Bar on Mugabe Street which has sort of a &quot;Cecil Rhodes&quot; theme and does jazz music at night.<br><br>About an hour&#039;s drive from Bulawayo, visit Matobo National Park to see Cecil Rhodes&#039;s grave. It&#039;s a beautiful location (and there&#039;s lots of other stuff to do in the park as well).<br><br>If you&#039;re at all interested in African history you can also visit Great Zimbabwe (~4h east of Bulawayo), which is supposedly one of the greatest &quot;castles&quot; built in pre-colonial Africa.<br><br>Lastly, I would recommend taking the train from Bulawayo to Vic Falls. They still operate old Rhodesian Railways rolling stock from the 1950s and 60s. It&#039;s an overnight trip where you basically wake up in Vic Falls. Booking a sleeper car is super cheap--but when I was there it had to be done at the train station in cash. Idk if they&#039;ve fixed this by now.<br><br>As usual, be cautious with your belongings.

It was one of those North American style churches, Kind of progressive in terms of service structure, but not in terms of beliefs, despite being in Canada they were trump supporters for whatever reason. Anyway I remember one of the congregation members&#039; dad, who was an old white man, apparently got really sick when he visited Thailand and eventually died. I&#039;m not sure but the lady found out that her dad had a satanic tattoo, even thought I&#039;m not sure what that means. Basically the whole church believed that this had something to do with his death and that he wouldn&#039;t be going to heaven or some shit like that. She even cried in front of the whole church. I know it&#039;s sort of insensitive to find the situation kind of absurd, but I feel likes it&#039;s more likely her dad was doing degenerate shit in Thailand, considering he was old and single, and the religious shit was a pretty embarrassing cope, but I&#039;m not sure. I&#039;ve never been to Thailand, but was wondering if foreigners often find themselves in pretty situations due to getting &quot;lost in the sauce&quot; given the reasons people tend to visit places like Thailand.",think,.png,268.0,188.0,250.0,175.0,1670289663864925.0,1670289663,B5Ip+UfukdeK33uhnhViOA==,6199.0,0,when-i-was-in-highschool-my-parents-often-forced,1,0,"[{'no': 2368556, 'now': '12/06/22(Tue)02:10:17', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Travel to Thailand to find out.
