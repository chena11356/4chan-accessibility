There&#039;s another one, I believe the Heart Run too. Those are the two main ones I remmeber.<br><br>As for things to do in Anchorage, some stuff off the top of my head:<br>- downtown has a couple decent things (historical sites, performing arts center, some actually decent restaurants (or hotdog stands if you want something cheap))<br>- standard drunk natives roaming the streets at all hours, but mostly later in the evening<br>- temperature will prolly be 60-75F or so, so pretty reasonable for walking/biking<br>- if you can, take the drive to Girdwood. It&#039;s like 45 minutes down the seward highway. There&#039;s a ski resort and hotel there, but it&#039;s also pretty in the summer. Lots of hiking there as well<br>- If you like road trips, renting a car and driving up to Fairbanks from Anchorage is like 6 or so hours, and you get to see a bunch of the state doing that. Road is also really good especially in summer<br>- If you like weed, there&#039;s places to purchase at like every street corner<br>- Anchorage is like small to medium sized US city. You&#039;ll find most things you&#039;ll find in any other city.

If you like sea animals, there&#039;s a large &quot;sealife&quot; center in Seward. Seward is like a 3 hour drive past girdwood.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is it true that it never gets dark in June?</span><br>The sun does set (and ride) year round in Anchorage. If you want to experience midnight sun, Fairbanks is probably your best bet. If you&#039;re feeling especially adventerous, Barrow (utqiagvik) at the top of alaska will def give you that experience.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;any good restaurants to try for authentic Alaskan food?</span><br>if im honest, i dont really know what authentic alaskan food is. whale? reindeer/caribou? moose? Whale and moose are fairly rare in anchorage, but you can definitely find reindeer and caribou meats at most non-chain restaurants. There&#039;s also specialty meat stores, Mr. Prime Beef, Alaska Sausage and Seafood come to mind. New Sagaya is a grocery store that carries a bunch of random game food. Rabbit, moose, caribou, whale (maybe??), etc. <br><br>as a side note, if you go out to the &quot;beaches&quot; in cook inlet, be very careful of the quicksand. that shit is no joke, and the water is cold as fuck. every year there&#039;s a bunch of tourists that fuck around in the sand and then have to have the fire department come out and rescue them.", "time": 1669868593, "resto": 2361383}, {"no": 2366528, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)15:58:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2366187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2366187</a><br>Wow that\u2019s really good information.

If you want your trip to be interesting as a beginner, you&#039;d be well inspired to visit the extremes first, and the more nuanced countries later. China and Japan for example have two very different cultures whereas Korea and Taiwan are a nuance of the former.<br>Vietnam and Thailand are the bigger cultural and economic actors of the ex-indochina region and thus visiting laos and cambodia would just be a waste of time for now.<br>The three outliers are the philippines (due to it being simply unique), and Indonesia/malaysia (visiting one of em is enough, the other one&#039;s basically the same). If you&#039;re planning to do a long trip with multiple countries, you should definitely do both in one swing, like say Japan and Vietnam or China and Thailand. Or Japan and Thailand, since China hasn&#039;t opened yet.<br><br>I also suggest you start with the poorer country first, since third world countries have some inconveniences i&#039;m sure you&#039;ll figure out, and by going to the more developed country after that it&#039;ll allow your body and mind to take a break from the hustle and bustle. This being said, it all hinges on how much time you have. If 2 weeks is all you have you can honestly just stay in Japan for the duration of the trip.

Recognizing that without foreign cash we&#039;re fucked, gangs near tourist areas have come to a tacit agreement of &quot;we won&#039;t fuck with tourists, but you don&#039;t intrude on our drug business, even if tourists blatantly come to us for drugs&quot; with the gov. Old San Juan has the La Perla ghetto, one of the most famous drug and crime hotspots in the island. You can hang around the wall that borders it in complete safety, but if you descend down into the ghetto itself then you either buy and gtfo or go at your own risk. The rest of old san juan is safe and holds a regular police presence, they just won&#039;t go into the ghetto itself unless serious shit goes down. Same with Condado which has its ghettoes far from nightlife. La Placita is a bit more of a hotspot but there&#039;s a big police and even undercover cop presence there. The other main spots in Rio Grande, Fajardo, Humacao, Rincon and La Parguera are more rural and don&#039;t have as big of a gang conflict issue since there&#039;s more territory for less people, and tourists are kept encapsulated in bubbles created by resorts and guarded by private security. Palmas del Mar in Humacao is great, all rich people, multiple gated communities, private police roaming constantly... It&#039;s solid. You really only need to worry about safety as a tourist in the metro area, but the main hubs are safe and tourists won&#039;t go out of their way to enter the shittier parts of the metro area like Carolina. Drugs are directly linked to around 60% of all murders in PR, drugs basically cause the majority of violence. South America simply loves shipping to and through us. Since we buy direct, it&#039;s great for dealers.

We had one of, if not THE strictest gun control laws in America. Before the latest USSC ruling, I would have to get a license for sport from the police. Originally these cost a whopping $500 per application, required you to pay for a membership at a shooting range and involved a multiple months long waiting period plus background check. If you were granted the license (it was not a guarantee) you got the right to only RENT a gun at a range for the purpose of shooting for sport at that range and nothing else. You could not purchase a gun to be kept at the range. Once you had the license for sport you then had to apply for a carry license which cost about $1,000, included the background check, a certified safety and handling class you also had to pay separately for, required sworn affidavits and approval by a judge instead of police, needed two people who knew you to confirm your good character and even if all requirements were met you could still be told no. That&#039;s all for the license alone btw, you buy the gun alone after. It effectively cost you $1500 and 4-12 months for a license then however many hundreds or thousands the gun cost. Almost no one had legal access to guns in PR until 2020. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;geography allows easy drugs</span><br>That&#039;s the ticket.

A recent bust happened because the boat sank on the way back to PR, rescue teams found them and the drugs. The guy in charge of sailing for this op was a first timer who was paid $10k up front and offered a $90k bonus upon completion (which he never got thanks to his arrest) according to court records.
