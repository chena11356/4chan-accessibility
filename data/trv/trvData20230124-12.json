If the earlier flight is delayed and you miss your next flight (more likely than you&#039;d think) the airlines probably won&#039;t help you. Mixing and matching airlines is acceptable when you have days between flights.<br>If the flights you&#039;re looking at have unfortunately long layovers (16 hours+), see about staying in the layover destination for a day or two and getting the flight to your real destination later. You do this by booking a return flight to the layover destination and a return flight from the layover destination to the real destination.<br>Most of the time cheap airlines are perfectly fine and anyone who wants to spend an extra $500+ just to get a shitty meal and see shitty movies through a shitty chair screen for 12 hours is an idiot. Purchase a good phone battery bank, put some games or movies on your phone and enjoy, being a little bored for a few hours is absolutely worth the money saved by flying cheap.<br>Cheap airlines are known for not refunding your ticket so don&#039;t buy the ticket if you aren&#039;t sure you will be going unless you&#039;re willing to take the risk.", "time": 1674536381, "resto": 2395410}, {"no": 2395841, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:43:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are flights to Japan and all long-haul flights so much more expensive at the moment?<br><br>Will they drop again?", "time": 1674560611, "resto": 2395410}, {"no": 2395846, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:59:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2395410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2395410</a><br>check kayak or google flights", "time": 1674561544, "resto": 2395410}, {"no": 2395858, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:34:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2395841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2395841</a><br>weebs goign to jp, but it&#039;s cheap for me :)", "filename": "discountflights", "ext": ".png", "w": 1252, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 35, "tim": 1674563694306263, "time": 1674563694, "md5": "tO0RCFxESJ1J7Fmu/d2lFw==", "fsize": 65249, "resto": 2395410}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2390280, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)15:58:28", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Wales", "com": "Hi /trv/ I am going to Wales for 5 days with my 2 brothers.<br>We want to see<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;castles</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Arthur/ Merlin stuff</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dragon stuff</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cool nature</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;natural swimming areas</span><br>We are coming from London by train, but we are visiting UK from California.<br>One of us does not travel well... hates trains &amp; gets sick sometimes.<br>Help me figure out an itinerary.", "filename": "8754", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 627, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 130, "tim": 1673729908571138, "time": 1673729908, "md5": "2w9UZPCHEwMnHlmFUnUagw==", "fsize": 146846, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "wales", "replies": 12, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 2390308, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)16:51:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "not all trains suck but the train running london to glasgow sucks for causing sickness (the only train i ahve felt this all others have been fine for me) - and depending on where you are traveling from you might be on it all the way to crewe before veering off to north wales. but who knows.<br><br>in northern wales there is snowdonia mountain - it has a railroad up it but closed in winter.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story.

MNCs function in such a way that every national branch is its own company. They bill shit to each other, and either compete with, or work in fields that aren&#039;t quite the ones back home. <br><br>For example, a lot of MNCs will have folks working sales abroad to sell the products produced back home. And the people they will hire are obviously locals because they might be cheaper or just more at ease with communicating with the locals. Also, hiring an equivalent foreign worker is pound to pound as skilled as a local is considered bad practice and is starting to get heavily curbed in Asia.<br><br>Therefore, differentiation is key.

Foreign internships, exchanges and double diplomas during your studies can help if you take the necessary steps professionally to make it work. <br><br>In a nutshell, anything that makes you a better person than a local works. And that also goes by evening the playing fields. Some countries have visa schemes that facilitate foreign hiring for skilled workers. Speaking the local language in a professional capacity also helps leveling the playing field and beating other foreign contenders. Again, you don&#039;t necessarily need to do all that to try your luck.

You don&#039;t go for the girls in that group, you don&#039;t hook up with them, you don&#039;t try to start a relationship, just make friends and that&#039;s that. The rest of the people however are fair game, but once someone joins your circle, they&#039;re not. This will teach you restraint and class, and the people in that group will actually appreciate you for it. Seriously, don&#039;t be that fucking guy who thinks he&#039;s better than the foreigners just because he&#039;s hanging around young east asian women because he may have a chance to fuck their pussies. I swear to God this is an actual category of the foreign population and it&#039;s disgusting.<br><br>I wasn&#039;t implying this, I meant how hard is it to meet people in general when you aren&#039;t out in the clubs etc anymore?", "time": 1674180270, "resto": 2389716}, {"no": 2393422, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)21:07:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2393335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2393335</a><br>It&#039;s good if you do that while working on something else.

You will do overtime, unpaid meetings, and getting any form of raise beyond compensation for inflation will be way more difficult.

If you&#039;re overly paranoid though or travelling somewhere you doubt there will be laundromats, pack a clothes washing soap bar.<br>Depending on where you&#039;re going all you really need is 1 scenario-specific outfit (by that I mean a &quot;going out&quot; outfit or a &quot;hiking&quot; outfit) and even then, try and fit that with your everyday outfit. For example, a &quot;going out&quot; outfit might just be your everyday jeans with a nice shirt rather than bringing nice jeans and a nice shirt. If you&#039;re going hiking your everyday shirt will be fine and more often than not, so will your everyday jeans.<br><br>Of course if you&#039;re a woman you&#039;re probably going full wacko mode and you&#039;re going to pack shit you don&#039;t need regardless.

If you\u2019re not concerned about potential abuse and addiction, you might also talk to a doctor about a small quantity of an anxiolytic like Xanax or Ativan, but any drug in the barbiturate or benzodiazepine families is more serious business than people like to think, and shouldn\u2019t be used too casually. They\u2019re all physically habit-forming with nasty withdrawal symptoms, and some people get unpleasant benzo hangovers that can leave you groggy and stupid for an extended period.

It won&#039;t be one of the IP addresses of your home telco provider.<br>The 2% chance I&#039;m holding back is because I&#039;m aware some telcos do have the options of SIMs with fixed IP addresses tied to them.

Others have probably talked about them already, but they come down to using a router or gateway device that can use a VPN. On that device you&#039;d use a VPN (preferably to a friend&#039;s home network in your home country, but maybe ExpressVPN will work for you since many of their exit nodes are partnered with local ISPs). Then you connect your work laptop to that router/gateway device. Your work laptop connects to the company VPN and your company VPN sees it coming from the personal/ExpressVPN address your router/gateway is using. If you do this route, you need a router/gateway that with a killswitch that will completely drop your internet interface if the VPN drops.<br>I think your big problem is having flaky work software that require you to bring the laptop to the office to fix.

International roaming depends on your carrier&#039;s agreement with some local carrier to provide you service in order to work. So when you try to log in, it&#039;ll show that country&#039;s location. <br><br>And it&#039;s not a guarantee you&#039;ll be able to get 5G wherever you go. Even in Europe. I paid my American carrier for unlimited roaming internet while abroad (again, it was a French carrier providing me the actual service, you can only do this a few months before they cut you off anyway), and I bought a French SIM card, and even then, the best I could get was 4G. <br><br>Besides that, if your company really is anal about security then there&#039;s no way in hell you&#039;ll be able to hide the fact that you&#039;re abroad from them. The fact that you would even ask this means you aren&#039;t technically sophisticated enough to outwit your IT department. You&#039;d only end up getting yourself in trouble. <br><br>My advice would be that, if working abroad means that much to you (and I can understand that, because it&#039;s a life-changing perk) then I would suggest you look for a job with a company that&#039;s willing to look the other way. This means banks and security work are probably a no-go for you (though there are surely exceptions). You should be looking for a new job constantly anyway, so that your compensation is as high as it can be. <br><br>Many companies won&#039;t allow you to work from abroad, if only to save themselves the tax and legal troubles they would have to figure out in another country. But if you use an American mailing address (say, your parents&#039;) and give them plausible deniability, many companies are willing to look the other way to keep valuable employees, including mine.", "time": 1673811951, "resto": 2376981}, {"no": 2390910, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:14:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2390824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2390824</a><br><a href=\"#p2390837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2390837</a> is probably going towards the better path.<br><br>Trying to outwitting a competent and aggressive IT team of a security focused company isn&#039;t a good idea.

That&#039;s why most people here in Brazil consider Brazil as west.

It&#039;s common for a woman to spend 4+ hours a day in social media.

Mcdonalds would cost about 40 reais.<br>A 330ml heineken bottle in a market will cost you about 5, 10 in a cheap bar, 15 in a expensive bar. In expensive nightclubs 2-3x that.

You could get hustled to buy something from street vendors, specially in Rio, for a higher price. But that&#039;s pretty much it. <br>In southern regions I recommend Iguazu Falls (3 days is enough) for nature (much better than shitty niagara falls) and Florianopolis to chill on the beach and party. In the state of SP there is Ilhabela. In the state of Minas Gerais, there ae some nice colonial towns like Ouro Preto and Tiradentes (just to spend a full day in each). In the state of Rio de Janeiro, Angra dos Reis (if you have money to charter a boat; there are more than 1000 beaches and 360 islands) and Paraty (also a colonial town and boat related stuff).<br>In northeastern region there are lots of beach resorts. If you want to see the most african city in Brazil and our first capital, go to Salvador. Besides that, I only recommend Len\u00e7ois Maranhenses.<br>In northern region Manaus (2 days at most) and some jungle resort in the Amazon. Also there is Jalap\u00e3o.<br>In center west region, there is Pantanal, a wetland. Not much to do besides seeing animals and flora. <br>Cooming is good.

But I would say the best months in southeastern states are april-june and september-november. Not too hot or cold and not too much rain. In S\u00e3o Paulo it can get near 0 C, but usually 5-10C in cold winter days and 35C in hot summer days. Rio get 15C in cold days and 40+C in hot summer days. Bear in mind that 10C in Brazil is much colder than 3C in European countries. We usually do not have heating inside houses and shops so it does feel cold.<br>I just advise to rent a car if you want to travel to smaller cities like from SP to southern MG and Paraty. Inside cities just use uber/taxi. If you go from capital to capital just fly. <br>Not really sure about hotels. Like anywhere else I just look for the ratings, location and hotel class. You won&#039;t have a problem booking 4+ stars hotels. If you&#039;re looking for cheap places, take care. We have motels (love hotels) that are used for having sex and places that attract low level scum to use drugs. So just book good places. 50-100 usd gets you great places in most cities and 100-200 usd gets you 5 star hotels in the expensive cities.<br>About the water, it depends of the state you are.

I used to do the later but instead of renting a room I would go to her place. If you know how to talk to her you could stay all night and have a true girlfirend experience.

Probably a meme story on /trv. I went through a long list of terrible life events, both by my own fault and out of my control.

My apartment lease was up and I moved my stuff to storage, decided to go to Japan for a few months and maybe end it afterwards or along the way.

Used her as a tour guide and went to a love hotel a few times. It was casual and I met another girl, who was clingy and (I soon discovered) crazy. Met another. Made friends with Japanese guys and girls (and some expats) and developed a social circle - which didn&#039;t last longer than my trip, but amazed me by how easy it was when I wasn&#039;t wrapped up in my own head. <br>Decided that life really wasn&#039;t so bad, at least as long as it stayed interesting.

There&#039;s a lot of nature too, see lakes, marshes, woods, beaches. You will enjoy four distinct seasons. In summer it does get busier but you can easily avoid tourist places. If you know locals they can show you private beaches. Plenty of seafood, the local dish is clam showder. The stores have fresh lobster in them if you want to cook yourself. Whale watching is the major summer activity, whales are really cool. Please try local ice cream, bagels with cream cheese, and clam chowder. If you go out there&#039;s a renaissance fair each year, King Richard&#039;s fair. If you want fresh apples or pumpkins hit up the orchards or pumpkin patches come autumn. Cranberries are a local product so get cranberry juice, and in the winter the bogs freeze over and you can skate on them. And if you go up to Boston, try to museum of science, and the duck boats.

There&#039;s no connection whatsoever between them and the young women they marry, they can barely communicate. It&#039;s painful to watch. I remember old guys awkwardly telling their girlfriends they&#039;ll give them money to go buy shoes or something generic like that, obviously not knowing anything about those women. The idea of dating/marrying some young girl who doesn&#039;t give a shit about you, probably resents you, and who you have no connection with, is much more depressing than being alone. There is something very creepy and wrong with a lot of the old sexpats down there, it kind of makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.<br><br>At the same time, you&#039;re right, these are old guys and I can&#039;t blame some of them for wanting to go around and fuck some attractive girls (though I find Cambodians ugly). Spending old age in a cheap tropical country with hot women doesn&#039;t sound bad at all. While I am judgmental of those creepy guys, I&#039;ve also known guys who brought back foreign wives who were younger, and they seemed quite happy. So maybe there&#039;s a right way and a wrong way to do it. It&#039;s also noticeable that it seems like women usually age a lot worse than men, so I see it all the time where there&#039;s a pretty good looking dude in his 60s, with a hideous, completely un-sexual woman his same age, and the disparity between them is depressing. I can very easily see myself getting a hot younger wife when I&#039;m older. But the key thing is, there would have to be a real personal connection, because relationships are really about the company. If you feel no personal connection, then you might as well just fuck random hookers on your free time. I believe the thing that&#039;s worse than being alone, is being with people who make you feel all alone.", "time": 1673223133, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2386695, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)19:19:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2386691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2386691</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t waste my breathe on these guys.

But lo, the bus is overbooked! Heated phonecalls from the driver and two of the travel agents appear. After more discussions and phonecalls a rusty heap of a bus with ominous, black fumes surrounding it is summoned. While one travel agent tries to convince the last passengers to board the death trap another realizes they don&#039;t need a second bus for 6 passengers. Another deliberation and a minivan loads the passengers. While the unneeded bus driver isn&#039;t happy about this, the travel agents hash it out with him as the bus finally leaves, minivan close behind. After a quick 60km detour through winding mountain roads because the driver forgot his lunchbox you are now on your way! <br><br>I&#039;d recommend just booking the first two - three nights of accommodation after flying in iot get your bearings and give you time to book the next step on site.", "time": 1673834621, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2391055, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)21:38:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2390878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2390878</a><br>where do you meet these girls?", "time": 1673836711, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2391069, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:24:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2391047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2391047</a><br>Sounds like good advise, the integrity of these agents seems poor.

A room without a window can be depressing. The money isn&#039;t a deal breaker. If I can find a hotel with a good view, and good location, then great. The options I currently found are supposedly in bad areas. I was told the China Town is kinda not a good area. I&#039;d like to not spend more than 500 USD for the month for the room. But I just see these studios in these great condos, with amazing views at night, in great locations, and they are actually cheaper than the hotels I&#039;m looking at. Like some of these studios go between 1800- 2100 in the local currency. Which at the lowest is like 400 USD. I just see that and feel if I miss out on that it&#039;s kinda a bummer.

You have the internet available, so use it. You can go minimalist and winging it or you can make a full day by day itinerary where you pick certain stops per day and plan a route to visit all of them. If you search online you may find sample routes for places you want to go to which you can alter at will based on your own interests. Look up lists of landmarks, museums, historical sites, hidden gems, hot spots in town and then find out which ones you want to go to and which ones you can skip on. Once you know where to go, find ways to connect them. If they&#039;re all in a circle around your accommodation, divide that circle into quadrants and explore it in a loop so you hit your interests and see the town on the way to and back. You can even find quality restaurants ahead of time per area and go to those the day you head out. It&#039;s really no different from mapping out a day in your own town. Something like:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;want to go see city hall in my small town</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh and there&#039;s a museum a few blocks away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s even a really beautiful park further down from the museum</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s going to be around lunchtime when I go, theres a restaurant with great reviews between the museum and park so i can stop there</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;after the park i&#039;ll need to make my way back, but ill return in a circle instead of a straight line back to check out a church and another museum before I leave</span><br>It&#039;s that simple, people really overestimate planning for travel. It takes a few hours at most to have everything ready, from bookings to day-to-day itineraries. <br><br>Speaking of bookings, do not use sites that book for you. Always book directly with an airline/hotel. If there&#039;s a problem and you book directly, then the place that fucked you has to deal with you themselves. If a booking agency fucks up, then you don&#039;t deal with the hotel or airline, you deal with the agency, which means you&#039;re fucked because they won&#039;t give you a fix when you need it, only after.", "time": 1673899597, "resto": 2391137}, {"no": 2391479, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)15:15:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2391399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2391399</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how fucked if i lose my phone?</span><br>About as fucked as you&#039;d be if you lost your phone right now.

I just want to stress the same points that other people made, bring only a backpack (40L-55L max imo, go to r/onebag for more info and realize that you can do laundry abroad) so that you can stay mobile and avoid spending extra money for checked baggage. In addition, I highly agree with being spontaneous. I personally like to AVOID planning too much beforehand because you end up spoiling a little bit of what you&#039;re going to see; however, I personally mark places on google maps near where I am staying such that I can do something in case I am bored. Again friend, I hope you end up going through with this trip, I can guarantee that you won&#039;t regret it if you stray outside of your comfort zone by trying new things and talking to people within your hostel or just on the street. I know this is 4chan and all of us are socially inward/outcasts in some way, but I can personally tell you that traveling by myself to a foreign country has done wonders to my self confidence (second to boxing) and I find myself far more comfortable with social situations and just talking to complete strangers. Being by yourself in a foreign country makes you lonely, which ends up forcing you to talk to other people you meet (which is a good thing!). <br><br>I&#039;m personally jealous that you&#039;re able to go to Japan and for so long!

Making friends in India is reasonably easy. However, the sorts of people who are most likely to approach you in the street will be interested in you because you&#039;re &quot;different.&quot; You can sometimes meet decent people this way, but you might not have anything in common. Furthermore, they might simply want to show you off as their &quot;cool foreign friend.&quot;<br><br>Dating is a slightly different story. Living in India longer-term makes dating easier, especially if you&#039;re looking for something serious--many women won&#039;t want to go out with someone who&#039;s only here for a few weeks or a few months. <br><br>Other than that, well--it completely fucking depends on you.
