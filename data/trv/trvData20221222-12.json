Ireland on whole I found unappealing. Dublin has some nice sights for a weekend trip, but all of it is ruined by how much of a shithole that city is. Just unsafe all around, with police doing absolutely nothing. People like to meme immigrants as some sort of a constant threat, and there&#039;s some truth to it, but Ireland was the only 1st world country where I was more worried about the local Irish than any shady looking immigrant. It has some nice nature, but otherwise the place is extremely boring. When they&#039;re not aggressive assholes, Irish are extremely self loathing and half of their identity is hating the English.

But UK suffers from fairly awful people all around, Brits are extremely passive aggressive and annoying cunts typically. Food is quite grim too. Average kebab is absolute garbage compared to rest of the Europe. Native cuisine isn&#039;t much to write home about, crumpets and Bath bun are the only things I enjoyed. Fish and chips is alright, tb h I found it weird how despite being surrounded by the ocean they hardly eat much fish. Compare it to Spaniards who eat fish and seafood extensively and how half of their cuisine is based around it too, especially in coastal cities. Weather is indeed awful, it&#039;s great if you hate the sun. Average Brit is also quite ugly for some reason.

Its a suburb of a surburb, I never went up into every mountain parts of these neighborhoods , but its proabably just sarisari stores, vulcanizing shops, karoke machines, and crowing roosters.They also have a really big cement plant, so if your into heavy industry instead of cooming you can go look at dudes make cement. The only place I can recommend here is blueridges mountain resort. Rooms are 2k, but it has a kino view of the mountainside and a nice pool. Do bring a date and preferrebaly your own transportation though....its a trek up that mountain for sure. <br><br>CarCar: This is the end of the suburbs of suburbs, and the start of the province proper. The have a roundabout in their plaza, and you have the option of going right, or continuing straight. For the purpose of this guide we will continue straight heading south along the coastal road<br><br>Sibonga: Nothing to see here. They have a wet market if you are staying in a nearby resort and want to grill some meats. <br><br>Argao: Check out mahayahay beach if you&#039;re on a budget, the maayo hotel if your on a medium budget, or panorama de argao for a kino view of the mountains and more luxurious hotel experience<br><br>Dalaguete: They have a beach that I would classify as &quot;MEHHH&quot;.

The roads are shitty going up there so either be a more experienced motorcycle driver or let kuya drive and backride. <br><br>Oslob: Ahhhhh the famous Oslob. Every tourist tout will try to get you to go here. You can swim with some whale sharks for 1k pesos, locals are 500 pesos......photographs will be 500 pesos. You will see alot of boomers with their 20 year gfs here. It&#039;s the most basic bitch tourist attraction in the whole of Cebu. Tumalog falls is also nice, do visit there.

Every tout will recommend you this. You will see groups of Asian tourists walking around with life vests and helmets, touts will harasss you almost non stop, and you&#039;ll hardly be able to walk or enjoy the view because of the crowds. It&#039;s the only place I&#039;ve ever seen a fucking traffic jam at a waterfall I&#039;m being dead ass serious. Lambug beach is also located here, and is probably one of the best public beaches in Cebu.....white sand, blue water, not rocky, accommodation on the beach etc. Kansanto springs is a more local spot where you can have a picnic and a cold swim. <br><br>Moalboal: This is a nice beach town. Lots of foreigners here. Split between 2 beaches....White Beach and Panagsama. White beach is more suitable to swimming as its less rocky, but you&#039;ll have less choice of accomidation and they will be of lower quality. Panagsama beach is a bit more rocky, but they have better accommodation/food choices there. It&#039;s one of the few places in the province that has some semblance of a nightlife. Chili bar is nice during sunset, and they used to have a disco that had lots of beautiful women in there, both pinay and foreign, but I&#039;m not sure if it survived the pandemic.

Malls in the Philippines serve many functions. MOST (not all.....all you conyo Filipinos shut the fuck up, sit down and listen) Filipinos can&#039;t actually afford anything in the larger malls. They go there because it&#039;s one of the few places they can get free aircon/wifi, people watch, window shop, variety of foods etc. They are some of the cleanest and best maintained places in the Philippines. This being said, these are some of the most densely populated places, and if your mission is hunting for a girl/boy/ladyboy WHATEVER, these are great places and must not be overlooked. Not only do malls provide traditional shopping, but they provide fianancial services (money transfers.....western union, money gram etc), and package delivery (DHL, UPS etc), along with being transportaion hubs for public utility vehichles (PUVS). This combination insures these places are always filled with people from opening to close. <br><br>I will share every mall in Cebu city proper with a brief description.

Many food options here ranging from classic Filipino, to Greek. They have a cinema if going to the movies is your thing. Must visit if in Cebu city. <br><br>2. SM CITY: Oldest major mall (I think) in Cebu. Located on Ouano avenue (a main artery of Cebu). Every person will know how to get here by instinct, I would consider this as the proverbial heart of Cebu. The Radisson blu is connected to the mall (nicer hotel with great lobby), and the bayfront hotel is across the street (midrange hotel). The mall itself is showing it&#039;s age. They have a bowling alley and cinema for entertaining your family.<br><br>3. SM Seaside: Newest major mall situated on the main road leading out of Cebu City. It&#039;s also connected to the newly constructed bridge (CCLEX), so it&#039;s the closet major mall to those living/staying in LapuLapu city/Cordova. Nice complex with a kino roof area/lounge. Seaside has a cinema and a ice skating rink. The cebu ocean park is also connected to the mall......an okay aquarium by international standards, but with a nice restaurant attached.....kino views and very instagramable for your girlfriend.", "time": 1670340331, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368785, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)10:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368769</a><br>4. Robinsons Galleria: Located just up the road from SM City. Has a decent hotel attached to the complex (summit galleria) . Has a tgifridays AND denny&#039;s (many memories of drunken fights at 3am in my local dennys in Miami.....here in the Philippines its a &quot;classy&quot; resturant LOOOL). <br><br>5. Robinsons Fuente: Located in Osmena circle, right up the street from the infamous mango square. On the first floor, theirs a vendor who sells &quot;TOBACCO&quot; pipes and rolling papers.....other than that it&#039;s not much in there except your standard fastfood and grocery store. <br><br>6. Parkmall: Located in Mandaue adjacent to BAI hotel. Mixed indoor/outdoor mall with a grocery store and lots of food options. Major transportation hub for PUV&#039;s. Good people watching in the afternoon for a more local flavor<br><br>7. City Times square: This can be considered part of parkmall as it right across the street. Outdoor stripmall type......has a few good bars and restaurants attached. Queensland hotel is here as well, for all your short time boomboom needs. <br><br>8. Pacific mall MANDAUE: Located just off the bridge coming from lapulapu city. Medium sized mall with your standard Jolibee/chowking offerings. Transportation hub for those headed into the northern suburbs of cebu <br><br>9. J Centre Mall (Jmall): Medium sized mall located in Mandaue. Most notable feature is their Bureau of Immigration office. If you live here as a foreigner for a while you will need to come here eventually. Decent hotel attached, and a nice bar (SENTRAL) located 1 minute walk away. <br><br>10. Elizabeth mall (Emall): Located adjacent to the south bus terminal. Smaller mall. Has a ghetto public school (ACT) attached, good place to people watch. For some reason I see ALOT of Africans in this mall, I can&#039;t fucking explain it, but I&#039;m working on figuring it out.", "time": 1670341983, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2369016, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:22:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368785</a><br>11. Ayala Central Block: Newer mall situated in IT park across the street from the park social and sugbu mercado. Lots of call center people open to foreigners around this area. Make sure to tell your driver AYALA in IT PARK, because if you just say &quot;Ayala&quot; they will take you to the Ayala center for sure.<br>12. JY Centre: Smaller mall in the Lahug neighborhood with a few food options, and a Mcdonalds for the Amerimutts. This is mainly used a jump off point for those going up into the mountains to see the TOPS viewpoint. Lots of motortaxi drivers will hang out here and try to take you up the mountain on a tour<br><br>13. Gaisano country mall: Outdoor Shopping area located in Mandaue. I&#039;ve driven by this many times but never went in, so I can&#039;t really report as to what&#039;s there, but it IS THERE. <br><br>14. Gaisano Main/138 mall/Colonade: I&#039;ve included these all together as they are in the same general vicinity (walking distance). All three of these are on, or very near to Colon street. Most Gaisano &quot;malls&quot; are not really malls so to speak, but more like big department stores. 138 and colonade sell a bunch of cheap knockoff shit from China, but theirs some good looking girls in there I&#039;LL TELL YOU WHATTTTT<br><br>15.Gaisano Tisa/Gaisano jai alai/Gaisano mandaue central/Gaisano mandaue north: YEA theirs like 10 of these things in the greater Cebu area, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some, so cebuBros correct me if I&#039;m missing anything. These are more ghetto malls, your gonna see lots of flip flops, basketball shorts, knockoff basketball jerseys, and ankle bracelets.

SM Consalacion: Smaller Sm mall located on the northern outskirts of Cebu. Kind of out the way if your staying in the city center, but it&#039;s the last stop before you start heading into the northern provinces. <br><br>17. Marina Mall: Located in LapuLapu city. This is mall in closet proximity to the airport. Standard jolibee/ chowking affair, nothing special. Their is another mall across the street (it&#039;s a gaisano mall), but as their is ANOTHER gaisano mall located a few meters down the road, I refer to both as Marina mall. The drivers have lived in the neighbnorhood their whole life and they still get the 2 malls mixed up, so just say Marina mall. <br><br>18. Gaisano Island mall: Located on lapu lapu a few meters from marina mall.....Known locally as Island mall. Theirs a beauru of immigration office inside, so if you live in lapulapu, its much more convient than going all the way into the city for your visa extensions. <br><br>19. Tamiya: This is an outdoor outlet style mall. On google maps, this is marked as &quot;THE SHOPS AT PUEBLO VERDE&quot;, or &quot;PUEBLO VERDE&quot;. If you tell a driver to take you to Pueblo verde, he will look at you like your stupid. For some reason everyone calls this area tamiya, you have to say tamiya or they won&#039;t know where the fuck you&#039;re talking about. I have many fond memories in Tamiya. Pre-pandemic they used to have a disco and a restobar in here, and I picked up quite a few girls just drinking in front of the 7/11 there (not hookers just horny young women). It&#039;s a bit more subdued now, but it&#039;s still a major transportation hub for LapuLapu city and they have several large factories nearby, so this place gets packed with people in the late afternoon. LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS who work in factories making 200 dollars a month praying and hoping you&#039;ll save them can be found in this area.

I went to Rome and felt the exact way described in OP. Wherever you go, there are you. And if you seek a new geographical location thinking you&#039;re going to escape from some sort of suffering you will learn your body shadows every step you take. Or to put it more clearly, if you&#039;re depressed it won&#039;t make a different to you wandering your depressed body somewhere else. The problem is within. <br><br>And fundamentally the world or rather being alive, being a human body is much of the sameness. You exist as your body and it doesn&#039;t matter where in the world you are, much if the day is spent dealing with its needs - finding shelter, cleaning, cooking, buying food, eating, finding comfort, clothes, sex, water, walking to places, etc, etc. Our lives really are just dealing with the burdens of our bodies. Just even more fundamentally every moment I&#039;m not in deep sleep I&#039;m adjusting my position, shifting from 1 foot to the other, relieving pressure somewhere. I&#039;m on a bus at the moment and sitting isn&#039;t just this passive comfortability - it&#039;s an active constant shift of weight and pressure. It hurts to sit for long periods of time. This is just an illustration of how burdensome our bodies are. <br><br>And really, how different are other places anyway? It&#039;s just the content of what your sense changes, rather than the structure. There&#039;s still your body, your visual field, the sounds you hear. What&#039;s really changing? The trees might look a little different, the foods might taste a little different. Nothing fundamentally has changed. You&#039;re still a body of burdens in an external world that is cold and indifferent to your needs. <br><br>Just keep in mind that &quot;tourism&quot;, &quot;travelling&quot; is an industry.

And if the material changes, there is a huge probability that you will change as you are a product of your environment to which your thoughts reflect upon and your acts interact with. Simply put, by changing your environment, you can change yourself. <br>But it has to be a meaningful experience. If all you do is go to a hotel, do some sightseeing for a couple of days and then come back, then yes, you&#039;re not doing shit. But if you do it in a certain way, travel can be great shock therapy by putting you in a completely novel environment and make you become someone you couldn&#039;t have been by staying put. We are not beings of pure willpower capable of changing in a vacuum. And moving to a very different physical and cultural location can be a good catalyst for change. <br>Of course, if it is a short term experience where you shelter yourself and keep yourself in your comfort zone (i.e doing nothing really novel) by really just doing what you could do back home, you&#039;re not doing shit. It&#039;s like going to the beach. You&#039;ve definitely made the effort to move from your home which is dry to an area where you can get wet, but if you didn&#039;t go ahead and made an effort to swim, you&#039;re still dry, so you haven&#039;t really achieved anything. <br><br>Doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t enjoy yourself, though.

Fuck those scam convenience stores in hotels where nothing is priced. Knew I was going to get ripped off so I tried experimenting just buying a can of Monster. 8 fucking dollars.

Room was nice and clean though.<br><br>Was disappointed by the lack of effort put into xmas decorations other than at The Bellagio which literally had the most impressive xmas display I&#039;ve ever seen. Big slots person so I blew loads of money at the various casinos. Slots were disappointingly homogenised, 95% of the slots were the same at every casino, no huge giant $100,000,000 megabucks displays any more (there are some large jackpot machines but they&#039;re non-descript). They&#039;re incredibly low volatility compared to UK slots, no chance of a big win, they just slowly eat your money<br><br>The shops are also really shitty now. Almost entirely high end shops. Weird going through Caesars, Aria and the Bellagio and same ultra expensive shops that are completely empty whilst the walkways outside them are packed. I know these shops don&#039;t need to make that many sales a day to make money but passing 3-4 empty Louis Vuitton shops at different casinos in a day makes suspect that they don&#039;t make any money and they&#039;re just subsidised by the casinos so they can say they have high end shopping in there.", "time": 1671459843, "resto": 2373639}, {"no": 2375542, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:23:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2375396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2375396</a><br>I&#039;m sorry you had to find out the hard way what a tourist trap Vegas has turned into.

Bunch of touts in Tunis, tons of stray dogs and cats everywhere. Lots of cats actually. No amenities firsties like me kinda take for granted, like trash cans, pedestrian areas, sidewalks, parks, public restrooms, playgrounds etc. Landscapes are mostly lackluster, it&#039;s all so fucking dry and brown.

Objectively speaking there&#039;s little reason to go there when you could just stay in neighboring Europe instead and experience more natural beauty, history and culture virtually anywhere with a lot more comfort and less stress. Tunis is well-connected to Europe by cheap ferry lines though and Tunisia, despite all its problems, is a beginner-friendly country by African standards, so it was kind of a nobrainer for me to check it out.

I&#039;ve prioritized location over form, so two neighbouring counties similar in size might look very different on the map, or an otherwise square county might look elongated, but they usually border each other where they should. Virginia, with its whopping 95 counties and 38 (!) independent cities, was particularly difficult. New Kent and Charles City for example are located next to each other on the map, despite being north-south of each other in real life. New York City is another case, where their five bouroughs also functions as counties, but they should be recognizable enough on the map.

A square around it would probably be best, because as of now it looks like a subdivision of Haiti, but that creates a new problem with the rest of the USMOI, which should then have borders too, for consistency&#039;s sake. Problem is they&#039;re too spread out for a single square, and unlike for example the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, there isn&#039;t a larger territory that could have a square, with the rest of the smaller islands connected to that. Separating them isn&#039;t a good idea if you ask me. It&#039;s treated as a single territory, and most Real Travellers will be lucky to visit even one of them in their lifetime. They&#039;re uninhabited and mostly off limits to ordinary people, and separating them would also open the door for separating the aforementioned French southern islands.

I hitchhiked between these places too, so I saw Dolomiti up close. Then I left and went through much of Northern Italy until Parma, then hit the road between Parma and La Spezia. Then I got to Genoa and took a train to a town outside to continue. I was getting fed up with hitchhiking, so I took another train to Nice. From there I hitchhiked again. The easiest countries were France and Poland. In general Eastern Europe was easy too. Italy was super hard, it took me a week to get from Friuli to Genova. Only place where I had good luck was Dolomiti. This is why I cut through mountains to reach Liguria as I thought that crossing up north would be more difficult, but instead there was hardly any traffic there.

You don&#039;t necessarily get what you pay for. But you get six months visa free as a Yank, which makes it a convenient place to duck out of Schengen and visit. Haters will, of course, hate. <br><br>There&#039;s also the advantage of it being English-speaking, so easier to navigate in general than, say, Albania, which is actually a wonderful place in some respects but extremely rough around the edges. Really, it&#039;s pretty rough all over. Extremely cheap and pretty friendly, though, and Americans can get in for a year visa free. The language is difficult, though, with no living relatives, so communication with about 70% of the population isn&#039;t necessarily easy, although you may meet guest workers who&#039;ve come back from Italy, Greece, or Germany, in that order, if you speak any of those, and lots of young people obviously study English. <br><br>Romania, still unable to get into Schengen, is quite civilized nowadays in the nice parts of Bucharest or Sibiu or Brasov or wherever... people also say nice things about Timisoara, but I&#039;ve never been there.

Open brothel district where you can see all the girls sitting at the front of their shops, and you pick one and go. There&#039;s very little Japanese needed, even though it helps during sex, and they are very open to foreigners. Matsushima Shinchi, also in Osaka, is the same, but there are fewer shops, and the quality of the girls isn&#039;t at the same level. Tobita&#039;s level of girls is super high; some are idol- and model-tier and would be the kind of girls you see at luxury/high-end soaplands. Tobita is by far my favorite if you&#039;re mainly concerned about looks and want to get the prettiest and cutest girl possible without risking getting baited by photoshopped/old pics (soaplands are notorious for this). Service can feel a little distant because they&#039;re so pretty and in high demand, but some of the best fucks I&#039;ve had were a matter of finding the right girl. And going at nighttime with all the lights and just seeing a huge variety of girls (little loli type, slutty gyaru, shrine maiden outfits, nurses, kimonos) is intoxicating.<br><br>Soaplands are better if you want to have more time and a less rushed experience, but the quality of girls can vary a lot, and you have to pay top dollar to fuck the prettiest ones. A bit more Japanese is necessary to enter and to schedule things, but it can be done. Yoshiwara in Tokyo is probably your best bet as a foreigner, and that place is kind of well-known for having girls that do NS (No Skin) and NN (Nakadashi), so raw sex is possible, although that might not be an option for you if they&#039;re wary about you because you&#039;re a foreigner.<br><br>Delivery/Hotel Health where girls are delivered to your selected love hotel is good and can be priced fairly, but you&#039;re paying for the love hotel. Lots of JAV girls also work for these shops. Intercourse is not necessarily guaranteed with these, and your mileage may vary for the shop and girls. Much more Japanese needed to schedule and arrange everything.", "time": 1669251232, "resto": 2355325}, {"no": 2362272, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)20:07:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2362269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2362269</a><br>For real?

Our cities are most trash. Although Rio de Janeiro is worth it. In the south there&#039;s Iguazu Falls and if you want to party/go to the beach Florian\u00f3polis and Balne\u00e1rio Camboriu. In the state of SP, Ilhabela. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, besides the capital, there&#039;s the colonial town of Paraty and Angra dos Reis, great places to spend some money chartering a boat (there&#039;s more than 365 islands in Angra dos Reis and places in Paraty like saco do mamangua and Ilha dos cocos; google it). Also Buzios and Petropolis if you\u2019re interested in Brazil\u2019s imperial past.<br>Some colonial towns in Minas Gerais, like Ouro Preto, might be nice for chilling for a few days. Lots of beaches in northeastern, although I think it&#039;s not worth it. Also, Len\u00e7ois Maranhenses, Jalap\u00e3o, Pantanal, and some jungle resort in the Amazon (you could spend 2 days in Manaus too). Oh, there&#039;s Salvador if you want to see a more African Brazil. I hate it actually.<br>People are usually very nice toward foreigners. In some touristic places, like Rio, people might try to rip you off. But normal people will treat you well. No difference for americans.

Don&#039;t wear watches and jewelry, avoid drawing attention, and use your phone inside stores. I mean, I have walked through S\u00e3o Paulo at 2 a.m. getting out of bars while drunk and nothing happened to me. That said, been raised here I\u2019m kinda streetsmart and also a bit lucky. You should be more careful. Kidnaps for the past decades have been really low, nothing to worry about. Murder has never been a problem desu. Not because it does not exist (it does happens a lot), but it actually about poor people killing poor people due to drugs and things related. It does not affect the middle class and would not affect you as a tourist. The problem is robbery attempts. Just be low profile and uber to places, specially at night. Oh, if you decide to rent a place instead of getting a hotel suite, rent a house in a gated community. <br>It would be better if you learn portuguese. As I\u2019ve said, most brazilians do not speak english. <br>Like USA, we\u2019ve received people from all over the world. Difference is that we had all permutations possible. So yes, there are hot women from every race and every mix between races. That said, when americans are not fat I would say that, in average, they look better. The top 5% brazilian women are very pretty though. The top 1% are gorgeous. But there are lots of differences between states, regions and social classes. Women here are also getting fatter (not many morbid obese though). But gym culture is also strong here, specially in Rio de Janeiro. Tl;dr I would say that women in eastern europe (russia, Poland, etc.) are the most beautiful if you sample random 1000 women from any country in the world.

I took a few trips but honestly found the country to be pretty boring and uninteresting, and I didn&#039;t really have time to travel anyways. So I just decided to save money and spend it elsewhere. My only real expense was groceries and the occasional night out, so it was easy to save ~$1800 a month. I just sent my whole salary home every month and barely touched it.<br><br>After that I went to work in Vietnam. Got a job teaching at a good language center since I had IELTS experience from my certification. Initially took a pay hit, but the hourly rate was way higher and I didn&#039;t have to work as much. Plus cheaper cost of living. Once I got my hours up to around 20-25 I was making more than Korea. And since your employer doesn&#039;t own your visa like in Korea you can hustle if you want for extra cash. Saved about $1500 a month maybe since I traveled a lot more and had to pay rent. <br><br>Now I work at a private school in Thailand making about the same as Vietnam, but with more work since I&#039;m salaried and have to be at school all day.

However, this isn&#039;t always the case - there are many jobs that will expect you to make your own lessons and deliver them without assistance.

It would be better to do the course and find out that TEFL is not for you, than to fly to another country to work and discover it there.<br><br>Of course, you should keep in mind that you can always quit a job. In the worst case scenario where you are miserable/depressed in a foreign country, you can just head to the airport and get on the first flight home.

But there are many examples of such teachers being employed elsewhere in Asia, though they are litteral wageslaves without any legal rights. They can be deported when the school doesnt need them anymore. <br>And salaries in Laos and Cambo are low, because those countries are undeveloped and being heavily invested into by China. Lots of construction is going on there. It means there is some potential for future development yet local population is still poor as fuck. <br>And no school would provide you with housing. Its not China. There are schools providing a shitty room in the campus. Thats it. Food is possible, at least Viet and Thai schools provide lunches. <br>Teaching in Laos is mostly voluntary job for either backpackers or opioid addicts. Are you one of them? Are you ready to be transported to Bkk by helicopter in case you break your leg or get seriously sick? Lao hospitals are for military, if you want to get treated, you have to order a helicopter. <br>Anyway, are you ready to live and work in Laos for 500-600 dollars a month? Paid in lao kips. And there would be almost no carreer development in this field because you lack that fucking degree. <br>If you are willing to do it, maybe i can help you to get employed, but competition is fierce even in Laos. Farangs are everywhere and they want to eat and live comfortable lives. <br>Have you got a teaching certificate? What about vaccine certificate? Whats your citizenship and race? They do want white snowflackes. They do prohibit their white monkeys to get tanned. This is Asia. <br>In conclusion, you may expect 500-600 dollars in Laos or Cambo, without housing alowance, without any expenses, maybe even without health insurance.

For the majority of people, working in either country is basically volunteering and earning enough to cover your expenses and live okay by local standards - i.e. not enough for your flights. There are decent jobs but you will need a degree for them. When I worked in Cambodia, I was at a university in the countryside and got just over $1000/month. It was a cushy gig but there are maybe 20 jobs like that in the entire country. The majority of English teachers are backpackers or retirees who wound up in the country and earn $500/month. To get those jobs you just need to be in the country.<br>It&#039;s similar in Laos - there&#039;s a handful of good jobs in Vientiane, but they aren&#039;t hiring people without degrees and experience. A big difference from Cambodia is the government doesn&#039;t make it easy for backpackers to get hired. Most English teachers in Laos are more likely to be with volunteer agencies and NGOs than anything else.<br>Having said all of that, you could lie about your degrees and experience, but you&#039;d have to be pretty convincing to get through the interviews.

Went to Bangkok for 4 days, the traffic is the worst I&#039;ve ever seen, so because of that alone I&#039;ll probably never go there again. However, it&#039;s a cool city. It&#039;s huge and there is lots to do. Never seen such big malls. You can find literally anything there. I just feel, they try to rip foreigners off who go there to shop. In Bangkok, I matched with a couple local girls and one time I was at some night club with my homie. Coincidentally, a girl I&#039;ve matched with was also there, so we texted and met there in personn. Before I continue, asian girls are not my type. I like round, big booty bitches like latinas and asian girls are for the most part pretty flat. So this girl I matched with looked thick in a good way. Keyword &quot;looked&quot;..because when I met her at the night club she was just fat. And also pretty tall for an asian girl, granted she had heels on. Either way I immediately knew I wasn&#039;t attracted to her but she was on my proverbial dick the whole time. We then went to watch a World Cup game (Argentina-Mexico it was) with her friends. The game was over at 4 am and then she drove me and my friend to our hotel. Kept texting me but I kept shrugging her off. Met a different girl a day later and god damn what a body she had. We were outside until 4 am, she showed me the street where most of the hoes are and also showed me Soi Cowboy. I was literally grabbed by the dick by some 30-40 year old woman (I think) who wanted me to get into her bar. After those 4 days we went to Phuket. Caught a sunburn like a dumbass on the first day at the pool. Stayed in Patong area, which was an interesting place. I have to say, the locals in Thailand are extremely friendly and sweet. I truly love those motherfuckers for real.", "time": 1671403507, "resto": 2366806}, {"no": 2375079, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)18:04:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2375072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2375072</a><br>Oh and about that second girl with the great body I forgot to mention we were outside until like after 4 am. We then took a taxi to her place, on the way there we were stopped by thai police. They checked pur pockets told me to show them my wallet. There I had 3 condoms, which the police officer saw, this was pretty embarrassing for me and I told him that but he laughed it off. Was very friendly too, then he let us go on our way. Then at here place we of course fucked and my god she was fucking incredible. She had fake tits, which I didn&#039;t know and fucked like a pornstar. Truly 10/10 experience it was. Also immediately gave me head, bitches in here europe usually don&#039;t do that so quickly from my experience. Anyway, we fell asleep at like 6 am and at 1.15 pm I had the flight to Phuket with my friend. So, I set my alarm clock at around 8.15 am, woke up tired af, said goodbye to the girl, went outside and it felt like a fucking movie. I was so out of place there, cars driving by, countless thai ppl by the street doing their thing and I was trying to find a taxi through the &#039;Grab&#039; app but for some fucking reason I couldn&#039;t find a damn taxi. So I tried my luck the old school way by waving my hand to approaching taxis, still no luck. At that point 30 minutes went by and I was getting nervous about arriving too late to the hotel where I&#039;d meet my friend to check out and then drive to the airport. Then I asked some locals and as nice as they are, some elderly woman tells a taxi driver to take me in but he kept saying &quot;no gas, no gas&quot;. But the dude still took me inside his car, drove 3 minutes &amp; said something like &quot;okay you can go here&quot;. Took me a moment to figure out he drove me to a Sky Train station from where it took my only like 15-20 minutes to get back to my hotel (just in time). My Vietnamese friend who also barely got any sleep is a good guy cuz he packed my bags for me, he knew I was running late.

There&#039;s personal stakes there. I remember there was talk about Epic Universe a while back and someone was wondering why they decided to go for a How to Train Your Dragon-themed land when Dreamworks has so many different IPs they could use, why limit it to just that one. It&#039;s the same thing. You could argue Shrek is by far the most famous and well-known Dreamworks property, but people aren&#039;t wishing they could live in the swamp or hang out with these fairy tale weirdoes. They like it as a movie and that&#039;s it. HTTYD is not only probably the most critically well regarded franchise they have, but it also has a big core fanbase like HP (albeit not as huge), but it most importantly fulfills that wish fulfillment aspect. The dragons in the movies (especially Toothless) are lovable and cute and make people want them, but also literally everyone has dreamed about flying at some point in their lives. Being able to fly on the back of a dragon is just such a simple idea that hits an extremely large group of people.

Unlike other media like televison and movies which always ask &quot;where do we take the story from here?&quot;, Theme Parks should 100% laser focus on presenting the audience with things they already know and love when handling IP, or really any existing theme. The entire point of going to Harry Potter World is to see a real-life recreation of Harry Potter&#039;s universe and to do the things you read about as a child. If Universal mirrored Disney&#039;s approach to their Theme Park IPs, HPW would be themed to the French Academy from Goblet of Fire and when guests asked &quot;Where is Harry?&quot;, staff would have to laboriously explain over and over why Harry isn&#039;t around, similar to why Darth Vader, Yoda, and Luke aren&#039;t at Galaxy&#039;s Edge. <br><br>However, I can somewhat understand why they took the approach they did. Star Wars, unlike HP, takes place on multiple planets across a whole galaxy. The diversity of the planets is one of the primary draws. So even if you were to theme a land to the original trilogy with HP-level immersion, there exists the issue of scale.

Star Wars is popular on the level HP is, and HP is going to be spread out across 3 separate parks, so why not one-up them there?

The track didn&#039;t hold up as promised and repairs are very expensive and can&#039;t be done in situ (as you could with a normal wood coaster) because of the prefab system. I also blame their decision to run heavy, long trains on it with few wheels. Each car has 3 rows which puts enormous forces on just 4 wheels. It seems like such an outdated vehicle (an iteration of 1960s PTC trains) when compared to a Millennium Flyer, a successful, comfortable, contemporary wooden coaster train.

I&#039;m surprised they managed to make it a lot better than I was expecting, all those moving enemies, Yoshi&#039;s and spinning coins make for some of the best kinematics I&#039;ve ever seen in any theme park.

If you have a card, debit or credit, with a Visa or Mastercard logo on it, you can typically use it for purchases almost anywhere such things are accepted, which in the modern era is more or less everywhere. ID is not typically required. Some countries will demand to look at your passport when exchanging money, some will not, but I\u2019ve never been asked for ID anywhere in the world (roughly 100 countries) just because I wanted to use a card.

They are ruthless price gougers, opportunistic and cruel. You would have to deal with these degenerates to get what you want, which is very morally questionable (since you appear to have strong principles, this may matter) since you&#039;re basically funding a human trafficking ring, not out of necessity, but because you want to travel without a passport. <br><br>And when all is said and done and you find them by asking around in the slummiest, scummiest parts of town, the nicer people will laugh it off and suggest you to leave before something happens to you, the normal ones will tell you to fuck off and the worst ones will actually play along with you until they can rob you.
