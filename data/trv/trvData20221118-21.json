Society comes to a halt as people turn inwardly towards their families for an entire month of drunken carousal. Colombians will take any excuse to party that they can get, every other week on their calendar has a long weekend, and Christmas and New Year&#039;s provides the best excuse there is. <br>Taxi and Uber drivers will clock out at 3pm to go day drink with their loved ones. Taxi drivers are the most arrogant of all, since Uber is technically illegal there, though it&#039;s still widely used.

If you speak Spanish, and even if you don&#039;t, drivers are generally happy to shoot the shit with you. They&#039;re flattered to see a foreigner decide to visit their country. If you get along with them, you can even ask for their numbers, and ask if they&#039;d be ok with you contacting them for rides once in a while. Many will be pleased with this sort of arrangement. And it can save your ass when you&#039;re out with a girl late at night, the streets are emptying out, and you can&#039;t find transportation. <br>Never get into a car that a Colombian girl has procured for you until you know you can trust her, even if it&#039;s a taxi.

The Southern Railway connects to most of the major districts in the state and from there you can just take a cab/auto to wherever you&#039;re going. The exception to this is Western Ghats where there are no railways as far as I know. There aren&#039;t even many public buses that run from major cities to the hill stations desu (and the ones that do exist are at odd hours), so your only options are taxis and private buses. Buses are really unsafe especially around the monsoon; idk if you&#039;ve ever been to the mountainous regions of India but people drive like fucking maniacs and there are one lane roads with hairpin turns and no guardrails. Me and my girlfriend actually missed a bus from Munnar to Kochi and we were really pissed because we had to stay an extra day at our accommodation. Literally three hours later our AirBNB host called to tell us that that exact same bus drove off a cliff and a bunch of people died. Was like a fucking final destination scene and I was pretty rattled because I nearly got us killed to save like $50.

Cash is fine for those situations but trying to order/book things online is a shitshow. I had a lot of issues booking domestic flights and using the IRCTC website was flat out impossible. I ended up having transfer money to my girlfriend&#039;s Indian bank account and have her pay for everything using Google Pay. Fucking ridiculous.

I just did a month in Italy and honestly it wasn\u2019t really much cheaper than just flying places, and it takes longer. I thought I\u2019d get the authentic European experience taking the train everywhere, but really all that happened was me being crammed into airplane style seats with obnoxious Italians taking up 3/4 the row despite being half my size. They will also just take your window seat if they arrive there first. Also, the windows are dirty half the time to the point you can\u2019t see particularly well outside of them anyways. The internet on them doesn\u2019t work for shit, and cell service is spotty. Overall, it felt pretty pointless. If it\u2019s only an hour or two, like Rome to Florence, sure why not. But any longer and I fail to see the advantage over flying besides not having to go through security. And security at FCO was way more efficient and nice than anything TSA manages back home in the states.<br>Personally I\u2019d listen to the anon that recommended renting a car so you can go wherever and stop anywhere, but if not I\u2019d say flying is the move for anything over an hour or two. My 4 hour train ride back from Venice to Rome was complete ass. Tickets one way are anywhere from 30\u20ac-100\u20ac depending on when you book - make sure you book a couple weeks ahead at the very least. I do not think any of the train tickets are cancellable either, and if you need to change your ticket you either need a more expensive one or pay an extra fee when you do so.

You also need to eat before you get really really hungry, I learned that from cycling. By the time you are too hungry you already burned out the glyocen in your muscles and your fatigue level will greatly increase and your muscular endurance will decrease.

A significant factor in your credit score is number of applications for cards sent out and concurrent years as a member which means cancelling an account will impact your overall credit and can hurt you financially in the future when you cancel. The best thing to do is to downgrade a card of a specific company to save up on annual fees, so if you want to stop paying $695 on an amex platinum, you downgrade to their shittiest card and save about $600 a year.

Mexico can be a safe country, but the further you try to stretch your money, the less safe it will be. The same isn&#039;t true of Thailand. How much of your money do you want to spend?<br>Also consider visas. Depending on your nationality, you can probably stay in Mexico for 180 days as a tourist. In Thailand, you will need to do at least one visa run if you use 60 day tourist visas plus 30 day extensions, or two visa runs if you use tourist-exempt entries plus 30 day extensions.<br>Also consider languages. If you speak Spanish, Mexico becomes cheaper and more navigable. (You can probably learn a lot of Spanish during your stay there too, if you have the time and drive to learn it.)

I&#039;ve been hassled more in Miami and Chicago than I have walking around Mexico City, even though I am visibly white and not a local.
