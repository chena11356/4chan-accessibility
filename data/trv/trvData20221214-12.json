Ever tried making friends in a new city ? It&#039;s a fucking pain in the ass, but it&#039;s usually feasible if you&#039;re in some kind of social circles such as your workplace or some group hobby (sports or some kind of gay shit like pottery or improv) or scene. <br>People in general barely manage to make friends in these environments but imagine you&#039;re doing it in fucking Japan. Even if you spoke Japanese and Chris does, you&#039;re still fucked because your average japanese doesn&#039;t want to befriend anyone. He&#039;s content with with his partner and the friends he made through the course of his studies and that&#039;s it. And a foreigner is a hassle he certainly doesn&#039;t want to contend with. I mean fuck, that&#039;s true of a lot of people, not even in Japan or even Asia. People face similar problems in France, Russia, etc.<br>And when all is said and done all you have left is other social rejects such as the japanese who never could quite vibe with their own society (reverse weebs like that guy Chris hangs out with) or your fellow expat.

Most likely your gonna be staying in a hotel or condo, and many of those are non smoking. Forget about smoking on the street.....Filipinos are notoriously NOSEY and will inquire as to what your doing at any and all times. Even weak bud.... it stinks and .the smell wafts and lingers..... and theirs always at least 38 guards in any given hotel or condo snooping around. I really would only suggest smoking if you had a private house that your gonna be staying in for a while so you can remove the smell before you move out<br><br>Lastly , if you do ever get involved in drugs here, even if it just smoking pot for recreation NEVER EVER EVER tell anyone you use drugs. You keep that between whoever you buy it from and yourself. Never let whoever you buy from know where you are staying.....tell him you are staying in caloocan when really you stay in pasay, use an alias and/or a fake facebook account. DO NOT offer drugs to your bitches, they can and will use it against you if you have a fight....they can easily snitch and get you deported", "time": 1670227240, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368056, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)03:17:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368024</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marrying a flip</span><br>Pathetic.", "time": 1670228254, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368057, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)03:18:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368053</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all</span><br>True story.....I met a younger whiteboy from Michigan at 7/11 like 3 years ago.

Lots of foreigners here. Split between 2 beaches....White Beach and Panagsama. White beach is more suitable to swimming as its less rocky, but you&#039;ll have less choice of accomidation and they will be of lower quality. Panagsama beach is a bit more rocky, but they have better accommodation/food choices there. It&#039;s one of the few places in the province that has some semblance of a nightlife. Chili bar is nice during sunset, and they used to have a disco that had lots of beautiful women in there, both pinay and foreign, but I&#039;m not sure if it survived the pandemic.

Today&#039;s topic is MALLS. I know I know.....many of you despise malls because you&#039;re coming from America/Europe/Australia and the malls there are dead at best, and souless centers of consumerism at worst...but hear me out. Malls in the Philippines serve many functions. MOST (not all.....all you conyo Filipinos shut the fuck up, sit down and listen) Filipinos can&#039;t actually afford anything in the larger malls. They go there because it&#039;s one of the few places they can get free aircon/wifi, people watch, window shop, variety of foods etc. They are some of the cleanest and best maintained places in the Philippines. This being said, these are some of the most densely populated places, and if your mission is hunting for a girl/boy/ladyboy WHATEVER, these are great places and must not be overlooked. Not only do malls provide traditional shopping, but they provide fianancial services (money transfers.....western union, money gram etc), and package delivery (DHL, UPS etc), along with being transportaion hubs for public utility vehichles (PUVS). This combination insures these places are always filled with people from opening to close. <br><br>I will share every mall in Cebu city proper with a brief description. Firstly, their are tiers of malls, and you will find a different type of person depending on the tier. <br>1. Ayala malls<br>2. Sm malls<br>3.Robinsons<br>4. Gaisano <br>5. Random shit.

Ayala Center: This is the best mall in cebu city. Centrally located in the buisness district and equipped with a beautiful courtyard. Their are many nice hotels situated within walking distance to this malls. Freelance hookers can be found prowling, especially around bo&#039;s coffee, tgiFridays, and the Social (bar/lounge located on the top level.....infamous for foreigner hunters). Many food options here ranging from classic Filipino, to Greek. They have a cinema if going to the movies is your thing. Must visit if in Cebu city. <br><br>2. SM CITY: Oldest major mall (I think) in Cebu. Located on Ouano avenue (a main artery of Cebu). Every person will know how to get here by instinct, I would consider this as the proverbial heart of Cebu. The Radisson blu is connected to the mall (nicer hotel with great lobby), and the bayfront hotel is across the street (midrange hotel). The mall itself is showing it&#039;s age. They have a bowling alley and cinema for entertaining your family.<br><br>3. SM Seaside: Newest major mall situated on the main road leading out of Cebu City. It&#039;s also connected to the newly constructed bridge (CCLEX), so it&#039;s the closet major mall to those living/staying in LapuLapu city/Cordova. Nice complex with a kino roof area/lounge. Seaside has a cinema and a ice skating rink. The cebu ocean park is also connected to the mall......an okay aquarium by international standards, but with a nice restaurant attached.....kino views and very instagramable for your girlfriend.", "time": 1670340331, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368785, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)10:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368769</a><br>4. Robinsons Galleria: Located just up the road from SM City. Has a decent hotel attached to the complex (summit galleria) . Has a tgifridays AND denny&#039;s (many memories of drunken fights at 3am in my local dennys in Miami.....here in the Philippines its a &quot;classy&quot; resturant LOOOL). <br><br>5. Robinsons Fuente: Located in Osmena circle, right up the street from the infamous mango square. On the first floor, theirs a vendor who sells &quot;TOBACCO&quot; pipes and rolling papers.....other than that it&#039;s not much in there except your standard fastfood and grocery store. <br><br>6. Parkmall: Located in Mandaue adjacent to BAI hotel. Mixed indoor/outdoor mall with a grocery store and lots of food options. Major transportation hub for PUV&#039;s. Good people watching in the afternoon for a more local flavor<br><br>7. City Times square: This can be considered part of parkmall as it right across the street. Outdoor stripmall type......has a few good bars and restaurants attached. Queensland hotel is here as well, for all your short time boomboom needs. <br><br>8. Pacific mall MANDAUE: Located just off the bridge coming from lapulapu city. Medium sized mall with your standard Jolibee/chowking offerings. Transportation hub for those headed into the northern suburbs of cebu <br><br>9. J Centre Mall (Jmall): Medium sized mall located in Mandaue. Most notable feature is their Bureau of Immigration office. If you live here as a foreigner for a while you will need to come here eventually. Decent hotel attached, and a nice bar (SENTRAL) located 1 minute walk away. <br><br>10. Elizabeth mall (Emall): Located adjacent to the south bus terminal. Smaller mall. Has a ghetto public school (ACT) attached, good place to people watch. For some reason I see ALOT of Africans in this mall, I can&#039;t fucking explain it, but I&#039;m working on figuring it out.", "time": 1670341983, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2369016, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:22:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368785</a><br>11. Ayala Central Block: Newer mall situated in IT park across the street from the park social and sugbu mercado. Lots of call center people open to foreigners around this area. Make sure to tell your driver AYALA in IT PARK, because if you just say &quot;Ayala&quot; they will take you to the Ayala center for sure.<br>12. JY Centre: Smaller mall in the Lahug neighborhood with a few food options, and a Mcdonalds for the Amerimutts. This is mainly used a jump off point for those going up into the mountains to see the TOPS viewpoint. Lots of motortaxi drivers will hang out here and try to take you up the mountain on a tour<br><br>13. Gaisano country mall: Outdoor Shopping area located in Mandaue. I&#039;ve driven by this many times but never went in, so I can&#039;t really report as to what&#039;s there, but it IS THERE. <br><br>14. Gaisano Main/138 mall/Colonade: I&#039;ve included these all together as they are in the same general vicinity (walking distance). All three of these are on, or very near to Colon street. Most Gaisano &quot;malls&quot; are not really malls so to speak, but more like big department stores. 138 and colonade sell a bunch of cheap knockoff shit from China, but theirs some good looking girls in there I&#039;LL TELL YOU WHATTTTT<br><br>15.Gaisano Tisa/Gaisano jai alai/Gaisano mandaue central/Gaisano mandaue north: YEA theirs like 10 of these things in the greater Cebu area, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some, so cebuBros correct me if I&#039;m missing anything. These are more ghetto malls, your gonna see lots of flip flops, basketball shorts, knockoff basketball jerseys, and ankle bracelets.

SM Consalacion: Smaller Sm mall located on the northern outskirts of Cebu. Kind of out the way if your staying in the city center, but it&#039;s the last stop before you start heading into the northern provinces. <br><br>17. Marina Mall: Located in LapuLapu city. This is mall in closet proximity to the airport. Standard jolibee/ chowking affair, nothing special. Their is another mall across the street (it&#039;s a gaisano mall), but as their is ANOTHER gaisano mall located a few meters down the road, I refer to both as Marina mall. The drivers have lived in the neighbnorhood their whole life and they still get the 2 malls mixed up, so just say Marina mall. <br><br>18. Gaisano Island mall: Located on lapu lapu a few meters from marina mall.....Known locally as Island mall. Theirs a beauru of immigration office inside, so if you live in lapulapu, its much more convient than going all the way into the city for your visa extensions. <br><br>19. Tamiya: This is an outdoor outlet style mall. On google maps, this is marked as &quot;THE SHOPS AT PUEBLO VERDE&quot;, or &quot;PUEBLO VERDE&quot;. If you tell a driver to take you to Pueblo verde, he will look at you like your stupid. For some reason everyone calls this area tamiya, you have to say tamiya or they won&#039;t know where the fuck you&#039;re talking about. I have many fond memories in Tamiya. Pre-pandemic they used to have a disco and a restobar in here, and I picked up quite a few girls just drinking in front of the 7/11 there (not hookers just horny young women). It&#039;s a bit more subdued now, but it&#039;s still a major transportation hub for LapuLapu city and they have several large factories nearby, so this place gets packed with people in the late afternoon. LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS who work in factories making 200 dollars a month praying and hoping you&#039;ll save them can be found in this area.

Probably a meme story on /trv. I went through a long list of terrible life events, both by my own fault and out of my control.

My apartment lease was up and I moved my stuff to storage, decided to go to Japan for a few months and maybe end it afterwards or along the way.

Used her as a tour guide and went to a love hotel a few times. It was casual and I met another girl, who was clingy and (I soon discovered) crazy. Met another. Made friends with Japanese guys and girls (and some expats) and developed a social circle - which didn&#039;t last longer than my trip, but amazed me by how easy it was when I wasn&#039;t wrapped up in my own head. <br>Decided that life really wasn&#039;t so bad, at least as long as it stayed interesting.

Bunch of touts in Tunis, tons of stray dogs and cats everywhere. Lots of cats actually. No amenities firsties like me kinda take for granted, like trash cans, pedestrian areas, sidewalks, parks, public restrooms, playgrounds etc. Landscapes are mostly lackluster, it&#039;s all so fucking dry and brown.

Objectively speaking there&#039;s little reason to go there when you could just stay in neighboring Europe instead and experience more natural beauty, history and culture virtually anywhere with a lot more comfort and less stress. Tunis is well-connected to Europe by cheap ferry lines though and Tunisia, despite all its problems, is a beginner-friendly country by African standards, so it was kind of a nobrainer for me to check it out.

I&#039;ve prioritized location over form, so two neighbouring counties similar in size might look very different on the map, or an otherwise square county might look elongated, but they usually border each other where they should. Virginia, with its whopping 95 counties and 38 (!) independent cities, was particularly difficult. New Kent and Charles City for example are located next to each other on the map, despite being north-south of each other in real life. New York City is another case, where their five bouroughs also functions as counties, but they should be recognizable enough on the map.

A square around it would probably be best, because as of now it looks like a subdivision of Haiti, but that creates a new problem with the rest of the USMOI, which should then have borders too, for consistency&#039;s sake. Problem is they&#039;re too spread out for a single square, and unlike for example the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, there isn&#039;t a larger territory that could have a square, with the rest of the smaller islands connected to that. Separating them isn&#039;t a good idea if you ask me. It&#039;s treated as a single territory, and most Real Travellers will be lucky to visit even one of them in their lifetime. They&#039;re uninhabited and mostly off limits to ordinary people, and separating them would also open the door for separating the aforementioned French southern islands.

However, it&#039;s a fantastic place to visit if you have some patience and aren&#039;t expecting anything other than a typical third-world country with typical third-world country inconveniences. All things considered, people tend to be friendly and welcoming. <br><br>Everything that people say about touts and scams is true, but it&#039;s also completely overblown. I&#039;ve traveled extensively across most parts of India, and I&#039;ve found that these sorts of hassles are borderline nonexistent outside a scarce handful of areas. For example, you&#039;ll be almost constantly bothered by travel agency touts in places like Delhi&#039;s Paharganj neighborhood, the Pink City in Jaipur, and anywhere within shooting distance of the Taj Mahal. However, other parts of the same cities--especially those that see few foreign tourists--are comparably tame, and you can explore without having to worry about strangers&#039; poor intentions. <br><br>People in more rural areas will either be quasi-autistically excited to see you or ignore you altogether (although they&#039;re usually very friendly if you speak some of their language and say hello). <br><br>IMO, a lot of India&#039;s so-called travails can be avoided by simply doing your best to blend in and look confident. I&#039;ve spent so much fucking time here that I can speak Hindi and two other Indian languages reasonably well. I&#039;m as White as they come, but a lot of people--somehow--assume that I&#039;m either Indian or Anglo-Indian (i.e., my family stayed here after the British Raj came to an end). Literally nobody bothers me when I travel by myself. This isn&#039;t because I&#039;m special, it&#039;s just because I look comfortable in my surroundings.

They have a lot of activities like bamboo rafting and night walks, but it&#039;s pretty expensive and you can&#039;t just wander around on your own so plan ahead if you want to go there. And as with most parks don&#039;t expect to see any animals besides deer and birds. It&#039;s also infested with leeches which the reviews don&#039;t mention lmao. The town of Kumily is pretty boring though so just go to the park and head out.<br><br>Munnar is another really popular hillstation in the Western Ghats. It is absolutely worth seeing but DO NOT STAY IN MUNNAR. The city is an overcrowded disaster and you will be miserable. Stay nearby in Idukki which is within driving distance and much quieter and calmer. Usually in Munnar people just rent a car or jeep and hit all the tourist spots. You can do this over two days since there are some really cool places in Idukki too. Most of the attractions here are tea plantations, waterfalls, dams, lakes, and viewpoints. Do some research and avoid the tourist traps like Top Station. Eravikulam National Park is here and it was...okay. You take a terrifying bus ride up to a winding mountain path. There are some goats and pretty scenery and a cafe and small museum. You walk around a bit and then you leave. Like the beaches most of the mountain tourism is really seasonal.

Any tourist areas will be full of North Indian and western restaurants also so you can eat whatever you&#039;d like.

One of my favorite trips ever and I&#039;ve been traveling for most of my life.

The Southern Railway connects to most of the major districts in the state and from there you can just take a cab/auto to wherever you&#039;re going. The exception to this is Western Ghats where there are no railways as far as I know. There aren&#039;t even many public buses that run from major cities to the hill stations desu (and the ones that do exist are at odd hours), so your only options are taxis and private buses. Buses are really unsafe especially around the monsoon; idk if you&#039;ve ever been to the mountainous regions of India but people drive like fucking maniacs and there are one lane roads with hairpin turns and no guardrails. Me and my girlfriend actually missed a bus from Munnar to Kochi and we were really pissed because we had to stay an extra day at our accommodation. Literally three hours later our AirBNB host called to tell us that that exact same bus drove off a cliff and a bunch of people died. Was like a fucking final destination scene and I was pretty rattled because I nearly got us killed to save like $50. So yea don&#039;t take the risk if you go up there and just pay the RS4000 for a taxi.<br><br>Worth noting, idk if you or her are actually from India, but right now paying for things in India is a fucking nightmare for foreigners. You basically can&#039;t use any payment methods except UPI and cash. My credit cards very rarely worked and many places will flat out tell you they can&#039;t process foreign credit/debit cards. Cash is fine for those situations but trying to order/book things online is a shitshow. I had a lot of issues booking domestic flights and using the IRCTC website was flat out impossible. I ended up having transfer money to my girlfriend&#039;s Indian bank account and have her pay for everything using Google Pay. Fucking ridiculous.

I really don\u2019t think India is a particularly challenging country to navigate, given the abundance of different transportation options\u2014it can just be a little frustrating and confusing for first-time visitors, who might not understand how common delays and other inconveniences are.

The only place you really have to be \u201con guard\u201d for folks who\u2019ll try taking advantage of you is in very touristic areas. Otherwise, I\u2019ve found that most people here are actually quite honest; many Indians still subscribe to the whole \u201cguest is god\u201d ideology, and they don\u2019t want to take a foreign tourist\u2019s money. <br><br>If anything, this is one of the few places where you can easily meet people you just met to call in sick to work so they hang out the next day or take you to some spot outside the city. <br><br>Now, my parents and some other extended family are coming here in another few months, and I absolutely don\u2019t wake them running around by themselves.

IME, this has far less to do with xenophobia than the Indian government&#039;s requirement that hotels file reports--Form C--whenever they host foreign guests. These reports have to be filed with the nearest police station within 24 hours of the guest&#039;s arrival. <br><br>Nowadays, hotels and guesthouses can fill out Form C online, but you still have to create an account and spend about ~5 minutes entering the traveler&#039;s information.

Public transport up that way is sparse at the best of times, let alone in the depths of winter.<br><br>Alternatively you could head down into the lovely and often overlooked scottish borders, where you can find a variety of castles and tower forts linked to the lawless and violent history of the border regions, not to mention several incredible medieval monasteries.

Weather is windy and wet, making -1C feel like -6C (i now don&#039;t get cold because I used to constantly be so cold thwre). Architecture - depressing. People at your workplace will be 95% NPC&#039;s incapable of discussing anything else than the current jew media happenings. They won&#039;t &#039;tell it to you straight&#039; too. Made some really nice and funny friends for life too. Children&#039;s behaviour is rotten in schools because of uncaring parents. And from what i hear the place is spiralling down fast economically. Only utility i personally found in it is to get free education through a sponsored enginnering apprenticeship, making a lot of money then fucking off to a place I now happily live in without carpets in bathrooms and mould in my room.", "filename": "cover1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670856799701577, "time": 1670856799, "md5": "Np3oLeFnm8Gmo90/JmLBsw==", "fsize": 14789, "resto": 2358350}, {"no": 2371662, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)10:13:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2371215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2371215</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free healthcare (that you pay for but can&#039;t access), generous holidays(so you get paid half as much), very difficult to sack someone without a lengthy process and payoff (lowering hiring, innovated productivity)and a good benefits safety net(that you pay for and browns and roasties abuse)</span><br><br>England is the worst country in the world you are just coping and dilating", "time": 1670858007, "resto": 2358350}, {"no": 2372126, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)04:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Might go back to the UK to do a uni degree and then leave again and never pay for it kek", "time": 1670923264, "resto": 2358350}, {"no": 2372333, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:36:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2371127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2371127</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wr-wrong!</span><br>Ok little fella", "time": 1670956586, "resto": 2358350}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2365429, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)14:46:53", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/Brazil/", "com": "Post travel tips and advice.

Our cities are most trash. Although Rio de Janeiro is worth it. In the south there&#039;s Iguazu Falls and if you want to party/go to the beach Florian\u00f3polis and Balne\u00e1rio Camboriu. In the state of SP, Ilhabela. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, besides the capital, there&#039;s the colonial town of Paraty and Angra dos Reis, great places to spend some money chartering a boat (there&#039;s more than 365 islands in Angra dos Reis and places in Paraty like saco do mamangua and Ilha dos cocos; google it). Also Buzios and Petropolis if you\u2019re interested in Brazil\u2019s imperial past.<br>Some colonial towns in Minas Gerais, like Ouro Preto, might be nice for chilling for a few days. Lots of beaches in northeastern, although I think it&#039;s not worth it. Also, Len\u00e7ois Maranhenses, Jalap\u00e3o, Pantanal, and some jungle resort in the Amazon (you could spend 2 days in Manaus too). Oh, there&#039;s Salvador if you want to see a more African Brazil. I hate it actually.<br>People are usually very nice toward foreigners. In some touristic places, like Rio, people might try to rip you off. But normal people will treat you well. No difference for americans. Some upper middle class might have some prejudice in the sense that they think americans ignorants. But nothing like hostilities toward americans.

Don&#039;t wear watches and jewelry, avoid drawing attention, and use your phone inside stores. I mean, I have walked through S\u00e3o Paulo at 2 a.m. getting out of bars while drunk and nothing happened to me. That said, been raised here I\u2019m kinda streetsmart and also a bit lucky. You should be more careful. Kidnaps for the past decades have been really low, nothing to worry about. Murder has never been a problem desu. Not because it does not exist (it does happens a lot), but it actually about poor people killing poor people due to drugs and things related. It does not affect the middle class and would not affect you as a tourist. The problem is robbery attempts. Just be low profile and uber to places, specially at night. Oh, if you decide to rent a place instead of getting a hotel suite, rent a house in a gated community. <br>It would be better if you learn portuguese. As I\u2019ve said, most brazilians do not speak english. <br>Like USA, we\u2019ve received people from all over the world. Difference is that we had all permutations possible. So yes, there are hot women from every race and every mix between races. That said, when americans are not fat I would say that, in average, they look better. The top 5% brazilian women are very pretty though. The top 1% are gorgeous. But there are lots of differences between states, regions and social classes. Women here are also getting fatter (not many morbid obese though). But gym culture is also strong here, specially in Rio de Janeiro. Tl;dr I would say that women in eastern europe (russia, Poland, etc.) are the most beautiful if you sample random 1000 women from any country in the world. But if you sample the top 1%, Brazil wins for the diversity of looks.

Only had watched like a couple short youtube videos on the process. Waitstaff understood and laughed with me.<br>Karasuma, Kawaramachi-Dori<br><br>Osaka, very fun very chill, great nightlife. Best street food. Dotonobri and Americamura. Clubs were super fun. Okonomiyaki is kinda bland and sucks, and I went to a pretty highly rated one.<br><br>Only had like a year of japanese to get around and it was still pretty accommodating.<br>Wasn&#039;t expecting any deep conversations with the natives, but the few I tried to have were obviously clunky. I appreciate how hard people try to be accommodating. The rudest people I met were other american tourists. Other foreigners were very friendly, but I&#039;m kind of eccentric and am usually pretty sociable.<br><br>Only wore my mask on the subway<br>The idea of a collective social health conscience evaporated after I watched a pair of women walking as slow as possible and giggling to each other while obstructing an ambulance in Shinjuku. Masks on.<br>They&#039;re just doing whatever theyre socially coerced to do, its not some grand social sacrifice<br>Only got 3ish passive aggressive passing coughs over 10 days of walking around.<br><br>I liked how nobody could dance so as a white guy who somewhat could I felt cool.<br><br>Super sick of fish and fish oil.

I&#039;ve seen people trying to start relationships with these women and failing so fucking hard because these women unravel once they realize how mundane and human a westerner is as the guy himself realizes he&#039;s putting his dick in crazy.<br><br>The other, healthier kind, are just women that have a more international vibe and thus are ok with dating foreigners because the foreigners living in taiwan also have this globohomo vibe. These women acknowledge that they have a taiwanese identity, don&#039;t exclusively date western men and don&#039;t purposefully dress up for them, and just have a far more healthier outlook on life. They don&#039;t try to pretend they&#039;re something they&#039;re not, they&#039;re not necessarily fetishizing certain ethnicities. They just want an international relationship because they have an education that made them ok with the idea. One of my exgf was just that, a woman who did an MBA in France, speaks english perfectly, and has had relationships with taiwanese before. I&#039;ve met her at a conference and we probably had one of the more healthier relationship i&#039;ve ever had.", "time": 1670853804, "resto": 2370937}, {"no": 2371637, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:25:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2371626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2371626</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Huh?

I took a few trips but honestly found the country to be pretty boring and uninteresting, and I didn&#039;t really have time to travel anyways. So I just decided to save money and spend it elsewhere. My only real expense was groceries and the occasional night out, so it was easy to save ~$1800 a month.

Got a job teaching at a good language center since I had IELTS experience from my certification. Initially took a pay hit, but the hourly rate was way higher and I didn&#039;t have to work as much. Plus cheaper cost of living. Once I got my hours up to around 20-25 I was making more than Korea. And since your employer doesn&#039;t own your visa like in Korea you can hustle if you want for extra cash.

Most leave after a couple of years, and they have the ability to return to a developed country and all the opportunities that gives them (whether they realize it or not). If they really are passionate about teaching, they could become licensed teachers, but the vast majority do not. The same would probably happen to you, except you have less chance of success than they do (non-native speaker, non-Anglo passport) and much greater opportunity cost (giving up chance of medical school).<br>TL;DR - go to medical school.", "time": 1668228385, "resto": 2352590}, {"no": 2357699, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)00:14:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Anyone ever have any luck with getting a school to pay for a visa service?

Are you ready to be transported to Bkk by helicopter in case you break your leg or get seriously sick? Lao hospitals are for military, if you want to get treated, you have to order a helicopter. <br>Anyway, are you ready to live and work in Laos for 500-600 dollars a month? Paid in lao kips.

For the majority of people, working in either country is basically volunteering and earning enough to cover your expenses and live okay by local standards - i.e. not enough for your flights. There are decent jobs but you will need a degree for them. When I worked in Cambodia, I was at a university in the countryside and got just over $1000/month. It was a cushy gig but there are maybe 20 jobs like that in the entire country. The majority of English teachers are backpackers or retirees who wound up in the country and earn $500/month.

She was more than happy to get US dollars.<br>If you go, you should bring a large amount of US currency, &quot;new&quot; bills in good condition, 100s and 20s. (It sounds like a pain, but the more 20s you bring the better, and keep them in the pages of a book to preserve their condition. You&#039;ll literally get 10% better black market rates (which everyone used when i was there, even the legit FX kiosks) for good condition bills, and a higher rate for 100 bills than lower denominations. I say bring a lot of 20s because anything of value you want to buy will be much cheaper in USD.", "time": 1670136773, "resto": 2364467}, {"no": 2367553, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)01:57:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2364530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2364530</a><br>It was relatively easy in 2018 for a tall slim blond and blue eyed spergy guy.", "time": 1670137049, "resto": 2364467}, {"no": 2367646, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:34:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2367552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2367552</a><br>good information.

I notice that the backpackers types I encountered in Greek hostels would visit a crazy amount of European countries like 5-10 in one vacation. A huge portion of them would always leave the hostel with their huge 30L backpack like retards. Since they are spending astronomical sums of money on airfare many of them seem loathe to ever rent a car, take a taxi or sometimes even take public transit! Many of those types of retards also are always wasting time in the hostel making food or eating something simple like oatmeal or cereal again and again, again because they blew all their travel budget on airfare for country hopping to fake being worldly. But they spend most their vacation in the hostels or in close walking to the hostels.

The language is difficult, though, with no living relatives, so communication with about 70% of the population isn&#039;t necessarily easy, although you may meet guest workers who&#039;ve come back from Italy, Greece, or Germany, in that order, if you speak any of those, and lots of young people obviously study English. <br><br>Romania, still unable to get into Schengen, is quite civilized nowadays in the nice parts of Bucharest or Sibiu or Brasov or wherever... people also say nice things about Timisoara, but I&#039;ve never been there.

Almost no woman will take you seriously if you are under 6&#039;, that&#039;s essentially the magic number where women draw the line.

Open brothel district where you can see all the girls sitting at the front of their shops, and you pick one and go. There&#039;s very little Japanese needed, even though it helps during sex, and they are very open to foreigners. Matsushima Shinchi, also in Osaka, is the same, but there are fewer shops, and the quality of the girls isn&#039;t at the same level. Tobita&#039;s level of girls is super high; some are idol- and model-tier and would be the kind of girls you see at luxury/high-end soaplands. Tobita is by far my favorite if you&#039;re mainly concerned about looks and want to get the prettiest and cutest girl possible without risking getting baited by photoshopped/old pics (soaplands are notorious for this). Service can feel a little distant because they&#039;re so pretty and in high demand, but some of the best fucks I&#039;ve had were a matter of finding the right girl. And going at nighttime with all the lights and just seeing a huge variety of girls (little loli type, slutty gyaru, shrine maiden outfits, nurses, kimonos) is intoxicating.<br><br>Soaplands are better if you want to have more time and a less rushed experience, but the quality of girls can vary a lot, and you have to pay top dollar to fuck the prettiest ones. A bit more Japanese is necessary to enter and to schedule things, but it can be done. Yoshiwara in Tokyo is probably your best bet as a foreigner, and that place is kind of well-known for having girls that do NS (No Skin) and NN (Nakadashi), so raw sex is possible, although that might not be an option for you if they&#039;re wary about you because you&#039;re a foreigner.<br><br>Delivery/Hotel Health where girls are delivered to your selected love hotel is good and can be priced fairly, but you&#039;re paying for the love hotel. Lots of JAV girls also work for these shops. Intercourse is not necessarily guaranteed with these, and your mileage may vary for the shop and girls. Much more Japanese needed to schedule and arrange everything.", "time": 1669251232, "resto": 2355325}, {"no": 2362272, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)20:07:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2362269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2362269</a><br>For real?

Unlike you, I have been able to travel throughout my marriage, and even now that I have kids, albeit not in such a RealTraveler(TM) way as I did when I was young and broke.<br><br>But I have also seen places I love change dramatically\u2014I began my travels in the Soviet Union, followed by a lot of backpacking/low-end expatting around Southeast Asia, starting at the end of the 80s and very early 90s. So some of the first places I ever visited don\u2019t even exist anymore, and many others bear no resemblance to the places I knew.<br><br>I have bittersweet nostalgic feelings for travel before the internet, to say nothing of smartphones. When I was living in Northeastern Thailand as late as the mid 90s, I still got most of my international news from shortwave radio and day-old copies of the English papers; although I had access to e-mail at work, I didn\u2019t even have the shockingly slow dial-up internet that was the norm at the time at home. <br><br>But in spite of all of that, I\u2019ve found many places I used to love to still be enjoyable in their newer incarnations. I\u2019m not opposed to change and development overall, and I\u2019m OK with the fact that some things I used to like don\u2019t exist anymore.<br><br>So I suppose that one answer to your concerns might be to just try to go somewhere you\u2019ve been before and see if you still like it. If you can\u2019t embrace its new form, go somewhere you\u2019ve never been before.

We drank a bit and then i had to piss, but for some reason i was unable to do, maybe because apartment was small and he was waiting for me. So i left his house without pissing, then i wanted to go to mall to piss, but i got lost in network of public communication (even tho i used app, but some streets got skipped in app and maybe i paniced i got into wrong tram, i dont know).

Whats scary to me in big cities, is that sometimes its hard to find place to piss. You can&#039;t just piss at someone flat, and people are always walking behind you, even at night.

Clubs and bars are sometimes ok for me - if there is not a lot of people, but open space festivals, with 2 toilets for everyone, that are occupied all the time? Forget it, i get panic attack, just thinking about that. My social life obviously suffers because of that, people are weirded out when i suddenly have to split very quickly.<br>And i was never on the plane, but i have to fly soon. Are planes usually full?

Realize that everyone gets a little pee shy and it\u2019s not a huge deal. I used to think it was this massive secret I couldn\u2019t let anyone find out and now I just tell people hey I get a little anxious if you\u2019re standing right outside the door can you give me some space. Shit like that. No one cares. They won\u2019t even remember you told them most likely and have to be reminded in the future. I still don\u2019t like urinals (had a gross groping experience in college that this all stems from) but I have accepted I will stand up and piss in a stall and fuck anyone that thinks that\u2019s weird.

I can even piss around other people again as long as they aren\u2019t hovering right behind me. Try to find ways to lower your general level of anxiety. Also read up on how anxiety works, once you begin to learn how to deal with it it gets way better. Usually the panic you feel right at the beginning is the worst it will get. If you can deep breathe and allow it to pass I bet you\u2019ll find you can piss. Don\u2019t fight the anxiety, notice it, let it be, and let it go away. <br>Also check out the IPA (International Paruresis Association). They have in person workshops you can attend that are kind of like AA for pee shy people. I went to one a year or two ago and I\u2019m basically cured of it. You go through a lot of the info I outlined above and then break out into groups to practice peeing around other people with people that have the same problems. If it sounds horrifying to you, that\u2019s normal, but I found it immensely beneficial.

For Madrid stay by the Gran Via, Puerta del Sol or Parque del Retiro and use the metro to get around. For Barcelona, as much as she will want to go, avoid La Rambla.

To check it off the list though, take her to breakfast at El Quim de la Boqueria (small restaurant in the farmers market) and then proceed to go right towards the gothic quarter. Prebook tickets to the sagrada familia so you don&#039;t have to wait in line and get lunch at La Paradeta nearby, super fresh seafood.

But the ketosis process is unpleasant and it will fog your brain, your muscular endurance will be less, etc. Everytime I get really sick and don&#039;t want to eat like when I had covid and the attendant pneumonia or bronchitis(years ago), I go into ketosis and I feel like crap just sitting on my ass. Sure you can hike in that state, but you will be miserable and make much less progress than if you eat constantly. You also need to eat before you get really really hungry, I learned that from cycling. By the time you are too hungry you already burned out the glyocen in your muscles and your fatigue level will greatly increase and your muscular endurance will decrease. So your pace will drop to a crawl.

I like Delta myself, Comfort + seating is the best bang for your buck in terms of comfiness and price. Another tip is to never check any bags, unless you are going to be gone for more than two weeks you can get away with a carry-on and small backpack if you pack right.

These stores have pretty bad selection, and are a reflection of the command economy that Cuba largely has. I recall tomato sauce, vinegar, orange and lemon extract, and a type of wine basically dominating the entire store. Just vast quantities of like 5 items.<br>- The third store is also a general store, but it only appears to foreign currency (specifically dollars or euros). The selection at these stores are similar to what you&#039;d find in a small grocery store in a western country. Hell, even western brands like Tide detergent and Axe body spray were available. Prices are high though. Clearly used to extract foreign currency.<br>3. There&#039;s not much wiggle room with police. If they ask you do to do something, just do it.
