At the time, the Myanmar embassy in my country was refusing to recognize the military junta and wasn&#039;t issuing work visas, so my organization flew me to Thailand and I got a visa from there and then flew in on a plane that was 90% cargo (most of the passenger seats had been removed).<br>The situation was very tense during that time. Only a couple of ATMs were stocked with cash every day. There were shootings and bombings going on, which I never saw personally but did see in videos posted to a Signal exapt group. We were warned by my worker not to talk politics with any local and to be careful if someone tried to chat us up because they might be military. I&#039;m quite sure that one day a friendly guy in a restaurant was in fact military because he was badmouthing the junta, trying to get me to talk about it, and the other locals avoided him.<br>We were supposed to stay in a hotel compound when we weren&#039;t being driven to and from work, but nothing stopped us from coming and going before the citywide curfew. I left a few times to walk around and search for some stuff I wanted to buy. Before the creampie guy asks, yes, I did get a hooker too. I noticed there was one young woman who was always outside and one evening I walked up to her and exchanged Line info. We chatted over Line and we worked out a deal where she visited my hotel. She was more than happy to get US dollars.<br>If you go, you should bring a large amount of US currency, &quot;new&quot; bills in good condition, 100s and 20s. (It sounds like a pain, but the more 20s you bring the better, and keep them in the pages of a book to preserve their condition. You&#039;ll literally get 10% better black market rates (which everyone used when i was there, even the legit FX kiosks) for good condition bills, and a higher rate for 100 bills than lower denominations.

These reports have to be filed with the nearest police station within 24 hours of the guest&#039;s arrival. <br><br>Nowadays, hotels and guesthouses can fill out Form C online, but you still have to create an account and spend about ~5 minutes entering the traveler&#039;s information.

The park itself is actually quite large, and the mountain is not near the tourist zone (which is on the highway). If you want to go the mountain, typically you&#039;d either drive on the backroads (they&#039;re dirt mostly I thinK), or take a park bus. There are 1 or 2 resorts there, and they&#039;ll have electricity, running water, internet, etc. They&#039;re quite expensive though ($300+/night?). The tourist zone only operates in summer months; complete ghost town in the winter (also wouldn&#039;t recommend driving the road between anchorage/fairbanks in the winter unless you&#039;re experienced, it&#039;s remote, no cell connection, and cold, ie dangerous.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How affordable is it to visit Alaska?</span><br>Assuming leaving from SF, LA, Seattle, or Portland, round trip flight to anchorage is like $400 economy? Hotels are probably cheaper than what you&#039;d find in downtown major cities in US, maybe $80-$200/night. Food is probably slightly more expensive than any other metro US area. Though, significantly cheaper than other northern cities you&#039;d find in canada, europe, etc. Attractions are mostly outdoors and free, though I believe DNP requires a park pass? Not sure, one isn&#039;t needed if you stay in tourist/highway corridor. Rental cars are expensive as fuck. Like $100/day or more.<br>Public transit outside of the Anchorage and Fairbanks metro areas is basically non-existent, with the exception of the Alaska Railroad, which you should probably look into. It&#039;s not super cheap, but it operates all along the Seward Highway, through Anchorage and up to DNP and to Fairbanks.

If you&#039;re planning to do a long trip with multiple countries, you should definitely do both in one swing, like say Japan and Vietnam or China and Thailand. Or Japan and Thailand, since China hasn&#039;t opened yet.<br><br>I also suggest you start with the poorer country first, since third world countries have some inconveniences i&#039;m sure you&#039;ll figure out, and by going to the more developed country after that it&#039;ll allow your body and mind to take a break from the hustle and bustle.

Old San Juan has the La Perla ghetto, one of the most famous drug and crime hotspots in the island. You can hang around the wall that borders it in complete safety, but if you descend down into the ghetto itself then you either buy and gtfo or go at your own risk. The rest of old san juan is safe and holds a regular police presence, they just won&#039;t go into the ghetto itself unless serious shit goes down. Same with Condado which has its ghettoes far from nightlife. La Placita is a bit more of a hotspot but there&#039;s a big police and even undercover cop presence there. The other main spots in Rio Grande, Fajardo, Humacao, Rincon and La Parguera are more rural and don&#039;t have as big of a gang conflict issue since there&#039;s more territory for less people, and tourists are kept encapsulated in bubbles created by resorts and guarded by private security. Palmas del Mar in Humacao is great, all rich people, multiple gated communities, private police roaming constantly... It&#039;s solid. You really only need to worry about safety as a tourist in the metro area, but the main hubs are safe and tourists won&#039;t go out of their way to enter the shittier parts of the metro area like Carolina. Drugs are directly linked to around 60% of all murders in PR, drugs basically cause the majority of violence. South America simply loves shipping to and through us. Since we buy direct, it&#039;s great for dealers.

We had one of, if not THE strictest gun control laws in America. Before the latest USSC ruling, I would have to get a license for sport from the police. Originally these cost a whopping $500 per application, required you to pay for a membership at a shooting range and involved a multiple months long waiting period plus background check. If you were granted the license (it was not a guarantee) you got the right to only RENT a gun at a range for the purpose of shooting for sport at that range and nothing else. You could not purchase a gun to be kept at the range. Once you had the license for sport you then had to apply for a carry license which cost about $1,000, included the background check, a certified safety and handling class you also had to pay separately for, required sworn affidavits and approval by a judge instead of police, needed two people who knew you to confirm your good character and even if all requirements were met you could still be told no. That&#039;s all for the license alone btw, you buy the gun alone after. It effectively cost you $1500 and 4-12 months for a license then however many hundreds or thousands the gun cost.
