Immerse yourself in real natural beauty, not fake rock work. Some people go to Epcot just to walk around the themed countries and eat and drink and IMO that&#039;s not worth the admission price. You can do the same at the themed Vegas Strip casinos for free.<br><br>I think most of the general public doesn&#039;t care about theming. They&#039;re there for the rides. Disney World fans make a big deal about the resort as a whole and the non-park aspects, but none of that would exist without the theme parks. Over half of the parks are 1 day visitors from off property. They&#039;re not there to walk around and people watch, ride a couple rides and go back to the hotel, they&#039;re there all day to ride as many rides as possible.

They present themselves and behave in such a way that you know they&#039;re looking for a white guy for sex and that they&#039;re not about to commit with you and thus are easily avoidable.

Why don&#039;t tourists return to Vietnam?</span><br>1. Most people who would do return trips after crossing off all the major sights from their list are either sex pests or resort tourists. Vietnam is garbage for both. The cooming offer is nowhere close to its neighbors and the beaches are frankly shit. While they can seem nice at a first glance, Vietnam is drowning in trash and has zero water pollution standards. You&#039;ll be frolicking in the waves and suddenly there&#039;s literal shit all around you.<br>2. People are often plain rude. There&#039;s little in the way of etiquette and the concept of disturbing others (which is generally a problem with SEA, but not to that level) does not exist in Vietnam at all. They&#039;ll spit, cut the line and play shitty Tik-Tok vids on full volume at 3AM on a night bus if they feel like it. Everyone working in the tourist industry has nothing but utmost contempt for tourists and will make sure you know that.<br>3. Scams. 80% of all Vietnamese you&#039;ll interact with will lie through their teeth in an attempt to extract money from you. If you don&#039;t play along, they&#039;ll get loud, insistent and aggressive. You can easily get ripped off in Thailand, which has ten times the return rate, but they usually do it with a smile and try to make sure you won&#039;t notice. Vietnam is on the level of people blatantly telling you to fuck off and demanding double while you point at the price list right behind them.<br>Don&#039;t take me wrong, Vietnam&#039;s my favorite place in SEA, but it is, without any doubt, a rude shithole that is the very opposite of comfy and that relaxed holiday feeling is what people are usually looking for.", "time": 1672245155, "resto": 2378355}, {"no": 2380118, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:03:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2379723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2379723</a><br>This is an absolute lie.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time.

So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan.

Stop in Jemez Springs on your way down, you can check out the historic sight or just hangout at the biker bar. From their you can either go to Albuquerque or up 550 towards Farmington.

Here&#039;s the kicker though. The Chinese locals in the apartment loved us and didn&#039;t like the foreigners. They all hung out in their group while we would hang out with locals.

I can&#039;t tell you the best route, but I can tell you what I did.<br><br>To teach in Japan without a master&#039;s degree, you generally have two options: teaching at an eikaiwa school or teaching as an ALT in public schools. You aren&#039;t likely to find a lot of eikaiwa in the countryside, so an ALT position would be the better bet for you. For that, you need to look for dispatch employers. There are a few companies out there that hire ALTs, but many of them require you to be in the country already. I initially applied to Interac, a dispatch company that hires from abroad and provides work visas. I told them the general geographic region I preferred, and that I wanted to live in a smaller town, and they obliged.<br><br>The issue that you&#039;ll likely face is that you&#039;re looking to relocate together, and as you might imagine, it&#039;s much harder to find small towns that want to hire two ALTs. That&#039;s not to say they don&#039;t exist at all, and there are some ways to get around that. For example, you might be assigned to neighboring towns (not so likely), or you might be assigned to a larger city nearby to which you can commute while living in a small town nearby. If one of you gets a job, the other one can apply for a spousal visa, but I don&#039;t know what the timeframe would look like on that, and it&#039;s possible that a spousal visa request could be denied, as ALT contracts usually only last for one year at a time (but are renewable).<br><br>Oh, one other thing to keep in mind is that in my experience, the dispatch company is more likely to honor your request of a rural town if you can speak Japanese somewhat well. Think about it from their perspective: if you can&#039;t speak Japanese, you could still get by without much support from the company in a big city, but in a small town, it&#039;s more likely you&#039;ll be requesting their aid for small things like getting mail redelivered.", "time": 1672705839, "resto": 2381414}, {"no": 2383002, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:52:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2382990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2382990</a><br>Different guy but I have a master&#039;s degree in international studies in the US and I can&#039;t find a suitable job I want.

And I just kept walking north (the shrine is in the south east of the city). Every time I ran into a temple on the street, I would see if it&#039;s available to the public and walk in. There are many, many big and small temples on that street <br><br>I also recommend you get a Goshuincho. It&#039;s a book where (almost all) temples will hand write you the name of the temple and it&#039;s seal / stamp. It gave me an extra reason to go visit temples and frankly is quite beautiful. At many of the smaller temples the person drawing them will be there alone with you, so this gives you a great excuse to talk to people. At least me, find it a million times easier to talk to someone when I have a genuine question. Mind you the book and getting them to write to you cost a little bit. Usually they ask for 300 yen per page they do, so you might not wanna get it everywhere. But it&#039;s worth it and is a real memory holder, you can always bring with you and look back fondly on. I love it. It also makes you attach more meaning to the places and respect them a bit more, or at least it did that for me.<br><br>I also recommend you just look into events, concerts and that kinda stuff. I went on my trip a lot like you, except I had it all booked before Corona and had to wait until October to finally go. Other things - look into festivals that might be happening too!

While not a venue for massively popular acts, Loft has hosted many popular Japanese acts as well as lesser known ones. Not only does Shinjuku Loft host live music, but it also platforms DJ nights and talk shows. It is a smaller venue, holding a maximum of 500 people standing.<br><br>Shinjuku Loft is a live venue owned by &quot;Loft Project&quot;, which owns five locations as of 2022. The first is Shinjuku Loft, the second is &quot;Shinjuku Loft Plus One&quot; which hosts talk shows, the third &quot;Naked Loft&quot; hosts music and talk shows, &quot;Shimokitazawa Shelter&quot; hosts live music, and &quot;Asagaya Loft A&quot; hosts music and talk shows. &quot;Shinjuku Loft Plus One&quot; is located relatively close to Shinjuku Loft, and is known for being a strange venue, often platforming anything from political discussion to porn stars performing erotic games. Loft Project also distributes a free music newspaper &quot;RoofTop&quot;, as well as operating multiple record labels for independent musicians and a recording studio, &quot;Studio Impact&quot;.<br><br>https://www.loft-prj.co.jp/LOFT/<br><br>https://www.loft-prj.co.jp/LOFT/flo<wbr>or.html<br><br>https://www.discogs.com/label/26876<wbr>9-Shinjuku-LOFT<br><br>https://twitter.com/shinjukuloft<br><br>Shinjuku Loft Promotional Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zr<wbr>H0FX5n9o", "filename": "1672598673925", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1367, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672910699227212, "time": 1672910699, "md5": "FrJTWheAQBa6MvFWIRAgvw==", "fsize": 433826, "resto": 2381414}, {"no": 2384642, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)05:07:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2384623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2384623</a><br><a href=\"#p2384624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2384624</a><br><a href=\"#p2384625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2384625</a><br>Wow.

There\u2019s a lot to see. Avoid nogs, rags, and zingari. You have to do Rome due to the amount of historical things to look at, but avoid nogs at all costs in that city and limit your time in the train station\u2026just get in and get out. Rome is chaotic and very much a big city and tourist trap. Florence is going to be much better, much more laid back, with friendlier people. Pisa is a university town. Some of the smaller cities in the north are surprisingly pleasant. Genoa, Turin, etc. Bologna has been gentrified a lot. You can even walk Bolognina after dark these days even if the streets are surprisingly empty by 9 pm for an Italian city. The further south you go the more dysfunctional it gets but not in a dangerous way. That\u2019s just northern stereotypes about the subhuman terrone (mostly true, but they are just dumb and lazy, not dangerous). Hotels will suck by American standards, even compared to a Holiday Inn express, so unless you want to know how to say Norman Bates in Italian it\u2019s worth the money to go up a star or two. Inflation has hit hard and things are expensive there now. Be prepared for that. You get a mixture of competent and lazy as shit with Italians.

You have to take all of these in account, which means you&#039;ll most likely be stuck in snowy northern Sweden or Finland.<br>If you love skiing, or hiking with snowshoes, and don&#039;t mind not seeing the northern lights because you ran out of luck, go ahead.<br>This is the thing when you do nature/outdoor-centered tourism such as hiking or birdwatching, never expect everything as you wished for.

I took a few trips but honestly found the country to be pretty boring and uninteresting, and I didn&#039;t really have time to travel anyways. So I just decided to save money and spend it elsewhere. My only real expense was groceries and the occasional night out, so it was easy to save ~$1800 a month. I just sent my whole salary home every month and barely touched it.<br><br>After that I went to work in Vietnam. Got a job teaching at a good language center since I had IELTS experience from my certification. Initially took a pay hit, but the hourly rate was way higher and I didn&#039;t have to work as much. Plus cheaper cost of living. Once I got my hours up to around 20-25 I was making more than Korea. And since your employer doesn&#039;t own your visa like in Korea you can hustle if you want for extra cash. Saved about $1500 a month maybe since I traveled a lot more and had to pay rent. <br><br>Now I work at a private school in Thailand making about the same as Vietnam, but with more work since I&#039;m salaried and have to be at school all day. I like the routine better though since I hate hourly work with timetabling and subbing and all that other bullshit. Probably going to stay here for a bit then try to get a scholarship for an MA TESOL or diploma or something. We&#039;ll see.<br><br>Anyways on a TEFL salary spending vs. saving is really just a lifestyle. I&#039;m frugal I guess but I&#039;m not miserly. I spend a lot when I&#039;m in vacation mode, but I only really travel to cheap locations. Last vacation was to India for a month where I spent maybe $2000. Most of my hobbies are cheap and I don&#039;t splurge when I go out. When I first started working I tracked my spending and just eliminated all the useless shit that was wasting a ton of money (alcohol, subscriptions, ordering food etc...).

Entry-level ESL jobs can be similarly &quot;easy&quot;, in the sense that you are often given a curriculum and your only job is to get the students to fill out their books while avoiding any major complaints. However, this isn&#039;t always the case - there are many jobs that will expect you to make your own lessons and deliver them without assistance. Teaching ESL isn&#039;t necessarily difficult but it can often be unintuitive, so if you find yourself in a more serious position you might struggle with high expectations and pressure. <br><br>Are you looking to make teaching a career?

These are short, rigorous courses that will teach you the basics and get you comfortable in an ESL classroom.

It would be better to do the course and find out that TEFL is not for you, than to fly to another country to work and discover it there.<br><br>Of course, you should keep in mind that you can always quit a job. In the worst case scenario where you are miserable/depressed in a foreign country, you can just head to the airport and get on the first flight home. It is a bit pathetic and unprofessional, but I say it to emphasize that you are never trapped if you feel like you&#039;ve made a mistake. <br><br>As far as social life is concerned, it&#039;s basically impossible to predict how you might react in a foreign environment.

But there are many examples of such teachers being employed elsewhere in Asia, though they are litteral wageslaves without any legal rights. They can be deported when the school doesnt need them anymore. <br>And salaries in Laos and Cambo are low, because those countries are undeveloped and being heavily invested into by China. Lots of construction is going on there. It means there is some potential for future development yet local population is still poor as fuck. <br>And no school would provide you with housing. Its not China. There are schools providing a shitty room in the campus. Thats it. Food is possible, at least Viet and Thai schools provide lunches. <br>Teaching in Laos is mostly voluntary job for either backpackers or opioid addicts. Are you one of them? Are you ready to be transported to Bkk by helicopter in case you break your leg or get seriously sick? Lao hospitals are for military, if you want to get treated, you have to order a helicopter. <br>Anyway, are you ready to live and work in Laos for 500-600 dollars a month? Paid in lao kips. And there would be almost no carreer development in this field because you lack that fucking degree. <br>If you are willing to do it, maybe i can help you to get employed, but competition is fierce even in Laos. Farangs are everywhere and they want to eat and live comfortable lives. <br>Have you got a teaching certificate? What about vaccine certificate? Whats your citizenship and race?

For the majority of people, working in either country is basically volunteering and earning enough to cover your expenses and live okay by local standards - i.e. not enough for your flights. There are decent jobs but you will need a degree for them. When I worked in Cambodia, I was at a university in the countryside and got just over $1000/month. It was a cushy gig but there are maybe 20 jobs like that in the entire country. The majority of English teachers are backpackers or retirees who wound up in the country and earn $500/month. To get those jobs you just need to be in the country.<br>It&#039;s similar in Laos - there&#039;s a handful of good jobs in Vientiane, but they aren&#039;t hiring people without degrees and experience. A big difference from Cambodia is the government doesn&#039;t make it easy for backpackers to get hired. Most English teachers in Laos are more likely to be with volunteer agencies and NGOs than anything else.<br>Having said all of that, you could lie about your degrees and experience, but you&#039;d have to be pretty convincing to get through the interviews. I&#039;d say most of these positions are filled by referrals.<br>And that part about needing to be snowflake white is just hyperbole. Yeah, it looks good, but most teachers in these countries are tanned golden. Looks do matter but I had an ugly old African guy as a colleague.

So say you book the Marriott in dallas, for $300 a night on Expedia, Marriott will pay Expedia 10% of that as a commission - they then sometimes pay that forward to customers which is why hotels.com give you &quot;free nights&quot; .... They&#039;re not free they&#039;re just sharing the commission. There&#039;s also &quot;overrides&quot; whereby if a company books a certain amount of room nights in a year they get an extra amount .. something like Marriott will give them an extra $3 per room night booked if they book 10,000 + , an extra $2 for 100,000+ etc<br><br>Anyway this leads onto your shitty little $20 a night room in butt fuck nowhere Vietnam. There is no contract for this, these shitty independent hotels have no agreement with any of these onlines so rather than getting kickbacks, the online sites actually charge these independent hotels to list on their site, it&#039;s a flat rate of say $100 a month to be on there and then the site will add on an arbitrary amount to the hotel cost, so a $20 a night hotel is actually bookable for $30 as booking.com will take $10 as commission so it&#039;s always worth booking these direct.<br><br>tl;dr<br>If you&#039;re booking a shit hotel online you&#039;re always going to pay more than direct.<br>Also the VPN/ deleting cookies thing is a retarded meme.

I suggest doing the palace and national museum as well as the chang kai chek memorial hall.<br>As for the rest well, look all the big night markets up if you&#039;re a foodie.<br>There&#039;s also the zoo, the multiple temples. I suggest you find a way to rent a bike for a day or so, the city is bicycle friendly so it may be worth navigating it that way<br>As train stations of importance, Gongguan, Technology Building have active neighborhoods, Ximen and Dongmen too. If you want souvenirs the underground mall at Beimen and Main Station should be an interesting stop, also for weeb shit. This is just an arm of the gigantic underground mall of Taipei Main Station so keep exploring even when you reach the end of that particular arm. <br><br>Speaking of bicycle it might be worth renting one for the day and going all the way to Bitan. This being said you can also do it via the MRT. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tips</span><br>Make sure you stay by Gongguan, since it&#039;s an active and cheap neighborhood and you can basically get your dinner there if you don&#039;t want to be bothered at night. Hell, you can even try the university restaurant which has underrated food right there.<br>Oh, also, try to wake up early, by 8, so you can get out by 9 and enjoy the various breakfast establishment. Some serve some real good shit, chicken and pork stuff, youtiao, french toast, hell, if you speak chinese these mfers will do you whatever you want.", "time": 1672629031, "resto": 2377640}, {"no": 2382511, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:25:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2382501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2382501</a><br>Cont. <br>Most clubs worth going to are around Taipei 101. It&#039;s easy to meet some eager people in the queue, and it&#039;s likely you&#039;ll meet some fellow filipinos so just be blunt about it and they&#039;ll befriend you quickly. Clubs are ridiculous in the sense that you can go in and go out and there&#039;s a 7/11 nearby so you can get absolutely shitfaced at the fraction of the price while still enjoying the nightclub also, a lot of them have a queue where you can basically get a free drink if you wait for like, 5 minutes. Great way to socialize btw. Make sure you bring some ID however.<br>There are other clubs but unless they come heavily suggested, i&#039;d say stick with 101. And don&#039;t go to Triangle no matter how much it&#039;s recommended. It is one of the seediest clubs in the city and it hides behind this fact by getting students to come in. But now there are no students so it&#039;s just seedy. <br><br>Speaking of which, south of gongguan, if you follow siyuan road all the way to the bridge, there are a lot of small bars in front of the riverside, all covered by a bridge when it rains. So it&#039;s really fucking comfy and it&#039;s all out in the open so you can enjoy the best of both worlds. <br><br>As for the rest, ummm... In terms of exploring, i suggest you walk around zhongxiao dunhua for a classier feel, guang hua digital plaza has all these cool electronics, going to Da&#039;an park is a nice change of pace, Elephant Mountain is definitely worth doing at dusk so you can enjoy the glorious view. Taking a train to go to Keelung is worth an afternoon, just make sure you don&#039;t miss the last one.<br>Also Jiufeng but make sure you stay the night or it&#039;s fucking useless. <br>The rest of the island is basically all about hikes. Yilan hikes around the rice fields and mountain ranges, hualien, taroko gorges, kenting. You could hike right there in taipei by walking around the southernmost part of xindian which is basically the countryside (just take the 648 bus that goes out the city)", "time": 1672629936, "resto": 2377640}, {"no": 2382514, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:26:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2382501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2382501</a><br><a href=\"#p2382511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2382511</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inb4 &quot;thanks bro, but what about the girls ?&quot;</span>", "time": 1672629998, "resto": 2377640}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2378012, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:45:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Moved to South America for three months</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I loved it but my parents wanted me to come home</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tell me how much they miss me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They pay for half of my return ticket so that I can be home for Christmas</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I get home no one asks me any questions</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was speaking in Spanish to my friend on the phone and no one cares</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everyone still treats me like dirt</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can\u2019t find a job</span><br>I should have just stayed there until the money ran out and then an-heroed.", "filename": "7E68C40A-E241-46A2-B314-7E83E9933B97", "ext": ".png", "w": 811, "h": 527, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 162, "tim": 1671857151513817, "time": 1671857151, "md5": "lLKxvLWlmAFoj3MN0UNPzg==", "fsize": 96302, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "moved-to-south-america-for-three-months", "replies": 15, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 2378020, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:59:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Become an hero, no one gives a fuck about your sob story", "time": 1671857952, "resto": 2378012}, {"no": 2378029, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:42:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2378012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2378012</a><br>Where you from?
