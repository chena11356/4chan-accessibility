It wasn&#039;t very expensive. $680 for round trip tickets and $6.8k for 88 days at an airbnb in Shinjuku.<br><br>I can work from home, etc, so it&#039;s not job related... but idk, I just kind of lost all interest in Japan recently. Maybe because I&#039;m turning 38 next year, but I used to love Japan. I studied abroad there for a semester and have spent 15 months besides that travelling Japan. I was actually really upset during covid because I couldn&#039;t make my yearly trip there... but now I think it&#039;s just kind of boring.<br><br>Japan is quite fascinating to westerners when you first get there. It&#039;s a VERY different experience than any other asian country, as well as any western country you&#039;ve ever been to. It&#039;s clean, the food is great, it&#039;s safe, and easy to get laid there if you&#039;re a decent looking white guy who is tall.<br><br>I was super excited for my trip when I booked it a couple of months ago... but that excitement has diminished quite a bit. Like what the fuck am I going to do in Japan besides walk around and try to get laid? I&#039;ve done that before so many times. I&#039;ve done basically everything I wanted to do in Japan and this upcoming trip feels a bit hollow for some reason.<br><br>Does anyone have any advice on how to make my trip feel good again?

Don&#039;t listen to what the other anons are saying, it&#039;s not actually that bad if you keep your wits about you and you&#039;re not a total retard.<br><br>To be fair, Harare is a shithole. If you visit, definitely do not stay in the city center. Generally the northeastern suburbs are the nicest and you should look for a hotel/airbnb there. Barring that, you can stay in Belvedere to the west of the city, which is where I stayed and is somewhat cheaper. It&#039;s a largely Indian and Chinese community. The Harare Gardens are also beautiful and worth strolling around (during the day of course).<br><br>Bulawayo might be a better city for Rhodesia nostalgia (it was Zim&#039;s biggest city until the 30s). Bulawayo is generally quite a pleasant town and you can see a lot of Rhodesian heritage just walking around. You can visit the railway museum which is for spergs but it&#039;s still kind of cool to see the old Rhodesian locomotives. I also stopped for a drink at the &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; Bar on Mugabe Street which has sort of a &quot;Cecil Rhodes&quot; theme and does jazz music at night.<br><br>About an hour&#039;s drive from Bulawayo, visit Matobo National Park to see Cecil Rhodes&#039;s grave. It&#039;s a beautiful location (and there&#039;s lots of other stuff to do in the park as well).<br><br>If you&#039;re at all interested in African history you can also visit Great Zimbabwe (~4h east of Bulawayo), which is supposedly one of the greatest &quot;castles&quot; built in pre-colonial Africa.<br><br>Lastly, I would recommend taking the train from Bulawayo to Vic Falls. They still operate old Rhodesian Railways rolling stock from the 1950s and 60s. It&#039;s an overnight trip where you basically wake up in Vic Falls. Booking a sleeper car is super cheap--but when I was there it had to be done at the train station in cash. Idk if they&#039;ve fixed this by now.<br><br>As usual, be cautious with your belongings.

Maybe some anons can give you advice. If you want a very nice apartment set up in advance, you could search for rental agencies in the destination city.
