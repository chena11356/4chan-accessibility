This is a man who always looks slightly stricken. When he speaks out loud, it tends to be hesitant and stilted. But as he eats, even if his expression is serious, in voiceover we hear his inner thoughts as he deeply enjoys the food he\u2019s been served. This is a man whose one true joy is dining alone, but we get to share his meals with him.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodok<wbr>u_no_Gourmet<br><br>https://twitter.com/tx_kodokugurume<wbr><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ell<wbr>pGKKIsec", "filename": "305661703_5763364757049737_3150183776262605620_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 41, "tim": 1673746802268175, "time": 1673746802, "md5": "bFPfk+kYP7DZLKv4B9GyYA==", "fsize": 97707, "resto": 2390173}, {"no": 2390422, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)20:43:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2390342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2390342</a><br>Everywhere.

You can use the machine (it supports english), or talk to the person at the counter. Show up around 20 mins before your train departs.

Staying in Osaka the entire time means you do not have to carry your luggage around, and also you can rearrange days depending on your needs.<br>When you are done with Osaka, you can forward your luggage from Osaka -&gt; Tokyo for about 2500yen.<br>One suggestion for you: If you are flying into Narita, consider flying from NRT -&gt; KIX rather than taking the NRT-&gt;shinkansen-&gt;Osaka.

I cannot recommend it enough if you come back to Japan though, focuses a lot on the firebombing and earthquakes to the extent it gave me vibes similar to the 9/11 memorial in NYC, with a similar quality (just an overall very well put together museum experience, my fave from Tokyo for sure).

Might be worth considering swapping Z\u00fcrich for Bern (many posters here hate Bern, too, but I think its historic center is prettier than Z\u00fcrich\u2019s) and adding a side trip somewhere in the nearby mountains of the Bernese highlands.

If you\u2019re not concerned about potential abuse and addiction, you might also talk to a doctor about a small quantity of an anxiolytic like Xanax or Ativan, but any drug in the barbiturate or benzodiazepine families is more serious business than people like to think, and shouldn\u2019t be used too casually. They\u2019re all physically habit-forming with nasty withdrawal symptoms, and some people get unpleasant benzo hangovers that can leave you groggy and stupid for an extended period.

Vietnam is garbage for both. The cooming offer is nowhere close to its neighbors and the beaches are frankly shit. While they can seem nice at a first glance, Vietnam is drowning in trash and has zero water pollution standards. You&#039;ll be frolicking in the waves and suddenly there&#039;s literal shit all around you.<br>2. People are often plain rude. There&#039;s little in the way of etiquette and the concept of disturbing others (which is generally a problem with SEA, but not to that level) does not exist in Vietnam at all. They&#039;ll spit, cut the line and play shitty Tik-Tok vids on full volume at 3AM on a night bus if they feel like it. Everyone working in the tourist industry has nothing but utmost contempt for tourists and will make sure you know that.<br>3. Scams. 80% of all Vietnamese you&#039;ll interact with will lie through their teeth in an attempt to extract money from you. If you don&#039;t play along, they&#039;ll get loud, insistent and aggressive. You can easily get ripped off in Thailand, which has ten times the return rate, but they usually do it with a smile and try to make sure you won&#039;t notice. Vietnam is on the level of people blatantly telling you to fuck off and demanding double while you point at the price list right behind them.<br>Don&#039;t take me wrong, Vietnam&#039;s my favorite place in SEA, but it is, without any doubt, a rude shithole that is the very opposite of comfy and that relaxed holiday feeling is what people are usually looking for.", "time": 1672245155, "resto": 2378355}, {"no": 2380118, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:03:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2379723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2379723</a><br>This is an absolute lie.

If you can&#039;t afford it then you can&#039;t go. Second, where are you going and for how long? You can split your budget by number of days and then check if you have enough money for accomodations, food, tourism, flight, transportation or if it will be unafforadble for you at which point you need to work more and delay your trip. You&#039;re from EU so that passport should open a lot of doors for you, some countries may still require you to apply for a visa so check before you buy a ticket if you need to or don&#039;t. Also, check restrictions on time limits for visa-free travel (can&#039;t go in visa free and stay indefinitely, many places have a 90 day limit).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what about a place to stay?</span><br>hostels, airbnb&#039;s, cheap hotels, expensive hotels are all options.

You have the internet available, so use it. You can go minimalist and winging it or you can make a full day by day itinerary where you pick certain stops per day and plan a route to visit all of them. If you search online you may find sample routes for places you want to go to which you can alter at will based on your own interests. Look up lists of landmarks, museums, historical sites, hidden gems, hot spots in town and then find out which ones you want to go to and which ones you can skip on. Once you know where to go, find ways to connect them. If they&#039;re all in a circle around your accommodation, divide that circle into quadrants and explore it in a loop so you hit your interests and see the town on the way to and back. You can even find quality restaurants ahead of time per area and go to those the day you head out. It&#039;s really no different from mapping out a day in your own town. Something like:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;want to go see city hall in my small town</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh and there&#039;s a museum a few blocks away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s even a really beautiful park further down from the museum</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s going to be around lunchtime when I go, theres a restaurant with great reviews between the museum and park so i can stop there</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;after the park i&#039;ll need to make my way back, but ill return in a circle instead of a straight line back to check out a church and another museum before I leave</span><br>It&#039;s that simple, people really overestimate planning for travel. It takes a few hours at most to have everything ready, from bookings to day-to-day itineraries. <br><br>Speaking of bookings, do not use sites that book for you.

There&#039;s no connection whatsoever between them and the young women they marry, they can barely communicate. It&#039;s painful to watch. I remember old guys awkwardly telling their girlfriends they&#039;ll give them money to go buy shoes or something generic like that, obviously not knowing anything about those women. The idea of dating/marrying some young girl who doesn&#039;t give a shit about you, probably resents you, and who you have no connection with, is much more depressing than being alone. There is something very creepy and wrong with a lot of the old sexpats down there, it kind of makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.<br><br>At the same time, you&#039;re right, these are old guys and I can&#039;t blame some of them for wanting to go around and fuck some attractive girls (though I find Cambodians ugly). Spending old age in a cheap tropical country with hot women doesn&#039;t sound bad at all. While I am judgmental of those creepy guys, I&#039;ve also known guys who brought back foreign wives who were younger, and they seemed quite happy. So maybe there&#039;s a right way and a wrong way to do it. It&#039;s also noticeable that it seems like women usually age a lot worse than men, so I see it all the time where there&#039;s a pretty good looking dude in his 60s, with a hideous, completely un-sexual woman his same age, and the disparity between them is depressing. I can very easily see myself getting a hot younger wife when I&#039;m older. But the key thing is, there would have to be a real personal connection, because relationships are really about the company. If you feel no personal connection, then you might as well just fuck random hookers on your free time. I believe the thing that&#039;s worse than being alone, is being with people who make you feel all alone.", "time": 1673223133, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2386695, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)19:19:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2386691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2386691</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t waste my breathe on these guys.

But lo, the bus is overbooked! Heated phonecalls from the driver and two of the travel agents appear. After more discussions and phonecalls a rusty heap of a bus with ominous, black fumes surrounding it is summoned. While one travel agent tries to convince the last passengers to board the death trap another realizes they don&#039;t need a second bus for 6 passengers. Another deliberation and a minivan loads the passengers. While the unneeded bus driver isn&#039;t happy about this, the travel agents hash it out with him as the bus finally leaves, minivan close behind. After a quick 60km detour through winding mountain roads because the driver forgot his lunchbox you are now on your way! <br><br>I&#039;d recommend just booking the first two - three nights of accommodation after flying in iot get your bearings and give you time to book the next step on site.", "time": 1673834621, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2391055, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)21:38:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2390878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2390878</a><br>where do you meet these girls?", "time": 1673836711, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2391069, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:24:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2391047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2391047</a><br>Sounds like good advise, the integrity of these agents seems poor.

I had decided to go on my first solo trip to anywhere that was cheap. I had dreamed of Central Asia, and wanted to live with the steppe nomads, and this song transports me there. It\u2019s almost primordial and I find a great beauty in the steppe. The people of the steppe have always been conquerors, from the Indo Europeans, to the Scythians, Huns, Mongols, etc, they all had a free and limitless vision of the world and themselves. Anyways, the cheapest place to go was not the steppe, but Hawaii funnily enough. I stayed in this hostel that cost 19$ a night in a 8 bed co Ed room. I had no car, 400$ and 2 weeks. I ended up going all over Oahu. I went to the north shore by bus, climbed koko head, swam everywhere where I got over my fear of ocean life. I did a hike into the rainforest, and I went to the dole plantation. I forgot my phone so I wasn\u2019t able to talk or contact anyone. That trip changed me, and I look back now and the pain of my girlfriend leaving me doesn\u2019t even come up. Now at almost 22, I\u2019m still young but I have the opposite issue where I want to be free but I have had a long term girlfriend for 2 years at this point. I love her but don\u2019t want to hurt her or myself if I leave. So maybe one day I\u2019ll have another Hawaii experience somewhere for my current situation, but that remains to be seen.

I&#039;m only talking about Taiwan because that&#039;s what I know, and you seem to have either Taiwan or Japan as an endgoal. You won&#039;t solve being a shut-in by meeting up open people. You&#039;ll solve it by either meeting people who match your energy or truly learning why you can&#039;t socialize.<br><br>Introverts don&#039;t want to talk shop because they think small talk is a thing for retards, when really, small talk is the human way to show that they want to sniff your butt and enter your social circle so they can actually open up to you.

Think about this problem, and trying to find some solutions on your own would be a good exercise. <br><br>Second, I always recommend people to go out and meet the expats in Taipei. They&#039;re a varied, decent bunch, very open, and are present in pretty much every night scene, they understand what it is to be a complete stranger to everyone and having to spontaneously meet new folks, and until you can understand how to make friends with locals, they can also introduce you to some.

On that device you&#039;d use a VPN (preferably to a friend&#039;s home network in your home country, but maybe ExpressVPN will work for you since many of their exit nodes are partnered with local ISPs). Then you connect your work laptop to that router/gateway device. Your work laptop connects to the company VPN and your company VPN sees it coming from the personal/ExpressVPN address your router/gateway is using. If you do this route, you need a router/gateway that with a killswitch that will completely drop your internet interface if the VPN drops.<br>I think your big problem is having flaky work software that require you to bring the laptop to the office to fix.

International roaming depends on your carrier&#039;s agreement with some local carrier to provide you service in order to work. So when you try to log in, it&#039;ll show that country&#039;s location. <br><br>And it&#039;s not a guarantee you&#039;ll be able to get 5G wherever you go. Even in Europe. I paid my American carrier for unlimited roaming internet while abroad (again, it was a French carrier providing me the actual service, you can only do this a few months before they cut you off anyway), and I bought a French SIM card, and even then, the best I could get was 4G. <br><br>Besides that, if your company really is anal about security then there&#039;s no way in hell you&#039;ll be able to hide the fact that you&#039;re abroad from them.

This means banks and security work are probably a no-go for you (though there are surely exceptions). You should be looking for a new job constantly anyway, so that your compensation is as high as it can be. <br><br>Many companies won&#039;t allow you to work from abroad, if only to save themselves the tax and legal troubles they would have to figure out in another country.

If you&#039;re overly paranoid though or travelling somewhere you doubt there will be laundromats, pack a clothes washing soap bar.<br>Depending on where you&#039;re going all you really need is 1 scenario-specific outfit (by that I mean a &quot;going out&quot; outfit or a &quot;hiking&quot; outfit) and even then, try and fit that with your everyday outfit. For example, a &quot;going out&quot; outfit might just be your everyday jeans with a nice shirt rather than bringing nice jeans and a nice shirt. If you&#039;re going hiking your everyday shirt will be fine and more often than not, so will your everyday jeans.<br><br>Of course if you&#039;re a woman you&#039;re probably going full wacko mode and you&#039;re going to pack shit you don&#039;t need regardless.

And it sounds like you\u2019re at least starting to make a plan, which is good. My biggest piece of additional advice as you keep thinking things through is this, and I think it is extremely important: <br><br>You probably have (or will soon have) some estimate in your head of how much money you will be bringing with you when you arrive. However much money that is, double it, at least, before you get on the plane. Even in low-COL countries, initial outlays are going to be more than you think they will be, and you\u2019re certain to run into expenses you weren\u2019t anticipating at all. Housing, for example, even in poor countries, is almost always more expensive for foreigners who don\u2019t have local connections. It will be especially expensive if you are arriving without legal, long-term residency (for example, just showing up in a country that lets your nationality in visa-free for 90 days, or six months, or even a year). Without some kind of residency document, you\u2019re not likely to be able to sign a normal lease, so at least at first you will probably be stuck with short-term accommodations aimed at foreigners. These are going to be more expensive than whatever locals pay in rent, so even if you research average rents in your arrival city you won\u2019t get an accurate picture of what it will really cost YOU.<br><br>Getting legally established is gong to cost more than you think it will, as well, almost without question. If you eventually change your visa status, you may be required to return to your home country to finalize the process at an embassy. You\u2019ll get your new visa only when you come back, so you\u2019ll want to budget for at least one trip home. MAYBE you will be able to get the paperwork done in-country, or maybe you\u2019ll just have to hop a border to a neighboring country, but don\u2019t count on it. Budget for the most expensive of these possibilities to avoid shock.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cont\u2019d</span>", "time": 1673435043, "resto": 2387906}, {"no": 2388307, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)06:24:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2388301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2388301</a><br>It\u2019s also unwise to compare whatever money you expect to be earning (online, with your future business, etc.) with average local incomes, or worse yet, with GDP per capita, which is practically meaningless. Maybe the average local is only earning $XXXX per year. He\u2019s also living with his extended family in a home owned by his grandparents and spending less on food than you will ever know how to, so even if you are bringing in $XXXX x 2 per year you aren\u2019t going to be as rich as you think you are.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story.

When it comes to La Placita, youve got an actual plaza and a few streets near it that are safe. I wouldn&#039;t go further south past La Penultima (solid bar btw) or too far directly east/west of it by foot. North of it is Condado which will get progressively safer the further north you go.

La Grieta is a great mezcal bar. La verguenza is more dive bar but has 3 floors and nice views. La taberna lupulo is a beer hall with an open air indoor patio you can smoke and drink at. Big local beers are trash, avoid Medalla and Magna, stick to Ocean Labs or FOK brews for better local beer.

El Cu\u00f1ao is a restaurant in the mountains near Cayey, go here for tons of local dishes but most notably Lechon (whole pork skewered on a rod and roasted over a fire, then served piece by piece). Morcillas (Blood sausage stuffed with rice and spices), longaniza (Spanish style sausage), Arroz con gandules (Rice and beans), Amarillos (fried sweet instead of salty plantain) are all good here, and the drive is quite nice. <br>4.

My point was, most universities from any given country, your home country included, have exchanges and double diploma deals with chinese universities. Your best bet would be to integrate those for a Master&#039;s degree. You then basically have the length of your studies there to do some networking, find a job or a PhD. It will not be easy but it is possible if you stay there and look long enough. Also, you need to seriously work on your Chinese. Since you&#039;re not doing STEM in an international corpo or TEFL, you&#039;re basically competing directly with the chinese in a domain where they don&#039;t recruit much foreigners. You could contend, but you have to even up the playing field, and that goes by learning mandarin. <br><br>Don&#039;t try to directly apply for a Chinese university if you&#039;re doing a pol sci cursus. You might end up with mandatory classes taught in mandarin, which would then put you in big trouble, because pol sci taught in chinese means you&#039;re going to write a shit ton of essays in chinese, which requires an advanced mastery of the language.<br><br>But in any case, learning Chinese is a must.

According to chinese teaching associations in germany and france, as well as the TOCFL commitee, an HSK5 from before 2021 is basically B1 or very low B2. Why am I pointing this out ? Because sociology is an essay and analysis heavy course, and a professor or a lecturer would have to teach that in Chinese. Which he couldn&#039;t possibly manage. He could&#039;ve taught the courses in english, but even then english courses have such a low volume in any university it wouldn&#039;t justify the expenditure of hiring a lecturer let alone a professor.

I mean, not exactly -if you spend 5 years networking throughout the country while doing your PhD , you could get somewhere. But in any case, you&#039;ll have a shit pay (during your PhD and after), will live in squalor in a dormitory where it is likely not allowed to have guests at night (so no cooming), and not much money nor time to visit the country. A PhD in China is usually around 5 years, so here&#039;s to that. And after your PhD, you could go for a post-doc (2-1 years), still living in the same squalor. And then, who knows ?
