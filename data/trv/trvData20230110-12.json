Over half of the parks are 1 day visitors from off property.

For example, Steel Vengeance has a mining back story in the queue and its overall look fits the nearby themed frontier town. I think this works a lot better than a parking lot coaster.

Luzern is a bit nicer as a tourist town; if you go, be sure to take some boat trips on the enormous lake. Might be worth considering swapping Z\u00fcrich for Bern (many posters here hate Bern, too, but I think its historic center is prettier than Z\u00fcrich\u2019s) and adding a side trip somewhere in the nearby mountains of the Bernese highlands.

In Venice I got St. Mark&#039;s square pretty much empty except for a few carabinieri, people setting up shop and pigeons.

Where I live as an expat, surrounded by other expats, it mostly means that you moved for work or were moved by your job. Maybe temporarily, maybe more permanently, very often serially in the big white collar world (I know lots of people who have bounced around many international postings for new opportunities within the same company, or for similar jobs with competitors), but whether the place is a shithole or not has little to do with it. Expat professionals take jobs in shitholes because they get things like contracts that include housing and servants and a car and driver and paid trips \u201chome\u201d a couple of times a year while earning several times more than natives. They also get jobs in rich places with perks like high salaries and private school tuition subsidies for their kids.

There&#039;s no connection whatsoever between them and the young women they marry, they can barely communicate. It&#039;s painful to watch. I remember old guys awkwardly telling their girlfriends they&#039;ll give them money to go buy shoes or something generic like that, obviously not knowing anything about those women. The idea of dating/marrying some young girl who doesn&#039;t give a shit about you, probably resents you, and who you have no connection with, is much more depressing than being alone. There is something very creepy and wrong with a lot of the old sexpats down there, it kind of makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.<br><br>At the same time, you&#039;re right, these are old guys and I can&#039;t blame some of them for wanting to go around and fuck some attractive girls (though I find Cambodians ugly). Spending old age in a cheap tropical country with hot women doesn&#039;t sound bad at all. While I am judgmental of those creepy guys, I&#039;ve also known guys who brought back foreign wives who were younger, and they seemed quite happy. So maybe there&#039;s a right way and a wrong way to do it. It&#039;s also noticeable that it seems like women usually age a lot worse than men, so I see it all the time where there&#039;s a pretty good looking dude in his 60s, with a hideous, completely un-sexual woman his same age, and the disparity between them is depressing. I can very easily see myself getting a hot younger wife when I&#039;m older. But the key thing is, there would have to be a real personal connection, because relationships are really about the company. If you feel no personal connection, then you might as well just fuck random hookers on your free time. I believe the thing that&#039;s worse than being alone, is being with people who make you feel all alone.", "time": 1673223133, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2386695, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)19:19:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2386691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2386691</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t waste my breathe on these guys.

It&#039;s usually shaming tactics from women, and then I see guys doing it to other guys, and I&#039;m convinced it because the guys are either jealous themselves, or will try and use anything they can find to feel superior to someone else. Height, hair, age.. anything they can leverage.<br><br>Of course the women are there just for the money, but most guys know this. They want someone to be nice to them and give them sex and cook and clean. Basically a maid + lover combo. Most of the expats have been run through the ringer and chewed up by divorce to a Western woman. They have almost no dating options at their age, aside from some old, entitled, fat, wrinkly, 65 year old chick who has a ton of emotional hang-ups herself. <br><br>So as long as the guy never forgets the situation, he can enjoy a live in sex maid who he can hang out with instead of being alone, shivering by himself in a run down flat in London. <br>And it&#039;s not really about having a personal connection with someone 30 years younger who barely speaks English. <br><br>Whether or not you think its worse or better to be legit alone all the time is up to you, but there is no affordable way to have a 30 year old lover and maid as a 70 year old guy in the West. But in SEA it&#039;s financially affordable.<br><br>Sort of hilarious that while sanctimonious young guys here are scorning and judging those expats, those geezers are busy doing their thing and getting their dicks sucked every night.

Before I moved here, I&#039;d visited multiple times per year for over a decade. My feelings for this country could be characterized as akin to a love-hate relationship. Outside of its cities, India is an extraordinarily beautiful country. People tend to be friendly, the cost-of-living is low, and there&#039;s a lot to see and do. <br><br>Sexual violence and street-side harassment, or &quot;eve-teasing,&quot; are genuine concerns.

Just took picrel today in rural Jharkhand. Stopped and talked to a bunch of tribal people along the trails and paths. They were all pretty jolly.

Find a company that takes you as an intern in an area that gonna be useful in your future work. Make lots of business connections while there. Work times usually are longer but overall I was way less stressed and burned out. Reason is that life in Japan is easy mode. Big service culture, punctual trains, people are calm and quiet in public spaces, food is great. Taking a nap in the office during work time wasn\u2018t a problem either. I wish I could move back and work there but now close up to 40s I kinda need to take care of my parents.

Its basically a fast track through customs when you arrive. They are going to want to know where you are staying and they will ask a few questions like whether you have more than 1kg of gold shoved in your ass. Theres going to be a tab called like &quot;quarantine fast track&quot; and when you click on it there will be a big red box thing. Scroll to the bottom and tell it no on the vaccination certificate and then it will allow you to certify with the test.

It reminds me of going to the movies. If you go alone, even if you want to see the movie, you always going to feel a little bit out of place, like your don&#039;t belong.

Its catered around and aimed towards people who are in relationships with each other (romantic, friendships) and it&#039;s enjoyable to them because they have a good time *together*, they make memories with other people.

Vietnam is garbage for both. The cooming offer is nowhere close to its neighbors and the beaches are frankly shit. While they can seem nice at a first glance, Vietnam is drowning in trash and has zero water pollution standards. You&#039;ll be frolicking in the waves and suddenly there&#039;s literal shit all around you.<br>2. People are often plain rude. There&#039;s little in the way of etiquette and the concept of disturbing others (which is generally a problem with SEA, but not to that level) does not exist in Vietnam at all. They&#039;ll spit, cut the line and play shitty Tik-Tok vids on full volume at 3AM on a night bus if they feel like it. Everyone working in the tourist industry has nothing but utmost contempt for tourists and will make sure you know that.<br>3. Scams. 80% of all Vietnamese you&#039;ll interact with will lie through their teeth in an attempt to extract money from you. If you don&#039;t play along, they&#039;ll get loud, insistent and aggressive. You can easily get ripped off in Thailand, which has ten times the return rate, but they usually do it with a smile and try to make sure you won&#039;t notice. Vietnam is on the level of people blatantly telling you to fuck off and demanding double while you point at the price list right behind them.<br>Don&#039;t take me wrong, Vietnam&#039;s my favorite place in SEA, but it is, without any doubt, a rude shithole that is the very opposite of comfy and that relaxed holiday feeling is what people are usually looking for.", "time": 1672245155, "resto": 2378355}, {"no": 2380118, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:03:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2379723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2379723</a><br>This is an absolute lie.

It was an amazing time.

You can spend a week in a place if you want, but I recommend going across Europe.<br><br>I also recommend staying in hostels with other travelers.

Open brothel district where you can see all the girls sitting at the front of their shops, and you pick one and go.

Matsushima Shinchi, also in Osaka, is the same, but there are fewer shops, and the quality of the girls isn&#039;t at the same level.

Tobita is by far my favorite if you&#039;re mainly concerned about looks and want to get the prettiest and cutest girl possible without risking getting baited by photoshopped/old pics (soaplands are notorious for this). Service can feel a little distant because they&#039;re so pretty and in high demand, but some of the best fucks I&#039;ve had were a matter of finding the right girl. And going at nighttime with all the lights and just seeing a huge variety of girls (little loli type, slutty gyaru, shrine maiden outfits, nurses, kimonos) is intoxicating.<br><br>Soaplands are better if you want to have more time and a less rushed experience, but the quality of girls can vary a lot, and you have to pay top dollar to fuck the prettiest ones. A bit more Japanese is necessary to enter and to schedule things, but it can be done. Yoshiwara in Tokyo is probably your best bet as a foreigner, and that place is kind of well-known for having girls that do NS (No Skin) and NN (Nakadashi), so raw sex is possible, although that might not be an option for you if they&#039;re wary about you because you&#039;re a foreigner.<br><br>Delivery/Hotel Health where girls are delivered to your selected love hotel is good and can be priced fairly, but you&#039;re paying for the love hotel.

Lots to see, great night life, very attractive women, lots to explore, catacombs, world class museums. Winter is the best time to visit Paris for the first time as there&#039;s not as much tourists and you won&#039;t get annoyed by huge lines in the main sights and there&#039;s less touts (which is what everyone is shitting their pants over). Also it&#039;s not overrun by tourists and locals are actually there. Spring is arguably the best period, but I recommend it after you&#039;ve seen the main stuff and can just enjoy walking along the banks of Seine with spring flowers and blossom everywhere.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story.

Stop in Jemez Springs on your way down, you can check out the historic sight or just hangout at the biker bar. From their you can either go to Albuquerque or up 550 towards Farmington.

I&#039;ve seen people trying to start relationships with these women and failing so fucking hard because these women unravel once they realize how mundane and human a westerner is as the guy himself realizes he&#039;s putting his dick in crazy.<br><br>The other, healthier kind, are just women that have a more international vibe and thus are ok with dating foreigners because the foreigners living in taiwan also have this globohomo vibe. These women acknowledge that they have a taiwanese identity, don&#039;t exclusively date western men and don&#039;t purposefully dress up for them, and just have a far more healthier outlook on life. They don&#039;t try to pretend they&#039;re something they&#039;re not, they&#039;re not necessarily fetishizing certain ethnicities. They just want an international relationship because they have an education that made them ok with the idea. One of my exgf was just that, a woman who did an MBA in France, speaks english perfectly, and has had relationships with taiwanese before. I&#039;ve met her at a conference and we probably had one of the more healthier relationship i&#039;ve ever had.", "time": 1670853804, "resto": 2370937}, {"no": 2371637, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:25:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2371626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2371626</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Huh?

Don&#039;t spend a week in Prague. It is a tourist trap. Stay two days, walk around the recommended places by literally any tour guide, you&#039;re not gonna find anything better other than other tourists to fuck. If you want something interesting and lively, go to Brno for two days or three - biggest student city with the business that goes along with it. Parties, really nice coffee shops, interesting artsy spots. It&#039;s cheaper and more progressive than Prague. Other than that, it depends on what you want/like. If you want nature and beautiful natural sights, head to Adr\u0161pach/Teplice mountain complex or Moravsk\u00fd kras, or Krkono\u0161e mountains or \u0160umava forests. If you want history/middle ages, Lednice is a beautiful chateau that is interconnected with one of the most beautiful garden complexes (but that sucks in this time of the year). Zl\u00edn is a beautiful and interesting looking city. If I were you, I&#039;d avoid Ostrava (an ex-miner city that has a lot of not very nice people there) and Olomouc (a flat industrial city that is starting to get more lively, following in Brno&#039;s footsteps, but not really worth it. Honestly just chat up a young czech student person and ask them where to go. Also don&#039;t be mistaken, czech people are very cold by nature and they don&#039;t really chit-chat very well and are a bit stand-offish, but they&#039;re good in heart and especially young generations are more lively and extroverted, so don&#039;t be afraid to socialize.", "time": 1673128343, "resto": 2381491}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2386024, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)16:24:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do digital nomads browse /trv/?

For starters, I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;re an American.<br><br>I&#039;ll talk about a few countries across the globe.<br><br>One country I&#039;d recommend is Mexico. To become a citizen, you just need to invest approx. $250k to $300k to automatically apply for residency. Look for places in Playa Del Carmen, for example. However, the further away from major cities, the more questionable the nightlife and healthcare is. There&#039;s some restrictions as to where you can buy property, so you need to look into whether these restrictions bother you or not. Furthermore, Mexico has universal healthcare, and you&#039;re close to the States. It&#039;s not bad.<br><br>In South America, I&#039;d recommend Ecuador. Weather is springlike year round, so no worries about sweltering heat or blistering cold. The national currency is actually the USD. It&#039;s also one of the safest places to live in South America too. Getting citizenship can take about four years, but properties can go as cheap as $150k for a nice apartment/house. <br><br>Finally, on the European continent, you could buy a nice apartment in Tbilisi, Georgia. They usually go for anywhere from $50k to the sky&#039;s the limit, honestly. To buy property, you&#039;d need a good financial advisor/lawyer and a copy of your passport. That&#039;s it. Healthcare is free and public. Nightlife is good. Without rent, which is cheap already, your cost of living will be great. In the capital, some folks can speak English, but you shouldn&#039;t rely on this to be the case. <br><br>As you can see, OP, you can buy property in a developing country but this&#039;ll require you to hop through the governments of developing countries and to fully integrate, require you to learn another language and about a culture if you&#039;re serious about this. I have my reservations about you buying property at your age, but I did want to answer your question.", "time": 1672990919, "resto": 2384726}, {"no": 2385161, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:47:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2384726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2384726</a><br><br>Also, if I could give you another piece of advice, (assuming you&#039;re an American), invest a good chunk of that money into the market and forget about it for 30 years. Assuming the US market grows at an average of 10%, and you don&#039;t touch a dime of that cash, you&#039;d have approx. $4.3 million to retire on by age 50. If you invest even 10% of your freelance money into your retirement, which you should, you can get to that mark earlier. In that case, you could live off of approx. $100k per year until you&#039;re 90. Of course, this is assuming nothing disastrous happens between then and now, which is silly, so the risk is yours.

I would say that driving in Naples is ALMOST as bad as its reputation\u2014along with being a very dense and crowded city, Italians are very aggressive drivers, much more than the American average, Neapolitans probably especially so. And Southerners are less rule-bound than northern Italians, so while most drivers come across as fairly skilled they don\u2019t necessarily obey traffic laws. <br><br>I drive well, and manual transmission is my first language (I assume that when you say you know how to drive, you drive stick at least as well as you drive automatic; lots of Americans don\u2019t, as I\u2019m sure you know), but I find driving in Naples a stressful pain in the ass. I would never use a car as my main mode of transportation there if I were staying inside the city (I\u2019ve only ever driven in from outside). Parking sucks too. Taxis are cheap, metro is good. I don\u2019t love Amalfi Coast driving, either, although it is often beautiful\u2014I\u2019ve had to get the hell out of the way of too many oncoming trucks and buses on narrow clifftop roads for my taste.<br><br>My final thought on driving in Italy is that it\u2019s the only place I consistently take the additional insurance car rental companies are always trying to upsell you\u2014I estimate that my rentals have gotten grazed, dented, or scratched (usually but not exclusively through no fault of my own) about 75% of the times I have driven there.", "time": 1673011764, "resto": 2385279}, {"no": 2385292, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)08:42:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2385285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2385285</a><br>Thanks for the info man, I guess the stories are true.

The TL is indeed not a nice place, but in many years of living in San Francisco I found it more depressing than dangerous. Lots of homeless people, drug addicts, and low-end prostitutes, and it\u2019s filthy, but it\u2019s actually not a major center of violent crime even if it looks like it could be. There are even a handful of interesting bars and restaurants there.

The Mission, which runs along Mission and Valencia Streets between 16th-24th St., is historically and still largely Latino, but has gentrified into an arts and nightlife neighborhood with influxes of hipsters followed by yuppies. Valencia is a great restaurant and bar corridor; Mission St is grubbier but authentic.

Both are good for Asian food.<br><br>The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood is still partially a tourist-trap monument to the Summer of Love (even if real hippies can no longer afford to live there), but there are some good cheap restaurants and a few interesting shops among the repetitive head shops. The Lower Haight, roughly ten blocks east of there and centered around Haight and Fillmore, has some good cheap food, a couple of cool bars, and artsy locals.
