This corrects an error from previous maps where the entire Golan Heights was shown as being a separate Israeli district.</span><br>I also removed Donetsk and Luhansk People&#039;s Republics that were added in the previous update, because with everything going on, they can hardly claim to be unrecognized countries anymore.

You can visit the railway museum which is for spergs but it&#039;s still kind of cool to see the old Rhodesian locomotives. I also stopped for a drink at the &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; Bar on Mugabe Street which has sort of a &quot;Cecil Rhodes&quot; theme and does jazz music at night.<br><br>About an hour&#039;s drive from Bulawayo, visit Matobo National Park to see Cecil Rhodes&#039;s grave. It&#039;s a beautiful location (and there&#039;s lots of other stuff to do in the park as well).<br><br>If you&#039;re at all interested in African history you can also visit Great Zimbabwe (~4h east of Bulawayo), which is supposedly one of the greatest &quot;castles&quot; built in pre-colonial Africa.<br><br>Lastly, I would recommend taking the train from Bulawayo to Vic Falls. They still operate old Rhodesian Railways rolling stock from the 1950s and 60s. It&#039;s an overnight trip where you basically wake up in Vic Falls. Booking a sleeper car is super cheap--but when I was there it had to be done at the train station in cash. Idk if they&#039;ve fixed this by now.<br><br>As usual, be cautious with your belongings.
