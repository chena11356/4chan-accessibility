For Madrid stay by the Gran Via, Puerta del Sol or Parque del Retiro and use the metro to get around. For Barcelona, as much as she will want to go, avoid La Rambla.

To check it off the list though, take her to breakfast at El Quim de la Boqueria (small restaurant in the farmers market) and then proceed to go right towards the gothic quarter. Prebook tickets to the sagrada familia so you don&#039;t have to wait in line and get lunch at La Paradeta nearby, super fresh seafood. El Raval is a bit more ghetto but it&#039;s still more authentic than La Rambla.

I&#039;m sorry you had to go through this shit, but it appears as if you made a couple of no-nos you should avoid doing in any third world country and this is why you didn&#039;t enjoy your experience quite as much. <br><br>The biggest issue with tourists is that they go on the usual spots who are chock full of grifters. Marrakech is a prime example of a city completely fucked by this, as well as other shitty spots like Sti Fadma. Even locals are subjected to these behaviors and it&#039;s fucking annoying. Your best way of doing stuff is to not answer or not even interact with those people. They take literally any kind of reaction as an invitation to try harder.<br>Also, general advice, maybe don&#039;t look like a a stereotypical american tourist like picrel in the muslim world in general. Americans have anglo-germanic traits that can easily be spotted, and the classic shirt + tshirt (or just shirt) set is a dead give away. if you really want to look fancy walking in a third world country, wear a polo shirt. Otherwise, just wear a plain t-shirt. This is what I do in every fucking country i visit, even first world ones.<br><br>Also, two other things : the Medina/Casbah of a given city isn&#039;t a place where you chill and drink coffee. They are on the same level as favelas in terms of poverty and education. Always stay in the beaten path and never leave it. If you&#039;re in a place where people are selling drugs to an American you&#039;re in the wrong fucking part of town.

What&#039;s different now is I&#039;ve learned I don&#039;t like cities and its people very much, and want to stick to forests, mountains, trails, and small towns. I think my new form of travel is PCT-esque; I&#039;ll follow mountain ranges and trails and skip into town to resupply while occasionally making stops at interesting cities or landmarks by hitching rides or local transport.

Camping in the woods is a non-issue for me. The occasional shower and warm bed is all I need to keep going. Finding accommodation has been a really big problem for me in large towns and cities because there aren&#039;t any camping spots and prices are expensive. This is the thing I&#039;m most worried about.<br>2) Acquiring shelf-stable food. In my experience, walking into a restaurant and telling the waitress you&#039;re traveling the world and would like some free food often works. It doesn&#039;t work at a supermarket when all you need is two jars of peanut butter. How do I get food that&#039;ll keep me going for 2-3 days while hiking without money or working, ideally?<br>3) Safe havens when sick or injured. Occasionally I&#039;ll get sick or injured while traveling and just need a place to stay to recover. Where do I go?<br>4) Making money while traveling. I really don&#039;t care for money and if I have to work I want to work as little as possible. What kind of work should I be looking out for that a foreigner can do?

St Catherine is in the middle of South Sinai, on Egypt&#039;s Sinai Peninsula. Busses leave once daily from Cairo&#039;s Torgamon bus station at 9:30am. My ticket was 175 Egyptian, ~9USD. Bus took exactly 7 hours, few stops along the way, more than half empty but I bought my ticket the day in advance to be safe.<br><br>The two main things to do in the town are climbing Mt Sinai (picrel) and visiting the monastery. Climbing the mountain was incredible and one of the best experiences I&#039;ve had over 40+ countries. Takes about 4 hours to the top if you&#039;re relatively fit, and I got up in time for the sunset which was magical. You have to (read: have to) take a Bedouin guide up the mountain. Mine was really nice and very liberal with time, bought snacks, and took all the photos I wanted. Guide costs 450 all in, which I was happy with because he was lovely.<br><br>Monastery is interesting enough and worthwhile for the icon gallery (museum) which has a cool collection of religious iconography and an old treaty signed by Muhammad promising to protect the monastery.<br><br>Blatant deception and assorted jewry from some of the local Bedouin population is a blemish on the trip, though. Camp/accommodation owners will essentially force you to take their ludicrously priced drivers from the camp to the monastery/mountain. 350 Egyptian for a 10 minute taxi, same on the way back. The owners of the place I stayed (450 Egyptian per night, Bedouin camp style place) had a massive shouting match with some woman who was staying there because she called them a mafia. Apparently she tried to take a local cab to the monastery and they found out and demanded she pay them as well as the local taxi, lmao.
