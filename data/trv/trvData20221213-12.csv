Brisbane I think I know the best, simply because I&#039;ve been there the most frequently.

I don&#039;t want to move any higher than Bundaberg which is where I am now. <br><br>There are many things I don&#039;t know about Adelaide however, and having read some of what people say online there are mentions of it being unfriendly towards people who move from other states.<br>That the water costs are higher due to droughts.<br>There is a lack of public health care and public doctors. <br>Are these things true? Please let me know anything else important about Adelaide or the other cities for that matter. <br><br>I ruled out Melbourne mostly because of the climate. I&#039;ve never been but I keep hearing that its cold for 7 months, that there are often 4 seasons in one day and that the houses are woefully unequipped for the weather (no insulation, no double glazed windows etc). <br><br>I think I&#039;d like to live about a 30 min drive from the city centre.

And since Tinder will only serve attractive women HVM, that means the vast majority of men she interacts with will be top earners. So your salary is good, but understand that there are a lot of people in your bracket.<br><br>Also, height is more important in America than anywhere else in the world. Almost no woman will take you seriously if you are under 6&#039;, that&#039;s essentially the magic number where women draw the line. Even if you, as a short person (if you are), get a girlfriend, you will be walking on thin ice every time a tall attractive high earner approaches her. At the minimum, she will experience visible FOMO.<br><br>If you still qualify so far, it&#039;s not over. Attractive women in america are extremely high maintenance. You will need to pay constant attention to her and spend tons of money on her or you will begin to lose her attention, even if she says &quot;i&#039;m fine, babe&quot; until she ends it. The sex will be great while it lasts though, for &quot;some reason&quot; very attractive girls are great at sex and they tend to moan loudly.<br><br>But anon, if you say you can live anywhere, just live in literally any other country.

Realize that everyone gets a little pee shy and it’s not a huge deal. I used to think it was this massive secret I couldn’t let anyone find out and now I just tell people hey I get a little anxious if you’re standing right outside the door can you give me some space. Shit like that. No one cares. They won’t even remember you told them most likely and have to be reminded in the future. I still don’t like urinals (had a gross groping experience in college that this all stems from) but I have accepted I will stand up and piss in a stall and fuck anyone that thinks that’s weird. If you go into the bathroom to piss and leave having done so it’s a win no matter what you did to get it done. <br>I found when I quit smoking weed combined with the above mine basically went away entirely. I can even piss around other people again as long as they aren’t hovering right behind me. Try to find ways to lower your general level of anxiety. Also read up on how anxiety works, once you begin to learn how to deal with it it gets way better. Usually the panic you feel right at the beginning is the worst it will get. If you can deep breathe and allow it to pass I bet you’ll find you can piss. Don’t fight the anxiety, notice it, let it be, and let it go away. <br>Also check out the IPA (International Paruresis Association). They have in person workshops you can attend that are kind of like AA for pee shy people. I went to one a year or two ago and I’m basically cured of it. You go through a lot of the info I outlined above and then break out into groups to practice peeing around other people with people that have the same problems.

Don&#039;t listen to what the other anons are saying, it&#039;s not actually that bad if you keep your wits about you and you&#039;re not a total retard.<br><br>To be fair, Harare is a shithole. If you visit, definitely do not stay in the city center. Generally the northeastern suburbs are the nicest and you should look for a hotel/airbnb there. Barring that, you can stay in Belvedere to the west of the city, which is where I stayed and is somewhat cheaper. It&#039;s a largely Indian and Chinese community. The Harare Gardens are also beautiful and worth strolling around (during the day of course).<br><br>Bulawayo might be a better city for Rhodesia nostalgia (it was Zim&#039;s biggest city until the 30s). Bulawayo is generally quite a pleasant town and you can see a lot of Rhodesian heritage just walking around. You can visit the railway museum which is for spergs but it&#039;s still kind of cool to see the old Rhodesian locomotives. I also stopped for a drink at the &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; Bar on Mugabe Street which has sort of a &quot;Cecil Rhodes&quot; theme and does jazz music at night.<br><br>About an hour&#039;s drive from Bulawayo, visit Matobo National Park to see Cecil Rhodes&#039;s grave. It&#039;s a beautiful location (and there&#039;s lots of other stuff to do in the park as well).<br><br>If you&#039;re at all interested in African history you can also visit Great Zimbabwe (~4h east of Bulawayo), which is supposedly one of the greatest &quot;castles&quot; built in pre-colonial Africa.<br><br>Lastly, I would recommend taking the train from Bulawayo to Vic Falls. They still operate old Rhodesian Railways rolling stock from the 1950s and 60s. It&#039;s an overnight trip where you basically wake up in Vic Falls. Booking a sleeper car is super cheap--but when I was there it had to be done at the train station in cash. Idk if they&#039;ve fixed this by now.<br><br>As usual, be cautious with your belongings.

I haven&#039;t been to Pakistan and Afghanistan but if I really have to compare your country to those shitholes than it just proves it&#039;s a shithole. Maybe in 20 years the country will reach Vietnam levels of development.
