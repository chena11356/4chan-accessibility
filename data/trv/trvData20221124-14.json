Like others, I often like to read novels set in places in or near where I am going. I read Burgess\u2019s Malayan Trilogy while in Southeast Asia (got a used paperback edition in a single volume; a lot of my books are secondhand paperbacks, and some of my favorite trashiest ones can be found in dollar bins at used bookstores), and also Orwell\u2019s Burmese Days (although I think I bought that new at a bookstore in Thailand). <br><br>I believe I first discovered the work of the extremely prolific pulp novelist Edward S. Aarons being given away on a hotel bookshelf in Laos; he wrote dozens of spy thrillers set in exotic locales from the 1950s-1970s, and his descriptions of these settings are actually excellent, although the books are mostly at least a little stupid. Similar but much lower-quality (and first found by me on the same bookshelf) are the KILLMASTER series of novels written by a committee calling itself Nick Carter, the name of the protagonist, a sort of a low-budget, American James Bond type. <br><br>I also read most of Haruki Murakami\u2019s novels on airplanes, back in the serious literature column. 1Q84 might be my favorite but they\u2019re all interesting.

Marrakech is a prime example of a city completely fucked by this, as well as other shitty spots like Sti Fadma. Even locals are subjected to these behaviors and it&#039;s fucking annoying. Your best way of doing stuff is to not answer or not even interact with those people.

Americans have anglo-germanic traits that can easily be spotted, and the classic shirt + tshirt (or just shirt) set is a dead give away. if you really want to look fancy walking in a third world country, wear a polo shirt. Otherwise, just wear a plain t-shirt.

I ask because I feel Asian countries peaked in popularity both on here and overall in society at large in 2019 just before the pandemic hit, and now that the pandemic has changed the face of travel, you just don&#039;t hear much about Asian countries anymore and nobody seems as interested to travel there anymore. Even now there are only one or two Asian related threads that made it even close to the front page, where as before they filled up the entire board. I assume this is because of the rules and regulations, and the local&#039;s insistence of wearing masks since the pandemic began that have shifted people&#039;s views of Asia and made them choose to travel elsewhere for holiday. As someone who enjoyed traveling to countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia quite a bit, this year I decided to try countries in Southeastern Europe like Croatia and Turkey and I found I liked them quite a bit, if not more, than the countries in Southeast Asia. Others that I know have discovered countries in Latin America that they will return to in the future over East Asia or Southeast Asia. How about you guys?

For some reason, they always have good deals. The rooms are nice and the mall downstairs has good food. The only downside is that parking is pretty far, at least a mile each way from the rooms to the parking garage. <br><br>Definitely go downtown at night and check out Fremont Street. It&#039;s fucking wild, especially on the weekends. There are always several free bands playing outside at night.<br><br>If you&#039;re into skateboarding, bring a board and go check out the free skateparks around town. There are like a dozen of them. Some are open all night. <br><br>Arizona Hotsprings is an awesome hike into a slot canyon to see some hot springs you can bath in. You can hike all the way to the colorado river. We saw big horn sheep last time we did it.<br><br>Don&#039;t go to the strip for hookers. Go to an asian massage parlor on Spring Mountain and get jerked off. $40 for the massage, $50 tip for the handjob.

What&#039;s different now is I&#039;ve learned I don&#039;t like cities and its people very much, and want to stick to forests, mountains, trails, and small towns. I think my new form of travel is PCT-esque; I&#039;ll follow mountain ranges and trails and skip into town to resupply while occasionally making stops at interesting cities or landmarks by hitching rides or local transport.

Camping in the woods is a non-issue for me. The occasional shower and warm bed is all I need to keep going. Finding accommodation has been a really big problem for me in large towns and cities because there aren&#039;t any camping spots and prices are expensive. This is the thing I&#039;m most worried about.<br>2) Acquiring shelf-stable food. In my experience, walking into a restaurant and telling the waitress you&#039;re traveling the world and would like some free food often works. It doesn&#039;t work at a supermarket when all you need is two jars of peanut butter. How do I get food that&#039;ll keep me going for 2-3 days while hiking without money or working, ideally?<br>3) Safe havens when sick or injured. Occasionally I&#039;ll get sick or injured while traveling and just need a place to stay to recover. Where do I go?<br>4) Making money while traveling. I really don&#039;t care for money and if I have to work I want to work as little as possible. What kind of work should I be looking out for that a foreigner can do?

St Catherine is in the middle of South Sinai, on Egypt&#039;s Sinai Peninsula. Busses leave once daily from Cairo&#039;s Torgamon bus station at 9:30am. My ticket was 175 Egyptian, ~9USD. Bus took exactly 7 hours, few stops along the way, more than half empty but I bought my ticket the day in advance to be safe.<br><br>The two main things to do in the town are climbing Mt Sinai (picrel) and visiting the monastery. Climbing the mountain was incredible and one of the best experiences I&#039;ve had over 40+ countries. Takes about 4 hours to the top if you&#039;re relatively fit, and I got up in time for the sunset which was magical. You have to (read: have to) take a Bedouin guide up the mountain. Mine was really nice and very liberal with time, bought snacks, and took all the photos I wanted. Guide costs 450 all in, which I was happy with because he was lovely.<br><br>Monastery is interesting enough and worthwhile for the icon gallery (museum) which has a cool collection of religious iconography and an old treaty signed by Muhammad promising to protect the monastery.<br><br>Blatant deception and assorted jewry from some of the local Bedouin population is a blemish on the trip, though. Camp/accommodation owners will essentially force you to take their ludicrously priced drivers from the camp to the monastery/mountain. 350 Egyptian for a 10 minute taxi, same on the way back. The owners of the place I stayed (450 Egyptian per night, Bedouin camp style place) had a massive shouting match with some woman who was staying there because she called them a mafia. Apparently she tried to take a local cab to the monastery and they found out and demanded she pay them as well as the local taxi, lmao. Standard tourist prices and disingenuous swindling behaviour apply throughout the town, expect things to be double the price of Cairo.

You can try Eger, a historical city with a huge fortress and other sites, many wineries with some good red wine. A bit more to the east, Tokaj is the center of our most famous wine region, there are vineyards with accomodation and good food. <br>In the middle of the Great Plain you have Hajd\u00faszoboszl\u00f3, a bath town cramped with wellness hotels. It\u2019s really only good for some sleazy weekends where you don\u2019t want to do anything else but bathing, massages and shitton of good buffet food. Rich Russians love it there.<br>There\u2019s also Debrecen, the second largest city, but I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019d do there as a tourist and I\u2019ve lived there half my life lmao. It\u2019s got awesome caf\u00e9s and restaurants, a few festivals and some historical sites. <br>Hungarian countryside has some real gems scattered around. It\u2019s the best if you get to know some Hungarians who can help you travel around because you can easily spend a week doing a roundtrip visiting some cool landscapes and eating top tier cuisine for pocket change, compared to other European countries.", "time": 1668892465, "resto": 2358294}, {"no": 2360622, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)16:44:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2358294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2358294</a><br>bear and closetcel stamp of approval", "time": 1668894260, "resto": 2358294}], "last_modified": 1668894260}]}]
