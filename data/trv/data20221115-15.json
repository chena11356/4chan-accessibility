The best thing I did and would recommend is a soviet history walking tour, I also met an American on the tour and went out drinking later on in the evening.

On the whole I found it by far the least clean and safe of the three capitals, unwelcoming and above all boring with a lack of anything really unique and interesting to see. The main pros are the market is cool to spend some time exploring and it is the most affordable. <br><br>Tallin - is by far the most interesting of the three. The old town is cool to walk around, public transport is very good, interesting museums and Everyone speaks English. It isn&#039;t as great as many expats would have you believe and it is no longer a budget destination either. People are in general, reserved, cold and not open to friendly interaction.

Mexico can be a safe country, but the further you try to stretch your money, the less safe it will be. The same isn&#039;t true of Thailand. How much of your money do you want to spend?<br>Also consider visas. Depending on your nationality, you can probably stay in Mexico for 180 days as a tourist. In Thailand, you will need to do at least one visa run if you use 60 day tourist visas plus 30 day extensions, or two visa runs if you use tourist-exempt entries plus 30 day extensions.<br>Also consider languages. If you speak Spanish, Mexico becomes cheaper and more navigable. (You can probably learn a lot of Spanish during your stay there too, if you have the time and drive to learn it.) You don&#039;t need to learn more than a few polite words in Thai regardless of where and how you would live there.<br>Personally I would choose Thailand because I&#039;ve had negative experiences in LatAm.

I think it all depends on your food and entertainment preferences, I really prefer Mexican cuisine its diversity and flavor profile but I prefer Thailand when it comes to nightlife and partying. <br><br>I&#039;m biased because of my job - both countries feel comparatively safe, I&#039;ve genuinely never been robbed or threatened in either country and I find that the CNN mentality of many Americans concerning safety in both countries is pretty laughable. I&#039;ve been hassled more in Miami and Chicago than I have walking around Mexico City, even though I am visibly white and not a local.

Also I noticed that money doesn&#039;t impress nearly the same in Mexico City - in a few neighborhoods, like Polanco and Santa Fe, the girls came from families with more money than I&#039;ll ever see in my life.

The $300 annual credit for a flight is insanely good but if I poormax and don&#039;t travel one year, that cash is wasted and the 5x for flights stays the same.

A significant factor in your credit score is number of applications for cards sent out and concurrent years as a member which means cancelling an account will impact your overall credit and can hurt you financially in the future when you cancel. The best thing to do is to downgrade a card of a specific company to save up on annual fees, so if you want to stop paying $695 on an amex platinum, you downgrade to their shittiest card and save about $600 a year. Outright cancellation will hurt if you don&#039;t keep at least something open with the CC company you signed up with and got the points from.<br><br>OP hasn&#039;t ever had a CC so he has no credit, no way he will be able to get a decent travel card like the Venture X, AMEX plat or Chase Sapphire.
