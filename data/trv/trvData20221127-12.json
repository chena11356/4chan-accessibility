This is why blackpill retards and fds women who think they are being eugenicists are retarded. Women have either been chosen by a village elder to pair off with someone in the tribe, arranged marriages in east, in Christiandom the fathers would choose the best mate for their daughters or approve, in war based societies the war chiefs would horde all the women in haram which would always collapse because they would overthrow him, and in Rome once women were given some \u201crights\u201d and cultural freedoms men just resorted to fucking prostitutes for the price of wine. <br><br>Women have never had any choice in their mating partners until the last 150 years or so after tradcucks and Victorian simps who thought were divine and equal to men did. You\u2019ll have the usual suspects call you an incel but humans are more akin to chimps. The only mammal species that gives women the \u201cchoice\u201d is bonobos and they live in very harm free environments that enable this akin to ours, and the men are all jerking each other off and are giant simps for the female bonobos and is matriacharcal society. Giving women rights and letting non property owners and non net tax payers voting rights was the biggest mistake the west could\u2019ve done and was done because they wanted a precipice for men to throw their lives away in the world wars. <br>Anyone who tells you that AI will solve this problem is a fucking idiot and is probably a fat dyke on crystal castle or something. Men are definitely way too cucked to do anything violent but there will be a slow collapse as people just don\u2019t have kids, men don\u2019t really uphold society, and we run out of money to fund all the adult day care jobs and huge tax programs for women.

I just got back from Kifisia which should have had amazing bike lanes. They were far better than all bike lanes I have encountered on the Eastern coast of the USA in that they were raised from the street level even more so than most sidewalks &amp; they had quite regular physical bollards that prevented cars from parking/driving through. The problem is that the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street was so bad -- so that left with no better choice pedestrians just took over the rather nice bike lanes. <br><br>Korinthos by where my uncle lives has some pretty nice bike lanes as well, regardless almost no one uses them. <br><br>Patras used to have a very nice bike rental network -- no one used them and I figure the whole system is useless or abandoned by now. <br><br>Another thing is that if bike lanes don&#039;t lead to anything, they are not useful. And there won&#039;t ever be enough demand to make the lanes more than something that will hardly even be used recreationally. Further Athens is just a lost cause, I think the civic mentality and infrastructure is so bad that the city is a write-off. I was impressed when I visited Thessaloniki by comparison, and especially Kalamata even though it was very small city showed that there are some Greeks somewhere that were able to keep nice things nice.<br><br>Outside of Thessaly, Greeks generally won&#039;t bike. Probably less Greeks bike than Americans, one of the least cycling nations. <br><br>I think it is because Greek youth especially and Greek people in general don&#039;t want to be seen bicycling, they likely see it as only something for the poor(like Americans and many other nations).

I&#039;m sorry you had to go through this shit, but it appears as if you made a couple of no-nos you should avoid doing in any third world country and this is why you didn&#039;t enjoy your experience quite as much. <br><br>The biggest issue with tourists is that they go on the usual spots who are chock full of grifters. Marrakech is a prime example of a city completely fucked by this, as well as other shitty spots like Sti Fadma. Even locals are subjected to these behaviors and it&#039;s fucking annoying. Your best way of doing stuff is to not answer or not even interact with those people. They take literally any kind of reaction as an invitation to try harder.<br>Also, general advice, maybe don&#039;t look like a a stereotypical american tourist like picrel in the muslim world in general. Americans have anglo-germanic traits that can easily be spotted, and the classic shirt + tshirt (or just shirt) set is a dead give away. if you really want to look fancy walking in a third world country, wear a polo shirt. Otherwise, just wear a plain t-shirt. This is what I do in every fucking country i visit, even first world ones.<br><br>Also, two other things : the Medina/Casbah of a given city isn&#039;t a place where you chill and drink coffee. They are on the same level as favelas in terms of poverty and education. Always stay in the beaten path and never leave it. If you&#039;re in a place where people are selling drugs to an American you&#039;re in the wrong fucking part of town.

Even now there are only one or two Asian related threads that made it even close to the front page, where as before they filled up the entire board. I assume this is because of the rules and regulations, and the local&#039;s insistence of wearing masks since the pandemic began that have shifted people&#039;s views of Asia and made them choose to travel elsewhere for holiday. As someone who enjoyed traveling to countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia quite a bit, this year I decided to try countries in Southeastern Europe like Croatia and Turkey and I found I liked them quite a bit, if not more, than the countries in Southeast Asia. Others that I know have discovered countries in Latin America that they will return to in the future over East Asia or Southeast Asia. How about you guys?

What&#039;s different now is I&#039;ve learned I don&#039;t like cities and its people very much, and want to stick to forests, mountains, trails, and small towns. I think my new form of travel is PCT-esque; I&#039;ll follow mountain ranges and trails and skip into town to resupply while occasionally making stops at interesting cities or landmarks by hitching rides or local transport.

It doesn&#039;t work at a supermarket when all you need is two jars of peanut butter. How do I get food that&#039;ll keep me going for 2-3 days while hiking without money or working, ideally?<br>3) Safe havens when sick or injured. Occasionally I&#039;ll get sick or injured while traveling and just need a place to stay to recover. Where do I go?<br>4) Making money while traveling.

St Catherine is in the middle of South Sinai, on Egypt&#039;s Sinai Peninsula. Busses leave once daily from Cairo&#039;s Torgamon bus station at 9:30am. My ticket was 175 Egyptian, ~9USD. Bus took exactly 7 hours, few stops along the way, more than half empty but I bought my ticket the day in advance to be safe.<br><br>The two main things to do in the town are climbing Mt Sinai (picrel) and visiting the monastery. Climbing the mountain was incredible and one of the best experiences I&#039;ve had over 40+ countries. Takes about 4 hours to the top if you&#039;re relatively fit, and I got up in time for the sunset which was magical. You have to (read: have to) take a Bedouin guide up the mountain. Mine was really nice and very liberal with time, bought snacks, and took all the photos I wanted. Guide costs 450 all in, which I was happy with because he was lovely.<br><br>Monastery is interesting enough and worthwhile for the icon gallery (museum) which has a cool collection of religious iconography and an old treaty signed by Muhammad promising to protect the monastery.<br><br>Blatant deception and assorted jewry from some of the local Bedouin population is a blemish on the trip, though. Camp/accommodation owners will essentially force you to take their ludicrously priced drivers from the camp to the monastery/mountain. 350 Egyptian for a 10 minute taxi, same on the way back. The owners of the place I stayed (450 Egyptian per night, Bedouin camp style place) had a massive shouting match with some woman who was staying there because she called them a mafia. Apparently she tried to take a local cab to the monastery and they found out and demanded she pay them as well as the local taxi, lmao. Standard tourist prices and disingenuous swindling behaviour apply throughout the town, expect things to be double the price of Cairo.

I think it all depends on your food and entertainment preferences, I really prefer Mexican cuisine its diversity and flavor profile but I prefer Thailand when it comes to nightlife and partying. <br><br>I&#039;m biased because of my job - both countries feel comparatively safe, I&#039;ve genuinely never been robbed or threatened in either country and I find that the CNN mentality of many Americans concerning safety in both countries is pretty laughable. I&#039;ve been hassled more in Miami and Chicago than I have walking around Mexico City, even though I am visibly white and not a local. Shootings aren&#039;t as often as people make it out to be and the only cities I&#039;ve ever heard gun shots were Denver and Johannesburg.<br><br>Latin women tend to be hotter, imo, but aren&#039;t nearly as easy as Thais, especially when it comes to the Mexicanas with more European ancestry. Also I noticed that money doesn&#039;t impress nearly the same in Mexico City - in a few neighborhoods, like Polanco and Santa Fe, the girls came from families with more money than I&#039;ll ever see in my life.
