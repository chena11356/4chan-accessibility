Usually I ask them to show me around the place I am visiting. In cities where transactional relationships are common, which is pretty much all of Latin America, you simply offer an &quot;arrangement&quot; (in Spanish arreglo or acuerdo) with the tacit agreement of intimacy for money to a girl you message online or meet IRL. There is some back and forth regarding final numbers but once the figures are mutual you just agree on a time and place. Its that simple. I typically aim for arrangements where I pay per date, which translates to a few hours some time in the afternoon or evening. Depending on what I want to do, I have had girls get drinks at my hotel then straight to my room while other girls I take to a legitimate dinner and a show then to my room. Other times I have taken girls on multi-day vacations. I suppose for me I can liken these arrangements as really good GFE, which is the pinnacle of cooming for me. Longevity is based on compatibility, some girls I have seen for over a year, others I could only tolerate for one night.

I recovered from COVID no problem. It was only when I took the J&amp;J that I started having problems. The minute I took the vaccine my heart started pounding rapidly. I told the people and they were worried for me. Told me to stay half an hour. I did pass out or anything so I just went home. For like 3 months I just had a rapid heart. Like the feeling of your heart when you stayed up 36 hours and you drink a can of monster to stay awake alittle longer. That is how my heart felt from awaking up until I went to sleep. Plus just constant fatigue. I couldn&#039;t walk for 5 minutes without feel like I ran for 40 mins. I use to like running. I stayed away from physical activity as much as I could. This heart thing was like the issue for a few months. After that for 1 month, I had what I think was brain fog. Like it was just terrible I couldn&#039;t think without it being a struggle to not have a weird feeling in my head. So for that month I stayed in bed and tried not to think. Like even watching TV was bothersome, but at the point the heart thing became less an issue and would only pump hard when walking 5 mins or more. After that, I started to recover. Slowly I was able to walk more and more, go further and further away from my house. Eventually I was able to attend Uni in person like normal. I missed come lectures since it was exhausting, but it was like I was getting my body back to be stronger to do normal things like walk for 15 mins than sit down for 2 hours.even that was something I couldn&#039;t do months earlier. At one point in the early months, I had a stiff neck, which I heard is another vaccine side effect. It felt like a tingle going down my spine in a line when I turned my head. But that went away doctor said it was a muscle issue not blood clots. Doctors checked me out and I guess I have no blood clots. He said my heart looked healthy.

But in another way it was like that feeling on impending doom. Like the fear of not knowing what&#039;s wrong with me. Like in a weird way it would be more comforting to know what exactly is the problem. Even if the problem is more serious it&#039;s better to know, than for it to not be serious but not know. At this point I&#039;ve recovered a lot. But I&#039;m not the same I was before. Like before I was fit, I would workout because I enjoyed working out and trying to be healthy. Like I wasn&#039;t born rich, but being born healthy was a consolation price. Now I don&#039;t even have that. I regret this, I didn&#039;t want to take it but I was pressured by a program in Uni. Honestly my injury is mostly why I&#039;m taking some time to bounce around SEA for a while. My thinking is if I could die in the next 5 years, then I want to get that experience I was planning on later in life. Even now as I type this I have a very faint weird feeling in my heart area. Like as if there is slight friction. This could be blood clots clogging my system, or a large heart rubbing up against my other organs for space. It isn&#039;t constant.

Looking at Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, all of these countries technically only allow 30 days upon entry. (I think Thailand is currently 45.) Thailand has free entry for most passports, Cambodia is $36, Vietnam is $25. Taking a bus between these countries is currently $25-35 one way.<br>In Thailand, you can extend your visa-free entry by another 30 days for $55 without leaving the country. In Cambodia you can extend another 30 days for about $35 without leaving the country. You can&#039;t currently extend in Vietnam. You can leave and re-enter Thailand twice by land borders every calendar year, unlimited times by air, but there&#039;s always the chance that Thai immigration will turn you back. One way to lessen this is to pay for a 60 day single entry visa (which can also be extended for 30 days without leaving the country) or a 180 day ME visa (which has more application requirements and a big cost). You can do visa runs with Cambodia and Vietnam indefinitely - they don&#039;t care.<br>So on the surface it will seem you can spend the most time in Thailand without doing expensive border runs, but Thailand is the country that&#039;s harder to live skint. Their whole economy is designed to suck money from farang, and even in remote areas you&#039;ll find yourself getting gouged and being resented if you barter too hard. There are places you can still do it (Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai are very budget and backpacker friendly, along with almost all the north). And if you get a Thai gf, which will be inevitable unless your tastes lean towards men or katoey, she will show you how to make your money go further.<br>Cambodia and Vietnam are easier to live on a budget, in my opinion, for various reasons. Don&#039;t expect as smooth an experience getting to different parts of them by local transport.

There is no conclusive research, but there is a strong correlation between older men who use sildenafil being twice as likely as men the same age to show some hearing loss. There&#039;s a theory that the same mechanism of sildenafil that makes blood flow easier could also affect the longevity of ear hair follicles that are used for hearing. Using a high dose of sildenafil daily would put a similar strain on your hearing as working in a loud environment. But this is just a theory because it doesn&#039;t seem to affect all men the same way.

The Chinese tourists went in and blocked everyone else from getting closer to the painting until the time was up. Not a big deal for me, but you can see how that can be a problem.

I wouldn&#039;t say either country has better food as I think they are both great but different.

The people are also INCREDIBLY focused on &quot;face&quot;. I hear this &quot;face&quot; meme a lot for China but Korea takes it to another level, hell it ain&#039;t even that bad in China. In Korea people will judge you for fucking everything.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about the trains </span><br>Both are excellent but different. The main difference between the two is that Seoul and most Korean cities seem like a tier 2 Chinese cities. You can&#039;t compare Seoul to Shanghai or Chengdu. Everything in Korea just seems so much smaller because it is. In China you can go to the desert, a rain forest, the grasslands, the beach. Etc. In Korea you essentially just have Jeju (which the locals won&#039;t shut up about because that&#039;s all they have. <br>If you have two weeks, go to Korea. If you have two months, go to China.

I&#039;m in Italy and all I can think about is how the Italian food in America is better), dating is easier (European women are strange, still figuring them out), alcohol is WAY better.

One thing I know is that I can&#039;t keep doing this moving around thing, I need a place to call home.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps individuals identify and change dysfunctional thinking patterns and behavior. Family therapy helps family members learn to better support the person with schizophrenia, build stronger relationships, and improve communication. Supportive psychotherapy helps people with schizophrenia cope with stress, identify and manage symptoms, and develop social skills.

It is best to start by trying to provide a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental environment for them, and to offer reassurance that their feelings are understandable and valid. Additionally, it is important to understand the individual&#039;s triggers and to be aware of any signs of distress, so that you can intervene before the situation escalates.

Before discussing commitment to an institution, it is important to try to explore other options and make sure that the individual is receiving the best possible treatment and support. This may include medication, therapy, and peer support groups. It is also important to ensure that the individual is safe and not a danger to themselves or others.

It is important to be respectful and understanding of your friend\u2019s struggles, while also providing them with guidance and support. A good starting point is to have an open and honest conversation with your friend and let them know that there may be better ways to use their time and energy.

It was insanely cold that week and I didn&#039;t want to risk getting stuck on the Italian side with my wife back in Zermatt. It was -17 C on the mountain all week. <br><br>Renting snowboarding gear outside of Zermatt and hauling it on the train would have been really inconvenient. We saw other people doing it and it looked terrible. Hauling that shit on the train would not have been worth the $100 we would have saved. The best thing about Zermatt is that you don&#039;t wait in line for snowboarding. We never waited for a single person to board a gondola or eat out anywhere. The photo looks crowded because that was where everyone stopped to take photos on the mountain. The run from the top was 14 miles. There were sections where I wouldn&#039;t see anyone else for 10 minutes. <br><br>The mountain infrastructure in Switzerland is incredible. Every peak has a giant gondola. Zermatt had a train and a gondola that takes you to the top. The train system wasn&#039;t as fast as Italy, but they were really nice and never very crowded. The train route from Geneva to Zermatt was amazing. The views are insane. <br><br><a href=\"#p2406435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2406435</a><br>Sure. You could save money and not eat out, or stay in a smaller place, but why go to Switzerland then? If you&#039;re in a budget, go to the Alps in France or Italy. We had a huge Airbnb in the middle of Zermatt that was the entire third floor of a building. It was $200 a night. not cheap, but way better than the tony hotel rooms in town that were same price or more. We did stay in a hotel for 2 nights in Geneva. Switzerland has the smallest hotel rooms I&#039;ve ever seen. I also think it&#039;s fair to mention that a fondue meal for 2 in Switzerland at a decent restaurant is going to run you $150. Or that bars charge $18+ for a mixed drink.

MNCs function in such a way that every national branch is its own company. They bill shit to each other, and either compete with, or work in fields that aren&#039;t quite the ones back home. <br><br>For example, a lot of MNCs will have folks working sales abroad to sell the products produced back home. And the people they will hire are obviously locals because they might be cheaper or just more at ease with communicating with the locals. Also, hiring an equivalent foreign worker is pound to pound as skilled as a local is considered bad practice and is starting to get heavily curbed in Asia.<br><br>Therefore, differentiation is key. Differentiation through diplomas (Prestigious ones), differentiation through specialization (PhDs in certain fields of expertise that are needed there, for example, or at least +5 year in a field but more is better).<br><br>If you&#039;re ballsy enough you can point out a certain need in a foreign branch, explain how to fill it so they can tailor a job offer for you there, too. <br>This being said, a lot of people manage to get to work abroad if they have +5 years exp in dev, sometimes less. Foreign internships, exchanges and double diplomas during your studies can help if you take the necessary steps professionally to make it work. <br><br>In a nutshell, anything that makes you a better person than a local works. And that also goes by evening the playing fields. Some countries have visa schemes that facilitate foreign hiring for skilled workers. Speaking the local language in a professional capacity also helps leveling the playing field and beating other foreign contenders. Again, you don&#039;t necessarily need to do all that to try your luck.

The real question is whether or not, ultimately, you&#039;d rather go abroad and settle for less (but definitely not less than the people working the same field there) or stay at home. <br>If you think TEFL is an easy solution, it&#039;s not, and will ultimately yield you the same problem. You will do overtime, unpaid meetings, and getting any form of raise beyond compensation for inflation will be way more difficult. Career-wise, if you ever want back in, you had better made it temporary before people do not find you worth hiring anymore. And also, teaching kids is EXHAUSTING.

Some things I&#039;ve done up there that I can recommend:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Visit the mountains. Doi Inthanon is the highest, but I can vouch for Doi Sa Ngo. I had a good picture of the sunrise I saw there but I can&#039;t find it now. Anyways, mountain camping is also pretty popular in Thailand nowadays, though it&#039;s more of a wintertime activity.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Ride an elephant or (more ethically) visit an elephant sactuary. I&#039;ve done both, these animals are truly beautiful and they&#039;re far more intelligent than the average Thai man/farang coomer.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Attend a Buddhist ceremony. Most monks will allow you inside their temples, and you can take pictures so long as you remain respectful. I personally would avoid any invitations to attend a sutra chanting though, they&#039;re very boring.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go shopping at a night market. Chiang Mai is locally famous for its night market, just like how Bangkok is famous for its floating markets. Most of the vendors sell foodstuffs but you can also buy some cool souvenirs without the ripoff prices you&#039;ll find in Bangkok. If you don&#039;t know what to eat, just follow the long lines and point at menus.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Hike with the hill tribes. The most famous is the Karen Long Neck. I did this when I was little so I don&#039;t remember much, but there&#039;s no better way to explore the Zomia. You can read about it if you want, it&#039;s &quot;a land without governance&quot;.

I&#039;ve attached the table of contents from Pok Pok by Andy Ricker, he goes over the best northern Thai dishes and you can use this to guide your culinary journey. Try to find pictures by googling if you can, if you can&#039;t I&#039;ll see what I can do. Also, if you&#039;re an adventurous eater, you can experience the pleasure and displeasure of trying the many unique proteins of the region (love me some snake, hate wasp larvae). Chiang Mai also has a booming coffee scene, some of the cafes are really stylish despite the north still being pretty rural.<br>Personally, whenever I visit Thailand (usually once yearly in the winter), I like to chill and do redneck things like fish in the rice paddies or go on motorbike/pickup truck joy rides.

There are definitely some things I would buy in Thailand to take back home, such as stuff that&#039;s just plain cheaper (Korean cosmetics, knockoff Chinese stuff that&#039;s 99% as good as the actual deal) and some unique things like retort curry pouches and special spices. Thai cooking is really spice-dependent, but that&#039;s the only real barrier.

You can anchor by a beach and save on docking. That said, from time to time you&#039;ll have to go to a marina to do some maintenance.<br>You learn to sail in easy conditions in 1-3 months, 6 months you learn a good deal of sailing and I think one year is enough to travel long distance (ocean crossing), although it would be better to have a more knowledgeable person as captain.

Also, if you plan to visit cities you will have to dock at marinas (so the price goes up).<br>Also keep in mind that boats are really small. In bad weather you would have to face the elements or stay confined in the small salon.

I got to the border and learnt that I needed a green piece of paper from the ministry of interior authorising me to leave Kuwait to Iraq via land, and that I could only get it from the office back in the city. This wasted an entire day, as the office was closed by the time I got back to the city. I got it the next morning from the interior office next to the airport - it only took 5 minutes and didn&#039;t cost anything. Back at the border, crossing is fairly straight forward. The Iraqi side is underdeveloped and pretty dusty. Visa on arrival for all the good western passports is available at all ports of entry and cost me $77USD, and was issued surprisingly quickly. From the border town of Safwan, you&#039;ll probably take a cab to Basra. I went straight to Baghdad from the Basra taxi station, about a 6 hour drive. I imagine flying into Baghdad is far more straightforward.<br><br>Baghdad - a surprisingly nice city compared to what you may think. Much nicer than Cairo, I thought, and enough to keep you busy for up to a week, although 4 days would be fine. My favourite thing to do was strolling through Mutannabi street and the adjacent areas where the local craftsmen, book sellers, and antique dealers are. The mosques around this area are stunning and will give you a good sense of the distinct architectural style of Baghdad, i.e. intricate brickwork and blue and yellow domes. If you like modern stuff like malls, chic cafes etc then Mansour area is very nice. Museums, monuments, mosques (go to kadhimiya) and food are plentiful and will keep you busy.", "filename": "Flag-Iraq (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 534, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1675694140834443, "time": 1675694140, "md5": "NMta2PtubYbxNxkFYXs2JA==", "fsize": 17658, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "iraq-trip-report-decjan-2223", "replies": 38, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 25}, {"no": 2402972, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)09:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2402967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2402967</a><br>Liquor shops are present and openly advertised. Women dress anywhere from jeans and tees to the full burqa. Careem works everywhere in Baghdad and is very convenient, as navigating the local minivans would be practically impossible without being a local. Traffic is standard developing-world-tier, frustrating but inevitable. Airbnbs are basically non-existent everywhere in Iraq and so I ended up staying in budget hotels. In Baghdad, the cheap ones (~25USD per night) can be found in the bataween area. Quality tends to be pretty shit, but if you just want a bed, it&#039;s fine. I stayed in Hotel Diwan. Baghdad feels safe enough and not tense, but keep your head on a swivel anyway. Standard precautions, don&#039;t walk late at night, dress conspicuously, speak a bit of arabic.<br><br>Karbala and Najaf - the two holjest Shia sites in Iraq, along with kadhimiya in Baghdad and Askari in Samarra. Both fairly well developed (relative to the region) due to the number of pilgrims. Go to either one first depending on your itinerary, and get there from the Al alawi south garage in Baghdad. You can take a bus or shared taxi, and the same for the next city. Hotel situation is much the same as above. 1-2 full days in each is appropriate, because all there really is to see are the shrines. Great places to learn about shia Islam and meet people from all over the world. People tend to be friendly here and strike up conversation, ask where you&#039;re from etc. No issue saying that you&#039;re not Muslim, just follow the customs that will be very evident and displayed on the entrances to the shrines. Shrines are open 24/7 and you can even sleep in them if you&#039;re so inclined.", "time": 1675694490, "resto": 2402967}, {"no": 2402979, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)09:52:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2402967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2402967</a><br>People tend to be quite fair in Iraq and I didn&#039;t really experience anyone trying to charge me the standard yt prices, though this could be because lots of people assumed I&#039;m Lebanese or because I can speak enough rubbish arabic to make any given vendor smile. The average Iraqi is very happy to welcome guests, though, and I had people offer to pay for my meals on several occasions when they learnt I was foreign. <br><br>Babylon - a day trip from karbala. Most disappointing thing I visited in Iraq desu. Site was all but abandoned apart from one guard sitting on a plastic chair, and the entrance fee for foreigners is 25k dinars (~18USD), which is absurd for Iraq. Just a bunch of brick walls with no explanatory signage or context. Might as well have been waking in any given field. The blue gate is cool I suppose but isn&#039;t the original one, that&#039;s in Berlin. Worth going, though, to visit Saddam&#039;s palace that&#039;s on the hill overlooking the city.<br><br>Samarra - 2 hour shared taxi from Baghdad, Al alawi north garage. Samarra isn&#039;t controlled by the fed gov and is instead run by a Shia militia called the peace companies. You&#039;ll get stopped at the checkpoint before the entrance to the city and made to hand over your passport to them. Your shared taxi, presumably filled with locals, will be told to continue and you&#039;ll be kept at the checkpoint where they&#039;ll call some local driver and assign him to you for the day. Westerners aren&#039;t allowed to stay overnight in Samarra, and apparently the security situation is still quite tenuous there. It&#039;s a shithole anyway, the only two things to see are malwiya mosque, the big spiral minaret, and Askari shrine. Your assigned driver probably knows you&#039;re there to see them anyway and will take you there and back to the checkpoint where you&#039;ll collect your passport. Malwiya is cool, but again is 25k for yt. Askari is free, and worth seeing.", "time": 1675695120, "resto": 2402967}, {"no": 2402985, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)10:05:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2402967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2402967</a><br>Mosul - one of the most surreal places I&#039;ve ever seen. 5hr shared taxi from Baghdad north, again, or you could continue on from samarra I guess. There isn&#039;t a whole lot going on in mosul in the normal sense, but walking around the rubble of the old city is unreal, as is meeting locals and hearing their stories about life under Isis. See if you can co-ordinate permissions with UNESCO to visit Al Nuri mosque which is being reconstructed, as well as the church of the lady of the hour. I asked around at some of the other destroyed churches, and the construction guys were nice enough to let me in and wonder around. I stayed in hotel Al safer on the west side, which was very basic (squat toilet) but fine for 25k per night. The city feels quite sad, but the security presence is heavy and it&#039;s safe. Locals are happy to meet visitors and I got invited to the house of a guy who I met wondering around the destroyed areas. He told me stories of his relatives being killed by Isis and how his house was blown up. Definitely worth going, if you&#039;re interested in the recent history of Iraq.<br><br>Kurdistan - I was sick for most of the time I was here, unfortunately, but a bit of info. Your federal Iraq visa works to enter here, but not vice versa. Erbil is just ok. Very relaxed, safe, and relatively liberal. The citadel and surrounding bazaar is nice, but there&#039;s really not much else to do in the city. Duhok is much nicer, I thought, and allows for interesting day trips. I went to Lalish, the yazidi holy city, and it was fascinating. You can&#039;t wear shoes in the whole village, and the architecture is very distinct. They have these conical spires which supposedly absorb the sun, and the whole area is very pretty and mountainous.

I had mixed success with my card working at these places, though.<br><br>Food - typical arab fare, which is to say pretty good. Meat, bread, pickles, hummus, falafel etc. Iraqi shish kebabs are the best I&#039;ve had anywhere in the world. Shawarma places and other local fast food is ubiquitous on every corner. Try the classic Iraqi roast fish called masgoof. There are also street carts selling boiled chickpeas called &#039;leblebi&#039; and boiled beets which are a great snack.

Had to bribe my way into the stadium even though I had a ticket. People hanging off the railing and stuff, three to a seat, had a guy literally sitting on my shoulders with his legs dangling. Probably 110k in a 65k capacity stadium. Clearly uncomfortable, but a mental experience that you couldn&#039;t really get in many other places, and Iraq ended up winning in an insanely dramatic match, so it was worth it.

I\u2019m heading to Iraq myself next month (mostly the southern parts because I\u2019m big into archaeology). Do you know how easy it is getting into some not too popular ancient ruins? By taxi or chatting up with some local in Baghdad to take me over if I hand him enough USD. <br><br>My main question is the following: how \u201csecure\u201d is Baghdad airport in terms of customs. I managed to smuggle a few shards of pottery and other items I excavated from Lebanon not too long ago and had no issues.

If you\u2019re not concerned about potential abuse and addiction, you might also talk to a doctor about a small quantity of an anxiolytic like Xanax or Ativan, but any drug in the barbiturate or benzodiazepine families is more serious business than people like to think, and shouldn\u2019t be used too casually. They\u2019re all physically habit-forming with nasty withdrawal symptoms, and some people get unpleasant benzo hangovers that can leave you groggy and stupid for an extended period.

Don&#039;t get me wrong there will be dodgy people who will take you without it but not really worth the risk imo, sure you could snorkel the surface but kinda boring.<br>I&#039;ve not been to Bonaire but I did Honduras, pretty cool and they have awesome whale sharks but it&#039;s a bit trickier to get there and all in all unless you&#039;re just in the area it&#039;s a faff.

How long are you in Ireland for?<br>You could take the train to Galway or Killarney and use either of those as a base for exploring the west coast. Killarney is more touristy but the scenery is a bit better. But Galway has better cultural stuff and I prefer it. You could go from Galway through Connemara and up through Mayo, to Donegal to see real untouched, untouristy Ireland with great scenery. Slieve League cliffs in Donegal are way higher than the overrated cliffs of Moher. There&#039;s a great deal of good hiking out in Donegal and Connemara as well as a lot of Irish speakers and traditional music.<br>From Killarney, I&#039;d reccomend the Dingle Peninsula. Don&#039;t drive the Conor pass until you get comfortable driving on the other side of the road on very narrow winding mountain passes. Do the Dingle archaeology tour and visit the Blasket Islands visitor centre. <br>From Galway, I&#039;d recommend visiting Connemara and especially the Aran Islands (either Inis Mor or Inis Oirr; stay overnight on one of them to get a feel of the place.). <br>From Dublin you can take a lot of different day trips by bus to places around the country although I don&#039;t reccomend just staying in Dublin. A good little bus trip from Dublin goes to the Glendalough ruins in the Wicklow mountains just south of Dublin, as well as the town of Kilkenny. Another one I highly recommend is the Newgrange tour by Mary Gibbons. <br>Dublin city itself does not need more than two or so days. Book of Kells is overrated and you just get to see one page of it after standing in line for hours. Temple Bar sucks and is expensive. The Molly Malone statue is just a statue.

Looking to save up some more and organize a trip to the island regions (San Andres, Malpelo, Gorgona) and the remote ass pacific jungle villages in Choc\u00f3 that can only be accessed by air or boat.<br>After that I may do a trip to central america/the caribbean, then it&#039;s saving up for a trip to Asia (Japan/Korea/Singapore, maybe Philippines as well as my passport has visa-free access)", "filename": "IMG_20230114_163455_1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 2268, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675404481239589, "time": 1675404481, "md5": "GpeFitfdRF855OOI9aKI/A==", "fsize": 3318009, "resto": 2400877}, {"no": 2400999, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:56:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2400885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2400885</a><br>Cool bro I will go to medellin in March, I am from Dominican Republic so ya se espa\u00f1ol.

Even around El Poblado I found plenty of unsavory characters and I honestly felt like I could be robbed at any moment.<br>The highlights of the trip to Medellin were the times I wasn&#039;t in Medellin itself. Guatape, Jardin, Santa Fe de Antioquia were so much better. Mind you, I&#039;m not really a party person, so my opinion doesn&#039;t account for that kind of stuff.<br>Medellin does have a bunch of cool viewpoints as it&#039;s in a valley surrounded by mountains, I would recommend trying going up Cerro Pan de Azucar - easy to get to via metrocable, some 45 minutes of walking and you&#039;re on top, the walk didn&#039;t feel unsafe either and there were plenty of people chilling on top (pic related).
