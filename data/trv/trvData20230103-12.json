I didn&#039;t have anything going on so I went to visit him for like 3-4 weeks. When I got to apartment that had like 250 residents, maybe 10-20 of those were foreigners there for internships.

Here&#039;s the kicker though. The Chinese locals in the apartment loved us and didn&#039;t like the foreigners. They all hung out in their group while we would hang out with locals. That group closed themselves off to both foreigners and natives.<br><br>If you feel like you don&#039;t fit in with a group in your school, dont force it.

I can&#039;t tell you the best route, but I can tell you what I did.<br><br>To teach in Japan without a master&#039;s degree, you generally have two options: teaching at an eikaiwa school or teaching as an ALT in public schools. You aren&#039;t likely to find a lot of eikaiwa in the countryside, so an ALT position would be the better bet for you. For that, you need to look for dispatch employers. There are a few companies out there that hire ALTs, but many of them require you to be in the country already. I initially applied to Interac, a dispatch company that hires from abroad and provides work visas. I told them the general geographic region I preferred, and that I wanted to live in a smaller town, and they obliged.<br><br>The issue that you&#039;ll likely face is that you&#039;re looking to relocate together, and as you might imagine, it&#039;s much harder to find small towns that want to hire two ALTs. That&#039;s not to say they don&#039;t exist at all, and there are some ways to get around that. For example, you might be assigned to neighboring towns (not so likely), or you might be assigned to a larger city nearby to which you can commute while living in a small town nearby. If one of you gets a job, the other one can apply for a spousal visa, but I don&#039;t know what the timeframe would look like on that, and it&#039;s possible that a spousal visa request could be denied, as ALT contracts usually only last for one year at a time (but are renewable).<br><br>Oh, one other thing to keep in mind is that in my experience, the dispatch company is more likely to honor your request of a rural town if you can speak Japanese somewhat well. Think about it from their perspective: if you can&#039;t speak Japanese, you could still get by without much support from the company in a big city, but in a small town, it&#039;s more likely you&#039;ll be requesting their aid for small things like getting mail redelivered.", "time": 1672705839, "resto": 2381414}, {"no": 2383002, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:52:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2382990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2382990</a><br>Different guy but I have a master&#039;s degree in international studies in the US and I can&#039;t find a suitable job I want.

Over half of the parks are 1 day visitors from off property.

For example, Steel Vengeance has a mining back story in the queue and its overall look fits the nearby themed frontier town. I think this works a lot better than a parking lot coaster.

Why don&#039;t tourists return to Vietnam?</span><br>1. Most people who would do return trips after crossing off all the major sights from their list are either sex pests or resort tourists. Vietnam is garbage for both. The cooming offer is nowhere close to its neighbors and the beaches are frankly shit. While they can seem nice at a first glance, Vietnam is drowning in trash and has zero water pollution standards. You&#039;ll be frolicking in the waves and suddenly there&#039;s literal shit all around you.<br>2. People are often plain rude. There&#039;s little in the way of etiquette and the concept of disturbing others (which is generally a problem with SEA, but not to that level) does not exist in Vietnam at all. They&#039;ll spit, cut the line and play shitty Tik-Tok vids on full volume at 3AM on a night bus if they feel like it. Everyone working in the tourist industry has nothing but utmost contempt for tourists and will make sure you know that.<br>3. Scams. 80% of all Vietnamese you&#039;ll interact with will lie through their teeth in an attempt to extract money from you. If you don&#039;t play along, they&#039;ll get loud, insistent and aggressive. You can easily get ripped off in Thailand, which has ten times the return rate, but they usually do it with a smile and try to make sure you won&#039;t notice. Vietnam is on the level of people blatantly telling you to fuck off and demanding double while you point at the price list right behind them.<br>Don&#039;t take me wrong, Vietnam&#039;s my favorite place in SEA, but it is, without any doubt, a rude shithole that is the very opposite of comfy and that relaxed holiday feeling is what people are usually looking for.", "time": 1672245155, "resto": 2378355}, {"no": 2380118, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:03:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2379723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2379723</a><br>This is an absolute lie.

Probably a meme story on /trv. I went through a long list of terrible life events, both by my own fault and out of my control. Hated my job and considered quitting but I was terminated before I had the chance. I had severance pay and nothing else going for me. My apartment lease was up and I moved my stuff to storage, decided to go to Japan for a few months and maybe end it afterwards or along the way. Once in Japan, I spent a week or two adjusting, and I realized that having daily challenges in life made existential problems go on the back burner.<br>Met a girl on Tinder while it still was a &quot;friend finder&quot; in Asia. Used her as a tour guide and went to a love hotel a few times. It was casual and I met another girl, who was clingy and (I soon discovered) crazy. Met another. Made friends with Japanese guys and girls (and some expats) and developed a social circle - which didn&#039;t last longer than my trip, but amazed me by how easy it was when I wasn&#039;t wrapped up in my own head. <br>Decided that life really wasn&#039;t so bad, at least as long as it stayed interesting. And decided not to kill myself and instead looked for ways to earn a living remotely. Applied for jobs until I got one.<br>In my opinion, the destination I chose was irrelevant. I&#039;d often thought to myself &quot;before I kill myself, I&#039;ll go to X country/location&quot;. They&#039;ve varied over the years: California, Africa, India, Japan. When it was time, my destination was Japan.

Does that mean I&#039;m a faggot ? Sure. I don&#039;t cope by pretending i&#039;m not.<br>2) while ladyboys are &quot;men&quot; and were real men at some point in their lives, in a lot of ways they also have some of that understanding of how men think and know how to play along. And so will you have this intuitive understanding about them that would make a conversation go smoother.<br>3) the flirting experience with ladyboys is far nicer because men in general are way more lucid about what a &quot;date&quot; entails. When you&#039;re dating a fucking trans/ladyboy they know you like them and you know they like you (otherwise the date wouldn&#039;t even happen). ladyboys, like men, date someone they want to fuck and having a relationship is a wanted bonus. Women do this thing where they either do it FOR a relationship or they reserve themselves for someone extremely attractive. <br>4) it&#039;s just nicer to talk to ladyboys because they judge you less. They&#039;re fucking trannies and they&#039;ve been through the worst shit in terms of social anxiety. They know how it feels to be ridiculed. They also learned to shrug a lot of it off. So unless you&#039;re acting with malicious intent, there&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br><br>The only big con is that trans people in general have a lot of shit going on emotionally, they&#039;ve probably been prostituted, asian ladyboys are probably drug addicts, a lot of trans people suffer from depression due to the constant internalized shame of being judged because you act like a woman and take it up the ass. <br>If there somehow was a machine that would magically turn a trans person into a real woman and all trans people went through it, i&#039;d only date them as they would finally become complete and have all the pros without the cons.The ancient greek dream come true.", "time": 1672304093, "resto": 2378057}, {"no": 2380464, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2380395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2380395</a><br>You should actually try to date a ladyboy.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story. Maybe look at the job situation so you can make it there.

You have to do Rome due to the amount of historical things to look at, but avoid nogs at all costs in that city and limit your time in the train station\u2026just get in and get out. Rome is chaotic and very much a big city and tourist trap. Florence is going to be much better, much more laid back, with friendlier people. Pisa is a university town. Some of the smaller cities in the north are surprisingly pleasant. Genoa, Turin, etc. Bologna has been gentrified a lot. You can even walk Bolognina after dark these days even if the streets are surprisingly empty by 9 pm for an Italian city. The further south you go the more dysfunctional it gets but not in a dangerous way. That\u2019s just northern stereotypes about the subhuman terrone (mostly true, but they are just dumb and lazy, not dangerous). Hotels will suck by American standards, even compared to a Holiday Inn express, so unless you want to know how to say Norman Bates in Italian it\u2019s worth the money to go up a star or two.

Open brothel district where you can see all the girls sitting at the front of their shops, and you pick one and go. There&#039;s very little Japanese needed, even though it helps during sex, and they are very open to foreigners. Matsushima Shinchi, also in Osaka, is the same, but there are fewer shops, and the quality of the girls isn&#039;t at the same level. Tobita&#039;s level of girls is super high; some are idol- and model-tier and would be the kind of girls you see at luxury/high-end soaplands. Tobita is by far my favorite if you&#039;re mainly concerned about looks and want to get the prettiest and cutest girl possible without risking getting baited by photoshopped/old pics (soaplands are notorious for this). Service can feel a little distant because they&#039;re so pretty and in high demand, but some of the best fucks I&#039;ve had were a matter of finding the right girl. And going at nighttime with all the lights and just seeing a huge variety of girls (little loli type, slutty gyaru, shrine maiden outfits, nurses, kimonos) is intoxicating.<br><br>Soaplands are better if you want to have more time and a less rushed experience, but the quality of girls can vary a lot, and you have to pay top dollar to fuck the prettiest ones. A bit more Japanese is necessary to enter and to schedule things, but it can be done. Yoshiwara in Tokyo is probably your best bet as a foreigner, and that place is kind of well-known for having girls that do NS (No Skin) and NN (Nakadashi), so raw sex is possible, although that might not be an option for you if they&#039;re wary about you because you&#039;re a foreigner.<br><br>Delivery/Hotel Health where girls are delivered to your selected love hotel is good and can be priced fairly, but you&#039;re paying for the love hotel. Lots of JAV girls also work for these shops. Intercourse is not necessarily guaranteed with these, and your mileage may vary for the shop and girls. Much more Japanese needed to schedule and arrange everything.", "time": 1669251232, "resto": 2355325}, {"no": 2362272, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)20:07:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2362269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2362269</a><br>For real?

Plus cheaper cost of living. Once I got my hours up to around 20-25 I was making more than Korea.

For the majority of people, working in either country is basically volunteering and earning enough to cover your expenses and live okay by local standards - i.e. not enough for your flights. There are decent jobs but you will need a degree for them. When I worked in Cambodia, I was at a university in the countryside and got just over $1000/month. It was a cushy gig but there are maybe 20 jobs like that in the entire country. The majority of English teachers are backpackers or retirees who wound up in the country and earn $500/month.

These need you to be physically there and meet up with people. Get some business cards and start exchanging them with people, maybe a CV. You can also just talk to the people you can meet during these social events and see how things go. Fields can range from anywhere from High tech to industrial to even fucking wine imports. Just look. For example, Shenzhen&#039;s Hi Tech fair happened this november. open a calendar, start piling all the events you can look for, so you can plan for when to come to East Asia.<br>3) Once you know all these people and actually act interested and follow up with their stuff, opportunities will arise, and you&#039;ll have enough knowledge on these matters to actually act accordingly.

So say you book the Marriott in dallas, for $300 a night on Expedia, Marriott will pay Expedia 10% of that as a commission - they then sometimes pay that forward to customers which is why hotels.com give you &quot;free nights&quot; .... They&#039;re not free they&#039;re just sharing the commission. There&#039;s also &quot;overrides&quot; whereby if a company books a certain amount of room nights in a year they get an extra amount .. something like Marriott will give them an extra $3 per room night booked if they book 10,000 + , an extra $2 for 100,000+ etc<br><br>Anyway this leads onto your shitty little $20 a night room in butt fuck nowhere Vietnam. There is no contract for this, these shitty independent hotels have no agreement with any of these onlines so rather than getting kickbacks, the online sites actually charge these independent hotels to list on their site, it&#039;s a flat rate of say $100 a month to be on there and then the site will add on an arbitrary amount to the hotel cost, so a $20 a night hotel is actually bookable for $30 as booking.com will take $10 as commission so it&#039;s always worth booking these direct.<br><br>tl;dr<br>If you&#039;re booking a shit hotel online you&#039;re always going to pay more than direct.<br>Also the VPN/ deleting cookies thing is a retarded meme.

It&#039;s easy to meet some eager people in the queue, and it&#039;s likely you&#039;ll meet some fellow filipinos so just be blunt about it and they&#039;ll befriend you quickly. Clubs are ridiculous in the sense that you can go in and go out and there&#039;s a 7/11 nearby so you can get absolutely shitfaced at the fraction of the price while still enjoying the nightclub also, a lot of them have a queue where you can basically get a free drink if you wait for like, 5 minutes. Great way to socialize btw. Make sure you bring some ID however.<br>There are other clubs but unless they come heavily suggested, i&#039;d say stick with 101. And don&#039;t go to Triangle no matter how much it&#039;s recommended. It is one of the seediest clubs in the city and it hides behind this fact by getting students to come in. But now there are no students so it&#039;s just seedy. <br><br>Speaking of which, south of gongguan, if you follow siyuan road all the way to the bridge, there are a lot of small bars in front of the riverside, all covered by a bridge when it rains.

In terms of exploring, i suggest you walk around zhongxiao dunhua for a classier feel, guang hua digital plaza has all these cool electronics, going to Da&#039;an park is a nice change of pace, Elephant Mountain is definitely worth doing at dusk so you can enjoy the glorious view.

Where one end of the street would have commie squatters partying throughout the week and the other side, groups of riot police ready to go with submachine guns in hand and full combat gear at all hours of the day and night.

I walked back to my hotel on the other side of the city with no phone one night, exploring old winding streets and passages in the warm Greek summer night breeze, passing by groups of rabid looking homeless schizos, old bookshops still open, a group of dancing women and a man getting violently beaten by Greek police dressed head to toe in black combat gear. My hotel was at the top of a hill, I looked back and saw the Acropolis lit up, shining in the night so beautifully against the backdrop of the city. Out of all of the worlds monuments I\u2019ve seen, the Acropolis at night is easily one of the most beautiful. <br><br>The next day I took a bus to the beach, and felt like I was transported to a completely different place altogether.

We only had vaginal sex and I know it mainly spreads through butt stuff, which was a load off my conscience. And I was living remote paycheck to paycheck, my hostel stay was about to expire, and I had to find somewhere else to live fast. Couldn&#039;t let go of 400 dollarydoos on the off chance she had HIV and proceeded to actually transmit it to me after three rounds of PIV. I ended up flying to Venice with that money. <br><br>I did learn that the chance of contracting HIV through vaginal sex isn&#039;t as low as you&#039;d think if the infected partner got it within six months, or one of you has a case of herpes. You may or may not even know you have herpes since many cases are asymptomatic, and it doesn&#039;t matter if you don&#039;t have lesions as apparently the thing that makes a difference is the increased activity of your immune system in that area, not so much the actual rupture in your skin. So I&#039;ll definitely be more careful in future. <br><br>It was rough for awhile because I started to get diarrhea like two weeks out, and I was always tired. But I realized this probably had more to do with the fact that I was getting drunk every night, lmao. Of course, I looked up symptoms of HIV and started getting shooting pains in my fingers and toes right after thanks to the placebo effect. <br><br><a href=\"#p2378993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2378993</a><br>Ultimately, you travel for pleasure, and worrying about money if something happens is a great way to ruin that.

You have a better chance getting a Japanese wife than a Brazilian with Japanese grandparents born and raised in Brazil with similar Japanese skills as you. You both are foreigners but he is a foreigner with an appearance that is common in Japan. In a vacuum on looks alone there is no reason for a Japanese to want someone who looks exactly like them but doesn&#039;t share the culture and language. Much better taking another born and raised Japanese person. Whites and blacks brings something different on the table so the ones not too afraid of speaking English would be more open about knowing them. Of course after that it is on the individuals to match and make things work. tl;dr Japanese people into foreigners will look for non-Asian foreigners, Japanese people not into foreigners will look for other Japanese people. Asian foreigners are in the place where they don&#039;t get the advantages of being different but also not the advantages of being a local unless they put a lot of effort in knowing Japanese language and customs like a local or actually grew up there.
