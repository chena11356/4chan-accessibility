Vietnam is garbage for both. The cooming offer is nowhere close to its neighbors and the beaches are frankly shit. While they can seem nice at a first glance, Vietnam is drowning in trash and has zero water pollution standards. You&#039;ll be frolicking in the waves and suddenly there&#039;s literal shit all around you.<br>2. People are often plain rude. There&#039;s little in the way of etiquette and the concept of disturbing others (which is generally a problem with SEA, but not to that level) does not exist in Vietnam at all. They&#039;ll spit, cut the line and play shitty Tik-Tok vids on full volume at 3AM on a night bus if they feel like it. Everyone working in the tourist industry has nothing but utmost contempt for tourists and will make sure you know that.<br>3. Scams. 80% of all Vietnamese you&#039;ll interact with will lie through their teeth in an attempt to extract money from you. If you don&#039;t play along, they&#039;ll get loud, insistent and aggressive. You can easily get ripped off in Thailand, which has ten times the return rate, but they usually do it with a smile and try to make sure you won&#039;t notice. Vietnam is on the level of people blatantly telling you to fuck off and demanding double while you point at the price list right behind them.<br>Don&#039;t take me wrong, Vietnam&#039;s my favorite place in SEA, but it is, without any doubt, a rude shithole that is the very opposite of comfy and that relaxed holiday feeling is what people are usually looking for.", "time": 1672245155, "resto": 2378355}, {"no": 2380118, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:03:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2379723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2379723</a><br>This is an absolute lie.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story.

Does that mean I&#039;m a faggot ? Sure. I don&#039;t cope by pretending i&#039;m not.<br>2) while ladyboys are &quot;men&quot; and were real men at some point in their lives, in a lot of ways they also have some of that understanding of how men think and know how to play along. And so will you have this intuitive understanding about them that would make a conversation go smoother.<br>3) the flirting experience with ladyboys is far nicer because men in general are way more lucid about what a &quot;date&quot; entails. When you&#039;re dating a fucking trans/ladyboy they know you like them and you know they like you (otherwise the date wouldn&#039;t even happen). ladyboys, like men, date someone they want to fuck and having a relationship is a wanted bonus. Women do this thing where they either do it FOR a relationship or they reserve themselves for someone extremely attractive. <br>4) it&#039;s just nicer to talk to ladyboys because they judge you less. They&#039;re fucking trannies and they&#039;ve been through the worst shit in terms of social anxiety. They know how it feels to be ridiculed. They also learned to shrug a lot of it off. So unless you&#039;re acting with malicious intent, there&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br><br>The only big con is that trans people in general have a lot of shit going on emotionally, they&#039;ve probably been prostituted, asian ladyboys are probably drug addicts, a lot of trans people suffer from depression due to the constant internalized shame of being judged because you act like a woman and take it up the ass. <br>If there somehow was a machine that would magically turn a trans person into a real woman and all trans people went through it, i&#039;d only date them as they would finally become complete and have all the pros without the cons.The ancient greek dream come true.", "time": 1672304093, "resto": 2378057}, {"no": 2380464, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2380395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2380395</a><br>You should actually try to date a ladyboy.

I highly highly recommend the Valles Caldera, you can drive in from Los Alamos and soak it in. Stop in Jemez Springs on your way down, you can check out the historic sight or just hangout at the biker bar. From their you can either go to Albuquerque or up 550 towards Farmington. If you\u2019re headed that way go to chaco canyon. It\u2019s a heavy place but one of the most interesting sights in all of north america.

I took a few trips but honestly found the country to be pretty boring and uninteresting, and I didn&#039;t really have time to travel anyways. So I just decided to save money and spend it elsewhere. My only real expense was groceries and the occasional night out, so it was easy to save ~$1800 a month. I just sent my whole salary home every month and barely touched it.<br><br>After that I went to work in Vietnam. Got a job teaching at a good language center since I had IELTS experience from my certification. Initially took a pay hit, but the hourly rate was way higher and I didn&#039;t have to work as much. Plus cheaper cost of living. Once I got my hours up to around 20-25 I was making more than Korea. And since your employer doesn&#039;t own your visa like in Korea you can hustle if you want for extra cash. Saved about $1500 a month maybe since I traveled a lot more and had to pay rent. <br><br>Now I work at a private school in Thailand making about the same as Vietnam, but with more work since I&#039;m salaried and have to be at school all day.

It would be better to do the course and find out that TEFL is not for you, than to fly to another country to work and discover it there.<br><br>Of course, you should keep in mind that you can always quit a job. In the worst case scenario where you are miserable/depressed in a foreign country, you can just head to the airport and get on the first flight home.

But there are many examples of such teachers being employed elsewhere in Asia, though they are litteral wageslaves without any legal rights.

For the majority of people, working in either country is basically volunteering and earning enough to cover your expenses and live okay by local standards - i.e. not enough for your flights. There are decent jobs but you will need a degree for them. When I worked in Cambodia, I was at a university in the countryside and got just over $1000/month. It was a cushy gig but there are maybe 20 jobs like that in the entire country. The majority of English teachers are backpackers or retirees who wound up in the country and earn $500/month. To get those jobs you just need to be in the country.<br>It&#039;s similar in Laos - there&#039;s a handful of good jobs in Vientiane, but they aren&#039;t hiring people without degrees and experience. A big difference from Cambodia is the government doesn&#039;t make it easy for backpackers to get hired. Most English teachers in Laos are more likely to be with volunteer agencies and NGOs than anything else.<br>Having said all of that, you could lie about your degrees and experience, but you&#039;d have to be pretty convincing to get through the interviews.

You have to do Rome due to the amount of historical things to look at, but avoid nogs at all costs in that city and limit your time in the train station\u2026just get in and get out. Rome is chaotic and very much a big city and tourist trap. Florence is going to be much better, much more laid back, with friendlier people. Pisa is a university town. Some of the smaller cities in the north are surprisingly pleasant. Genoa, Turin, etc. Bologna has been gentrified a lot. You can even walk Bolognina after dark these days even if the streets are surprisingly empty by 9 pm for an Italian city. The further south you go the more dysfunctional it gets but not in a dangerous way. That\u2019s just northern stereotypes about the subhuman terrone (mostly true, but they are just dumb and lazy, not dangerous). Hotels will suck by American standards, even compared to a Holiday Inn express, so unless you want to know how to say Norman Bates in Italian it\u2019s worth the money to go up a star or two. Inflation has hit hard and things are expensive there now. Be prepared for that. You get a mixture of competent and lazy as shit with Italians.

Matsushima Shinchi, also in Osaka, is the same, but there are fewer shops, and the quality of the girls isn&#039;t at the same level.

Service can feel a little distant because they&#039;re so pretty and in high demand, but some of the best fucks I&#039;ve had were a matter of finding the right girl.

Went to Bangkok for 4 days, the traffic is the worst I&#039;ve ever seen, so because of that alone I&#039;ll probably never go there again. However, it&#039;s a cool city. It&#039;s huge and there is lots to do. Never seen such big malls. You can find literally anything there. I just feel, they try to rip foreigners off who go there to shop. In Bangkok, I matched with a couple local girls and one time I was at some night club with my homie. Coincidentally, a girl I&#039;ve matched with was also there, so we texted and met there in personn. Before I continue, asian girls are not my type. I like round, big booty bitches like latinas and asian girls are for the most part pretty flat. So this girl I matched with looked thick in a good way. Keyword &quot;looked&quot;..because when I met her at the night club she was just fat. And also pretty tall for an asian girl, granted she had heels on. Either way I immediately knew I wasn&#039;t attracted to her but she was on my proverbial dick the whole time. We then went to watch a World Cup game (Argentina-Mexico it was) with her friends. The game was over at 4 am and then she drove me and my friend to our hotel. Kept texting me but I kept shrugging her off. Met a different girl a day later and god damn what a body she had. We were outside until 4 am, she showed me the street where most of the hoes are and also showed me Soi Cowboy. I was literally grabbed by the dick by some 30-40 year old woman (I think) who wanted me to get into her bar. After those 4 days we went to Phuket. Caught a sunburn like a dumbass on the first day at the pool. Stayed in Patong area, which was an interesting place. I have to say, the locals in Thailand are extremely friendly and sweet. I truly love those motherfuckers for real.", "time": 1671403507, "resto": 2366806}, {"no": 2375079, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)18:04:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2375072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2375072</a><br>Oh and about that second girl with the great body I forgot to mention we were outside until like after 4 am. We then took a taxi to her place, on the way there we were stopped by thai police. They checked pur pockets told me to show them my wallet. There I had 3 condoms, which the police officer saw, this was pretty embarrassing for me and I told him that but he laughed it off. Was very friendly too, then he let us go on our way. Then at here place we of course fucked and my god she was fucking incredible. She had fake tits, which I didn&#039;t know and fucked like a pornstar. Truly 10/10 experience it was. Also immediately gave me head, bitches in here europe usually don&#039;t do that so quickly from my experience. Anyway, we fell asleep at like 6 am and at 1.15 pm I had the flight to Phuket with my friend. So, I set my alarm clock at around 8.15 am, woke up tired af, said goodbye to the girl, went outside and it felt like a fucking movie. I was so out of place there, cars driving by, countless thai ppl by the street doing their thing and I was trying to find a taxi through the &#039;Grab&#039; app but for some fucking reason I couldn&#039;t find a damn taxi. So I tried my luck the old school way by waving my hand to approaching taxis, still no luck. At that point 30 minutes went by and I was getting nervous about arriving too late to the hotel where I&#039;d meet my friend to check out and then drive to the airport. Then I asked some locals and as nice as they are, some elderly woman tells a taxi driver to take me in but he kept saying &quot;no gas, no gas&quot;. But the dude still took me inside his car, drove 3 minutes &amp; said something like &quot;okay you can go here&quot;. Took me a moment to figure out he drove me to a Sky Train station from where it took my only like 15-20 minutes to get back to my hotel (just in time). My Vietnamese friend who also barely got any sleep is a good guy cuz he packed my bags for me, he knew I was running late.

You will see groups of Asian tourists walking around with life vests and helmets, touts will harasss you almost non stop, and you&#039;ll hardly be able to walk or enjoy the view because of the crowds. It&#039;s the only place I&#039;ve ever seen a fucking traffic jam at a waterfall I&#039;m being dead ass serious.

Lots of foreigners here. Split between 2 beaches....White Beach and Panagsama. White beach is more suitable to swimming as its less rocky, but you&#039;ll have less choice of accomidation and they will be of lower quality. Panagsama beach is a bit more rocky, but they have better accommodation/food choices there. It&#039;s one of the few places in the province that has some semblance of a nightlife. Chili bar is nice during sunset, and they used to have a disco that had lots of beautiful women in there, both pinay and foreign, but I&#039;m not sure if it survived the pandemic.

Today&#039;s topic is MALLS. I know I know.....many of you despise malls because you&#039;re coming from America/Europe/Australia and the malls there are dead at best, and souless centers of consumerism at worst...but hear me out. Malls in the Philippines serve many functions. MOST (not all.....all you conyo Filipinos shut the fuck up, sit down and listen) Filipinos can&#039;t actually afford anything in the larger malls. They go there because it&#039;s one of the few places they can get free aircon/wifi, people watch, window shop, variety of foods etc. They are some of the cleanest and best maintained places in the Philippines. This being said, these are some of the most densely populated places, and if your mission is hunting for a girl/boy/ladyboy WHATEVER, these are great places and must not be overlooked. Not only do malls provide traditional shopping, but they provide fianancial services (money transfers.....western union, money gram etc), and package delivery (DHL, UPS etc), along with being transportaion hubs for public utility vehichles (PUVS). This combination insures these places are always filled with people from opening to close. <br><br>I will share every mall in Cebu city proper with a brief description. Firstly, their are tiers of malls, and you will find a different type of person depending on the tier. <br>1. Ayala malls<br>2. Sm malls<br>3.Robinsons<br>4. Gaisano <br>5. Random shit.

Ayala Center: This is the best mall in cebu city. Centrally located in the buisness district and equipped with a beautiful courtyard. Their are many nice hotels situated within walking distance to this malls. Freelance hookers can be found prowling, especially around bo&#039;s coffee, tgiFridays, and the Social (bar/lounge located on the top level.....infamous for foreigner hunters). Many food options here ranging from classic Filipino, to Greek. They have a cinema if going to the movies is your thing. Must visit if in Cebu city. <br><br>2. SM CITY: Oldest major mall (I think) in Cebu. Located on Ouano avenue (a main artery of Cebu). Every person will know how to get here by instinct, I would consider this as the proverbial heart of Cebu. The Radisson blu is connected to the mall (nicer hotel with great lobby), and the bayfront hotel is across the street (midrange hotel). The mall itself is showing it&#039;s age. They have a bowling alley and cinema for entertaining your family.<br><br>3. SM Seaside: Newest major mall situated on the main road leading out of Cebu City. It&#039;s also connected to the newly constructed bridge (CCLEX), so it&#039;s the closet major mall to those living/staying in LapuLapu city/Cordova. Nice complex with a kino roof area/lounge. Seaside has a cinema and a ice skating rink. The cebu ocean park is also connected to the mall......an okay aquarium by international standards, but with a nice restaurant attached.....kino views and very instagramable for your girlfriend.", "time": 1670340331, "resto": 2363402}, {"no": 2368785, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)10:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2368769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2368769</a><br>4. Robinsons Galleria: Located just up the road from SM City. Has a decent hotel attached to the complex (summit galleria) . Has a tgifridays AND denny&#039;s (many memories of drunken fights at 3am in my local dennys in Miami.....here in the Philippines its a &quot;classy&quot; resturant LOOOL). <br><br>5. Robinsons Fuente: Located in Osmena circle, right up the street from the infamous mango square. On the first floor, theirs a vendor who sells &quot;TOBACCO&quot; pipes and rolling papers.....other than that it&#039;s not much in there except your standard fastfood and grocery store. <br><br>6. Parkmall: Located in Mandaue adjacent to BAI hotel. Mixed indoor/outdoor mall with a grocery store and lots of food options. Major transportation hub for PUV&#039;s. Good people watching in the afternoon for a more local flavor<br><br>7. City Times square: This can be considered part of parkmall as it right across the street. Outdoor stripmall type......has a few good bars and restaurants attached. Queensland hotel is here as well, for all your short time boomboom needs. <br><br>8. Pacific mall MANDAUE: Located just off the bridge coming from lapulapu city. Medium sized mall with your standard Jolibee/chowking offerings. Transportation hub for those headed into the northern suburbs of cebu <br><br>9. J Centre Mall (Jmall): Medium sized mall located in Mandaue. Most notable feature is their Bureau of Immigration office. If you live here as a foreigner for a while you will need to come here eventually. Decent hotel attached, and a nice bar (SENTRAL) located 1 minute walk away. <br><br>10. Elizabeth mall (Emall): Located adjacent to the south bus terminal. Smaller mall. Has a ghetto public school (ACT) attached, good place to people watch.

Ayala Central Block: Newer mall situated in IT park across the street from the park social and sugbu mercado. Lots of call center people open to foreigners around this area. Make sure to tell your driver AYALA in IT PARK, because if you just say &quot;Ayala&quot; they will take you to the Ayala center for sure.<br>12. JY Centre: Smaller mall in the Lahug neighborhood with a few food options, and a Mcdonalds for the Amerimutts. This is mainly used a jump off point for those going up into the mountains to see the TOPS viewpoint. Lots of motortaxi drivers will hang out here and try to take you up the mountain on a tour<br><br>13. Gaisano country mall: Outdoor Shopping area located in Mandaue. I&#039;ve driven by this many times but never went in, so I can&#039;t really report as to what&#039;s there, but it IS THERE. <br><br>14. Gaisano Main/138 mall/Colonade: I&#039;ve included these all together as they are in the same general vicinity (walking distance). All three of these are on, or very near to Colon street. Most Gaisano &quot;malls&quot; are not really malls so to speak, but more like big department stores. 138 and colonade sell a bunch of cheap knockoff shit from China, but theirs some good looking girls in there I&#039;LL TELL YOU WHATTTTT<br><br>15.Gaisano Tisa/Gaisano jai alai/Gaisano mandaue central/Gaisano mandaue north: YEA theirs like 10 of these things in the greater Cebu area, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some, so cebuBros correct me if I&#039;m missing anything.

SM Consalacion: Smaller Sm mall located on the northern outskirts of Cebu. Kind of out the way if your staying in the city center, but it&#039;s the last stop before you start heading into the northern provinces. <br><br>17. Marina Mall: Located in LapuLapu city. This is mall in closet proximity to the airport. Standard jolibee/ chowking affair, nothing special. Their is another mall across the street (it&#039;s a gaisano mall), but as their is ANOTHER gaisano mall located a few meters down the road, I refer to both as Marina mall. The drivers have lived in the neighbnorhood their whole life and they still get the 2 malls mixed up, so just say Marina mall. <br><br>18. Gaisano Island mall: Located on lapu lapu a few meters from marina mall.....Known locally as Island mall. Theirs a beauru of immigration office inside, so if you live in lapulapu, its much more convient than going all the way into the city for your visa extensions. <br><br>19. Tamiya: This is an outdoor outlet style mall. On google maps, this is marked as &quot;THE SHOPS AT PUEBLO VERDE&quot;, or &quot;PUEBLO VERDE&quot;. If you tell a driver to take you to Pueblo verde, he will look at you like your stupid. For some reason everyone calls this area tamiya, you have to say tamiya or they won&#039;t know where the fuck you&#039;re talking about. I have many fond memories in Tamiya. Pre-pandemic they used to have a disco and a restobar in here, and I picked up quite a few girls just drinking in front of the 7/11 there (not hookers just horny young women). It&#039;s a bit more subdued now, but it&#039;s still a major transportation hub for LapuLapu city and they have several large factories nearby, so this place gets packed with people in the late afternoon. LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS who work in factories making 200 dollars a month praying and hoping you&#039;ll save them can be found in this area.
