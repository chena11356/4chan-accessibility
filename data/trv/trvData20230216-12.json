People are nicer, food is better (I didn&#039;t actually thing this would be true but it is. I&#039;m in Italy and all I can think about is how the Italian food in America is better), dating is easier (European women are strange, still figuring them out), alcohol is WAY better.

One thing I know is that I can&#039;t keep doing this moving around thing, I need a place to call home.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps individuals identify and change dysfunctional thinking patterns and behavior. Family therapy helps family members learn to better support the person with schizophrenia, build stronger relationships, and improve communication. Supportive psychotherapy helps people with schizophrenia cope with stress, identify and manage symptoms, and develop social skills.

Before discussing commitment to an institution, it is important to try to explore other options and make sure that the individual is receiving the best possible treatment and support. This may include medication, therapy, and peer support groups. It is also important to ensure that the individual is safe and not a danger to themselves or others.

The inhabitants of these islands are not subjected to any law, king, or lord. Although there are large towns in some regions, the people do not act in concert or obey any ruling body; but each man does whatever he pleases, and takes care only of himself and of his slaves. He who owns most slaves, and the strongest, can obtain anything he pleases. No law binds relative to relative, parents to children, or brother to brother. No person favors another, unless it is for his own interest; on the other hand, if a man in some time of need, shelters a relative in his house, supports him, and provides him with food for a few he will consider that relative as his slave from that time on, and is served by him. They recognize neither lord nor rule; and even their slaves are not under great subjection to their masters and lords, serving them only under certain conditions, and when and how they please. When these people give or lend anything to one another, the favor must be repaid double, even if between parents and children, At times they sell their own children, when there is little need or necessity of doing so.<br><br>These people declare war among themselves at the slightest provocation, or with none whatever. Privateering and robbery have a natural attraction for them. Whenever the occasion presents itself, they rob one another, even if they be neighbors or relatives; and when they see and meet one another in the open fields at nightfall, they rob and seize one another. Many times it happens that half of a community is at peace with half of a neighboring community and the other halves are at war, and they assault and seize one another; nor do they have any order or arrangement in anything.

Seated on our row was a mom and her two kids. She couldn&#039;t secure the restraint over her round frame so she beckoned for one of the operators to help. After about 2 minutes of struggling, another operator jumped in and they both stood there furiously trying to shove the restraint into its lock for a good few minutes. At one point they even tried to kick the thing into place when their arms were starting to tire out. Everyone queued up was trying really hard not to laugh, some failing to contain it. I felt bad for the kids, how humiliating that must have been but as for the mom, why even bother?

Most anons only know about Pattaya and the other touristy places, so I&#039;m glad you&#039;ll be taking some time to explore the humble yet wild north. Some things I&#039;ve done up there that I can recommend:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Visit the mountains. Doi Inthanon is the highest, but I can vouch for Doi Sa Ngo. I had a good picture of the sunrise I saw there but I can&#039;t find it now. Anyways, mountain camping is also pretty popular in Thailand nowadays, though it&#039;s more of a wintertime activity.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Ride an elephant or (more ethically) visit an elephant sactuary. I&#039;ve done both, these animals are truly beautiful and they&#039;re far more intelligent than the average Thai man/farang coomer.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Attend a Buddhist ceremony. Most monks will allow you inside their temples, and you can take pictures so long as you remain respectful. I personally would avoid any invitations to attend a sutra chanting though, they&#039;re very boring.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go shopping at a night market. Chiang Mai is locally famous for its night market, just like how Bangkok is famous for its floating markets. Most of the vendors sell foodstuffs but you can also buy some cool souvenirs without the ripoff prices you&#039;ll find in Bangkok. If you don&#039;t know what to eat, just follow the long lines and point at menus.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Hike with the hill tribes. The most famous is the Karen Long Neck. I did this when I was little so I don&#039;t remember much, but there&#039;s no better way to explore the Zomia. You can read about it if you want, it&#039;s &quot;a land without governance&quot;. The Moken are also pretty cool and are enjoying their own form of political liberation, but they&#039;re in southern Thailand.</span>", "time": 1676002700, "resto": 2403835}, {"no": 2405124, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:49:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2405114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2405114</a><br>(2/2)<br>Other than those activities, a lot of Thailand&#039;s appeal is food-related. I&#039;ve attached the table of contents from Pok Pok by Andy Ricker, he goes over the best northern Thai dishes and you can use this to guide your culinary journey. Try to find pictures by googling if you can, if you can&#039;t I&#039;ll see what I can do. Also, if you&#039;re an adventurous eater, you can experience the pleasure and displeasure of trying the many unique proteins of the region (love me some snake, hate wasp larvae). Chiang Mai also has a booming coffee scene, some of the cafes are really stylish despite the north still being pretty rural.<br>Personally, whenever I visit Thailand (usually once yearly in the winter), I like to chill and do redneck things like fish in the rice paddies or go on motorbike/pickup truck joy rides. And honestly, even though those sound pretty boring in writing, it really captures the spirit of Thailand as a whole. It&#039;s an easygoing country.<br>Sorry, one more thing. There are definitely some things I would buy in Thailand to take back home, such as stuff that&#039;s just plain cheaper (Korean cosmetics, knockoff Chinese stuff that&#039;s 99% as good as the actual deal) and some unique things like retort curry pouches and special spices. Thai cooking is really spice-dependent, but that&#039;s the only real barrier.

You can anchor by a beach and save on docking. That said, from time to time you&#039;ll have to go to a marina to do some maintenance.<br>You learn to sail in easy conditions in 1-3 months, 6 months you learn a good deal of sailing and I think one year is enough to travel long distance (ocean crossing), although it would be better to have a more knowledgeable person as captain. There are people who just take classes for one month, start sailing along the coast of their countries for a few months and then cross the atlantic. So it is doable in less time.<br>Boats are expensive but living costs are actually cheap if you&#039;re doing most repairs, sailing in your own and not docking in expensive marinas.<br>That said, would you really enjoy it? It&#039;s slow, a bit dangerous, can get tedious if you&#039;re not used to be lonely, it&#039;s easy to get mad at people (if you&#039;re not sailing alone)... Also, if you plan to visit cities you will have to dock at marinas (so the price goes up).<br>Also keep in mind that boats are really small. In bad weather you would have to face the elements or stay confined in the small salon. If sailing alone you would have to sleep for small periods of time as you must keep an eye in the route, fishing nets and boats along your way.<br>My 0.20 cents: crossing the atlantic must be a nice thing to do once. Sailing by the coast of onefew countries for a month also is fun. But too much time in a boat is tiresome.

I recovered from COVID no problem. It was only when I took the J&amp;J that I started having problems. The minute I took the vaccine my heart started pounding rapidly. I told the people and they were worried for me. Told me to stay half an hour. I did pass out or anything so I just went home. For like 3 months I just had a rapid heart. Like the feeling of your heart when you stayed up 36 hours and you drink a can of monster to stay awake alittle longer. That is how my heart felt from awaking up until I went to sleep. Plus just constant fatigue. I couldn&#039;t walk for 5 minutes without feel like I ran for 40 mins. I use to like running. I stayed away from physical activity as much as I could. This heart thing was like the issue for a few months. After that for 1 month, I had what I think was brain fog. Like it was just terrible I couldn&#039;t think without it being a struggle to not have a weird feeling in my head. So for that month I stayed in bed and tried not to think. Like even watching TV was bothersome, but at the point the heart thing became less an issue and would only pump hard when walking 5 mins or more. After that, I started to recover. Slowly I was able to walk more and more, go further and further away from my house. Eventually I was able to attend Uni in person like normal. I missed come lectures since it was exhausting, but it was like I was getting my body back to be stronger to do normal things like walk for 15 mins than sit down for 2 hours.even that was something I couldn&#039;t do months earlier. At one point in the early months, I had a stiff neck, which I heard is another vaccine side effect. It felt like a tingle going down my spine in a line when I turned my head. But that went away doctor said it was a muscle issue not blood clots. Doctors checked me out and I guess I have no blood clots. He said my heart looked healthy.

But in another way it was like that feeling on impending doom. Like the fear of not knowing what&#039;s wrong with me. Like in a weird way it would be more comforting to know what exactly is the problem. Even if the problem is more serious it&#039;s better to know, than for it to not be serious but not know. At this point I&#039;ve recovered a lot. But I&#039;m not the same I was before. Like before I was fit, I would workout because I enjoyed working out and trying to be healthy. Like I wasn&#039;t born rich, but being born healthy was a consolation price. Now I don&#039;t even have that. I regret this, I didn&#039;t want to take it but I was pressured by a program in Uni. Honestly my injury is mostly why I&#039;m taking some time to bounce around SEA for a while. My thinking is if I could die in the next 5 years, then I want to get that experience I was planning on later in life. Even now as I type this I have a very faint weird feeling in my heart area. Like as if there is slight friction. This could be blood clots clogging my system, or a large heart rubbing up against my other organs for space. It isn&#039;t constant.

Looking at Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, all of these countries technically only allow 30 days upon entry. (I think Thailand is currently 45.) Thailand has free entry for most passports, Cambodia is $36, Vietnam is $25. Taking a bus between these countries is currently $25-35 one way.<br>In Thailand, you can extend your visa-free entry by another 30 days for $55 without leaving the country. In Cambodia you can extend another 30 days for about $35 without leaving the country. You can&#039;t currently extend in Vietnam. You can leave and re-enter Thailand twice by land borders every calendar year, unlimited times by air, but there&#039;s always the chance that Thai immigration will turn you back. One way to lessen this is to pay for a 60 day single entry visa (which can also be extended for 30 days without leaving the country) or a 180 day ME visa (which has more application requirements and a big cost). You can do visa runs with Cambodia and Vietnam indefinitely - they don&#039;t care.<br>So on the surface it will seem you can spend the most time in Thailand without doing expensive border runs, but Thailand is the country that&#039;s harder to live skint. Their whole economy is designed to suck money from farang, and even in remote areas you&#039;ll find yourself getting gouged and being resented if you barter too hard. There are places you can still do it (Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai are very budget and backpacker friendly, along with almost all the north). And if you get a Thai gf, which will be inevitable unless your tastes lean towards men or katoey, she will show you how to make your money go further.<br>Cambodia and Vietnam are easier to live on a budget, in my opinion, for various reasons. Don&#039;t expect as smooth an experience getting to different parts of them by local transport.

There is no conclusive research, but there is a strong correlation between older men who use sildenafil being twice as likely as men the same age to show some hearing loss. There&#039;s a theory that the same mechanism of sildenafil that makes blood flow easier could also affect the longevity of ear hair follicles that are used for hearing. Using a high dose of sildenafil daily would put a similar strain on your hearing as working in a loud environment. But this is just a theory because it doesn&#039;t seem to affect all men the same way.

You can do it cheaper though. Don&#039;t write off Cambodia yet - I was just there for a few months and the Chinese are gone. Sihanoukville is still a mess, but anywhere else that was worried about them (such as Kampot) is experiencing a good revival. You can stay in hotels, eat restaurant food, and get drunk every day in Siem Reap for under $500/month. And I only use these activities as baselines because switching to longer term housing, cutting down on alcohol (which saves money in Thailand but is cheaper than water in Cambodia), and following locals at mealtimes to see where they eat can bring you down to under $500 in Thailand and Vietnam and even lower in Cambodia. You can stretch your money quite far.<br>I recommend Vietnam, although the visa situation sucks there right now, but if not for that it would be my top recommendation.

Since it is summer I would do some scuba diving here, this can be done near Wilmington which is our largest coastal city. You can scuba dive at multiple shipwrecks and since it is summer the water should be relatively warm. Wilmington also has a lot of cool little shops and a historical battleship museum too that you could visit. Alternatively if you wanted try northern coast area, go to visit the NC Aviation Museum there is a lot there to see, as well as the monument at Kitty Hawk where the Wright Brothers flew the first plane. Also there is the Lost Colony of Roanoke where all the colonists disappeared in the 1500s on Roanoke Island, and Tryon Palace which was the colonial governor&#039;s home back when we were still a colony. (Praise our mother country Great Britain!)<br><br>Moving inland a bit, the relatively obscure White Lake is a cool destination as it has crystal clear water and white sand, a very interesting spot and the only one of its kind in the state. Raleigh is OK for like a day, we have the State Capitol building which is nice as well as the state natural history museum. Southwest there is also Uwharrie National Forest which is very beautiful.<br><br>Then in Charlotte we have the Charlotte Motor Speedway, which is the home of 2 major yearly NASCAR races and the NASCAR hall of fame.

North of that is Blowing Rock which is an awesome hike, just be sure to do it on a weekday due to possible foot traffic.<br><br>Then west of there is the Appalachian Mountains. Hot Springs NC is a nice place to visit here for a relaxing day with its natural geothermal springs. As another Anon suggested, the Biltmore Estate is a great visit and a very beautiful mansion with surrounding gardens. Asheville is right next to it with some nice shops as well. Additionally in the mountains we have the Cherokee Native American reservation which is also visitable and they have a big casino there too. Lake James is also a great place to visit for a day and has some pretty views in the mountains. Also, there is the Linville Gorge which is very scenic, and Mt. Mitchell, which has the highest peak east of the Mississippi River.

Usually I ask them to show me around the place I am visiting. In cities where transactional relationships are common, which is pretty much all of Latin America, you simply offer an &quot;arrangement&quot; (in Spanish arreglo or acuerdo) with the tacit agreement of intimacy for money to a girl you message online or meet IRL. There is some back and forth regarding final numbers but once the figures are mutual you just agree on a time and place. Its that simple. I typically aim for arrangements where I pay per date, which translates to a few hours some time in the afternoon or evening. Depending on what I want to do, I have had girls get drinks at my hotel then straight to my room while other girls I take to a legitimate dinner and a show then to my room.

Longevity is based on compatibility, some girls I have seen for over a year, others I could only tolerate for one night.

Labor regulations are dysfunctional and it&#039;s better for you to have them deal with it. For example, you&#039;ve gotta pay them severance after they&#039;ve been working for you a certain amount of time. What if you decide one day you don&#039;t want her around? That&#039;ll be a month&#039;s wages. <br><br>Another thing to consider is how banal violence is in Colombia. This isn&#039;t America, where women clutch their pearls once guys start swinging and &quot;violence is never the answer.&quot; The country&#039;s been in an on-and-off civil war since the 60&#039;s. Officially, there&#039;s been a peace agreement since 2016, but killings by fringe groups on the left and the right still take place. Gen Xers grew up watching the Cali cartel and the Medellin cartel kill with impunity, for the most arbitrary reasons. If a cartel guy wanted to be with a girl and she had a problem with it, she was dead. <br><br>Those days are gone, but the impact on the culture persists. The streets are mostly run by neighborhood level gangs these days. Colombians are very social. Everyone in the barrio knows each other. Say you knocked up your maid, and she doesn&#039;t want to get an abortion. You have an argument, and she decides you&#039;ve disrespected her. Colombians are very touchy. Chances are she knows one or two guys who care about her enough and dgaf about the law enough to come after you. <br><br>On top of that, tourist fatigue is becoming a real issue in Colombia. Every day on the news there&#039;s gringo sexpats doing sleazy things. There&#039;s Valentina Trespalacios and a lot more. Last week, a story came out where American guys were charging tourists for access to sex parties where they lured poor women with free food. They won&#039;t take kindly to you disrespecting their cousins or sisters. Colombians have loads of common sense and good social skills.

I wouldn&#039;t say either country has better food as I think they are both great but different.

The main difference between the two is that Seoul and most Korean cities seem like a tier 2 Chinese cities. You can&#039;t compare Seoul to Shanghai or Chengdu.

They let in groups of like 30-40 people for 1 minute at a time and then the next group comes in. The Chinese tourists went in and blocked everyone else from getting closer to the painting until the time was up. Not a big deal for me, but you can see how that can be a problem.

Switzerland has the smallest hotel rooms I&#039;ve ever seen. I also think it&#039;s fair to mention that a fondue meal for 2 in Switzerland at a decent restaurant is going to run you $150.

MNCs function in such a way that every national branch is its own company. They bill shit to each other, and either compete with, or work in fields that aren&#039;t quite the ones back home. <br><br>For example, a lot of MNCs will have folks working sales abroad to sell the products produced back home. And the people they will hire are obviously locals because they might be cheaper or just more at ease with communicating with the locals. Also, hiring an equivalent foreign worker is pound to pound as skilled as a local is considered bad practice and is starting to get heavily curbed in Asia.<br><br>Therefore, differentiation is key.

Foreign internships, exchanges and double diplomas during your studies can help if you take the necessary steps professionally to make it work. <br><br>In a nutshell, anything that makes you a better person than a local works. And that also goes by evening the playing fields. Some countries have visa schemes that facilitate foreign hiring for skilled workers. Speaking the local language in a professional capacity also helps leveling the playing field and beating other foreign contenders. Again, you don&#039;t necessarily need to do all that to try your luck.

The real question is whether or not, ultimately, you&#039;d rather go abroad and settle for less (but definitely not less than the people working the same field there) or stay at home. <br>If you think TEFL is an easy solution, it&#039;s not, and will ultimately yield you the same problem. You will do overtime, unpaid meetings, and getting any form of raise beyond compensation for inflation will be way more difficult. Career-wise, if you ever want back in, you had better made it temporary before people do not find you worth hiring anymore. And also, teaching kids is EXHAUSTING.

Some pertinent info and thoughts if you&#039;re looking to do the same.<br><br>Entry + visa - I entered Iraq through the land border with Kuwait which you, if you know about Kuwait, will not be surprised to learn was a fucking hassle. Internet says there&#039;s a public bus that runs to the border but there isn&#039;t, the only option is a taxi. I got to the border and learnt that I needed a green piece of paper from the ministry of interior authorising me to leave Kuwait to Iraq via land, and that I could only get it from the office back in the city. This wasted an entire day, as the office was closed by the time I got back to the city. I got it the next morning from the interior office next to the airport - it only took 5 minutes and didn&#039;t cost anything. Back at the border, crossing is fairly straight forward. The Iraqi side is underdeveloped and pretty dusty. Visa on arrival for all the good western passports is available at all ports of entry and cost me $77USD, and was issued surprisingly quickly. From the border town of Safwan, you&#039;ll probably take a cab to Basra. I went straight to Baghdad from the Basra taxi station, about a 6 hour drive. I imagine flying into Baghdad is far more straightforward.<br><br>Baghdad - a surprisingly nice city compared to what you may think. Much nicer than Cairo, I thought, and enough to keep you busy for up to a week, although 4 days would be fine. My favourite thing to do was strolling through Mutannabi street and the adjacent areas where the local craftsmen, book sellers, and antique dealers are. The mosques around this area are stunning and will give you a good sense of the distinct architectural style of Baghdad, i.e. intricate brickwork and blue and yellow domes. If you like modern stuff like malls, chic cafes etc then Mansour area is very nice.

Women dress anywhere from jeans and tees to the full burqa. Careem works everywhere in Baghdad and is very convenient, as navigating the local minivans would be practically impossible without being a local. Traffic is standard developing-world-tier, frustrating but inevitable. Airbnbs are basically non-existent everywhere in Iraq and so I ended up staying in budget hotels. In Baghdad, the cheap ones (~25USD per night) can be found in the bataween area. Quality tends to be pretty shit, but if you just want a bed, it&#039;s fine. I stayed in Hotel Diwan. Baghdad feels safe enough and not tense, but keep your head on a swivel anyway. Standard precautions, don&#039;t walk late at night, dress conspicuously, speak a bit of arabic.<br><br>Karbala and Najaf - the two holjest Shia sites in Iraq, along with kadhimiya in Baghdad and Askari in Samarra. Both fairly well developed (relative to the region) due to the number of pilgrims. Go to either one first depending on your itinerary, and get there from the Al alawi south garage in Baghdad. You can take a bus or shared taxi, and the same for the next city. Hotel situation is much the same as above. 1-2 full days in each is appropriate, because all there really is to see are the shrines. Great places to learn about shia Islam and meet people from all over the world. People tend to be friendly here and strike up conversation, ask where you&#039;re from etc. No issue saying that you&#039;re not Muslim, just follow the customs that will be very evident and displayed on the entrances to the shrines.

The average Iraqi is very happy to welcome guests, though, and I had people offer to pay for my meals on several occasions when they learnt I was foreign. <br><br>Babylon - a day trip from karbala. Most disappointing thing I visited in Iraq desu. Site was all but abandoned apart from one guard sitting on a plastic chair, and the entrance fee for foreigners is 25k dinars (~18USD), which is absurd for Iraq. Just a bunch of brick walls with no explanatory signage or context. Might as well have been waking in any given field.

Samarra isn&#039;t controlled by the fed gov and is instead run by a Shia militia called the peace companies. You&#039;ll get stopped at the checkpoint before the entrance to the city and made to hand over your passport to them. Your shared taxi, presumably filled with locals, will be told to continue and you&#039;ll be kept at the checkpoint where they&#039;ll call some local driver and assign him to you for the day. Westerners aren&#039;t allowed to stay overnight in Samarra, and apparently the security situation is still quite tenuous there. It&#039;s a shithole anyway, the only two things to see are malwiya mosque, the big spiral minaret, and Askari shrine. Your assigned driver probably knows you&#039;re there to see them anyway and will take you there and back to the checkpoint where you&#039;ll collect your passport.

There isn&#039;t a whole lot going on in mosul in the normal sense, but walking around the rubble of the old city is unreal, as is meeting locals and hearing their stories about life under Isis. See if you can co-ordinate permissions with UNESCO to visit Al Nuri mosque which is being reconstructed, as well as the church of the lady of the hour. I asked around at some of the other destroyed churches, and the construction guys were nice enough to let me in and wonder around. I stayed in hotel Al safer on the west side, which was very basic (squat toilet) but fine for 25k per night. The city feels quite sad, but the security presence is heavy and it&#039;s safe. Locals are happy to meet visitors and I got invited to the house of a guy who I met wondering around the destroyed areas. He told me stories of his relatives being killed by Isis and how his house was blown up.

Your federal Iraq visa works to enter here, but not vice versa. Erbil is just ok. Very relaxed, safe, and relatively liberal. The citadel and surrounding bazaar is nice, but there&#039;s really not much else to do in the city. Duhok is much nicer, I thought, and allows for interesting day trips. I went to Lalish, the yazidi holy city, and it was fascinating. You can&#039;t wear shoes in the whole village, and the architecture is very distinct.
