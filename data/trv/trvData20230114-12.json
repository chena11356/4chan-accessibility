Why don&#039;t tourists return to Vietnam?</span><br>1. Most people who would do return trips after crossing off all the major sights from their list are either sex pests or resort tourists. Vietnam is garbage for both. The cooming offer is nowhere close to its neighbors and the beaches are frankly shit. While they can seem nice at a first glance, Vietnam is drowning in trash and has zero water pollution standards. You&#039;ll be frolicking in the waves and suddenly there&#039;s literal shit all around you.<br>2. People are often plain rude. There&#039;s little in the way of etiquette and the concept of disturbing others (which is generally a problem with SEA, but not to that level) does not exist in Vietnam at all. They&#039;ll spit, cut the line and play shitty Tik-Tok vids on full volume at 3AM on a night bus if they feel like it. Everyone working in the tourist industry has nothing but utmost contempt for tourists and will make sure you know that.<br>3. Scams. 80% of all Vietnamese you&#039;ll interact with will lie through their teeth in an attempt to extract money from you. If you don&#039;t play along, they&#039;ll get loud, insistent and aggressive. You can easily get ripped off in Thailand, which has ten times the return rate, but they usually do it with a smile and try to make sure you won&#039;t notice. Vietnam is on the level of people blatantly telling you to fuck off and demanding double while you point at the price list right behind them.<br>Don&#039;t take me wrong, Vietnam&#039;s my favorite place in SEA, but it is, without any doubt, a rude shithole that is the very opposite of comfy and that relaxed holiday feeling is what people are usually looking for.", "time": 1672245155, "resto": 2378355}, {"no": 2380118, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:03:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2379723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2379723</a><br>This is an absolute lie.

Foreigners will undoubtly be suspicious of Filipinos offering them drugs, but they WILL lower their guard if its another foreigner.....gives them some sense of security I suppose. A guy like Mr. Pogi German is a perfect crash test dummy to push shit to tourists and what not. <br><br>Remember, methamphetamines makes you feel invincible and take unnecessary risks ......couple that the &quot;white god&quot; effect, and you get situations like this.

My point was, most universities from any given country, your home country included, have exchanges and double diploma deals with chinese universities. Your best bet would be to integrate those for a Master&#039;s degree. You then basically have the length of your studies there to do some networking, find a job or a PhD. It will not be easy but it is possible if you stay there and look long enough. Also, you need to seriously work on your Chinese. Since you&#039;re not doing STEM in an international corpo or TEFL, you&#039;re basically competing directly with the chinese in a domain where they don&#039;t recruit much foreigners. You could contend, but you have to even up the playing field, and that goes by learning mandarin. <br><br>Don&#039;t try to directly apply for a Chinese university if you&#039;re doing a pol sci cursus.

There&#039;s no connection whatsoever between them and the young women they marry, they can barely communicate. It&#039;s painful to watch. I remember old guys awkwardly telling their girlfriends they&#039;ll give them money to go buy shoes or something generic like that, obviously not knowing anything about those women. The idea of dating/marrying some young girl who doesn&#039;t give a shit about you, probably resents you, and who you have no connection with, is much more depressing than being alone. There is something very creepy and wrong with a lot of the old sexpats down there, it kind of makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.<br><br>At the same time, you&#039;re right, these are old guys and I can&#039;t blame some of them for wanting to go around and fuck some attractive girls (though I find Cambodians ugly). Spending old age in a cheap tropical country with hot women doesn&#039;t sound bad at all. While I am judgmental of those creepy guys, I&#039;ve also known guys who brought back foreign wives who were younger, and they seemed quite happy. So maybe there&#039;s a right way and a wrong way to do it. It&#039;s also noticeable that it seems like women usually age a lot worse than men, so I see it all the time where there&#039;s a pretty good looking dude in his 60s, with a hideous, completely un-sexual woman his same age, and the disparity between them is depressing. I can very easily see myself getting a hot younger wife when I&#039;m older. But the key thing is, there would have to be a real personal connection, because relationships are really about the company. If you feel no personal connection, then you might as well just fuck random hookers on your free time. I believe the thing that&#039;s worse than being alone, is being with people who make you feel all alone.", "time": 1673223133, "resto": 2383653}, {"no": 2386695, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)19:19:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2386691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2386691</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t waste my breathe on these guys.

However, rental prices in Mumbai are significantly more expensive than elsewhere in India. You&#039;ll pay more and get less than you would in Delhi or Bangalore. However, an Rs. 60,000 housing stipend should be sufficient alone to rent a reasonably comfortable apartment. <br><br>If you&#039;re staying or working in a more central area, paying an additional $200-300 out-of-pocket should net you a spacious, modern property. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How easy is it to travel to other parts of India from Mumbai? </span><br>Mumbai is a Tier-1 city and Alpha global city. It has an international airport with flights across the country. You can also take the train to most places. There are regular buses--across a variety of budgets--running to other cities in Maharashtra, Goa, and so forth. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And how easy is it to make friends/date as a Westerner?</span><br>Completely depends on you. Making friends in India is reasonably easy. However, the sorts of people who are most likely to approach you in the street will be interested in you because you&#039;re &quot;different.&quot; You can sometimes meet decent people this way, but you might not have anything in common. Furthermore, they might simply want to show you off as their &quot;cool foreign friend.&quot;<br><br>Dating is a slightly different story. Living in India longer-term makes dating easier, especially if you&#039;re looking for something serious--many women won&#039;t want to go out with someone who&#039;s only here for a few weeks or a few months. <br><br>Other than that, well--it completely fucking depends on you. You can certainly find White fetishists in a city like Mumbai--girls who only date White men, and will sleep with any reasonably attractive foreigner. They&#039;re a very small percentage of the overall population, but if you look half-decent, they&#039;ll proactively seek you on dating apps. <br><br>I met some of these women when I was single, and they are fucking insufferable.

Same socks for 3 days, same shirt for 5 days, same pants for 2 weeks, etc.<br>Anti-perspirant is your friend as it&#039;ll stop you stinking up your clothes after you&#039;ve only worn them for a day.<br>Every city is going to have a laundromat so the chances of you getting stuck with no clothes to wear is unlikely. If you&#039;re overly paranoid though or travelling somewhere you doubt there will be laundromats, pack a clothes washing soap bar.<br>Depending on where you&#039;re going all you really need is 1 scenario-specific outfit (by that I mean a &quot;going out&quot; outfit or a &quot;hiking&quot; outfit) and even then, try and fit that with your everyday outfit. For example, a &quot;going out&quot; outfit might just be your everyday jeans with a nice shirt rather than bringing nice jeans and a nice shirt. If you&#039;re going hiking your everyday shirt will be fine and more often than not, so will your everyday jeans.<br><br>Of course if you&#039;re a woman you&#039;re probably going full wacko mode and you&#039;re going to pack shit you don&#039;t need regardless.

But if you want the most bang for your buck, plan a trip to do two of these cities at the same time. For example, the ferry from HK to Macau is only 40 bucks (roundtrip) and Shenzhen is right at the border. So you could like, leave a day or two for visiting Macau and do the rest of the week in Hong Kong visiting the city, museums, the nearby greenery or simply just having fun. Same goes for Singapore and Kuala lumpur, a simple bus trip of a few hours gets you from one to the other. <br><br>Same goes for Japan. Kyoto and Osaka (+kobe) are basically the same city. only issue is if you want to do Tokyo too, in which case an overnight bus trip (500km) won&#039;t cost much. And Same goes for Seoul/Busan (300km)<br>Taking this into account, you can easily see that HK/Shenzhen/Macau is a great deal and so is Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe (kobe is definitely worth a visit !), especially if you can fit Tokyo into your timetable/budget. I&#039;d also put Malacca/Kuala Lumpur/Singapore as another trio worth visiting. <br><br>On the other hand, there are places where it&#039;s worth just taking 2-4 weeks, find an appartment or airbnb to rent, and pretend you&#039;ve lived there all your life. These places are Chongqing and Taipei, in my opinion. They&#039;re relatively peaceful places with not much shit to do but basically go on a walking adventure around the city, discover the people, hear their stories. Maybe have a love story. Maybe look at the job situation so you can make it there.

A lot of European cities have walk-in travel clinics for foreigners that can sometimes fill prescriptions for visitors based on a foreign script, with relatively few questions asked. My wife accidentally ran out of thyroid meds while on holiday in Portugal once and was able to get what she needed from a clinic just by showing them the empty box with her name on the prescription label. And when I moved countries, I was able to get an armload of prescriptions from my new GP just by telling him the medications I needed (I have multiple chronic health conditions).

Gritty, dirty big city, juxtaposed against a majestic, historic and captivating place full of winding old streets. Beautiful beaches, weird commie anarchist neighbourhoods, vibrant music/arts/history, riot police on every corner at all times, crumbling post-modern architecture and beautiful outdoor cafes. Also beautiful girls, cheap whores and good food. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Barcelona, Spain. </span><br>Not going to go down well on /trv/ but I\u2019ve never had a bad vibe in this city. Big, cosmopolitan and international, modern yet loads of incredibly beautiful streets and neighbourhoods.

Luzern is a bit nicer as a tourist town; if you go, be sure to take some boat trips on the enormous lake. Might be worth considering swapping Z\u00fcrich for Bern (many posters here hate Bern, too, but I think its historic center is prettier than Z\u00fcrich\u2019s) and adding a side trip somewhere in the nearby mountains of the Bernese highlands.

Where I live as an expat, surrounded by other expats, it mostly means that you moved for work or were moved by your job.

Expat professionals take jobs in shitholes because they get things like contracts that include housing and servants and a car and driver and paid trips \u201chome\u201d a couple of times a year while earning several times more than natives. They also get jobs in rich places with perks like high salaries and private school tuition subsidies for their kids.

Open brothel district where you can see all the girls sitting at the front of their shops, and you pick one and go.

Matsushima Shinchi, also in Osaka, is the same, but there are fewer shops, and the quality of the girls isn&#039;t at the same level. Tobita&#039;s level of girls is super high; some are idol- and model-tier and would be the kind of girls you see at luxury/high-end soaplands. Tobita is by far my favorite if you&#039;re mainly concerned about looks and want to get the prettiest and cutest girl possible without risking getting baited by photoshopped/old pics (soaplands are notorious for this). Service can feel a little distant because they&#039;re so pretty and in high demand, but some of the best fucks I&#039;ve had were a matter of finding the right girl.

A bit more Japanese is necessary to enter and to schedule things, but it can be done. Yoshiwara in Tokyo is probably your best bet as a foreigner, and that place is kind of well-known for having girls that do NS (No Skin) and NN (Nakadashi), so raw sex is possible, although that might not be an option for you if they&#039;re wary about you because you&#039;re a foreigner.<br><br>Delivery/Hotel Health where girls are delivered to your selected love hotel is good and can be priced fairly, but you&#039;re paying for the love hotel.

Bring a tote bag to put things in while you leave the bag at the hostel.

There are a lot of hostels which means it&#039;s a good place for doing this kind of thing, it&#039;s enough of a culture shock that it will be exciting and I can&#039;t imagine a US citizen will have a hard time with immigration. Rome2Rio is a good website for transport and skyscanner is good for flight tickets. Booking dot com allows you to filter for hostels only which makes deciding where to stay and go much easier; you can search a country and then filter hostels only, a place with multiple hostels means it&#039;s easy to get to and an exciting place.<br>If you&#039;re willing to fly much farther, south-east asia is great but only if you&#039;re willing to sit on a plane that long for your first trip.

In Venice I got St. Mark&#039;s square pretty much empty except for a few carabinieri, people setting up shop and pigeons.

My favourite was that historical museum in whatever villa it is, near Colosseo, and the Etruscan museum which is bit off center.

Also they never stay in one farm for long. Many of them think they can just change farms after 2/3 weeks and continue travelling. Farmers in Australia hate them for this reason, they are usually the last people to get hired and the first to get fired. When you try and explain to them the reality of the situation (i.e. that Australians don&#039;t care about their gay little adventures and want a stable workforce) they get pissy at you and just ignore what you said. German girls tend to be very attractive by conventional standards (blonde hair and blue eyes) so they have guys hitting on them multiple times per day. They will always assume you are trying to fuck them and will make it obvious at all times that they despise you unless you are attractive, rich or have some kind of authority.

For example two 18 year old girls who came here just after high school were offered full time well paid jobs that didn&#039;t even exist for no other reason other than they were attractive and people wanted to fuck them. The irony Is that alot of people respect the fact they are so honest about valuing nepotism over merit.

Theres so much cool underground stuff that you miss by beelining it right for x,y,z destination in a subway. Like another anon here recommended, ssarch and destroy is a great example<br>Bars. Some of the best cocktail bars in the world, and some of the coolest atmospehres. Id recommend checking out speakeasies. Theres also please dont tell and Yees apothecary.<br>Finally, if youre going to Brooklyn at any point, be sure to take the Q train (espically at night). Not because its safer or anything, but because it heads over the bridge and its view coming in is fucking gorgoues", "time": 1672937065, "resto": 2382110}, {"no": 2384820, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:13:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2383791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2383791</a><br>It&#039;s not sports it&#039;s negrow worship.

You can do the same at the themed Vegas Strip casinos for free.<br><br>I think most of the general public doesn&#039;t care about theming. They&#039;re there for the rides. Disney World fans make a big deal about the resort as a whole and the non-park aspects, but none of that would exist without the theme parks. Over half of the parks are 1 day visitors from off property. They&#039;re not there to walk around and people watch, ride a couple rides and go back to the hotel, they&#039;re there all day to ride as many rides as possible. Coasters being among the most popular rides whether they&#039;re themed or not.<br><br>I think a little theming helps.

Disney at least reliably meet a minimum standard, on and off season.<br><br>Special offers.

Before I moved here, I&#039;d visited multiple times per year for over a decade. My feelings for this country could be characterized as akin to a love-hate relationship. Outside of its cities, India is an extraordinarily beautiful country. People tend to be friendly, the cost-of-living is low, and there&#039;s a lot to see and do. <br><br>Sexual violence and street-side harassment, or &quot;eve-teasing,&quot; are genuine concerns. However, eve-teasing is also a somewhat localized phenomenon, insofar as the problem is far worse in a handful of northern states and cities than it is elsewhere. Still, if your girlfriend is White, you can expect some level of discomfort. <br><br>I don&#039;t really have any expat friends, and I don&#039;t regularly come across other foreigners in my city. From the handful of White chicks I&#039;ve talked to in recent years, harassment seems to be pretty hit and miss--some girls have gotten groped or nearly raped, while most others didn&#039;t have complaints beyond mundane selfie harassment at tourist sites and monuments (f.e., I just took an American friend to the Taj Mahal--we were taking pictures a few feet from a European-looking woman, who went apeshit after the 20th guy in 10 minutes asked for a picture). <br><br>(for what it&#039;s worth--the one White girl I know who was &quot;almost raped&#039; had gotten piss-drunk with a group of random men she&#039;d met a shitty nightclub and then invited them to her hotel room for an &quot;afterparty.&quot; No Indian women would ever do that unless she was actually looking to get trained) <br><br>Personally, I--as a man--have rarely felt unsafe while traveling in India. Just took picrel today in rural Jharkhand. Stopped and talked to a bunch of tribal people along the trails and paths. They were all pretty jolly. Either didn&#039;t give a shit that I was there, or were extraordinarily friendly and happy to chat.

And it sounds like you\u2019re at least starting to make a plan, which is good. My biggest piece of additional advice as you keep thinking things through is this, and I think it is extremely important: <br><br>You probably have (or will soon have) some estimate in your head of how much money you will be bringing with you when you arrive. However much money that is, double it, at least, before you get on the plane. Even in low-COL countries, initial outlays are going to be more than you think they will be, and you\u2019re certain to run into expenses you weren\u2019t anticipating at all. Housing, for example, even in poor countries, is almost always more expensive for foreigners who don\u2019t have local connections. It will be especially expensive if you are arriving without legal, long-term residency (for example, just showing up in a country that lets your nationality in visa-free for 90 days, or six months, or even a year). Without some kind of residency document, you\u2019re not likely to be able to sign a normal lease, so at least at first you will probably be stuck with short-term accommodations aimed at foreigners. These are going to be more expensive than whatever locals pay in rent, so even if you research average rents in your arrival city you won\u2019t get an accurate picture of what it will really cost YOU.<br><br>Getting legally established is gong to cost more than you think it will, as well, almost without question. If you eventually change your visa status, you may be required to return to your home country to finalize the process at an embassy. You\u2019ll get your new visa only when you come back, so you\u2019ll want to budget for at least one trip home. MAYBE you will be able to get the paperwork done in-country, or maybe you\u2019ll just have to hop a border to a neighboring country, but don\u2019t count on it. Budget for the most expensive of these possibilities to avoid shock.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cont\u2019d</span>", "time": 1673435043, "resto": 2387906}, {"no": 2388307, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)06:24:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2388301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2388301</a><br>It\u2019s also unwise to compare whatever money you expect to be earning (online, with your future business, etc.) with average local incomes, or worse yet, with GDP per capita, which is practically meaningless. Maybe the average local is only earning $XXXX per year. He\u2019s also living with his extended family in a home owned by his grandparents and spending less on food than you will ever know how to, so even if you are bringing in $XXXX x 2 per year you aren\u2019t going to be as rich as you think you are.

Due to low stakes on /trv/ (we don&#039;t have people trying to raid, no doxxing, no pedopornography and we have one of the slowest board on the chan), i suppose /trv/ can only be on the bottom of that list, so reports are taken care of after a while because nobody ever fucking reports shit (whereas a pedo post can be reported a 100 times). However they ARE taken care of. Every report that i&#039;ve sent that rigorously violates the board&#039;s rules has been removed. None have been disregarded. <br>And since we don&#039;t have a janitor looking around our threads in a daily fashion that only means that it is up to us to regulate the threads by reporting the shitposters. <br>As for the reason why this thread stands, a former janitor (whose infos concur with an obscure vice article that leaked info about 4chan&#039;s internal moderation so i think it&#039;s true) has posted on reddit that 4chan&#039;s current team tends to loathe removing threads with many responses.
