Australia is not so great for long distance train travel, we don&#039;t have high speed trains like Europe or Asia. So a simple trip from Sydney to Melbourne can take like 11 or 12 hours by train, whereas it takes 90 minutes in the air. For this reason most people fly, only poorfags or very elderly people take the train. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do some flights between capitals cost less than some trains/ferries?</span><br>Train and coach are usually cheap. But flights are reasonable because plenty of competition, lots of available seats and demand. Of course it also depends on the route and the time of the year. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are busses a better option than trains?</span><br>I&#039;ve never been interstate on train so I can&#039;t make a good comparison. But when I was a poorfag student I did go down to Melbourne via coach and it was an overnight trip, it took about 12 hours. The bus make about two stops along the way at big roadside petrol station/truckstops. So you can get off the bus, stretch your legs, take a piss and buy a snack.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What occurs at interstate checkpoints and how much time is wasted at them?</span><br>Nothing. If you fly the only &#039;checkpoint&#039; as such will be airport security. If you drive then it is pretty much nothing. Sometimes between NSW and QLD they warn you not to bring in fresh fruit from interstate, but I&#039;ve never actually seen a roadside checkpoint enforcing this. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how much money can I carry onto a plane</span><br>When you enter Australia as an international passenger then you will need to declare if you are carrying more than $10,000 in cash, cabin crew will give you an incoming passenger card on your arriving flight and the card will tell you what you need to declare. Once you are in Australia and travelling between states on domestic flights then I&#039;m not aware of any limits on cash.", "time": 1670235126, "resto": 2366333}, {"no": 2368087, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)05:20:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2366400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2366400</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what level of sussing you out do they even do for domestic flights?</span><br>You pass through security, hand luggage, wallet, phone, laptop etc will go into a plastic bucket and through the x-ray.

A security pajeet may approach you and ask to swab your hands and bag for residue, this takes a minute. Once that is done then you are airside and can wait at the boarding gate, there is usually no further security.

IME, this has far less to do with xenophobia than the Indian government&#039;s requirement that hotels file reports--Form C--whenever they host foreign guests. These reports have to be filed with the nearest police station within 24 hours of the guest&#039;s arrival. <br><br>Nowadays, hotels and guesthouses can fill out Form C online, but you still have to create an account and spend about ~5 minutes entering the traveler&#039;s information. A lot of lower-budget facilities either don&#039;t know how to do it or receive so few foreign guests that they won&#039;t bother.<br><br>Nevertheless, you can typically find homestays and budget hotels for $5-$12 per night, depending on the area and amenities. It&#039;s typically best to search options in advance, since showing up in town and searching for a place doesn&#039;t always work out.

Sapphire had the most aggressive strippers I&#039;ve ever met, some of them started swarming me as soon as I walked in and just wouldn&#039;t take a very firm &quot;NO&quot; for an answer. The girl I went to Vegas with that time was a stripper in another state, she practically had to yell at the Sapphire stripper to leave us alone. &quot;Look, I&#039;m a dancer too, I know how it is, but we are NOT buying a dance!&quot;<br><br>If you want to hit a good strip club, the Palimino Club is your best bet. It&#039;s the only club that allows alcohol and has full nudity. Sit at the stage, tip a dollar a song, and drink. If you sit at the bar or somewhere besides the stage you&#039;ll have a lot of girls coming up to your trying to sell dances (they&#039;re never been aggressive like the bitches at Sapphire though, holy shit) if you just want to hit a crazy club and have fun, go to Chicas Bonitas. It&#039;s mostly frequented by local Hispanics and tourists don&#039;t usually go there. The girls aren&#039;t the hottest but they&#039;re pretty chill and it&#039;s fun place to hang out, drink, and see some boobs.<br><br><a href=\"#p2359533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2359533</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;globalhomo</span><br>Go back.

The park itself is actually quite large, and the mountain is not near the tourist zone (which is on the highway). If you want to go the mountain, typically you&#039;d either drive on the backroads (they&#039;re dirt mostly I thinK), or take a park bus. There are 1 or 2 resorts there, and they&#039;ll have electricity, running water, internet, etc. They&#039;re quite expensive though ($300+/night?). The tourist zone only operates in summer months; complete ghost town in the winter (also wouldn&#039;t recommend driving the road between anchorage/fairbanks in the winter unless you&#039;re experienced, it&#039;s remote, no cell connection, and cold, ie dangerous.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How affordable is it to visit Alaska?</span><br>Assuming leaving from SF, LA, Seattle, or Portland, round trip flight to anchorage is like $400 economy? Hotels are probably cheaper than what you&#039;d find in downtown major cities in US, maybe $80-$200/night. Food is probably slightly more expensive than any other metro US area. Though, significantly cheaper than other northern cities you&#039;d find in canada, europe, etc. Attractions are mostly outdoors and free, though I believe DNP requires a park pass? Not sure, one isn&#039;t needed if you stay in tourist/highway corridor. Rental cars are expensive as fuck. Like $100/day or more.<br>Public transit outside of the Anchorage and Fairbanks metro areas is basically non-existent, with the exception of the Alaska Railroad, which you should probably look into. It&#039;s not super cheap, but it operates all along the Seward Highway, through Anchorage and up to DNP and to Fairbanks.
