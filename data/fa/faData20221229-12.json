I don&#039;t want a harsher cleanser if I am to use twice a day, but surely there are better choices for the rest in regards to the fact that I have acne.

Admittedly skincare has been a process of trial and error for me but I&#039;ve been into this stuff for like nine years haha. It sounds like you&#039;re at a good starting point (props to you for using sunscreen). If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what is your goal through using retinol? Differin (as opposed to other &quot;retinol&quot; products) would be your best OTC bet for things like acne.<br>If you&#039;re keen on oil cleansing, I would recommend using an oil cleanser in place of coconut oil and following up with a water-based cleanser. People who oil cleanse usually only do it at night. It&#039;s helped me a lot with blackheads personally. Products marketed as cleansing oils contain emulsifying agents, which help them wash off your skin (unlike straight-up oil). Coconut oil can be very comedogenic as well.<br>Some people really like Vitamin C and/or niacinamide for acne spots, but I&#039;m not using either at the moment. In my opinion, it&#039;s best to be patient with the retinization process and refrain from adding additional actives in the meantime. Emphasize hydration if you get any skin flakes or irritation. You&#039;re off to a great start.<br><a href=\"#p17393939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393939</a><br>The Ordinary&#039;s claims surrounding Vitamin C and niacinamide have been debunked, but I recommend skipping Vitamin C for now because it can be sensitizing (especially in its ascorbic acid form). That stuff can be really rough on your skin if used too often.

You know nothing about being a woman. The itch you&#039;re trying to scratch won&#039;t be helped by you transitioning. If you&#039;re autistic, keep in mind that you&#039;re literally born with severe self-perception issues and will likely have them forever. It&#039;s not that your body is yearning to transition, it&#039;s that your autism literally prevents you from ever being fully at peace with yourself, your emotions, and with the world around you. You&#039;re harming your own body forever, just to try on a band-aid fix that does nothing to address the root cause. Transsexualism hasn&#039;t been studied nearly enough for science to conclusively say that yes, you should get on HRT and cut your dick off.<br>You&#039;re probably young and you&#039;ve got your whole life ahead of you. Don&#039;t fuck it up now. Go to therapy and talk about whatever it is that&#039;s causing this, whether it be childhood abuse, childhood sexual trauma, autism, porn addiction, or whatever.<br>To add, I don&#039;t hate trannies. I&#039;m just really annoyed by the really autistic ones on Twitter that can&#039;t stop talking about being trans (since it&#039;s their hyperfixation). I do however hate the &quot;scientists&quot; who can&#039;t see that retardedly approving body-altering and mind-altering medicines and treatments without proper testing is dangerous and will lead to mass suicides.

Not all trans people experience dysphoria because of autism so transitioning may as such be a good option for them, but most trans people I&#039;ve talked to usually had other unresolved issues that contributed to their dysphoria. They were usually social outcasts when young, often times addicted to the internet, very rarely had any kind of relationship experience, and were usually raised by a single mother.<br>The truth is that transgender people are 11 times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than the general population. That&#039;s huge, and indicative of a larger problem, a problem so large that we should await further studies until we give out HRT willy-nilly. Autistic people struggle severely with understanding and expressing their own emotions.

Learn to read my fucking post before you engage with it. Why are you so keen on defending companies that siphon thousands of dollars from vulnerable people? The modern trans movement hasn&#039;t been around for nearly as long as it needs to for us to know enough about gender dysphoria and why it&#039;s so especially prevalent in autistic people, so why blindly trust treatments developed by capitalist vultures?

For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t have autism and I didn\u2019t have any developmental trauma which may have spurred me to transition. Rather, I\u2019d just known since being very young that I hated being a boy and always related to and wanted to be female. I transitioned at 23 after a terrible few years of depression and anxiety that no amount of SSRIs or therapy could help. About a month on HRT made me brighter, more peaceful, and happier than I\u2019d been since I was a child. For some of us, it is genuinely life-saving medication. I get that people hate us because some of us transition late or because of a fetish and end up looking freakish and horrible. I think there should be gatekeeping, and that people should have to exhibit deep, embedded dysphoria before being prescribed HRT. I also think there should be a way to screen for those who have mistaken another mental disorder for dysphoria, such as those with autism or OCD. <br><br>With all that being said, this is a conversation that should be led from the bottom-up, by trans people, to make sure that genuine trans people get proper care. I\u2019m very uncomfortable with your tone, and the tone of other \u2018concerned bystanders\u2019, who are almost always cis people who disapprove of *all* trans people and are simply gatekeeping as a means of indiscriminately reducing the overall population. Ultimately, the best way to prevent people from wrongly transitioning is to actually put aside hate and dislike of trans people, and actually fund proper healthcare and proper research on transsexualism.

Sure, why not, but it might be a turn off to some women for a guy to be into certain kinds of music like metal or something. Generally having interests is a good thing, but it depends on how you express it. If you&#039;re into fashion but have basic taste, then maybe it won&#039;t be clocked that you&#039;re into fashion but you still look well put together so that&#039;s a plus, or you could be a cringe lord and be into dark academia which would be an automatic turn off for most women. A lot of women seem to enjoy when a guy have a personal style of his own rather than falling into a genre/niche or a trend, but maybe some women that are explicitly into fashion would like a guy that follows the trends. It just depends on the woman.

Da Fu shoes have a thinner sole for martial artists and used to make them with a green triangle but have started making them with the red circle like Feiyue recently. However, Shanghai Da Fu merged with a company called Top One that also makes these shoes, still with a green triangle and they are much more flexible than the others with a thin sole, but are uglier.
