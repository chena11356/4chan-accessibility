The second most damaging thing when it comes to frag lifespans are the reformulations by the manufacturers.

It is still a warm jacket, so unless you live in a place that&#039;s very cold year round, it&#039;ll be a winter jacket. It&#039;s up to you to decide if it&#039;s worth the money in this case. Also bear in mind that leather jackets are not good for rain, so if you live in a place with mild but rainy winters, I wouldn&#039;t pick this jacket.<br>Hope this helps.", "filename": "z2102m-marion-side-landscape_1080x", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671183088744361, "time": 1671183088, "md5": "bvlRSAZcxt90majlHDVRTw==", "fsize": 165486, "resto": 17394197}, {"no": 17394805, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:35:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17394238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17394238</a><br>how can it be warm if it has no hood", "time": 1671183305, "resto": 17394197}, {"no": 17394816, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:48:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Keep in mind that RMC fits rather slim in general.

At best the product or service produced is cool, but the *image* of a brand being cool -- no way man. There is nothing cool to me about having an Apple computer, a Gucci bag, Fendi shoes, Dolce and Gabbanna pants, beyond the functional purpose and aesthetics of those products themselves. People who wear brand names emblazoned on their clothes -- &quot;Guess Jeans&quot;, &quot;The North Face&quot; -- you are walking billboards. You *are paying that company* for the privilege of advertising their goods! How little must you think of yourself to not only give this service for free -- but pay for it!<br><br>Advertisements themselves -- I believe have a deliterious affect on human psychology. Television, internet, radio, signs, even email advertisements are constantly assaulting our senses, sight and hearing with things to buy -- trying to convince us using humor, sex and style that we will be better after trading our money for what they are selling. I am completely intolerant of advertisements in any form -- I change the radio in the car when an ad comes on, I don&#039;t watch television and I always have an ad blocker on my browser when using the web, I paid an extra $20 to remove ads from my Kindle ebook -- I really hate ads.<br><br>Now back to watches -- How much of a fucking narcassist does a watch maker need to be to put his fucking name on the watch face?? They want you to subconsciously see their name every fucking time you check the time! How often is that? fifteen, fifty times a day? This is after you pay potentially hundreds of dollars for the watch?? I will not be coerced to worship a brand -- especially a watch. And I will not advertise it to others who see my wrist. A brand of clothing or watch is not *my* brand and as such it needs to shut the hell up about who made it -- because otherwise it&#039;s off brand -- off *my* brand.", "time": 1671138017, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393909, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:00:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "rolex explorer is such an ugly pos", "time": 1671138022, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393912, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:01:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393908</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;he&#039;s wearing a watch with easily visible logos</span><br>thats almost every successful watch brand", "time": 1671138062, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393914, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:02:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393909</a><br>it looks a bit too plain for me but its still very nice", "time": 1671138122, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393915, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;thats almost every successful watch brand</span>", "filename": "17fba4s7m25a1", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671138123061966, "time": 1671138123, "md5": "bs/VR404nDzLTVm6AJ/cHw==", "fsize": 1275101, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393916, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:02:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393914</a><br>datejust is better. if i see an explorer it&#039;s always some old used 2006 piece of shit", "time": 1671138171, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393917, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:03:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393915</a><br>uhh are you just proving my point?

I pulled the trigger and they arrived today. Here are my first impressions if someone is interested.<br>The seller said they had worn them for a short stroll and I guess they weren&#039;t lying. They came with perfect outsoles, no creasing nor scruffs, so it&#039;s like I bought them brand new, or as close as possible to that.<br>Out of the box these blow any other leather sneaker I&#039;ve seen, tried or owned. The leather is thick and rough but nice to the touch. There&#039;s no loose threads nor gaps anywhere, the construction looks to me as solid as it can be.<br>Regarding sizing, I got a 10US/43EU. My feet are 275mm long and I normally wear a size 10US in sneakers and 9.5 on dress shoes. For the record, I own a pair of Red Wing Beckmans in 9D. The counter adjusts perfectly to my calf, the widest par of the shoe and the toe box is roomy, even considering that my feet are a bit wide for my usual size, I still normally wear a D width, but I have trouble getting my proper size in shoes that have a slender design. What I mean is that these sneakers are a bit wider than expected, which is the opposite of a problem for me specifically.<br>They came with two pairs of shoelaces, one cotton pair which is nothing special, and a leather pair. The leather shoelaces are a bit thinner than expected, which makes me question how much traction they can hold, since the shoes are fairly rigid and I really have to pull to close them properly.<br>Which leads me to question which market Thursday wanted to tackle with this shoe. They&#039;re too rigid out of the box and not confortable from the got go as any other sneaker -and mall-tier boots-, but they&#039;re to light and fall short when compared to proper boots.

Doing short-fiber burst exercises like 3x6 reps of high intensity causes you to develop strength-oriented musculature, which as it happens is naturally voluminous (with some conflicting evidence). Endurance exercises are the opposite (e.g. 5x12 reps for weights), but more importantly tend to use full-body or compound exercises, so the growth in musculature is divided over a set of many smaller muscles, instead of concentrating a lot of development onto one or two major ones (which will make you look beefy, even though the tinier muscles are underdeveloped).<br>The other major part, which you are probably already doing, is streamlining your diet. Muscle is interwoven with fat, and if you less body fat, your muscles will be similarly denser.", "time": 1670441718, "resto": 17376496}, {"no": 17380808, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)15:12:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17380754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17380754</a><br>it seems that,for once,Baki got body science right<br>copious reps of weights will reduce both muscle mass and fat", "filename": "pepe-gets-excited", "ext": ".gif", "w": 840, "h": 488, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1670443969256029, "time": 1670443969, "md5": "5b4N2NpG72zAK7/bOBFaxQ==", "fsize": 522989, "resto": 17376496}, {"no": 17380822, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)15:22:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17380808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17380808</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Baki</span><br>?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reduce ... muscle mass</span><br>How does that work?

There have been bracelets found in Russia that are thought to be over 40,000 years old. Bangles are an important part of some marriage ceremonies throughout the world. While ancient Egyptians wore bracelets on their wrists, it is not thought there was much significance for this other than fashion. Greek soldiers wore leather bracelets to protect their wrists and it became a traditional part of their military uniform. Bracelets were popular for both men and women until The Middle Ages when they became an accessory worn mainly by women. Bracelets re-emerged as an extremely fashionable accessory for women in the 17th century. During the 20th century, men often began wearing bracelets again, although they were typically more simple and singular, whereas many women wore multiple bracelets of all different styles.</span>", "time": 1671095533, "resto": 17393168}, {"no": 17393174, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:19:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393168</a><br>wtf does he even meat by eat stew? is stew supposed to be some super masculine food?<br>it&#039;s bullshit anyway because people do eat stew they just eat non-european stew: many curries etc are just stews from different parts of the world<br>&quot;stew&quot; is just any stewed food<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cooked slowly in liquid in a closed dish or pan.</span><br><br>personally i dislike bracelets and watches because i find them uncomfortable and they pluck out my arm hairs", "time": 1671095960, "resto": 17393168}, {"no": 17393179, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:22:45", "name": "invicta spongebob edition", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393174</a><br>It&#039;s literally schizoposting but verified checkmark edition.

With its catamite blend of pinesol enema&#039;d bussy and fresh notes, this perfume exudes submission and bashfulness, the very qualities that define traditional power bottom mindset. But don&#039;t just take my word for it - try it for yourself and you&#039;ll see why this is the go-to fragrance for the most flaming homosexual men out there.<br><br>But let&#039;s be real here - not everyone is going to agree with me. In fact, some people might say that a person&#039;s sexuality has nothing to do with the scent they wear. And to those people, I say this: you&#039;re wrong. Because when you smell Bois Imperial, you can&#039;t help but feel a certain naval buttfucking aura that is undeniable. It&#039;s a scent that commands attention and demands one be bent over and spread like a hunk of ripe roast beef, and that&#039;s exactly what homosexual men are all about. <br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking that this is all just marketing hype and that Bois Imperial is just another perfume like any other. But that&#039;s where you&#039;re mistaken. Because this fragrance has been specially crafted to appeal to the most homosexual of shill posters, and it shows in every single note. From the robust cedarwood and green moss at the top, to the spicy heart of spicy notes and sage, to the deep, sensual base of sandalwood and amber, Bois Imperial is a scent that is truly and unapologetically homosexual. No amount of grainy phone screencaps can deny it. <br><br>So if you want to embrace your homosexuality and show the world that you&#039;re a man ready for a hot, sweaty Turkish bathhouse, then look no further than Bois Imperial, preferably layered with Al Rahab Dakar.

I can only answer this question for Germany, though. First you want to compare prices through idealo.de, billiger.de or geizhals.de and then set up alerts when a certain price has been reached. These websites offer tracking of prices over a range of time, so you can see how low the price has dropped in the past. Second you want to go to mydealz.de and set alerts for certain fragrances (or fragrances in general). Those prices there are sometimes unique due to certain coupon codes not showing up on the price tracking websites. <br>If you&#039;re not from Germany, there usually is something equivalent, and if there isn&#039;t, you should start an e-commerce business which does exactly that.<br><br><a href=\"#p17392982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17392982</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;agua di gio isn\u2019t worth 200 dollars</span><br>This is what happens when you don&#039;t track prices and wait for deals.<br><br><a href=\"#p17393154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393154</a><br>They do not.

The main offender are, of course, impurities in certain chemicals. No frag maker knowingly puts endocrine disruptors into their fragrances. The main impurities people are worried about are usually phthalates, and not every fragrance compound uses chemicals which are at a risk of having phthalates as impurities. Of course you can&#039;t know that, because frag makers keep the formula a secret. Natural materials (essential oils etc.) are even worse and can contain up to 10% of phthalates.
