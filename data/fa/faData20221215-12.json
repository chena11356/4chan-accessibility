With its catamite blend of pinesol enema&#039;d bussy and fresh notes, this perfume exudes submission and bashfulness, the very qualities that define traditional power bottom mindset. But don&#039;t just take my word for it - try it for yourself and you&#039;ll see why this is the go-to fragrance for the most flaming homosexual men out there.<br><br>But let&#039;s be real here - not everyone is going to agree with me. In fact, some people might say that a person&#039;s sexuality has nothing to do with the scent they wear. And to those people, I say this: you&#039;re wrong. Because when you smell Bois Imperial, you can&#039;t help but feel a certain naval buttfucking aura that is undeniable. It&#039;s a scent that commands attention and demands one be bent over and spread like a hunk of ripe roast beef, and that&#039;s exactly what homosexual men are all about. <br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking that this is all just marketing hype and that Bois Imperial is just another perfume like any other. But that&#039;s where you&#039;re mistaken. Because this fragrance has been specially crafted to appeal to the most homosexual of shill posters, and it shows in every single note. From the robust cedarwood and green moss at the top, to the spicy heart of spicy notes and sage, to the deep, sensual base of sandalwood and amber, Bois Imperial is a scent that is truly and unapologetically homosexual. No amount of grainy phone screencaps can deny it. <br><br>So if you want to embrace your homosexuality and show the world that you&#039;re a man ready for a hot, sweaty Turkish bathhouse, then look no further than Bois Imperial, preferably layered with Al Rahab Dakar. It&#039;s the ultimate scent for the ultimate faggot.", "filename": "right....", "ext": ".png", "w": 338, "h": 230, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1670902245933324, "time": 1670902245, "md5": "bIpKXSDsH/FrPdrRyQy/rA==", "fsize": 98079, "resto": 17389236}, {"no": 17389302, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)22:39:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How do you guys know all these fragrances?

I can only answer this question for Germany, though. First you want to compare prices through idealo.de, billiger.de or geizhals.de and then set up alerts when a certain price has been reached. These websites offer tracking of prices over a range of time, so you can see how low the price has dropped in the past. Second you want to go to mydealz.de and set alerts for certain fragrances (or fragrances in general). Those prices there are sometimes unique due to certain coupon codes not showing up on the price tracking websites. <br>If you&#039;re not from Germany, there usually is something equivalent, and if there isn&#039;t, you should start an e-commerce business which does exactly that.<br><br><a href=\"#p17392982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17392982</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;agua di gio isn\u2019t worth 200 dollars</span><br>This is what happens when you don&#039;t track prices and wait for deals.<br><br><a href=\"#p17393154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393154</a><br>They do not.

The main offender are, of course, impurities in certain chemicals. No frag maker knowingly puts endocrine disruptors into their fragrances. The main impurities people are worried about are usually phthalates, and not every fragrance compound uses chemicals which are at a risk of having phthalates as impurities. Of course you can&#039;t know that, because frag makers keep the formula a secret. Natural materials (essential oils etc.) are even worse and can contain up to 10% of phthalates.

The only reason people would dress fashionably is to impress themselves or those who are &quot;in the know&quot; about whatever pieces you decide to wear. There&#039;s a clear distinction between &quot;dressing nicely&quot; and &quot;dressing fashionably&quot;: Anyone can dress nicely. They can throw on a dress shirt, some chinos or whatever, and the majority of people would say they&#039;re dressed well or nicely. Compare that to people who enjoy fashion as a hobby and can deliberately understand the quality of their outfit and other factors such as matching.

Then by day 2, 3, maybe 4, it finally builds up enough natural oils to moisturize it and settle it down, the hair becomes more obedient.<br>Well because you don&#039;t strip all the oils off, you never go into that state, so you are always like on day 2, 3 after a wash.<br>It&#039;s also very easy to adjust how much oil you strip.<br>Warmer water, strips off more oil. Cooler water less. Cold water thats unpleasant practically doesn&#039;t remove any, just the excess.<br>Another benefit is that you never have to fuzz about having your special shampoo on hand.

I can do better with lots of water, zero sugar, zero alcohol, (and I do these things), but the steroid cream is the only thing that actually truly works rather than mildly reducing symptoms. Looking at the posts above, I will give Alterra Execalm a try and sunflower oil as well.

I&#039;ve been taking bleach baths as well, which is a commonly recommended home treatment, but it CAN&#039;T be good for my skin. When my skin gets dry it flakes like something out of a movie. ALL the skin dries and comes off, I should take pictures because you&#039;d need to see it to believe it. But the second I get back on the steroids, all better.
