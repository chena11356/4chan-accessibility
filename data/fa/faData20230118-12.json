order to stay relevant and feasible in a world saturated with sloppiness and athleisure. <br><br>Hence the current trend of combining classic menswear pieces with vintage/high end denim, military-derived garments (fatigues with double breasted blazers, etc.), vintage inspired sportswear (rugbys) and workwear (lots of gorpcore&#039;ish outerwear in place of overcoats, fleece vests and pullovers, western shirts and flannels underneath suits, etc.).<br><br>tl;dr: straight leg, high-rise denim is totally cool with blazers and coats cause they don&#039;t make you stick out like a sore

As someone who owns a few of these, he literally could not be any more honest than he was. Said they were seriously awesome flannels, but horrendously overpriced. The same could be said for his review of the John Lofgren engineer boots. A gorgeous boot with an arguably perfect toe profile and immaculate detail with stitching, but seems to have issues with sizing and ultimately being able to get your foot past the pass through of the boot shaft. As for your dilemma, do your research on certain boots that appeal to you in terms of it&#039;s appearance and whether it would reasonably be able to blend well with most outfits, and then look into whether those boots have legitimately good construction quality such as its welt construction (double stitch down or goodyear welt at a minimum), quality of leather, and stitching on the uppers (double to triple stitching at a minimum).", "filename": "4968739487634", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 590, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1673322100682619, "time": 1673322100, "md5": "O6SbZlqz1s+Iw+ZAi9tDgw==", "fsize": 72435, "resto": 17430338}, {"no": 17434900, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)09:23:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17434446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17434446</a><br>murawski is the biggest poser in existance<br>there is no other guy that wants to be blue-collar as desperate as he<br>he changed his story on what job he does like 3-4 times<br>this whole fake persona is pathetic larping<br>besides he is absolutely not objective, he takes sponsorship money from the brands he recommends<br>he has this demented obsession with &quot;made in the usa&quot;, to the point where he will always have to denegrate white&#039;s boots, made 100% in spokane washington btw, just because they are owned by a japanese conglomerate<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why would you buy them, part of your money doesn&#039;t stay in the usa and goes to the greedy japanese, trying to cut corners on construction wherever they can</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dude just buy nicks instead, bro, you definitely don&#039;t pay an upcharge for their absolutely predatory viral marketing budget, that indirectly goes to me, because i get sponsored by them constantly, like every boot tuber in existance, not really going to disclose that when i recommend their boots in every video btw</span>", "time": 1673360627, "resto": 17430338}, {"no": 17435703, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)20:14:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17430338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17430338</a><br>A true rockstar, he almost looks like Elvis!", "time": 1673399696, "resto": 17430338}, {"no": 17435778, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)21:25:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My Chunk reference was to Aerosurfer.

All of what you just wrote right here proves that you have never ACTUALLY bought and worn a more valuable pair of heavy japanese denim. Before getting into the heavier selvedge, I used to exclusively wear APC until I walked into one of the Self Edge shops and tried on a pair of Iron Hearts and immediately realized that those jeans would undoubtedly last three times the lifetime than a pair of APCs. I have been very active in these jeans for a couple years now (bike riding, lifting in the jeans) and they have not blown out. On top of that, the richness of color within raw indigo jeans is something that APC cannot even compete with, and the fact that japanese companies have a large selection of different fits compared to standard skinny/slim twink femboi fits that APC seems to only offer proves that there is no competition. Bro, quit swallowing all the shallow bullshit that miserable faggots on this board push around about japanese denim. There&#039;s always a large swatch of miserable seething losers on this website whenever someone posts about some higher quality item of their particular hobby. For example, pathetic losers on the /mu/ will bitch and moan about how Gibson guitars are somehow actually shitty and you are spending way too much money whenever you buy a Les Paul. The funny part about all this shit is these people guaranteed have never actually boughten a Gibson and are unconsciously just jealous of those who can afford one, so they have to hide their jealousy by acting like those who can afford one are actually stupid.", "filename": "IMG_1878", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1573, "h": 3387, "tn_w": 58, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673836534707117, "time": 1673836534, "md5": "TcNaJMwPsbZjImkWDnjAvQ==", "fsize": 1678385, "resto": 17430338}, {"no": 17443626, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)21:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17443600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17443600</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hey guys, I play guitar blah blah blah.</span><br>Opinion discarded.", "filename": "Larry Kravitz", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 473, "h": 708, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673837671434664, "time": 1673837671, "md5": "1AkajC/9pEoRQRn0geRH3Q==", "fsize": 169148, "resto": 17430338}, {"no": 17443632, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)21:57:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17443626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17443626</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon gets direct response to their main argument</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doesn&#039;t know how to respond</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Resorts to red herring remarks </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;omg so fuckin based </span><br>Kill yourself", "time": 1673837828, "resto": 17430338}, {"no": 17443655, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:04:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17430338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17430338</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What are some /fa/-approved raw denim fits?</span><br>These just plain do not fit the guy. <br><a href=\"#p17434268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17434268</a><br>I don&#039;t think this guy in the photo knows how clothing works.<br><a href=\"#p17437519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17437519</a><br>I like this point about reality vs fantasy but what if you had some really cool boots to start with. <br><a href=\"#p17443012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17443012</a><br>I like that he doesn&#039;t look overly styled but has a cohesive look.", "time": 1673838296, "resto": 17430338}, {"no": 17443666, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:17:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My kingdom for fancy 36\u201d inseam jeans that don\u2019t shrink.

It should go without saying, but we do buy much more clothes than people did in the past, it&#039;s just that they are much cheaper than they have ever been.

Most of your basic stuff sounds fine though. Graphic tees can be a bit childish or stupid depending on the design so you could replace those with plain. I like oversized t-shirts or jackets but tighter stuff works too if you think it flatters your body.<br><br>If you want to go fancier than that, you could check out the &quot;academia&quot; aesthetics. Stuff like turtlenecks, knit sweaters, chinos, shorts, button down shirts can all look normal but feminine depending on the cut and sizing.

I think that tighter shirts can seem more &quot;twink&quot; than &quot;girly&quot; if you have a normal male body with wider shoulders than hips, but either is fine if you like it. I don&#039;t recommend wider pants because they hide your butt and they make short ppls legs look shorter imo. You want to ideally make your legs look longer and your torso look less long.<br><br>For clothes since you are short and skinny there are a lot of options that could look feminine without seeming tranny. Basically anything outside of dresses or skirts might be good. Also avoid anything that emphasizes your shoulders ofc. Plain t shirts look classier than graphic tees and turtlenecks can be very nice.

As a little summary:<br><br>white/gray/beige/brown/olive/navy are very versatile. You can pair them with most other colors. black isn&#039;t actually as versatile as the rest of these but it&#039;s still pretty reliable. It will just be higher contrast with most colors than gray or navy would be.<br><br>Avoid wearing colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel in op. These are complimentary colors, and they make each other stand out a lot regardless of the exact shade of those colors. This is why Christmas is red-green, sports teams have blue-orange or purple-yellow, etc. It is very hard to not look like you&#039;re wearing a costume with these colors together.<br><br>Saturation is important too. This is how &quot;strong&quot; a color is. Regular red is saturated, but burgundy and pastel pink are more muted colors with the same hue but lower saturation. The more natural contrast you have, the bolder colors you can use in outfits. The Congo dandies have very dark skin and hair so they can pull off the bright suits. But a pale, light haired person would look retarded in the same suit because the hair+skin are less contrasting and less saturated. So if you are paler you should stick to less saturated color choices, with some saturated color as a statement. If you are darker then pastels probably would look a bit worse on you. Also black is considered &quot;saturated&quot; compared to gray and navy, but it&#039;s still safer than bright colors by far. <br><br>Color schemes also help, but those are sort of hard to explain. After a while of looking at good combinations you &quot;just know&quot;. Some example color schemes are monochromatic (usually all black/gray/white is best), warm or cool colors (red-yellow-orange or green-blue-purple), pastels, triadic colors (the ones that form a triangle in the color wheel), and more.

It&#039;s not at all a lesbian thing. It started as a &quot;boyfriend&quot; shirt thing where girls were wearing their boyfriends clothing and it&#039;d be too big for them, and then guys liked the look and made it work in a different way. There&#039;s a lot of reasons its a thing, but there isn&#039;t at all a lesbian thing. The lesbian look that comes from wearing coveralls is the concept of a working woman in a trade, because a woman that works in a trade is generally thought to be fairly butch and masculine, and there are a lot of butch masculine lesbians looking for petite lesbians. Workwear in general is going to be associated with butch lesbians unless you can wear it in a cute and trendy way, but that involves understanding styling and accessorizing with beanies and jewelry.<br>Where ever I go shopping I see women in the men&#039;s section. Often times men&#039;s clothing isn&#039;t explicitly masculine, it&#039;s just often not feminine, it&#039;s more or less neutral because a lot of guys don&#039;t want to express anything with their clothing.<br>Tasteful oversizing is when something is specifically made as an oversized garment. Like many different retailers make things and will label it as oversized.
