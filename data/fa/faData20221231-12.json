I&#039;m middle aged, this is a perfect romantic/date night fragrance for me.<br>This will sound crazy but the 1986 smells like a bar, and multiple people wearing different fragrances inside the bar, but in a good way. There&#039;s a boozy rum cocktail smell, aged rum and red and stone fruits, plus the smell of the barrel itself. There&#039;s the smell of fresh tobacco, smells just like how opening a fresh pack of Marlboro reds used to smell. There&#039;s a faint leather smell like a well worn jacket. And then there&#039;s combinations of notes that my brain reads as other distinct fragrances. There&#039;s a strong myrrh note, combined with patchouli and amber and it smells exactly like the drydown of Prada Amber Homme intense. Then there&#039;s a strong musk, vanilla and oakmoss combo that smells like the drydown of a typical barbershop fragrance, but I&#039;m picking this up at the same time as the Prada smell, and all of them together with the boozy bar and tobacco smell.<br>But it doesn&#039;t smell disjointed or unnatural, it smells like walking past two people in a bar wearing fragrances the smell nice and somehow it all smells nice together.<br>Most fragrances smell nice, it&#039;s rare to find one that displays such imagination to come up with a concept and the technical mastery to execute the idea.<br>I know what I&#039;m saying probably sounds nuts, that&#039;s fine. I&#039;m not saying go buy a bottle, it&#039;s expensive, don&#039;t waste your money.

Encouraging people to make some seriously life altering decisions just for fashion or aesthetic reasons is fucked up.

I was never balding, and that can be reversed through other means. My skin has always been great outside of some sun damage I reversed with tret.

The things I posted absolutely fall under that umbrella. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t have an appreciation for more interesting things, be it accessories or clothing. My personal perspective is that I seek a balance between clean and straightforward function, general attractiveness, and overall quality for things I need every day. If I could justify slapping on an Omega and carrying a calfskin Dior briefcase then I probably would. This stuff makes sense for me every day. I have nicer watches than an Apple Watch. I have nicer knives than a kershaw. I have a vintage Italian leather attach\u00e9 inherited from my great grandfather. I don\u2019t use them everyday because they\u2019re nicer, they are special, and every day is not a special day.

It&#039;s also a good conversation starter quite often.<br>If you have a good, not round face and wide body frame without acting like a faggot - no one will think of you as a fag/tranny/woman unless they&#039;re just making a joke or are faggots themselves. It&#039;s just a good addition to already good looks, and if you&#039;re that lucky with genetics it doesn&#039;t require more than a wash+conditioner every 2 days or so (for me at least). Only real complaint is the shedding, but it&#039;s not that major. <br>A good beard also is a great addition, but sadly this is where my genetics fail and i have patchy shit that i have to shave it off instead of going full pic rel.<br>God help you if you have a round face like OP pic, shitty frame or any other major problem though. Long hair is just going to multiply your issues tenfold that way.<br><br>Also, I remember some autist anon here posting a chart about how many compliments he had from having long hair and how much less compliments he had after he cut it short.

A lot of women seem to enjoy when a guy have a personal style of his own rather than falling into a genre/niche or a trend, but maybe some women that are explicitly into fashion would like a guy that follows the trends.

I know therapy gets shit on heavily here, but I\u2019d really recommend giving it a real shot, go find a therapist your age (male) that understands your struggles, and will help you get over them. I did therapy for two years and it seriously helped me so much. Got sober, started working out hard again, checked myself into therapy, and turned my 20s around by 26 and have had a beautiful end to them. I used to be constantly negative and depressed and now I\u2019m the one that\u2019s optimistic and tries to be positive when I can. Just keep trying until you find a good therapist, there\u2019s a lot of quacks out there, but when you find one you truly click with it makes all the difference. You have to want it though, if you just go and don\u2019t put in any work discussing the heavy things really bothering you it won\u2019t do any good.

When you\u2019re depressed and still love another woman other girls can tell, it colors all of your interactions and no one wants to be around that long term unless they\u2019re also depressed.

I can do better with lots of water, zero sugar, zero alcohol, (and I do these things), but the steroid cream is the only thing that actually truly works rather than mildly reducing symptoms. Looking at the posts above, I will give Alterra Execalm a try and sunflower oil as well.

I&#039;ve been taking bleach baths as well, which is a commonly recommended home treatment, but it CAN&#039;T be good for my skin. When my skin gets dry it flakes like something out of a movie. ALL the skin dries and comes off, I should take pictures because you&#039;d need to see it to believe it. But the second I get back on the steroids, all better.

Admittedly skincare has been a process of trial and error for me but I&#039;ve been into this stuff for like nine years haha. It sounds like you&#039;re at a good starting point (props to you for using sunscreen). If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what is your goal through using retinol? Differin (as opposed to other &quot;retinol&quot; products) would be your best OTC bet for things like acne.<br>If you&#039;re keen on oil cleansing, I would recommend using an oil cleanser in place of coconut oil and following up with a water-based cleanser. People who oil cleanse usually only do it at night. It&#039;s helped me a lot with blackheads personally. Products marketed as cleansing oils contain emulsifying agents, which help them wash off your skin (unlike straight-up oil). Coconut oil can be very comedogenic as well.<br>Some people really like Vitamin C and/or niacinamide for acne spots, but I&#039;m not using either at the moment. In my opinion, it&#039;s best to be patient with the retinization process and refrain from adding additional actives in the meantime. Emphasize hydration if you get any skin flakes or irritation. You&#039;re off to a great start.<br><a href=\"#p17393939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393939</a><br>The Ordinary&#039;s claims surrounding Vitamin C and niacinamide have been debunked, but I recommend skipping Vitamin C for now because it can be sensitizing (especially in its ascorbic acid form). That stuff can be really rough on your skin if used too often.
