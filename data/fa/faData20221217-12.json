Maybe if he didn&#039;t wear it high it would be different, but wearing a bright neon orange beanie is something a black person does, or at least an urban person, not some pasty white guy.<br>It&#039;s both the fact that he&#039;s wearing his beanie in that fashion as well as the fact that he&#039;s your stereotypical 30-something balding white guy with glasses that likely still listens to the Shins and Arcade Fire. The workwear is just a symptom of him following trends for outside validation, and definitely not the root cause of why people are calling him soi.

From what I could gather a few weeks back when I was weirdly researching a brand I don&#039;t wear, Carhartt used to actually hold much more market share in actual genuine workwear among tradesmen, so workers were actually wearing their pants and shirts as well, but Dickies overtook their market share with pants and generally tradesmen over the last couple decades have been wearing branded shirts related to their employer/company because it makes more marketing sense.<br>That said, Carhartt still seems to have a considerable grasp on genuine workwear because while most workers just get their shit from Walmart and move on, there will always be workers who want something they perceive to be decent quality and will venture into the Dickies/Carhartt realm, and that&#039;s what the current fight is for. I do respect the effort that Carhartt has put in over the last decade to push past strict workwear into more casual wear. They seemed to have struck a deal with Amazon because if you search &quot;beanie&quot; or &quot;shirt&quot;, their shit has been one of the top results for around a decade now, with no mention of workwear in the title.

I think if you&#039;re leaning into motorcycle culture, you&#039;re missing the aesthetic, if you&#039;re leaning into guns, you&#039;re missing the aesthetic. The goofy little Japanese lorries fit the aesthetic better than an old cafe racer. This recent little set of moto collages is more about embracing practicality and personal taste to the abandonment of social expectations. There&#039;s a slightly autistic edge to it, it&#039;s intentionally weird. The gun is included like a fedora wearing neckbeard carrying a katana.

It also recommended that exfoliator, good score on EWG as well. It recommends buying two kinds of moisturizers, one for the day with SPF, and a heavier one for the night. I settled for a sunscreen with some moisturizing action for the day because it&#039;s relatively cheap and healthy. Thoughts on my picks? Also, I have acne but I didn&#039;t take that into consideration here, am I wrong in doing that?

Compare that to people who enjoy fashion as a hobby and can deliberately understand the quality of their outfit and other factors such as matching.

Accessing the internet prior to having a smartphone generally required what was considered specialist equipment, especially in the early 2000&#039;s. Since progressively more and more people have a computer and internet connection in their homes and a cell phone with internet access in their pocket, anyone can access any website on the internet without having to be a &#039;geek&#039; or whatever you want to call it. Posting on a phone degrades the quality of discussion because few if any phoneposters are going to sit for an extended period of time and type out a long, thought out and edited response to another post on a tiny screen with a tiny keyboard, in addition to other factors such as mass reuse of the same images because a camera roll or downloads folder displays the most recently saved images first.<br><br>The &quot;badge&quot; is a symbol of caring about things that have intangible value. Zoomers love to comment on how &#039;cringe&#039; people who are passionate about things are for some ungodly reason because they have nothing to be passionate about.

My feet are 275mm long and I normally wear a size 10US in sneakers and 9.5 on dress shoes. For the record, I own a pair of Red Wing Beckmans in 9D. The counter adjusts perfectly to my calf, the widest par of the shoe and the toe box is roomy, even considering that my feet are a bit wide for my usual size, I still normally wear a D width, but I have trouble getting my proper size in shoes that have a slender design. What I mean is that these sneakers are a bit wider than expected, which is the opposite of a problem for me specifically.<br>They came with two pairs of shoelaces, one cotton pair which is nothing special, and a leather pair. The leather shoelaces are a bit thinner than expected, which makes me question how much traction they can hold, since the shoes are fairly rigid and I really have to pull to close them properly.<br>Which leads me to question which market Thursday wanted to tackle with this shoe. They&#039;re too rigid out of the box and not confortable from the got go as any other sneaker -and mall-tier boots-, but they&#039;re to light and fall short when compared to proper boots. They&#039;re somewhere in between so as to not appeal to sneakerheads nor boot enthusiasts.<br>1/2", "filename": "thursday high tops", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1125, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671108394762470, "time": 1671108394, "md5": "v4Oc5xfQd/juVCdYOSS5NA==", "fsize": 633646, "resto": 17392357}, {"no": 17393340, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)07:48:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393334</a><br>2/2 <br>But I&#039;m happy with them because they will fill the spot I wanted them to.

At best the product or service produced is cool, but the *image* of a brand being cool -- no way man. There is nothing cool to me about having an Apple computer, a Gucci bag, Fendi shoes, Dolce and Gabbanna pants, beyond the functional purpose and aesthetics of those products themselves. People who wear brand names emblazoned on their clothes -- &quot;Guess Jeans&quot;, &quot;The North Face&quot; -- you are walking billboards. You *are paying that company* for the privilege of advertising their goods! How little must you think of yourself to not only give this service for free -- but pay for it!<br><br>Advertisements themselves -- I believe have a deliterious affect on human psychology. Television, internet, radio, signs, even email advertisements are constantly assaulting our senses, sight and hearing with things to buy -- trying to convince us using humor, sex and style that we will be better after trading our money for what they are selling. I am completely intolerant of advertisements in any form -- I change the radio in the car when an ad comes on, I don&#039;t watch television and I always have an ad blocker on my browser when using the web, I paid an extra $20 to remove ads from my Kindle ebook -- I really hate ads.<br><br>Now back to watches -- How much of a fucking narcassist does a watch maker need to be to put his fucking name on the watch face?? They want you to subconsciously see their name every fucking time you check the time! How often is that? fifteen, fifty times a day? This is after you pay potentially hundreds of dollars for the watch?? I will not be coerced to worship a brand -- especially a watch. And I will not advertise it to others who see my wrist. A brand of clothing or watch is not *my* brand and as such it needs to shut the hell up about who made it -- because otherwise it&#039;s off brand -- off *my* brand.", "time": 1671138017, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393909, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:00:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "rolex explorer is such an ugly pos", "time": 1671138022, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393912, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:01:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393908</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;he&#039;s wearing a watch with easily visible logos</span><br>thats almost every successful watch brand", "time": 1671138062, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393914, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:02:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393909</a><br>it looks a bit too plain for me but its still very nice", "time": 1671138122, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393915, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;thats almost every successful watch brand</span>", "filename": "17fba4s7m25a1", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671138123061966, "time": 1671138123, "md5": "bs/VR404nDzLTVm6AJ/cHw==", "fsize": 1275101, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393916, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:02:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393914</a><br>datejust is better. if i see an explorer it&#039;s always some old used 2006 piece of shit", "time": 1671138171, "resto": 17393287}, {"no": 17393917, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:03:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17393915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393915</a><br>uhh are you just proving my point?
