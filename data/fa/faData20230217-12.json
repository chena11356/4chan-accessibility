I&#039;m only posting because I saw the thread on the front page and I can write something relevant. Indoors, I keep a pair of indoor-only sandals, for multiple reasons. Like my outdoor sandals (everytime except winter, with snow on the ground), I always wear whatever pair of sandals I have on with black socks. This allows my feet to breath and keeps my eczema in check, and the layer of the sock is a skin which protects against infection and injury. This functionality is far more important than any fashionable consideration could ever possibly be.<br><br>2) Certain of my neighbors are zero-conscientousness democrat voting assholes who insist on a) keeping a dog even though no one ever held a gun to their head forcing them to keep a pet while b) not being fucked to curb their stupid animal in winter. Consequently, as I write, there are literally dozens of dog turds in my immediate outdoor environs, left in the snow. The landlord appears to have issued an ultimatum, and this won&#039;t get anyone to exhibit basic human decency, so they&#039;ll simply get fined I suppose. While I realize that my willingness to live in such a place speaks as much to my own stupidity as it does to theirs, they&#039;re the ones leaving turds.<br><br>The point being that I quickly established a clear indoor/outdoor protocol since my local environment is &quot;Extra-American&quot;.<br><br><a href=\"#p17475648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17475648</a><br><br>No one likes you on /lit/, and no one likes you here.

You really don&#039;t have a horrible base to work with - you&#039;re not severely deformed, don&#039;t have terrible acne, etc. I think with 6 months to a year of consistent work, you can get to be a 7-8/10. Here&#039;s how:<br>-Those glasses. Get rid of them. Either get bigger frames (not the little rectangles you have, but Buddy Holly style instead) or get something like Clubmasters or Wayfarers or whatever. Alternatively, you could just get contacts and it would work just as well or better.<br>-Skincare/hygiene. Dude, you look greasy and sweaty. Take a shower every day, or at least every other day. Get some nice shampoo/conditioner. Get facial cleanser and use it every day.<br>-Haircut. Where you&#039;re currently at, I&#039;d suggest getting a fade - maybe a 4 on the sides and a generous trim on top. You could grow it out later, but it looks like right now you don&#039;t have much volume. It looks like it&#039;s really greasy/sweaty/wet right now. Dry your hair thoroughly with a blow drier or towel after you wash it, and get some pomade to put in it after it dries. Comb it back first, and then comb the middle/back part to the side, leaving the front part to do a bit of a pomp if your hair will do that.<br>-Eyebrows. I&#039;ve got bushy brows and I leave them natural, but yours look like caterpillars. Get some tweezers and/or one of those female body hair razors, look up a tutorial, and clean up your brows.<br>-Facial hair. Right now, it looks like you&#039;ve got a lazy not-quite-stubble going on. It doesn&#039;t look like you&#039;d grow a great beard or have attractive stubble, so I&#039;d encourage you to shave every single day and keep the clean cut look until you get older and are more able to rock facial hair. Right now it just looks lazy.<br>-Bodyfat.

Self consciousness REEKS to anybody with even basic people skills. If you only dress nicely to appeal to women and lose your virginity \u2014 and not out of a genuine sense of aesthetics, self-respect, and propriety \u2014 you will get nowhere. Your lack of confidence will be immediately apparent within the first minute of conversation, and your motivations will be completely transparent. People will think you\u2019re creepy, desperate, and trying too hard.<br><br>Nice clothes are a SUPPLEMENT to a secure, confident personality; not a substitute for one. You need to develop your own personality and sense of style, which takes time. You\u2019re so young. You have so much time to figure out what looks good on you. Lose some weight. Work on your people skills and learn how to be charismatic and engaging. Start building a wardrobe of adult clothes slowly, one piece at a time. And most importantly: STOP LETTING YOUR SENSE OF SELF WORTH BE DETERMINED BY WOMEN. Insecurity will outweigh even the most /fa/ outfit 100% of the time.", "time": 1676604484, "resto": 17489815}, {"no": 17491054, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:46:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17489815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17489815</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does anyone else feel like their ugliness is fucking with their state of mind?</span><br>Yes absolutely.

Skip these. Anything from fast fashion is landfill quality even new. You might find Uniqlo stuff but check the wear on them.

Rely on how good the fabrics are and how well the fit you and if you can search the brand and see what their price point is usually and compare it to what you&#039;re paying for. Some stuff is truly vintage so you won&#039;t find that label anymore or you might see logos of brands that have changed over the years. Typically vintage stuff is kinda more fun to find cause it cannnnn be better quality but also the style might be more unique than anything that&#039;s a few years old. Look for pit stains, collar stains and anything else that would be difficult to wash off. Try to avoid polyester and other synthetic fabrics unless you&#039;re looking at performance sports wear or outdoors wear. Look for natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and wool because it&#039;s usually a sign of higher quality. Thickness and how good the item is constructed and stitched is another give away of quality, i would compare garments to see which of the two looks better built.

Thing is, I&#039;ve noticed in my country many young and even middle aged lawyers are starting to ditch the suits for more casual office wear (except when attending an important meeting or trial date). In fact, wearing a suit and tie every day is starting to be perceived as &quot;lowly&quot; in a sense, because only low salary law students dress like that anymore. Top lawyers are still dressing sharply, but not extremely formal.<br>Pic related is sort of what I mean, except the hanging ID. Nice looking pants, nice sweater. Shoes probably not too formal. I&#039;m thinking blazers too with a sweater underneath, or nice jackets with a shirt underneath.<br>I&#039;m really ignorant on matters concerning fashion so I would appreciate any help or sources where I could do my own research.<br>If it helps, I am 25 years old, 5&#039;9, 175 lbs (been lifting for eight years). That brings up a point; I have nice forearms so maybe rolling up my sleeves could be a good idea in more casual environments. Have been described as handsome or attractive before. Probably a bit above average.<br>Thank you and have a blessed day", "filename": "example", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 186, "h": 436, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676322535419948, "time": 1676322535, "md5": "WhSXiypQJAgQj62CVhsiPw==", "fsize": 24887, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "young-lawyerneed-help", "replies": 15, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 10}, {"no": 17486460, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:13:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17486453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17486453</a><br>What country is that so I can avoid it like the plague?", "time": 1676322810, "resto": 17486453}, {"no": 17486506, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17486460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17486460</a><br>It&#039;s a third world hellhole you wouldn&#039;t want to visit anyways", "time": 1676324096, "resto": 17486453}, {"no": 17486541, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:10:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;asking 4chan how to dress as a lawyer </span><br>just wear full rick and julius", "time": 1676326206, "resto": 17486453}, {"no": 17486556, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:20:29", "name": "\u0fc7 C \u0152 M G E N V S \u0fc7", "com": "<a href=\"#p17486506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17486506</a><br><a href=\"#p17486453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17486453</a><br><br><br>1.
