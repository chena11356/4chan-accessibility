I do respect the effort that Carhartt has put in over the last decade to push past strict workwear into more casual wear. They seemed to have struck a deal with Amazon because if you search &quot;beanie&quot; or &quot;shirt&quot;, their shit has been one of the top results for around a decade now, with no mention of workwear in the title.

I bought a vintage 30ml bottle of Zino last year, mostly because of all the Beau de Jour comparisons. My reaction to it at the time was similar to yours, and I hardly ever wore it after the first week or so. But about a month ago I tried it out again and found that I like it a lot more now. Its blend of patchouli, lavender, rose, and vanilla is gorgeous and complex, but it does have a musty quality that some might find off-putting. <br>I recently ordered a bottle of the current formulation along with the deodorant because they&#039;re both so cheap, and they just arrived today (Having tried both the current and vintage Zino now, I would say they&#039;re about 90% the same).<br>To my nose Zino and Beau de Jour are less similar than lots of people say, especially in their respective openings. First of all Zino has some sour, mouth-watering bergamot while BdJ has no citrus at all. The opening of Beau de Jour is all about the lavender, which is clean, beautiful, and high-quality. The lavender in Zino is nice too, but it has more of a urinous/ammonia quality. The two frags become more similar as they dry down and become more about patchouli. However Beau de Jour also has a lot of amber (ambroxan?) in the base, which I used to enjoy but I&#039;m not a huge fan of it anymore. I guess the amber is what makes BdJ more modern. If you had asked me which I prefer a year ago, I would have said Beau de Jour without hesitation, but my appreciation for Zino has grown immensely since then, so I&#039;m honestly not sure which I prefer now. At any rate, Beau de Jour is probably the best contemporary aromatic fougere/barbershop fragrance; it just smells GOOD and clean, but it&#039;s very expensive. Zino has things in common with BdJ, but it&#039;s not a substitute for it. But anyone who&#039;s curious about Zino should just blind buy it because you can get a 4.2oz bottle for less than $20", "time": 1671484658, "resto": 17398498}, {"no": 17401018, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)16:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17400904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17400904</a><br>Nice, I only have the current EDP but it&#039;s my favorite frag I own.

Douglas P\u2019s onstage attire and his overall gesamtkunst style including performing attire and album art draw heavily from WW2 German uniforms, including SS camouflage such as erbsenmuster, tieing these elements to an older v\u00f6lkisch pagan style that implicitly rejects modernity and individualism; the SS smocks are cut in a peasant pattern, and there are frequent v\u00f6lkisch nature motifs such as wicker and flowers; Douglas P\u2019s face is often covered by some sort of mask, often resembling bark, leaves, or moss. <br><br>What elements define Neofolk?<br>Neofolk is defined by wearing clothing in traditional cuts (generally pre-1950s) made from natural materials such as unbleached cotton muslin, roughspun wool, linen, leather, and waxed canvas. The color palette is dominated by dark and muted plain colors: black, dark gray, olive green, brown, and navy blue. The garments emphasize plainness and utility, so militaria and outerwear are the focus, not formal menswear.<br><br>What isn\u2018t Neofolk?<br>Conversely Neofolk is also very much defined by what it is not; Neofolk never includes modern garment types; modern blue jeans (if you must wear jeans think coal miner not James Dean), athletic wear, hoodies or sneakers; synthetic materials such as polyester or spandex, and eschews modern fasteners such as velcro and visually steers clear of bright garish colors and overt branding, graphics, or logos. <br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "ED14901D-055F-4AEE-B920-ACA6D6D71DC2", "ext": ".png", "w": 1012, "h": 1535, "tn_w": 164, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1671528715273280, "time": 1671528715, "md5": "T+Tkwcjb8bxbY4OagjQCBw==", "fsize": 1934867, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "neofolk-general-winter-war-edition", "replies": 12, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 17401982, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:33:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are similar clothing styles to Neofolk?<br>While there is substantial overlap with Oxford Academia, its bastardized cousin Dark Academia, and Ivy/Prep, Neofolk does not incorporate tweed or any of the brightly colored elements of Ivy/Prep. Additionally, since the origins of Neofolk style are heavily tied to Douglas P, it is useful to refer to the WW2 German and v\u00f6lkisch style of Neofolk as its first subgenre- Neovolk. <br><br>Will Neofolk make me look like a Nazi/larper/autist?<br>The short answer is yes. The long answer; not necessarily. The reason it is important to single \u2018Neovolk\u2019 out from the larger \u2018Neofolk\u2019 style is because it is particularly susceptible to making the people wearing it look like larping nazis with autism. Wearing pieces from Wehrmacht/SS uniforms in public is going to make you look like a larping nazi.

I can do better with lots of water, zero sugar, zero alcohol, (and I do these things), but the steroid cream is the only thing that actually truly works rather than mildly reducing symptoms. Looking at the posts above, I will give Alterra Execalm a try and sunflower oil as well.

I&#039;ve been taking bleach baths as well, which is a commonly recommended home treatment, but it CAN&#039;T be good for my skin. When my skin gets dry it flakes like something out of a movie. ALL the skin dries and comes off, I should take pictures because you&#039;d need to see it to believe it. But the second I get back on the steroids, all better.

Admittedly skincare has been a process of trial and error for me but I&#039;ve been into this stuff for like nine years haha. It sounds like you&#039;re at a good starting point (props to you for using sunscreen). If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what is your goal through using retinol? Differin (as opposed to other &quot;retinol&quot; products) would be your best OTC bet for things like acne.<br>If you&#039;re keen on oil cleansing, I would recommend using an oil cleanser in place of coconut oil and following up with a water-based cleanser. People who oil cleanse usually only do it at night. It&#039;s helped me a lot with blackheads personally. Products marketed as cleansing oils contain emulsifying agents, which help them wash off your skin (unlike straight-up oil). Coconut oil can be very comedogenic as well.<br>Some people really like Vitamin C and/or niacinamide for acne spots, but I&#039;m not using either at the moment. In my opinion, it&#039;s best to be patient with the retinization process and refrain from adding additional actives in the meantime. Emphasize hydration if you get any skin flakes or irritation. You&#039;re off to a great start.<br><a href=\"#p17393939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393939</a><br>The Ordinary&#039;s claims surrounding Vitamin C and niacinamide have been debunked, but I recommend skipping Vitamin C for now because it can be sensitizing (especially in its ascorbic acid form). That stuff can be really rough on your skin if used too often.

And if women do find them attractive without muscles, then they don&#039;t even need to put effort into getting jacked and they&#039;ll hit diminishing returns pretty quickly.", "filename": "comment_1604630328R6i4GwLqUuejjvuyaxlpWN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671319200651001, "time": 1671319200, "md5": "mSfiXTGuXF9Gfe5+jTO4mA==", "fsize": 309475, "resto": 17397359}, {"no": 17397579, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:21:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17397577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397577</a><br><a href=\"#p17397552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397552</a>", "filename": "E5ka_1dWYAMB0nq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 586, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 73, "tim": 1671319284103516, "time": 1671319284, "md5": "3/MlMlq9dMGEaADBogWOlw==", "fsize": 72525, "resto": 17397359}, {"no": 17397582, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:25:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17397579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397579</a><br>Absolute kek, glasses really fuck with your appearence", "filename": "a784b9f8481a-600x338", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 338, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671319508672467, "time": 1671319508, "md5": "4CuOS9G9c1+veNFjo/BOCw==", "fsize": 51256, "resto": 17397359}, {"no": 17397584, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:29:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17397582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397582</a>", "filename": "scooby-standing-topless-in-his-kitchen-in-fron-of-a-fridge-full-of-7up", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 926, "tn_w": 114, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671319748734103, "time": 1671319748, "md5": "HswLF58n3drxps0b6zvTIw==", "fsize": 69696, "resto": 17397359}, {"no": 17397587, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:33:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17397584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397584</a><br>Kek", "filename": "hi-res-136825462_crop_exact", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671319980059294, "time": 1671319980, "md5": "bpp6yDFLD4NJ5DgJ7qUUiA==", "fsize": 135489, "resto": 17397359}, {"no": 17397594, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:38:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17397577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397577</a><br><a href=\"#p17397582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397582</a><br>what&#039;s the point in being masculine if you don&#039;t look good?
