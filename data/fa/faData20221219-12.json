You autistically obsess over fragrances and label them as being either good or shit (no middle ground), as being for summer or winter, for this occasion or that occasion, etc. The fact is 99% of fragrances smell nice and for the most part it doesn&#039;t matter what you spray on yourself. If you&#039;re attractive then smelling good is just the cherry on top (pretty much any fragrance will do). If you&#039;re some ugly loser it doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re wearing a ridiculously expensive niche fragrance or a mass-pleasing compliment-getter, ultimately you&#039;re still an ugly loser.", "time": 1671379302, "resto": 17398498}, {"no": 17398748, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)11:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17398634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17398634</a><br>Bogart Signature", "filename": "20221025_105238", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2430, "h": 2430, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671379329240511, "time": 1671379329, "md5": "Rs4gRr634VXtC3dA77d7OA==", "fsize": 1794146, "resto": 17398498}, {"no": 17398783, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)11:29:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17398651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17398651</a><br>It&#039;s great.

Then by day 2, 3, maybe 4, it finally builds up enough natural oils to moisturize it and settle it down, the hair becomes more obedient.<br>Well because you don&#039;t strip all the oils off, you never go into that state, so you are always like on day 2, 3 after a wash.<br>It&#039;s also very easy to adjust how much oil you strip.<br>Warmer water, strips off more oil. Cooler water less. Cold water thats unpleasant practically doesn&#039;t remove any, just the excess.<br>Another benefit is that you never have to fuzz about having your special shampoo on hand.

From what I could gather a few weeks back when I was weirdly researching a brand I don&#039;t wear, Carhartt used to actually hold much more market share in actual genuine workwear among tradesmen, so workers were actually wearing their pants and shirts as well, but Dickies overtook their market share with pants and generally tradesmen over the last couple decades have been wearing branded shirts related to their employer/company because it makes more marketing sense.<br>That said, Carhartt still seems to have a considerable grasp on genuine workwear because while most workers just get their shit from Walmart and move on, there will always be workers who want something they perceive to be decent quality and will venture into the Dickies/Carhartt realm, and that&#039;s what the current fight is for. I do respect the effort that Carhartt has put in over the last decade to push past strict workwear into more casual wear. They seemed to have struck a deal with Amazon because if you search &quot;beanie&quot; or &quot;shirt&quot;, their shit has been one of the top results for around a decade now, with no mention of workwear in the title.

I can do better with lots of water, zero sugar, zero alcohol, (and I do these things), but the steroid cream is the only thing that actually truly works rather than mildly reducing symptoms. Looking at the posts above, I will give Alterra Execalm a try and sunflower oil as well.

I&#039;ve been taking bleach baths as well, which is a commonly recommended home treatment, but it CAN&#039;T be good for my skin. When my skin gets dry it flakes like something out of a movie. ALL the skin dries and comes off, I should take pictures because you&#039;d need to see it to believe it. But the second I get back on the steroids, all better.

Admittedly skincare has been a process of trial and error for me but I&#039;ve been into this stuff for like nine years haha. It sounds like you&#039;re at a good starting point (props to you for using sunscreen). If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what is your goal through using retinol? Differin (as opposed to other &quot;retinol&quot; products) would be your best OTC bet for things like acne.<br>If you&#039;re keen on oil cleansing, I would recommend using an oil cleanser in place of coconut oil and following up with a water-based cleanser. People who oil cleanse usually only do it at night. It&#039;s helped me a lot with blackheads personally. Products marketed as cleansing oils contain emulsifying agents, which help them wash off your skin (unlike straight-up oil). Coconut oil can be very comedogenic as well.<br>Some people really like Vitamin C and/or niacinamide for acne spots, but I&#039;m not using either at the moment. In my opinion, it&#039;s best to be patient with the retinization process and refrain from adding additional actives in the meantime. Emphasize hydration if you get any skin flakes or irritation. You&#039;re off to a great start.<br><a href=\"#p17393939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17393939</a><br>The Ordinary&#039;s claims surrounding Vitamin C and niacinamide have been debunked, but I recommend skipping Vitamin C for now because it can be sensitizing (especially in its ascorbic acid form). That stuff can be really rough on your skin if used too often.

However, there are several reasons why fur may actually be a more sustainable choice for clothing.<br><br>First, it is important to consider the environmental impact of the production of synthetic fabrics. Many synthetic fabrics, such as polyester, are made from petroleum, which is a non-renewable resource and the production of which has significant environmental consequences. In contrast, fur is a natural material that is produced by animals that are raised on fur farms. These farms are generally smaller and more sustainable than the factories that produce synthetic fabrics, and they often have less of an impact on the environment.<br><br>Second, the durability of fur is significantly higher than that of synthetic fabrics. Fur is a long-lasting material that can be passed down for generations, whereas synthetic fabrics often wear out and need to be replaced after just a few years. This means that the environmental impact of synthetic fabrics is often greater over their lifetime, as they need to be produced and disposed of multiple times.<br><br>Finally, it is important to consider the environmental impact of disposal. Synthetic fabrics do not biodegrade and can take hundreds of years to break down in a landfill. In contrast, fur can be composted and will break down naturally over time.<br><br>Overall, while synthetic fabrics may seem like the more environmentally friendly choice, there are several reasons why fur can actually be a more sustainable option. From the more sustainable production process to the durability and biodegradability of the material, fur can be a more eco-friendly choice for clothing.", "filename": "FFE0A3F9-4771-4B28-8B41-ED1D2A117F6A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 628, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 130, "tim": 1671302921238350, "time": 1671302921, "md5": "tMJhyDE0L0XMlkk4noCRNw==", "fsize": 79611, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fur-clothing-has-long-been-a-controversial-topic", "replies": 21, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 17397152, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p17397142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;17397142</a><br>I dont give a fuck about the &quot;sustainability&quot;.
