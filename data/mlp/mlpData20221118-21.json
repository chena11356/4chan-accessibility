And, I dunno, friends but this, to me, feels like it\u2019s going to be a vintage year for content.

You see &quot;fans&quot; openly talking about how they desire to &quot;punish equestria&quot; to &quot;put other fans in their place.&quot; This is vindictive and psychopathic, and destructive against everyone&#039;s interests including their own, and doesnt have any business being My Little Pony. But if Hasbro is trying to &quot;listen to the fans,&quot; and the ones who aren&#039;t censored and harassed away are screaming those things, then they are put in a tough spot. And to make it worse, a lot of the crew themselves share many of these sentiments and are more than happy to oblige because it makes no difference to them as it&#039;s just a job, pal. And it sadly feels like G5 is born out of these sentiments. I hate to say it, but it&#039;s not nearly emotionally intelligent enough as an approach for My Little Pony. It is unbecoming of My Little Pony. I hope that moving forward there will be less of that flavor in the brand.", "time": 1668794040, "resto": 39312571}, {"no": 39318510, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)17:40:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p39312571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39312571</a><br>Bump", "time": 1668811203, "resto": 39312571}, {"no": 39318931, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:14:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p39312571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39312571</a><br>Let the artists and writers do their work instead of microanalyzing everything to conclude if it&#039;ll make 3% more money or not.<br>Toys are not art, they are product.

The shape of the scales and their orientation is much better. You&#039;re doing great. <br><br>There are a couple of refinements you can make to give it more depth and make it seem more 3D.<br>Notice the belly of the snake I posted. Do you see how it&#039;s not just a lighter color, but the shape of the scales are very different? Rather than being the diamond-esque shape of the other scales, they are long and thin, crossing the whole belly. You can use that to show just how the body is curling around. <br>Also, a body like that is a big tube. The scales on the edges are going to be distorted by the fact that they are going around a curve. If you need help visualizing it, you can take something like a paper towel tube and draw the scales on it. Then, looking at it, you can see exactly how the scales would visually change shape due to being on the edge of the snake&#039;s body. <br>Thinking about a body as a 3D object and trying to make sense of them in 2D is a heck of a challenge.

Can we make some sort of trap?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Opaline must be stopped, no matter what!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: Opaline abhors the idea of unity and equality, believing that ponies should fear and love the alicorn race, whom she believes are meant to rule Equestria with an iron hoof while confining the use of magic to royalty.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This makes her dangerous, but weak, also, as she has no allies. It does, however, mean that we know who she&#039;ll want to be her allies, and we might be able to use that to set a trap.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Then we need to gather our current allies and friends and make a plan!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you think it would be wise to tell the mane 6 about this? Or should we gather our forces first? I&#039;m sorry Nova, this is all so overwhelming.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: Opaline is well hidden, but she&#039;ll come out of hiding if she thinks she can sway one of the other alicorns to her side.</span>", "time": 1668816195, "resto": 39222075}, {"no": 39318741, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)19:11:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p39318718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39318718</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s how she revealed herself to Twilight the first time around. She thought that pointing out what all the non-alicorns were doing with magic as they fought each other would convince Twilight of her own ideals, but Twilight sealed the magic away instead.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: So... the best thing we can do right now, is try to track down which alicorn Opaline might want to sway to her side in your timeline?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I look up at the clock I know it&#039;s early morning, so I&#039;ll gather the girls for a meeting soon enough.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you want to meet up with us at Sugarcube Corner?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: Ah... Actually, since I came from the future, I have no place to stay, and, well...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I pull out a billfold full of paper notes and show Starlight</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It turns out my paper currency has no value in the past. I didn&#039;t realized you all still used gold coins in this day and age.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Oh goodness!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I look at my wallet</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sadly I only have a bit of coin left after my latest book shopping spree.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would you like to come live with me then? I have extra bedroom that&#039;s currently unused, and I would be happy to have another roommate with me!

I&#039;ve also not eaten anything in a long time.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Oh. That can&#039;t be good. Come along!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I grab Nova&#039;s hoof, bringing her to my house along with her luggage</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We enter my home, and I lead her to the bedroom</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make yourself at home Nova! I&#039;ll get us some breakfast.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A while later, I return with two mugs of cider and some bread rolls</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Please be gentle on my cooking, I&#039;m no baker.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: I&#039;m sure it&#039;s fine. In a world without magic, no one has a magic talent for baking, effectively meaning no one can cook or bake as well as a chef or baker from the past, so you&#039;re probably no worse than the best of my time.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: I do know some great bakers personally!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pinkie knows how to make the best cider and cakes, she can even bake them with her ears.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rarity isn&#039;t quite on par in the bakery department, but she makes up for the lack of taste with her adorable appearance!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And the other mares have some great treats as well, though their methods of making them are usually far from conventional. I laugh</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: I laugh as well, but grow somber</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They sound nice, and you seem nice so far. This seems like a nice place to live... I almost feel like I don&#039;t belong.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Nonsense! You fit in perfectly here, Nova!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twilight may have her rough patches, she tends to be a tad overprotective, but she is a wonderful pony. I couldn&#039;t ask for a better mentor than her.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only downside is her constant overwork, which has put a lot of strain on her back. It&#039;s to the point where she&#039;s developing a hunch from the many years she&#039;s been overworked.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sighs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just wish she took a day off here and there.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: So thoughtful, but what I mean is... Haven&#039;t you wondered how I did it?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Do you mean the time travel thing? I have no idea!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maybe you have a special saddlebag that can allow you travel through time?</span>", "time": 1668816675, "resto": 39222075}, {"no": 39318758, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)19:17:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p39318741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39318741</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I know time travel is possible due to my failed experiments in the past. But, I never really paid attention to it before. All I know is that the magic needed to do time travel is extremely powerful, so only unicorns who have practiced magic for decades can even have a chance at manipulating time.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: Exactly, and yet, I did it in a future with no magic. Doesn&#039;t that seem strange?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: It... it doesn&#039;t make much sense!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The alicorns, and any other unicorns with a good head on their shoulders, would understand that the use of chaos magic can and will lead to the obliteration of everything, so they would never teach anyone such magic.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unless, if somehow your timeline has figured out a way to do time travel without the use of magic... but that, I would think is near-impossible.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: Do you know a filly named Cozy Glow?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Uh, yes?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She&#039;s one of our students. She&#039;s rather bookish but intelligent and sweet. She often stays up late reading textbooks, and is a bit shy around the other foals.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She has a strong work ethic, and I believe she wants to be a librarian. She&#039;s actually quite good at writing.</span><br>N: I smile weakly<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She actually wants to become an alicorn, and does it by stealing the magic of a bunch of other ponies in the future before being defeated, her stolen magic removed, and then she gets turned to stone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the magic fades, her stone prison degrades, and she&#039;s released. In all the chaos, she organizes the pegasi under her leadership, and eventually is declared their queen. I sneaked into the royal archives of the pegasi royal family, and found her diaries, and inside, I found a ritual that allowed for the stealing of all magic from the world.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I used it, in conjunction with books I&#039;ve found of yours, to draw the last remaining sparks of magic-the wisps of every ponies&#039; soul- into one spot, and cast the time travel spell I made from your notes.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I effectively killed all of the ponies of my time the moment before I erased the world.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: I look at Nova in horror. My eyes are filled with fear, and I let go of her hoof and stumble backwards</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N-no...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My legs begin to wobble, and I fall on my butt. I pull myself up against the nearest wall, trying to process what I just heard</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, that- that can&#039;t be true. Cozy is a good pony, with a great work ethic and a sense of duty to serve her schoolmates!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How could she possibly do something so awful?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N: I mean, what I did was probably worse, right? She never killed anyone, or erased a timeline.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: I shake my head</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, not even close. You were just trying to save the future. You had good intentions, even if your actions were a bit... questionable.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On the other hoff, if- if what you said is true, Cozy Glow would be fully aware of the consequences of her actions. Stealing the magic from anyone and everyone, then forcing the pegasi into leadership. Why would she do all of this?

And instead of supporting her and teaching her to be a great pony, they treated her poorly and cast her aside as a failure.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wonder if she is just simply lonely.

If anything, I&#039;m just really tired.</span><br>Why don&#039;t you go tell Twilight about all of this, then the two of you can talk to Cozy together. If Twilight needs evidence, the truth about Cozy Glow should be easy to prove.

It&#039;s a ritual spell, after all.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Oh, that makes sense.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think I can track her mail.

My name is Starlight Glimmer, and I&#039;m looking for a penpal service that connects to Tartarus.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it possible that I could get access to Cozy Glow&#039;s letters?

I\u2019ll explain my personal rankings below.<br><br>Teens React to MLP: S Tier - Absolutely hilarious and perfectly executed. They critiqued the video well while also not taking themselves seriously at all and providing a bunch of hilarious lines. This series could not have started off better.<br><br>Derpy/College Humor My Little Brony: C Tier - Mainly just a discussion about these topics. Cool time capsules and the guys made good points, but besides that not much interesting or comedic here.<br><br>Cupcakes: B Tier - Only first few minutes are reactions to the actual video, which were hilarious. The rest of it is just a discussion about it. Pretty fun overall, especially Saberspark\u2019s disgust.<br><br>Season 2 Finale/Season 3 Premiere: A Tier - First couple episode reactions, and very fun. I wish they were a bit longer and they feel a bit rushed. However, that is understandable since these was the first ones, and its really cool to see all these guys react first time to such old episodes<br><br>Season 3 Finale: S Tier - We have now hit the sweet spot in the pacing of the episode reacts. Has enough reactions so that everything interesting is covered without feeling rushed but few enough so that it doesn\u2019t drag on and is very rewatchable. AcRacebest\u2019s theories and how he edited those segments were the highlight here. The gold standard to follow for these.<br><br>Equestria Girls Trailer: A Tier - Really good mix of comedy and serious discussion on the topic at hand. An interesting variety of takes, with a good overall message about how the drama was overblown and the best solution was to wait and see if the movie would be good. <br><br>Equestria Girls Movie: S Tier - Once again, great pacing for an episode react, and since this movie is so easy to make fun of they had great material to work with. And BlackGryph0n literally skydived on video just to complain about Flash Sentry. Nuff said.
