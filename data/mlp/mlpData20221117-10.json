But attention quickly turned to &quot;The Scruffening&quot;, a mass deletion of various threads and general confusion over the following days. Milky Way threads were quickly deleted from then on, later confirmed as bannable content due to its NSFW nature: https://desuarchive.org/q/thread/64<wbr>0332/#q641855 Some claimed that Lauren&#039;s visit sparked the sudden SFW enforcement but this remains inconclusive.<br><br>Milky Way threads have occasionally been posted over the years, lasting only a few minutes to several hours at a time.

I\u2019ll explain my personal rankings below.<br><br>Teens React to MLP: S Tier - Absolutely hilarious and perfectly executed. They critiqued the video well while also not taking themselves seriously at all and providing a bunch of hilarious lines. This series could not have started off better.<br><br>Derpy/College Humor My Little Brony: C Tier - Mainly just a discussion about these topics. Cool time capsules and the guys made good points, but besides that not much interesting or comedic here.<br><br>Cupcakes: B Tier - Only first few minutes are reactions to the actual video, which were hilarious. The rest of it is just a discussion about it. Pretty fun overall, especially Saberspark\u2019s disgust.<br><br>Season 2 Finale/Season 3 Premiere: A Tier - First couple episode reactions, and very fun. I wish they were a bit longer and they feel a bit rushed. However, that is understandable since these was the first ones, and its really cool to see all these guys react first time to such old episodes<br><br>Season 3 Finale: S Tier - We have now hit the sweet spot in the pacing of the episode reacts. Has enough reactions so that everything interesting is covered without feeling rushed but few enough so that it doesn\u2019t drag on and is very rewatchable. AcRacebest\u2019s theories and how he edited those segments were the highlight here. The gold standard to follow for these.<br><br>Equestria Girls Trailer: A Tier - Really good mix of comedy and serious discussion on the topic at hand. An interesting variety of takes, with a good overall message about how the drama was overblown and the best solution was to wait and see if the movie would be good. <br><br>Equestria Girls Movie: S Tier - Once again, great pacing for an episode react, and since this movie is so easy to make fun of they had great material to work with. And BlackGryph0n literally skydived on video just to complain about Flash Sentry. Nuff said.

Or only a bit? Do you consider it a fetish?</span><br>Oh, I absolutely consider it a fetish and get off to it. I&#039;m still exploring my asexuality so I can&#039;t describe it perfectly, but one branch of it is that I have little interest translating my fetishes IRL (half because they aren&#039;t particularly realistic and half because the concept of IRL sex grosses me out), and the other branch of it is the inherent clop itself takes secondary priority for me when I seek material out -- tasteful clop certainly elevates a fetish for me when it ties directly into the fetish itself (for ex. manifesting as a direct demonstration of hypnotic control vs just lazily ordering some hypnotized sap to have sex or whatever for you, there is some nuance here I&#039;m not good at explaining). tl;dr I don&#039;t need the sex to enjoy the fetish, and I don&#039;t enjoy the sex without the fetish.

My friend sent me that screenshot earlier this week when we discussed poni, and I assumed this was Twitter because that&#039;s what&#039;s usually circulating. You&#039;re cool in my books.<br>Weird Al&#039;s statement remains ambiguous, but I respect him for not picking useless fights with Ponkfrens. Even if he was a die-hard waifufag, he&#039;d be in the same boat as everybody else; one could even say he&#039;d be cucked by Cheese Sandwich for Cheese is merely heavily based on Weird Al, yet no wish-fulfillment OC-insert.

It&#039;s a level of meta where Yankovic is playing Weird Al, who is in turn voicing Cheese. How closely Yankovic relates to Weird Al is purely speculative, given that his public persona closely mimics Weird Al mannerisms. It would be like asking how much of any character personality is tied back to the core personality of the individual. Look at public &quot;character&quot; personas like Gilbert Gottfried or David Blaine, or Andy Kaufman. For Yankovic, Weird Al *is* himself. Maybe in a more exaggerated fashion, but he&#039;s solidly been Weird Al for the majority of his life, we have to assume that a huge part of Weird Al is Yankovic. But when it comes to Cheese, I wouldn&#039;t bet on Yankovic/Weird Al having Ponk as a waifu, or even attempting to self-insert into MLP through Cheese. There aren&#039;t any solid indications of Weird Al liking ponies to the degree of bronyhood. And he would be a person that would have done a song on it, or brought it up from the get-go because he&#039;s, well, weird. And being a brony would fit right into that persona without anyone batting an eye. I think it&#039;s more likely that the MLP writers had the idea and Hasbro approached him with the proposal.
