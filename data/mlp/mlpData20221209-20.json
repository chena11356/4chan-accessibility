They are all business and no talk.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remembering Carol&#039;s article, you tell your companion to get down before you get noticed. Whoever these people are, they&#039;re definitely no police, you can tell that much. Actually, you don&#039;t see any police anywhere, just those operatives.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Black suits, black cars with tinted windows, bright flashlights, a whole assortment of tools that they&#039;ve taken here to account for anything that might&#039;ve been scorched by magic. That includes the burnt up car and its pieces that are getting documented and taken away into a nondescript minivan.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only thing that stands out about it are the wheels and the windows. They seem a bit too new for this kind of regular workhorse, you bet they&#039;re bulletproof.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Who are these people?&quot;</span><br>&quot;No idea, some kind of clean up crew,&quot; you squint in an attempt to see if there&#039;s more of them in ambush somewhere. &quot;Apparently they&#039;re always the first on the scene when something goes wrong with pony magic.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;But nothing goes- Well, there was one time recently, but...&quot;</span><br>&quot;They&#039;ve obviously been preparing for incidents like this. Maybe you&#039;re not as subtle as you think.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That just makes the pony sigh.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Our own cleanup crew usually gets everything first. Where are they?

Confidence can lead to the most obvious mistakes you could make.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;And now I&#039;m sounding like Twilight myself,&quot; the mare chuckles quietly. &quot;Come on.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She is looking at you expectantly.</span><br>&quot;Come on what?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Hold me.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No hesitation on her part.</span><br>&quot;Shouldn&#039;t we wait until they&#039;re gone?&quot; you nod in your apartment&#039;s direction.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;If they are still busy here they probably haven&#039;t checked the witnesses yet, or are already done with them. Either way, inside should be safe...if we enter without them knowing. Now hold onto me.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You hesitantly touch the mare&#039;s suit. Even with this light of a touch you can feel how tender her little body is.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I need you to grab me so we can teleport together.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The pony is patient with you.

It&#039;s easier on the magic reserve that way.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tightening your embrace means putting your head right next to hers. Even through the protection shield you see her kind eyes watching you as your cheek touches the cold sealed material of the suit.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Aww, don&#039;t worry. It&#039;s just a teleport, hold tight and don&#039;t let go even after we&#039;re clear, okay?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You feel like her cheek is touching yours from under the suit and you hear her breath so close, it distracts you from your extreme awkwardness for a mere second.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just enough time for the world to quite literally disappear from under your legs.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You almost scream in panic but in a blinding flash the cold hard surface once again appears under your legs. The scream that never was turned into a sheepish little yelp.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The pony can&#039;t help it and giggles.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You already start letting her go but for some reason you can&#039;t keep your balance and fall over.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thankfully, it&#039;s not a long fall.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The shock will wear off in a moment. Now, let me see...&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As you recover from the spell you realize that you&#039;re no longer anywhere near your building, instead this feels more like...a roof?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your guess is proven right by the mare who waves her hoof at you from the precipice. She&#039;s looking down without even trying to conceal herself. You&#039;re a bit more careful about it, barely showing your head above the concrete.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Where&#039;s your window supposed to be?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You have to lean in a bit and it makes your head spin. The ground below is scaring you and you&#039;re not sure this pony can be trusted to keep you safe.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still, you concentrate on finding the right column of windows and after some time you think you can guess correctly.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s also an opportunity to look at the special agents working on the scorched street.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They&#039;re picking up some small black parts off the ground all around the place where the fight was taking place.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Burnt concrete and asphalt show the path of that nightmare alicorn&#039;s magic across it. The car is now a piece of burnt metal. No sign of Carol.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Someone is arguing with one of the agents in the yellow circle of a street light and by the indoor clothes and frantic gesturing you can guess it&#039;s one of the residents. The words barely reach you but if it&#039;s the car&#039;s owner it&#039;s gonna be a long discussion.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And those black things are all over the place. A bit too late you realize what they actually are.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Anon, over here!&quot; your pony guide calls you with an exagerrated whisper.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Those are the not so hidden living cameras used on you and discarded now after they&#039;ve lived past their usefulness.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The pony asks you the same thing when you approach her as she is looking down.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Are those...birds? Dead birds?&quot;</span><br>&quot;Yeah. It&#039;s a long story.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;How gruesome,&quot; sadness in her voice makes you feel a bit sad too.</span><br>&quot;How are you planning on getting inside?&quot;", "time": 1670630253, "resto": 39338857}, {"no": 39395567, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:00:05", "name": "A Wish Enough for Two", "com": "<a href=\"#p39395552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39395552</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;You are going to get on my back and I&#039;m going to magically open the window for us to fly inside.&quot;</span><br>&quot;You&#039;re- You know what, let&#039;s get to it.

You mount the pony in one awkward motion. She is still too small for her back to even reach your crotch.

Even more so, to watch a movie series you knew she had no love for. The whole situation was enigmatic, but it seemed rude to deny her request.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Plus, you had her blessing to enjoy the occasion with your beloved brother to your heart\u2019s content. Something the two of you had not done in years. A truly improbable scenario that you couldn\u2019t pass up.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The day of the movie was a nonstop torrent of Star Horse discussion. From breakfast all the way up to the opening crawl. All your worries were washed away by a childlike glee to dissect and enjoy a science fantasy dream; that you wished you could make a reality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Once the movie began, your attention was placed solely on the film.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; And that was a mistake.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Once the third act had begun, you couldn\u2019t help but hear the signature trope of a couple fooling around.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Really!? For a movie as highly anticipated as this!? Who had the nerve?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; When there seemed to be a break in the action, you stole a peek and immediately wish you hadn\u2019t.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Your brother was the one making the commotion because he was making out with Cadence. But they weren\u2019t just kissing; no, they were making too much noise for that. They were practically jerking each other off with the amount of skin-on-skin contact they were making.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; You were such an idiot. How could you fall for such an obvious trap? Take the little sister to the movies to cheer her up while you had a good reason to be out of the house for a few hours to get your rocks off.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; If you were more socially adept you would have seen this coming. But you weren\u2019t, and now everything was ruined. You didn\u2019t even bother to follow the rest of the movie. You simply tried to ignore and block out the sound of your brother\u2019s intimate moment. At least he was enjoying himself.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; On the way back to the car, you didn\u2019t say anything to your brother. How could you? You felt so used. Yet, you tried to keep up appearances by hiding your sense of </span><s> betrayal </s> the best you could.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Even so, he knew what he had done. It was written all over his face.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Then, just as you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse, Cadence opens her mouth.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cSo, Twilight.
