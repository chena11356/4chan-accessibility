class=\"quote\">&gt;In an instant, she&#039;d taken nearly all of you into her mouth, and you could feel your tip pushing into the back of her throat.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twilight gave a slight panicked, muffled gasp of breath, but you&#039;d had plenty of experience to know she wasn&#039;t choking.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She pulled away, until it was just the tip in her mouth again, and then she went back down.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It wasn&#039;t long before she was getting into an all-too-familiar bobbing motion, moving her head back and forth on

They critiqued the video well while also not taking themselves seriously at all and providing a bunch of hilarious lines. This series could not have started off better.<br><br>Derpy/College Humor My Little Brony: C Tier - Mainly just a discussion about these topics. Cool time capsules and the guys made good points, but besides that not much interesting or comedic here.<br><br>Cupcakes: B Tier - Only first few minutes are reactions to the actual video, which were hilarious. The rest of it is just a discussion about it. Pretty fun overall, especially Saberspark\u2019s disgust.<br><br>Season 2 Finale/Season 3 Premiere: A Tier - First couple episode reactions, and very fun. I wish they were a bit longer and they feel a bit rushed. However, that is understandable since these was the first ones, and its really cool to see all these guys react first time to such old episodes<br><br>Season 3 Finale: S Tier - We have now hit the sweet spot in the pacing of the episode reacts. Has enough reactions so that everything interesting is covered without feeling rushed but few enough so that it doesn\u2019t drag on and is very rewatchable. AcRacebest\u2019s theories and how he edited those segments were the highlight here. The gold standard to follow for these.<br><br>Equestria Girls Trailer: A Tier - Really good mix of comedy and serious discussion on the topic at hand. An interesting variety of takes, with a good overall message about how the drama was overblown and the best solution was to wait and see if the movie would be good. <br><br>Equestria Girls Movie: S Tier - Once again, great pacing for an episode react, and since this movie is so easy to make fun of they had great material to work with. And BlackGryph0n literally skydived on video just to complain about Flash Sentry. Nuff said.
