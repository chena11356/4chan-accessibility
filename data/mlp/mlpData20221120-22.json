Lauren Faust would visit /mlp/ a few days later https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/1<wbr>0902082/ and all hell broke loose, even prompting a reply from Moot (https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/<wbr>10902082/500/3/#q10906860). But attention quickly turned to &quot;The Scruffening&quot;, a mass deletion of various threads and general confusion over the following days. Milky Way threads were quickly deleted from then on, later confirmed as bannable content due to its NSFW nature: https://desuarchive.org/q/thread/64<wbr>0332/#q641855 Some claimed that Lauren&#039;s visit sparked the sudden SFW enforcement but this remains inconclusive.<br><br>Milky Way threads have occasionally been posted over the years, lasting only a few minutes to several hours at a time.

Even if, maybe, the Princesses themselves were working to keep knowledge of it contained, are you honestly telling me that at no point, ever, had a random unicorn/pegasus family adopted an earth pony foal and had to deal with the possibility of their foal showing off their ability as they grow? Or did there just so happen to be another earth pony around to be able to make sure the kid never ever revealed themselves? And also, literally EVERY earth pony is in agreement that no one outside of their race should know about it? Not just the rural or racial-purity focused ones, even earth ponies like Octavia, the Cakes, and even Bon-Bon are staunch believers in &quot;Keeping The Secret&quot;?<br><br>It&#039;s frustrating to think about.
