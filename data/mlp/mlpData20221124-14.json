To his surprise, he saw many of the yellow mares throughout the court, including the judge, smiling and nodding in agreement with the objection. Fixing his gaze on the audience, he was just in time to see Princess Luna wave to him before opening the courtroom door, revealing some sort of magical portal on the other side, and pass through it. The door closed on its own behind her. \u2018Why a portal and not just teleportation?\u2019 thought Anon. But, he didn&#039;t have time to consider that peculiarity before another objection rang out.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I object to that objection!&quot; said Miss Defender, likewise pushing her weight up by her forelegs on the table. She smiled brightly at Anon and continued, but she kept her warm gaze upon him. &quot;Mister Anon&#039;s words can be trusted provided we use the ancient human tradition of &#039;Testimony&#039;&quot;.</span><br>Anon was confused. He had never heard of &#039;Testimony&#039; being an ancient human tradition that could be used in lieu of an oath. While musing, he noticed that neither lawyer had removed her gaze from him.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Um, the prosecution and defense will approach the bench to discuss the meaning and use of &#039;Testimony&#039;.&quot; said Judge Fluttershy.</span><br>Both lawyers did so and for a moment Anon only heard their whispers. The only thing he could make out was the judge asking Prosecutor X if she had any further objections, to which the wily Prosecutor coolly shook her head.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Both lawyers trotted back to their tables and Judge Fluttershy gently tapped the gavel to her desk before standing up to address the entire court.</span><br>Anon could have sworn that the judge was blushing deeply before she spoke.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Ehem.&quot; began the sage judge. &quot;Both objections are sustained. Therefore, given, um, the unusual nature of Anon&#039;s origin we will proceed to use the human tradition of &#039;Testesmony&#039; in lieu of the sacred legal oath. This will ensure he tells the truth.&quot;</span><br>&#039;What is she even talking about? She&#039;s not even pronouncing &#039;Testimony&#039; correctly.&#039; thought Anon as he tried to figure out what was happening. He held his peace while the judge continued.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As explained by Miss Defender and confirmed by Prosecutor X, it is known by magical means that in ancient days on Earth...where, um, Anon is from...human males would hold their groin when acting as a witness. This was called &#039;Testesmony&#039;&quot; continued Judge Fluttershy with a little giggle. &quot;This imbued their words with absolute truth, since that&#039;s where a human male hides all his truth, um, it would seem. So, by my decree, Anon will now take out and grab his groin to proceed with his Testesmony in response to questions.&quot;</span><br>Whispers of approval echoed through the court and many of the cute yellow pegasai present were heard to exclaim \u201cYay!&quot; Anon was stunned.", "filename": "Fluttershy18", "ext": ".png", "w": 623, "h": 513, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1669317243933956, "time": 1669317243, "md5": "1hzfsnbSh0j9SUqPTnLr1Q==", "fsize": 316661, "resto": 39210969}, {"no": 39339161, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:19:40", "name": "In The Court Of Fluttershy", "com": "<a href=\"#p39339141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39339141</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The judge now turned to Anon with a smile and pointed a hoof at his crotch. &quot;Mister Anon, if you will, um, if it&#039;s not too much trouble, will you please now take out and grab your groin so that the court can verify that you are telling the truth?

It&#039;s the law.&quot; said the judge gravely.</span><br>&quot;But this is silly, and besides, that&#039;s not what &#039;Testimony&#039; means!&quot; protested Anon. &quot;Really...&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another tap of the gavel. This time Fluttershy turned to the Bailiff. &quot;Well, um, Miss Bailiff please prevent Mister Anon from being unruly.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Of course, your lawfulness!&quot; said the clearly eager Bailiff. She pulled the baton out of her belt by mouth and, trotting over to Anon, proceeded to give him a series of gentle whacks on his legs.</span><br>Anon observed her, unhurt but in disbelief. After a few more whacks he watched her put the baton away and look up at him with a big, beaming grin. He turned again to the judge. &quot;You judgeship, I...&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet another gavel tap from Judge Fluttershy. &quot;I&#039;m truly sorry Mister Anon, but I find that you have contempted the court. You&#039;ll need to be restrained.&quot; Turning to the Bailiff she spoke again &quot;Bailiff, please restrain Mister Anon.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Bailiff whipped out her fuzzy pink cuffs and looked up expectantly at Anon. With the cuffs in-mouth, she spoke. &quot;Um, M&#039;ifter Anon, um, &#039;oo &#039;eeed to &#039;ake off &#039;oor &#039;acket an&#039; &#039;irt.&quot;</span><br>\u201cTake off my jacket and shirt?!&quot; In amazement Anon looked up at Judge Fluttershy, who instead of banging the gavel now looked at him with pleading eyes and sad anticipation, like she had been rejected. He looked out over all the other yellow mares and saw similar expressions. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Please?&quot; pleaded the judge.</span><br>Anon met her imploring gaze and hesitated in his frustration. Suddenly, Princess Luna&#039;s advice came flooding back to hime. \u2018Flow with whatever was going on in this court beneath the surface.\u2019 is what she had advised. &quot;Ok, your lawfulness.&quot; said Anon with a sigh. He resigned himself to just go with it. After all, Her Highness had assured him there was nothing sinister here.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Wonderful! Miss Clerk, will you please assist the Bailiff?&quot; asked the judge turning to her right.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Oh yes! I would love to!&quot; said the enthusiastic paper pusher.</span><br>Anon removed his tie, jacket, and shirt. He handed them off to the Clerk who, in turn, tossed them joyfully by mouth, one by one, into a pile behind the platform. Anon then held his hands out for the Bailiff.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Bailiff hesitated. &quot;Um, &#039;eehind &#039;ur &#039;ack, &#039;ip &#039;ooo p&#039;ease, M&#039;fter Anon.&quot;.

Moreover, since Mister Anon cannot do it, the defense and prosecution shall hold the components of his groin aloft during questioning. &#039;Aloft&#039;, for the purposes of this trial shall mean any point higher than that at which his, um, parts, usually dangle.&quot; The judge paused to see the effect of the pronouncement. &quot;Shall this be satisfactory to the defense and prosecution?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Certainly!&quot; said both lawyers in tandem with approving nods. Prosecutor X additionally licked her lips while eyeing Anon.</span><br>&#039;This is crazy! I can&#039;t believe this is even happening!&#039; Anon thought. He sighed and reasoned that he must go through with it, given that what he had to say would prove vital to the case. Once again, he noted nods, smiles, and exclamations of &quot;Yay!&quot; from the audience of winged yellow mares. The jury did the same, only they were also taking notes.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Bailiff and lawyers, who had trotted over to the witness platform while Anon had been lost in thought, went to work removing Anon&#039;s shoes, socks, belt, pants, and boxers. Between the three of them, and using a bit of teamwork, they managed to render Anon totally naked. In the process, Anon was certain that he felt Prosecutor X push her nose into his scrotum and the Bailiff sneak a tongue lick over his penis. While the Bailiff trotted back to her station, she looked back at Anon, made a lewd gesture with her tongue and gave him a wink. This confirmed Anon&#039;s suspicion.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Speaking civilly to Miss Defender for the first time during the trial, Prosecutor X suggested, &quot;Um, well, would you like to hold the upper part? I, well I, would like to hold the lower part, if you like.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Mmmm hmmm!&quot; replied Miss Defender.</span><br>Prosecutor X was the first to hold her portion aloft. As she raised her hoof, Anon felt his balls come to rest neatly in the hollow formed by her upturned hoof and horseshoe. Contrary to what he expected, it was pleasantly warm and he felt his pulse quicken. Miss Defender then raised her hoof beneath his penis. It came to rest, like a sausage on a platter, across her horseshoe. Again, it was unexpectedly warm and Anon could feel himself start to harden.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Both mares smiled at each other and let out little giggles. Prosecutor X then looked up at Anon. \u201cUm, Don\u2019t worry Mister Anon, we know they\u2019re sensitive.

Some raised their eyebrows suggestively, some winked, others licked their lips or made lewd gestures with their tongues, still others gazed dreamily at him, while still others blew kisses. Looking down at Prosecutor X, he was met by a truly salacious, but also truly endearing grin. She was gorgeous in her black dress and ruby earrings. She jiggled his balls and gave him a wink. Then he turned to look at Miss Defender. Equally lovely in her blue dress and sapphire earrings, she beamed back at him with a sensually suggestive, but warm smile. Leaning in, she gave the tip of his penis a brief teasing lick. Looking to Judge Fluttershy, he beheld her warm, loving expression.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;See Mister Anon?

It&#039;s not the most unique concept out there, sure, but looking at the amount of Luna&#039;s banishment fics that make it to the box, people don&#039;t mind seeing how different takes on the same ideas, provided the idea is good enough. And your take is pretty good, which helps.<br>One minor thing that I didn&#039;t find a great place to comment on is the color of the MC&#039;s <s>and his sister&#039;s</s> coats. There&#039;s a reason literally no regular pony in the show has a pure jet black coat. Of course, it&#039;s less jarring in a written form of content, but you might consider repainting them into a dark hue other than #000000. <br>Other than that, maybe you could mention that the assassin is from outside Equestria in one of his initial speeches. The fic does make that crystal clear later on, but having ponies who hail from outside the borders of Equestria is unusual enough that, in my opinion, it deserves an extra mention.<br><br><s>Having Celestia go full Galadriel (or Daybreaker, for a setting-appropriate comparison that I&#039;m assuming was the intended one) is a bit unexpected but I liked it. Maybe you could consider Celestia having a bit stronger reaction to her own outburst because her dialogue afterwards does read like &quot;oops, sorry, tbdesu kinda your fault, tho&quot; and those long blocks of dialogue present a perfect opportunity for her to do something.</s> I remember that you&#039;ve said that you prefer to have the ponies walk during a dialogue because it&#039;s easier to add action tags there. It&#039;s certainly visible here.<br><br>And even though yeah, the other anon might be right that the ending is obvious about halfway through the fic, that isn&#039;t a problem. It&#039;s obvious because it&#039;s a good ending that makes sense for Celestia to steer the action towards.

They hurried off to fetch their weapons.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor spotted a more welcome face and ran over. She put herself in Buygra&#039;s path, panting.</span><br>&quot;[You have to come!]&quot; she gasped. &quot;[They have Xuan! Xuan is gone! We have to go find her!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This made the hunter hesitate. He looked after Willow and the others and jerked his body as if to follow them. Mayor butted his thigh with her head and he took a step back.</span><br>&quot;[Come! Xuan! There is no time!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She pranced in place until the man cursed and began to ran toward his tent. She breathed a sigh of relief and followed.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It occurred to her that Buygra would be outnumbered, but he was a good shot with the bow and that would surely even the odds. Besides, her plan was to sneak around the groups of attacking men and try to follow Xuan. They would have taken her out of the camp as directly as possible, she guessed. Maybe they could head them off.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She had to be in time! She simply had to! She wouldn&#039;t let Guuni lose her mother!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It wasn&#039;t long after that she stood, trembling, by Buygra&#039;s side as he held his bow, drawn. Four men had tried to rush him and the first one fell with an arrow through his eye. It had been a lucky shot, but the others didn&#039;t know that.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; They&#039;d stopped and were milling around in confusion. Mayor wondered whether they would charge again, when one of they, barely older than Salki she gauged, turned and ran.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; One of the others twisted to yell curses after his escaping comrade and Buygra released his arrow.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It wasn&#039;t as accurate as the previous one, but it hit the man in the belly and he went down with a bloodcurdling scream. He kept yelling and thrashed around on the ground, but he wouldn&#039;t fight anymore, so Buygra aimed his next shot at the last man.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; His opponent, suddenly alone, dropped his spear and ran. The arrow missed him, but Mayor didn&#039;t think he would be back. The fear in his eyes had been all too real. She remembered that this was an entirely new, frighteningly effective weapon.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Buygra went forward, giving a wide berth to the fallen warrior who was still screaming as he clutched the arrow protruding from his belly. Mayor tried not to look and pressed her ears as flat as she could to tune out the pained cries as she followed.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; More of the camp&#039;s nomads were now awake and fighting the intruders. Most of them had spears, since bows were quite rare and the skill to shoot them rarer still. There was shouting of several melees nearby and Mayor nudged Buygra&#039;s thigh with her muzzle to guide him away from the worst fighting.</span>", "time": 1669313177, "resto": 39256661, "trip": "!!Ojw0rGjSZOI"}, {"no": 39338924, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:07:19", "name": "AspiringWritefag", "com": "<a href=\"#p39338921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39338921</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; A few times they came across a scrap and the young hunter dropped arrows into the strangers. The men thus freed from fighting hurried off to find their friends and families, despite Mayor and Buygra&#039;s shouts for help.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; They were almost at the edge and Mayor couldn&#039;t wrap her mind around how many attackers had come. It felt as if the entire camp was involved in the little war. She couldn&#039;t see any direction that was safe.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The only piece of luck was that most of the women and children had been at the bonfire, well away from the outskirts. Otherwise the slaughter would have been much worse.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Oh, and Guuni and Ayaulym were fine. The fighting hadn&#039;t spread that far by the time she and Buygra had made it to their tent, and the young man told his mother in law in no uncertain terms that she was to take the child directly to the bonfire.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor had acquired a torch and lit the scene she&#039;d found earlier. The spear which had missed her was gone, as was the one which had scraped her flank, but the sticks were still where she&#039;d found them.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[Here! Bring the light here!]&quot; Buygra said, studying the ground intently. Mayor obliged with the torch and the young hunter furrowed his brow.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She tried to see what he was seeing, but the ground didn&#039;t look any different to her. Same well-trodden mud as everywhere in the camp.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Eventually Buygra pointed. &quot;[Here, I think. There was a struggle. They must have grabbed her and dragged her away. See the furrows where she kicked and dragged?]&quot; </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor tried again to see, but she might as well been trying to read tracks in water for all that she could identify.</span><br>&quot;[No. Sorry.]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She tried to bend down and sniff the ground, careful not to smother the torch in her mouth, and thought she caught a faint whiff of Xuan. Unfortunately it was hard to be sure whether it was real or just wistful thinking.</span><br>&quot;[Sorry,]&quot; she said again.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Buygra crept closer, still intently watching the ground and she followed close after him. They were both so engrossed in the trail that neither of them noticed the stranger.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor heard him first as the warrior ran for them, his spear arm already pulling back to strike.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; All she had time for was yelp, which caused her to drop the torch. Buygra began to turn and fumbled for his bow, but it would be too late.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The warrior glanced at her and their eyes met. He dismissed her and turned his attention fully to Buygra.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; That gave Mayor a chance. She didn&#039;t think and, fueled by fear and adrenaline, twisted her body around. She dug her forehooves into the soft mud and lashed out blindly with her hind hooves.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Their attacker hadn&#039;t been expecting that and couldn&#039;t change his direction in time. Her hooves connected and there was a sickening crunch.</span>", "time": 1669313239, "resto": 39256661, "trip": "!!Ojw0rGjSZOI"}, {"no": 39338928, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:08:20", "name": "AspiringWritefag", "com": "<a href=\"#p39338924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39338924</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The spear clattered harmlessly against Buygra&#039;s half-raised bow and the stranger went flying back.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor was an earth pony and she hadn&#039;t held back. Her muscles had been toned with months and months of gruelling physical labor. Even as he fell, the man sprayed blood from his mouth and nose.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; When he landed with a dull thud he didn&#039;t move again.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor stared with wide eyes and panted. Then she began to shake. She saw a bubble of red blood grow from the fallen man&#039;s nose, then pop. All was still. His chest didn&#039;t move.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; He was dead.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She&#039;d killed him.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[Fuck, well done,]&quot; Buygra said with a noticeable tone of admiration in his voice.
