You know the answer to this question deep down in spite of all the mental gymnastics you use to deny it. The Mane Six are too attitudinally safe and unfun for her.

groan in annoyance and unbuckle yourself as you gently begin floating upwards in the lack of gravity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not that this piece of space junk has any gravity anyways, even with the reactor online</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Using one of your hooves to hold yourself to your captain&#039;s chair you align yourself carefully to the door at the back</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A gentle push propels you forward, carrying your lithe form through the cabin before seconds later you touch opposite end</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Taking holf of one of the many pipes moving along the wall you pull yourself to the airlock carefully and press the button next to it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frowning, you glare at the stubborn door and the fact that the emergency power decided to crap out on you as well</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In frustration you decide it is a great idea to kick the door, just to realize that every action has an equal reaction and in space there is nothing to stop you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Going for a backwards tumble you flail your helpless hooves and even try flapping your wings to no avail</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No air and no gravity means your feathery (albeit covered by your flight suit) appendages are basically useless anyways</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Slamming head first into the console you attempt to rub your snout before remembering that, yeah, you have a helmet on and for good reason</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sadly, while slamming onto your controls usually seems to work wonders, your little crash has done nothing but... broken off a small switch that now floats between your eyes</span><br>&quot;Great, absolutely fucking amazing&quot;, you shout as you slam down a hoof on the console, immediately regretting it<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This time you were wise to hold yourself against one of the bars mounted to the console so you don&#039;t get thrown away, but now your hoof is hurting like a bitch</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cursing, you turn back around and push yourself off again, much less graceful this time as your irritation gets the better of you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Holding on to the wheel that serves as an override to the airlock&#039;s door, you begin to turn it with all the might that your quite frankly not exactly trained muscles can muster</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In absolute silence you struggle but eventually the probably rusted wheel begins to turn and the door slowly slides open</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Squeezing through the small gap you&#039;ve managed to create you struggle a bit as your hindquarters decide to hinder your progress for just a few seconds</span>", "filename": "owos", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 814, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 158, "tim": 1669913180169601, "time":

class=\"quote\">&gt;Just a little bit of manual control and some additional, cheap sensors and you&#039;re able to keep the Sparkle Drive from overloading while charging it up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A broken Sparkle controller is highly illegal, so what does a bit of modding of the ship matter?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quite a lot, actually, especially in the Pegasus Quadrant</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If any of security ship inspectors ever set hoof on this... you can&#039;t even call it a ship, you&#039;d probably be out of

class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, mostly it wouldn&#039;t be your flank on the line but you are sure that you&#039;d... never get to fly again if they found out</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But you&#039;ve been flying this thing for about 3 years now and no pony but you has ever stepped hoof on here</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, while you were on it, at least, this ship cost the

Could work you completely senseless until you were the herd slut.&quot;<br>You move yourself up above her, still holding your clawful of mare cum in your claws which was starting to drip through the cracks in them.<br>&quot;After all that you must be pretty thirsty, here~.&quot;<br>You offer them to her. She stares at it for a moment before taking your claws and gently taking the mare cum to her lips, her throat flexing as she drinks it down and lets out a satisfied &#039;aah&#039; once it was all gone. With that done your own needs explode to the forefront with a needy mewl clawing it&#039;s way up your throat, your feathers ruffled and raised. You shoot your claws down to your griffonhood and start pumping away at a record pace. Nickle smirks up at you as she sits herself up a bit, her forehooves reaching up to gently pull your claws away from your nethers though there is some resistance from you at this.<br>&quot;I believe I remember promising that I&#039;ll return the favor.&quot;<br>You look at her in confusion which turns into surprise as she flips you around and wraps her left foreleg around you to pin you to her, your lower back being greeted by her teats. Her left hoof which was pinning you to her starts to rub at your teats while her right hoof reaches down to your snatch, rubbing the outside of your folds with the frog of her hoof for a moment before placing the tip of her hoof to your entrance and pressing down, sinking her hoof in where she starts to rub you back and forth, your tail matching the quick pace she immediately sets.<br>&quot;You finished me off twice in this session. Let me do the work for you once at least~.&quot;<br><br>What do you do?", "time": 1669925551, "resto": 39355348}], "last_modified": 1669925551}, {"no": 39358225, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)16:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "New G5 Game: Merge Magic", "com": "This is like what, the 5th new G5 game we&#039;ve gotten?

It affects whoever\u2019s looking at it at the moment one of the buttons is pressed. And if your theory was correct</span><br>\u201cWell the watch still works. Maybe it\u2019s a one button at a time thing, or a sequence. How do you feel Sunburst?\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI\u2019m fine Sir.\u201d Sunburst replied in a monotone, still staring blankly ahead.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So that was it. Maybe? You had to point the watch at somepony and then it would take effect.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But then again, it didn\u2019t work when you were looking into the watch before and hit the first button.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Was there a time limit or something?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There was a lot about this watch you didn\u2019t really understand, but at least Sunburst was talking while being affected by it now.</span><br>\u201cWhy are you just standing around then? I thought you\u2019d say something about me using the watch on you.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dYou\u2019ve not told me what to do.\u201d</span><br>\u201cSo you need me to give you an order then?\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dYes, Sir.\u201d</span><br>\u201cCare to explain why you need me to give you an order?\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dBecause, Sir, you activated the watch on me. Therefore I must obey your orders.\u201d</span><br>\u201cSo you need me to give you orders because I activated the watch? Do you know anything else about the watch? Like why it just froze you before but now you\u2019re all chatty?\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dI do not know Sir. This is the first time I can recall ever seeing the watch.\u201d</span><br>\u201cHmph, well I\u2019m liking the way you call me sir right now. Why don\u2019t you do that when you\u2019re not all roboty?\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dUnderstood, I will refer to you as Sir from now on.\u201d</span><br>\u201cUh, right then.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was supposed to be a joke, but it looks like Sunburst wasn\u2019t able to tell when he was like this.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You turned back to the watch in your hoof. Talking to the monotone Sunburst had been enlightening, but it was also off-putting a bit. You just wanted to see if pressing the </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Click.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cEh, did I freeze up again Sir?\u201d Sunburst asks as he blinks and then turns to face us.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So he doesn\u2019t remember what happened while he was under? But he\u2019s still calling you Sir happily. </span><br>\u201cYeah, though you were all weird that time. Saying everything in a monotone and asking me for orders. You started calling me sir while you were like that, and now you\u2019re doing it when you\u2019re not acting like a dead fish.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dI have?

Meanwhile the third hand with a red gemstone was sitting comfortably at the 12 position unmoving.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dIt might be that the watch affects ponies\u2019 memories and minds, Sir. If it\u2019s an artifact that forces ponies to obey your orders sir, we\u2019ll need to inform Princess Cadence and Shining Armor immediately.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He was right. An artifact like the watch was a threat to national security. The fact that it came from Sombra\u2019s vault made it even more so. The Princess and the Crystal Guard needed to be ready and waiting in case something happened because of it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But despite that.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...you just didn\u2019t feel like giving up the watch.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ideas were just coming into your head about just what you could do with it. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hell, if you could use it on your players, they\u2019d stop breaking character all the damn time in the middle of important moments in the campaign.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And if it made ponies think they were following your orders of their own volition...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ch-chack. The pink gemstone stopped at the 12 position alongside the red with a soft noise. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was soft, so you doubted he heard the sound over your words. </span><br>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I understand Sunburst.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With that, you pointed the watch at him again. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Click. Tick. tick. Tick. tick.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So it was still working now. So was it a time limit thing then? Or just the watch needing to be wound back up?</span><br>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we fully document the watch\u2019s effects before we run off to warn Shining and the Princess?

Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to wait on informing them?
