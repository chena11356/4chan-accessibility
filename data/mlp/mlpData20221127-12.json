They are much more mellow and have much more feminine traits so that their friendships with the others still feels natural, they doesn&#039;t come off as the token tomboy like Rainbow Dash does.<br><br>Rainbow Dash has the personality of a typical loud male jock and yet she is friends with feminine girls who have completely different temperaments and interests than her. She has never been shown with tomboy or male friends that have her type of temperament. She comes off as a forced token tomboy character. Like really, they couldn&#039;t give her a single male friend? She has the masculine temperament of guys, so it seems like she would have definitely have male friends. Heck, she acts a lot more like your average male than your average female.<br><br>Where are her friends that are not vastly different from her? I&#039;m not even necessarily asking for the same interests, just for a similar temperment. The rest of them are all chill normies in spite of varying interests while Rainbow is just alone as the loud brash hyper dude bro. And yet she magically is on the same footing as the rest as best friends, and appears to have no other close friends. If you had a jock friend who acted like Rainbow Dash but is a male, would you be able to see them as best friends with people with the mane six&#039;s temperment? Of course not.<br><br>In a real life setting like high school or college, what group of people could you more naturally see Rainbow Dash hanging out and bonding with: A group of brash, mascaline troublemakers (whether male or tomboys) who are athletic and enjoy screwing around, or the feminine safe mane six? You know the answer to this question deep down in spite of all the mental gymnastics you use to deny it. The Mane Six are too attitudinally safe and unfun for her. Her placement in the show is forced and has always been forced. But people don&#039;t care because they like tomboys.

it&#039;ll be quick. Today&#039;s an exceptionally special day as it marks 10 years since Milky Way&#039;s Tumblr started. The tumblr is now age-restricted but you can view the posts here starting from the back: https://www.tumbex.com/milkmare-of-<wbr>trottingham.tumblr/posts?page=10<br><br>Milky&#039;s special talent quickly gained the blog over 1400 watchers in less than two weeks. It was especially embraced on /mlp/ where the thread generated several times more content than the tumblr which was only in its second day: https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/<wbr>5678650/#q5678650 Milky had a continuous presence for months afterwards as a general thread.<br><br>Fast forward to May 2013 and it was on its 71st general thread: https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/<wbr>10866090/#q10866090 The thread was deleted early and the incident shrugged off, but unbeknownst to them it was right before some of the most eventful days in /mlp/ history. Lauren Faust would visit /mlp/ a few days later https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/1<wbr>0902082/ and all hell broke loose, even prompting a reply from Moot (https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/<wbr>10902082/500/3/#q10906860). But attention quickly turned to &quot;The Scruffening&quot;, a mass deletion of various threads and general confusion over the following days. Milky Way threads were quickly deleted from then on, later confirmed as bannable content due to its NSFW nature: https://desuarchive.org/q/thread/64<wbr>0332/#q641855 Some claimed that Lauren&#039;s visit sparked the sudden SFW enforcement but this remains inconclusive.<br><br>Milky Way threads have occasionally been posted over the years, lasting only a few minutes to several hours at a time.
