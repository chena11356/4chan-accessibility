Lauren Faust would visit /mlp/ a few days later https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/1<wbr>0902082/ and all hell broke loose, even prompting a reply from Moot (https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/<wbr>10902082/500/3/#q10906860). But attention quickly turned to &quot;The Scruffening&quot;, a mass deletion of various threads and general confusion over the following days. Milky Way threads were quickly deleted from then on, later confirmed as bannable content due to its NSFW nature: https://desuarchive.org/q/thread/64<wbr>0332/#q641855 Some claimed that Lauren&#039;s visit sparked the sudden SFW enforcement but this remains inconclusive.<br><br>Milky Way threads have occasionally been posted over the years, lasting only a few minutes to several hours at a time.

She would deal with the aftermath later, once she&#039;d had some time to think and get to grips with what had happened.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She lowered her head and tried to make her legs stop shivering. Luckily Salki stepped out of the tent again and when Mayor risked a glance upward she saw his face was dark an angry.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[Mother said you insulted her, and you wouldn&#039;t listen to her instructions. She said you&#039;re like a spoiled child.]&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Despite having expected something very much like he said, it still made Mayor sputter and she almost turned back to go and give Darga a piece of her mind. She would have, too, but Salki leaned down and put a hand on her back.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[No, don&#039;t. Come on, let&#039;s get you cleaned up and you can tell me your side of it.]&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; At least he hadn&#039;t automatically believed his mother, Mayor thought to herself.

[cunt], but maybe the son could be salvaged.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; In that moment Mayor decided to help him become chieftain. The sooner he could do so, the sooner she could stop dealing with Darga.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She hurried to fall instep with the young man and gratefully pressed her flank against his thigh.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; ~~~~</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The pair were sitting some distance from the camp in a patch of young, green grass, bathed in the warm afternoon sun.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor felt clean, and despite the residual pains around her back and flanks, better than she had since yesterday.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; That whole mess - the hunt and how she&#039;d acted, and what she&#039;d done - that would stay with her for a long while and she would pay for it many times over with sleepless nights and moments of horror when a memory forced itself into her consciousness. She shook her head to dislodge the latest image and went on with her story.</span><br>&quot;[That is what happened. I only wanted sleep. I didn&#039;t sleep in the night, but she called me a beast.]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor turned tear-filled eyes on Salki, who hadn&#039;t said a word for the last while and was staring thoughtfully at the distant horizon.</span><br>&quot;[It was not fair!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Her shoulders shook as she repeated it again to herself, in a whisper.</span><br>&quot;[Ponies don&#039;t kill!

I&#039;m wrong!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She felt the wail coming back and tried very hard to keep it suppressed, but the pressure released in a series of snorts and sniffles despite her best efforts.</span><br>&quot;[I did those things! I did what pony should never do, Salki! He hit me and he beat me and he yelled! There was death and blood!

She put her muzzle in the warm grass and sobbed miserably.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She was dimly aware of Salki&#039;s hand in her mane as he sought for her ears to scratch behind them. He knew it always comforted her, but it wasn&#039;t working this time.

We have to hunt, Meyermer, or we starve! Nomads can&#039;t live only on vegetables, we need meat. It was just a hunt!]&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor Mare shook her head, which dislodged his hand for a moment, but it came right back, more insistent than a biting insect, but at least far more pleasant than that.</span><br>&quot;[Not for me!]&quot; she wailed, &quot;[I am not- I am not that! Ponies don&#039;t kill! I never killed something! I never- until yesterday.]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She knew he had a hard time understanding. For him, and for his entire species it seemed, this was simply the way of life. They hunted, they killed and they ate. It was how their world worked.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; They couldn&#039;t see anything wrong.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Perhaps, ironically, Mayor thought, Willow had come the closest to understanding just how revolted she felt about physical violence. How else could she explain his perverse delight in making her hunt?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; His shouting and the beating the previous day, the confusion of the hunt and his insistence to stay with her, had all been aimed at making her kill. He&#039;d known, or guessed, just how much it would hurt her inside.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor wished she could make Salki understand too.</span><br>&quot;[You don&#039;t understand!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[Then explain it to me!]&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She thought about it for a while in silence, while he rubbed her ears. The noise of fingers sliding through fur allowed her to ignore the world for a little while and Mayor closed her eyes.</span><br>&quot;[Saule! Would you kill Saule?]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The scratching stopped and Salki drew a sharp breath in sudden surprise. &quot;[What!? What kind of question is that? You know I wouldn&#039;t!]&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor lifted her head and treated the young nomad to a piercing glare.</span><br>&quot;[What if Willow beat you?

I hate him, but I hate myself more!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It seemed as if Salki didn&#039;t have a response to that. Mayor watched him in silence for a while, then heaved a sign and lowered her muzzle back down. She was grateful when he slid his hand down to her withers and began rubbing in small, comforting circles.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[Maybe,]&quot; he said at last. &quot;[Maybe I understand. Ponies are not killers. You don&#039;t like it. I remember when you were talking about the bow, how your face got sad and your ears got floppy.]&quot;</span><br>&quot;[Yes.]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; There was more silence and then Salki shifted uncomfortably. He switched the topic: &quot;[You shouldn&#039;t have called Mother what you did. You shouldn&#039;t have fought her. She will make it hard for you. Harder.]&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She was reminded of that horrible, miserable exchange and Mayor&#039;s lip curled back in a sneer.</span><br>&quot;[I don&#039;t fucking care!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This got another sigh out of the young nomad. &quot;[Meyermer, don&#039;t. She doesn&#039;t understand. Just- apologize when we get back, okay? I&#039;m sure she will let you stay in the tent.]&quot;</span><br>&quot;[I don&#039;t care,]&quot; Mayor repeated.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[Please! Where will you go otherwise?]&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She hadn&#039;t thought about that so she blurted out the first thing she could think of.</span><br>&quot;[I&#039;ll live with Xuan! Her daughter likes me, I will help watch the child! I will sleep outside before I apologize! Darga had no right to-]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This statement made Salki draw back with a growl and he interrupted: &quot;[She had every right! She&#039;s chieftain and what the chieftain says, goes! You still aren&#039;t really one of us, Meyermer, you&#039;re a slave! You do what you&#039;re told, immediately, understand?]&quot;</span>", "time": 1668719312, "resto": 39256661, "trip": "!!Ojw0rGjSZOI"}, {"no": 39314868, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:09:33", "name": "AspiringWritefag", "com": "<a href=\"#p39314864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39314864</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor Mare opened her mouth to curse him out as well, to spit at him and walk away, but she thought better of it. She couldn&#039;t alienate her closest ally in the camp, not when she might need him the most to intercede with his mother.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; As much as she hated that sneaky little political thought, it was true. She abhorred both Darga and Willow, but she still had to live with them. There wasn&#039;t any choice.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She closed her eyes and mentally let it go.</span><br>&quot;[I won&#039;t apologize. You can apologize if you want, I will not. I know what I am and I know what I bring. If Darga wants more Equestrian miracles she will treat me better! Otherwise I will go to Intor instead.]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mayor could hardly believe the words her own muzzle was spouting, but she knew they were true. Things had changed so much that she would rather ally herself with Intor than crawl on her belly before Darga.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; That would mean dealing with Willow, but maybe that could be tolerated. She&#039;d noticed how Intor had been getting annoyed and fed up with Willow&#039;s antics, now that the position of top hunter was gradually slipping away from him.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The nomad just wasn&#039;t any good with a bow, and that counted for a lot when so many others were demonstrating just how useful this new weapon could be.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; With luck, Salki might soon be eligible for that prestigious title. Maybe Mayor could work with Intor if they both disliked Willow.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Neither of them had spoken in a while, so the mare broke the silence.</span><br>&quot;[Fuck,]&quot; she swore quietly. &quot;[Talk to your mother. She doesn&#039;t have to apologize, but neither will I. Tell her we can forget it happened.]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It was the most Mayor was willing to do. She knew what an apology to a slave would do for Darga&#039;s reputation in the camp. Her grasp on the chieftain&#039;s position was tenuous and many nomads were clamoring for a man to lead them.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She was, in fact, slightly stronger now that Salki was proving to be an excellent hunter, which was all thanks to the bow and thus came back full circle to Mayor Mare. The woman really should have shown a bit more gratitude.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Still, their little spat had been entirely stupid, mostly because Mayor hadn&#039;t been in her right mind, so she was willing to forget, this time.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;[I&#039;ll tell her, but she won&#039;t like it.]&quot;</span><br>&quot;[Tough! I don&#039;t care. I know more Equestrian secrets. She will accept it if she wants them!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Salki opened his mouth again, but Mayor groaned in exasperation and headed him off:</span><br>&quot;[I not want to talk about it more! Something else, please!]&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; He fell silent, then obliged and changed the topic again: &quot;[What did you think of Xuan&#039;s daughter?]&quot;</span>", "time": 1668719373, "resto": 39256661, "trip": "!!Ojw0rGjSZOI"}, {"no": 39314874, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:11:19", "name": "AspiringWritefag", "com": "<a href=\"#p39314868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;39314868</a><br><br>Oh, ouch, it just keeps getting worse and worse.

I see you\u2019re up for the challenge, though.\u201d<br>The guild mare gives a wink to your huge alchemist friend.<br><br>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d Pear Plum speaks up again. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, what I mean to ask was\u2026 well, do you know why these ents got so vindictive? This is highly unhabitual for them to even leave their woods, let alone attack ponies at random.\u201d<br>\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s time to solve this mystery.\u201d The mare from the guild shakes her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened and couldn\u2019t find any clues. I strongly suggest you put them out of their misery. They\u2019re just too dangerous for everypony at this point.\u201d<br>\u201cOh, uhm\u2026\u201d Pear Plum falls silent, but you can tell she\u2019s not happy with what she was told.<br><br>This story sounds a bit fishy to you too.

trying and failing to have sex with Anon, the only human in Equestria. While the title implies that it is Fluttershy trying to rape Anon, others may follow in her stead and attempt their own versions of rape. There are different versions of Flutterrape, but most are light-hearted comedies about the ponies failing in their attempts to get into Anon\u2019s pants. Just because your story has Anon in it, doesn&#039;t mean it fits in this thread.

I\u2019ll explain my personal rankings below.<br><br>Teens React to MLP: S Tier - Absolutely hilarious and perfectly executed. They critiqued the video well while also not taking themselves seriously at all and providing a bunch of hilarious lines. This series could not have started off better.<br><br>Derpy/College Humor My Little Brony: C Tier - Mainly just a discussion about these topics. Cool time capsules and the guys made good points, but besides that not much interesting or comedic here.<br><br>Cupcakes: B Tier - Only first few minutes are reactions to the actual video, which were hilarious. The rest of it is just a discussion about it. Pretty fun overall, especially Saberspark\u2019s disgust.<br><br>Season 2 Finale/Season 3 Premiere: A Tier - First couple episode reactions, and very fun. I wish they were a bit longer and they feel a bit rushed. However, that is understandable since these was the first ones, and its really cool to see all these guys react first time to such old episodes<br><br>Season 3 Finale: S Tier - We have now hit the sweet spot in the pacing of the episode reacts. Has enough reactions so that everything interesting is covered without feeling rushed but few enough so that it doesn\u2019t drag on and is very rewatchable. AcRacebest\u2019s theories and how he edited those segments were the highlight here. The gold standard to follow for these.<br><br>Equestria Girls Trailer: A Tier - Really good mix of comedy and serious discussion on the topic at hand. An interesting variety of takes, with a good overall message about how the drama was overblown and the best solution was to wait and see if the movie would be good. <br><br>Equestria Girls Movie: S Tier - Once again, great pacing for an episode react, and since this movie is so easy to make fun of they had great material to work with. And BlackGryph0n literally skydived on video just to complain about Flash Sentry. Nuff said.
