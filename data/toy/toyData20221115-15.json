Joy Toy just announced this new male figure for their Frontline Chaos line, which is a welcome move. He\u2019s a bit more low tech than the Frontline Chaos girls, hopefully this means more guys in the future, and more stuff from this line. I\u2019ll post some other pics of the Frontline Chaos line here, but VToys just teased a new knight- potentially Bloodborne/Souls inspired.", "filename": "322FD080-9CC1-4147-B890-64FEC786DE72", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 1113, "tn_w": 190, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668269779082810, "time": 1668269779, "md5": "tPNzRRQ9uk0eprthgZO/yw==", "fsize": 124573, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "112-clothed-general", "replies": 28, "images": 16, "omitted_posts": 23, "omitted_images": 12, "last_replies": [{"no": 10141815, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)21:51:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10141791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10141791</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lim toy</span><br>Nice, but prepare for a wait.", "time": 1668480703, "resto": 10137943}, {"no": 10142626, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)12:57:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hiya Toys EXQUISITE SUPER series", "filename": "1658337432630", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668535060611216, "time": 1668535060, "md5": "SUda+3DjFCFZe985q+T4qg==", "fsize": 385283, "resto": 10137943}, {"no": 10142628, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)12:58:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10142626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10142626</a>", "filename": "1653151598036", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668535122654775, "time": 1668535122, "md5": "r6nN5LnMlcO5hXQx/l7N8w==", "fsize": 378734, "resto": 10137943}, {"no": 10142630, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)12:59:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10142628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10142628</a>", "filename": "1648656564282", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668535183987158, "time": 1668535183, "md5": "A40bX720kckgbh1TJnKzBQ==", "fsize": 322336, "resto": 10137943}, {"no": 10142632, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:00:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10142630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10142630</a>", "filename": "1640275194573", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668535245494656, "time": 1668535245, "md5": "yD9mOWRhX4Bpj4+GOc17Cg==", "fsize": 259047, "resto": 10137943}], "last_modified": 1668535245}, {"no": 10116957, "now": "10/29/22(Sat)21:39:37", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "NECA General: Playing Games", "com": "Previous thread: <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;10087198</span><br><br>In stores and online:<br>Gremlins 2 carded Mogwai<br>Universal Monsters Mummy Accessory Set<br>Universal Monsters Remco retro carded glow in the dark Mummy, Frankenstein Monster, Wolfman<br>Ultimate Robocop<br>Ultimate Battle Damaged Robocop (with chair)<br>Ultimate Radiation Suit Doc Brown<br>Defenders of Earth Mandrake<br>Defenders of Earth Lothar<br>Aliens Fireteam Elite Prowler<br>Aliens Fireteam Elite Runner<br>Aliens Fireteam Elite Spitter<br>Aliens Fireteam Elite Burster<br>Gremlins 2 Demolition 2-pack<br>Toony Terrors American Werewolf in London<br>Toony Terrors Halloween III Trick or Treaters<br>TMNT x Universal Monsters Leonardo as The Hunchback<br>TMNT x Universal Monsters April as The Bride<br>TMNT x Universal Monsters Michelangelo as The Mummy<br>TMNT movie Secret of the Ooze Shredder (Walmart)<br>TMNT movie Secret of the Ooze Turtles 2-packs (Walmart, Leo, Mikey, Raph, Donnie)<br>Toon TMNT Neutrinos 3-pack<br>Toon TMNT Tokka &amp; Rahzar<br>Toon TMNT Usagi Yojimbo<br>Toon TMNT Zach (the 5th turtle) and Smash<br>Toon TMNT Rock Soldiers &amp; Crooked Ninja Turtle Gang Member<br>Disney&#039;s Gargoyles Demona<br>Disney&#039;s Gargoyles Bronx<br>Disney&#039;s Gargoyles Hudson", "filename": "FgRpfhpXEAI8iNi", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1350, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1667093977585697, "time": 1667093977, "md5": "31Ds9HxsCjDfFTYcj3bFDw==", "fsize": 157455, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "neca-general-playing-games", "replies": 265, "images": 47, "omitted_posts": 260, "omitted_images": 47, "last_replies": [{"no": 10142572, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)12:07:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How&#039;s the ultimate robocop figure?

There were issues in both that wound up not being apparent for years because the order window to when they came out was so long. I don&#039;t even remember if I had my raptors in hand when I ordered the triceratops figures. Also, &quot;they&#039;re all repaints&quot; they&#039;re actually not, which was one of my biggest criticisms with the line once it became apparent that each KS was going to take 2-3 years to come out. Spending all that time and money on barely different sculpts was and is a waste. Anyway my issue wasn&#039;t ever really with you, just saying when I had so many figures I&#039;m well aware of their issues so someone coming in 5 years later with a &quot;I just bought this figure maybe it&#039;s different&quot; really didn&#039;t do anything for me.

I do get what you mean though in terms of how long it takes waves to come out and all that, I understand it&#039;s just one guy and some chinese factory workers basically rather than a proper toy company, but it&#039;s taken 6-7 years since the line was announced before you could make an obligatory &quot;T.Rex vs. Triceratops&quot; sort of display.<br>I understand the whole &quot;re-use molds for other figures&quot; thing, it makes sense, and I&#039;m sure theres budget reasons per-line, but it&#039;s still annoying.

They are hard PVC-like plastic with some flexibility to them. As I expected soaking them in hot water makes them completely bendable and they will hold their shape once cooled down (pic related, before and after wrapping around the included figure). As they remain slightly flexible overbending is recommended to get tight grabs. The tentacles have different lengths, which straightened out they vary from 10 to 15cm. 2 of the tentacles have &quot;grabber&quot; tips, the others classic rounded tips.<br><br>The pegs and pegholes used for the tentacles are all the same shape and size so you can freely mix and match positions as you please, even if the instructions specify a specific order. However the tentacles are prone to falling off when inserted cold. Instead you want to heat up the pegs which gives them way a better fit. The instructions don&#039;t mention this which explains all the complaints from angry parents. As for movement, it only allows for rotation.<br><br>The mouth and teeth are soft PVC. The mouth&#039;s opening is 27mm wide and 22mm tall. The body is hard plastic and hollow. Measured from the mouth it goes 86mm deep. The sculpt has a lot of details which would benefit from a wash. <br><br>At \u20ac15 (\u20ac10 post gift card) I&#039;d say it makes for a nice affordable option for degenerate uses.

I hope they keep that and carry it through the other figures. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok-<wbr>eNr0Yc0c&amp;ab_channel=LooseCollectorC<wbr>ollectibles", "filename": "Screen Shot 2022-08-24 at 10.39.38 AM", "ext": ".png", "w": 1976, "h": 1838, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 232, "tim": 1661352089510422, "time": 1661352089, "md5": "SDwY4OkHr+SLpHJdAUiZBQ==", "fsize": 3462972, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "loosecollector-executive-replicas-figures", "replies": 173, "images": 51, "omitted_posts": 168, "omitted_images": 50, "last_replies": [{"no": 10134294, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)17:23:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10134273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10134273</a><br>Ravioli ravioli show us the areole", "time": 1668032587, "resto": 10004576}, {"no": 10134316, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)17:38:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10134273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10134273</a><br>Need to see the extremes of posing on her.
