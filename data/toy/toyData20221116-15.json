The story is not any dumber than a Marvel movie, it just has dialogue that sounds like a kid&#039;s show.

Sure, you could argue it&#039;s military propaganda, but with how much everyone in the USA hates each other right now is it really such a bad thing to have a story about very different people who all work together because they love their country?

You just finish the build with a coat. But yea it will still work, have a wet q-tip handy if a piece dosnt wanna move, slap the q-tip on it and it will become loose. Just throwing out there how I do slides- cut out n soak for about a minute, fish it out with beauty tweezers, the kind where one side angles to a point, lay the slide where you want and use a dull toothpick to slide off the decal and re-arange it, but a q-tip works also- roll out the water with a dry q-tip, apply a lil mark set, wait a day and topcoat. Sorry about my tangent, just want to help those interested in watersides. Mr mark softer is rarely needed, it mainly slightly melts the decal to bend around shapes or separated pieces, and the need for that hardly comes up.

The manga will be about the everyday life of Polys and will also give more details about them. We should hopefully be getting more news on following releases soon as we only have 2 figures up at the moment. <br><br>As always, here is the assistance e-mail for those who need it, so if any problem should arise, feel free to contact them over at &quot;user_support@mile-stone.jp&quot; or the shop you purchased the figure from.<br><br>Once again, feel free to share your photos and adventures, they add life and some fun to the thread. Also, welcome newcomers, we hope you enjoy your stay.<br><br>Last Thread:<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9793845</span>", "filename": "Polynian General - Back in Black Again", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1284, "h": 2220, "tn_w": 144, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1658002437015, "time": 1658002437, "md5": "aPq59WUlKcT0YBaySbN5sw==", "fsize": 323097, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "daibadipolynian-general-back-in-black-again", "trip": "!2ijLsbucRg", "replies": 315, "images": 111, "omitted_posts": 310, "omitted_images": 109, "last_replies": [{"no": 10142551, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:38:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10131873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10131873</a><br><a href=\"#p10131885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10131885</a><br>Where did you get these cute clothes from?", "time": 1668530301, "resto": 9915215}, {"no": 10142892, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)16:26:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10142551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10142551</a><br>I could be mistaken, but they look like Pico Neemo stuff to me.", "time": 1668547580, "resto": 9915215}, {"no": 10143324, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)21:49:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10142551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10142551</a><br><a href=\"#p10142892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10142892</a><br>yup, both piconimo<br>ribbon bra and shorts set and short sleeve sailor uniform set 2", "time": 1668566944, "resto": 9915215}, {"no": 10143430, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)23:37:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Got my Olivier in today!

They are hard PVC-like plastic with some flexibility to them. As I expected soaking them in hot water makes them completely bendable and they will hold their shape once cooled down (pic related, before and after wrapping around the included figure). As they remain slightly flexible overbending is recommended to get tight grabs. The tentacles have different lengths, which straightened out they vary from 10 to 15cm. 2 of the tentacles have &quot;grabber&quot; tips, the others classic rounded tips.<br><br>The pegs and pegholes used for the tentacles are all the same shape and size so you can freely mix and match positions as you please, even if the instructions specify a specific order. However the tentacles are prone to falling off when inserted cold. Instead you want to heat up the pegs which gives them way a better fit. The instructions don&#039;t mention this which explains all the complaints from angry parents. As for movement, it only allows for rotation.<br><br>The mouth and teeth are soft PVC. The mouth&#039;s opening is 27mm wide and 22mm tall. The body is hard plastic and hollow. Measured from the mouth it goes 86mm deep. The sculpt has a lot of details which would benefit from a wash. <br><br>At \u20ac15 (\u20ac10 post gift card) I&#039;d say it makes for a nice affordable option for degenerate uses.
