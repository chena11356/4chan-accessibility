This included some big licenses, like Madballs. <br><br>Around July of 2020 people began to notice that they were getting charged for orders, but they weren&#039;t shipping (much like BBTS, you were not supposed to get charged until the item was about to ship). At first it seemed like some scamdemic problems, so people were understanding... but they kept doing it, and they wouldn&#039;t ship. This went on for months. I personally had my Great Ape Vegeta Figuarts figure through them, which is a reasonably expensive figure ($200~ish). They charged me, and then a month later I contacted them because it hadn&#039;t shipped. At first they were responsive, but after about three months they stopped responding to emails, and at that point I backcharged them after googling the issue and finding out that this was widespread. Word was that they were taking payments for figures that they never even ordered from the distributors, and apparently behind the scenes they ran up huge debts with said distributors, which they never paid. All of this eventually came to a head, and they shut down.<br><br>But Premium DNA came back, and claimed no actual connection to Megalopolis. They just said that they had a partnership, and since Megalopolis was gone, that was over.
