I buy a bunch of desirable figures. I camp for harder to acquire import item preorders--SHFSS, Mafex, some mecha stuff like SoC/Chogokin Valks. Occasionally figma or Sentinel. Some domestics too--Transformers, Marvel Legends, Mcfarlane, Neca. I have them delivered on release, and hold onto them for about a year, gauging just how much they will resell for to get max profits. But in the meantime, I discreetly open these figures(steaming/heating tape in cases they&#039;re taped up), and remove only their hands. I then stick up their accessories--hands, weapons, anything within a reasonable size, up my ass. One at a time, of course, unless I can fit a bunch of small ones.<br>I&#039;ve been doing this for 15 years now. Remember, I don&#039;t just stick them up my ass, I sell them. I sell them everywhere-eBay, comic shops, even Mandarake on business trips. When I can, I sell them as new, unopened. Any time I encounter a &#039;shit&#039;poster on /toy/ giving me a hard time, I just think, this guy probably is playing with something I stuck up my ass. This always seems to give me the edge. Every day for 15 years I stick 30 figures worth of accessories up my ass. 210 figures a week, 10,920 figures a year. To date, that&#039;s 163,800 figures. Eight hundred times the population of /toy/. Those accessories were in my ass! You think you&#039;re better than me? Oh, you&#039;re not better than me. You handle my ass-cessories every day.

People can be selective about it, so demand won&#039;t be that great.<br><br>I fucking wish they&#039;d do the same with Spiderman. There&#039;s the Ditko one coming out, but who knows when they&#039;ll release one after that, so i just might fucking settle for it.<br>I mean, i own a single fucking Spiderman and it&#039;s not even in 1:12 scale, because i don&#039;t like the idea of having 230948092384 versions of iconic characters like Spiderman or Batman. I want the most idealistic version that comes with as many features as possible.<br>I still kick myself over skipping over the first Mezco Spiderman, after seeing how amazing it actually was. Didn&#039;t like the Mezco flairs at first, but after seeing it in reviews, i got a boner. Of course, by then, it was already sold out and like fuck I&#039;m paying the late comer tax.<br>I was thinking about buying the Mafex one, but thought it too sloppy and by the time revisions/redecos were made, Mezco announced that Ditko Spiderman.... it&#039;s hard to make a decision.
