Canopy and fuselage are somewhat banana&#039;d compared to each other, so an amount of force is required to get a decent fit. Meaning all those canopy safe acrylic/PVA/whatever glues are right out. Second, the black bit with the main sight in front/ahead of the front instrument panel sits a bit higher than it should, so it gets squeezed against the wind-shield. Add a drop of extra thin and schlorp, half the wind shield&#039;s been coated on the inside.<br>Well then, some sanding, polishing and varnishing later and the canopy ain&#039;t good as new but at least it ain&#039;t quite so bad any more. So try again, now with regular cement. A teeny tiny amount along the edge and... it gets squeezed up onto the lower wind shield again. So fuck it, this is clearly how it&#039;s meant to be by the powers that be.<br>In other news the main pitot tube is one long, thin rod of plastic (I&#039;m sure you&#039;re all very surprised by that), to which twelve little PE fins are to be glued. If someone think gluing a PE thin just butt-on to the side of a thin plastic rod seems like a problem, don&#039;t worry, these PE bits have little tabs on them to fit into little holes. Little quarter millimetre holes that you&#039;re to drill yourself into the side of the very thin plastic rod. So I guess I&#039;ll just get the landing gear bits ready as well and then pause this thing while whoever I end up buying it from ships me Maser Models brass-and-resin version instead, where all the fins come cast as one with a pair of hollow resin tubes that you simply slide onto the main brass rod.", "filename": "20221127_181005", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1181, "h": 842, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1669570047401674, "time": 1669570047, "md5": "r1aW+pXR18e958jqmwpAYg==", "fsize": 273873, "resto": 10156620}], "last_modified": 1669570047}, {"no": 10158393, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)21:11:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why the actual FUCK hasn&#039;t this set come out yet?
