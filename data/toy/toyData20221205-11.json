This is how it&#039;s been since they got the Marvel license in the late 00s and how it&#039;s been for Star Wars since at least the prequels.<br>However, they rolled their movie lines into the generic Marvel Legends/TBS/vintage/etc lines to save money/get more orders. Before, the movie lines had standalone toylines and there were 2-5 waves for every movie. That&#039;s 3-6 figures every single wave. So lines like IM2 had a shit ton (30+) of brand new molded figures. Today, at best you&#039;ll get 6 figures + maybe a BAF for the movies, AND it replaces a normal wave.

I got my crepe hair and CA glue and I&#039;m practicing fur layering on a piece of scrap from the Playmates 11&quot; King Kong. I tried a couple different glues and I can say srtraight up, loctite is a bad choice for this kind of work because it turns a chalky white color if you use accelerant on it. Thin CA glue is also a bad choice because it&#039;s too runny and makes a mess. The two glue types I find that work well are Gorilla brand superglue, and what I think is going to be my primary glue for the project, Bob Smith Industries Insta-Cure. It goes on clear enough with accelerant, and it&#039;s possible to air cure it with a little patience in areas that need it.<br><br>One of the things I discovered early on is that the crepe hair needs to go on long and get trimmed afterward. The crepe hair comes in a braid, and to make it straight I had to use a flat iron, although I hear a regular clothing iron will work too. The fur also needs to get brushed after a while to get rid of any loose hairs and to make sure everything is running in the right direction.<br><br>I&#039;d take pics of the process but it&#039;s kind of a pain to photograph it.

Currently we know that the Polynian and Touhou series will continue since Marisa is supposedly the next in line to go up. The official Poly 4Koma is still going and it seems its been well received as it gives little look into the everyday lives of the Polys we know.
