By now most of everyone who ordered Olivier and Vania should have them in hand. Its seems the delay was worth it as Olivier seems to be one of the better releases in the line. Vania also seems to be a generally good release as people are having fun messing with her and Olivier. As of now, we only have one other figure up for Pre-Order right now, that being Bikini Clover. Currently we know that the Polynian and Touhou series will continue since Marisa is supposedly the next in line to go up. The official Poly 4Koma is still going and it seems its been well received as it gives little look into the everyday lives of the Polys we know. We also had a wonderful surprise in the form of the new Polynian MLL body! We finally have a counterpart to the Iana body. Aside from that things have been pretty quiet for the time being.<br><br>As always, here is the assistance e-mail for those who need it, so if any problem should arise, feel free to contact them over at &quot;user_support@mile-stone.jp&quot; or the shop you purchased the figure from.<br><br>Once again, feel free to share your photos and adventures, they add life and some fun to the thread.

Yes the same parts are winning all the time until a meta shift.<br>It remains to be seen if shifts will continue after burst concludes. So either the meta will stop shifting and you don&#039;t have to chase new buys or players develop it and you&#039;ll want to keep up with the social brain solving the meta.<br><br>2. Not always.<br>That test is time-sensitive (see answer 1). If there&#039;s time lag for a release or uptake between the east &amp; west, you&#039;ll have different results than if you waited 2 more weeks to test.<br>In all Burst waves, a new release is the primary driver of the meta. The new parts either become necessary and unilaterally replace a previously required part or it fails so do so and the current part remains supreme. Due to the 1-copy rule, a new part can be effectively the same as an old, which is not the same as &quot;diversity&quot; in the sense that a new player expects.<br>For a long time even into GT, Perfect Phoenix from Cho-Z was still the layer to beat for long spin times because nothing new could replace it. That meta also heavily relied on Xtreme&#039; driver for fast+aggressive combos which is still required today for those types. But today, aggressive beys cannot create enough counter-spin to burst opponents; nor transfer enough translation force to knock opponents out of the pockets. This is due to extreme weight increases. So Xtreme&#039; is &quot;required&quot; for aggression but outmoded in general. Likewise Phoenix isn&#039;t heavy enough to use now.<br><br>The below &quot;Wind&quot; layer is currently necessary and will likely stay that way when Burst ends.
