Despite my....kind of overwhelming collection, I&#039;ve actually been cherry picking figures pretty hard so each one kind of serves a specific purpose. And I find even figures I kind of buy for &quot;rule of cool&quot; alone eventually find themselves a needed spot in my ranks. <br><br>Speaking of ranks, I started taking pics of each of my individual armies because it&#039;s hard to see each figure in a group of 90 of em. Starting with my smallest, and kind of newest faction, the Cult of Poxxus. <br><br>It was originally just Malachi and Kronaww, and I had them with the Legions of Arethyr. But with Poxxus himself on the way, combined with a few other oddball figures on pre-order, I decided to make them their own group. I won&#039;t have them be a bunch of weird mages and magical folk like the 4H&#039;s official faction, but rather a group of freaks and mutants that don&#039;t fit with other armies. That ends up meaning it&#039;ll mostly made up of MotU homages since those are all pretty oddball figures. I also plan on dropping the Cosmic Legions Scorpion lady in with them, as well as the Zombie builder&#039;s ghost parts. <br><br><a href=\"#p10143737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10143737</a><br>They could always release Aracagorr with feather wings, a new head and color scheme. <br><br><a href=\"#p10146301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10146301</a><br>Thanks for the bullet points anon.
