No one is allowed to discuss LEGO themes or sets that aren\u2019t from or resemble your childhood. There are no good MOCs besides recreations of your childhood.

This included some big licenses, like Madballs. <br><br>Around July of 2020 people began to notice that they were getting charged for orders, but they weren&#039;t shipping (much like BBTS, you were not supposed to get charged until the item was about to ship). At first it seemed like some scamdemic problems, so people were understanding... but they kept doing it, and they wouldn&#039;t ship. This went on for months. I personally had my Great Ape Vegeta Figuarts figure through them, which is a reasonably expensive figure ($200~ish). They charged me, and then a month later I contacted them because it hadn&#039;t shipped. At first they were responsive, but after about three months they stopped responding to emails, and at that point I backcharged them after googling the issue and finding out that this was widespread. Word was that they were taking payments for figures that they never even ordered from the distributors, and apparently behind the scenes they ran up huge debts with said distributors, which they never paid. All of this eventually came to a head, and they shut down.<br><br>But Premium DNA came back, and claimed no actual connection to Megalopolis. They just said that they had a partnership, and since Megalopolis was gone, that was over.

Despite what &#039;pro modelers&#039; tell you, they are just reading the script and assume you have an airbrush and hundreds in paints and supplies to do the whole shebang. The only reason to use a gloss coat is to protect a fully painted kits painted layer so you can panel line on top of it without smearing/staining. That&#039;s the reason your gundam marker panel lines look so thick, it sticks to the gloss coat and doesn&#039;t allow your finger oils/qtips thin the line. You basically can&#039;t use gundam markers with a gloss coat, only tamiya panel line accent because it can be cleaned with lighter fluid without damaging the gloss coat.<br><br>Really bugs me how everyone parrots the &quot;gloss coat before panel lining!&quot; line without mentioning that this should only be done if you plan on fully painting the kit with an airbrush or at least a wide assortment of rattle cans. Next time properly thin your panel lines with your fingers/qtips(for gundam marker, or q-tips and lighter fluid for tamiya) on the bare plastic and go straight to the matte topcoat.
