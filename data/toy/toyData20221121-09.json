Contrary to what plamo general says it&#039;s completely fine to paint on bare plastic and top coat all that. On that topic, I&#039;d advice you to paint details before glosscoat, because then you can scratch excess paint off of the model. Looking at that front skirt piece, I get what you were going for there, but the edges of the red area could&#039;ve been trimmed using something like a cocktail stick for a sharper end result. Same goes for the panel lines.<br>Plamo general is a good source of inspiration but they&#039;ll grill you for not painting 100% of the kit.

Despite my....kind of overwhelming collection, I&#039;ve actually been cherry picking figures pretty hard so each one kind of serves a specific purpose.

Starting with my smallest, and kind of newest faction, the Cult of Poxxus. <br><br>It was originally just Malachi and Kronaww, and I had them with the Legions of Arethyr. But with Poxxus himself on the way, combined with a few other oddball figures on pre-order, I decided to make them their own group. I won&#039;t have them be a bunch of weird mages and magical folk like the 4H&#039;s official faction, but rather a group of freaks and mutants that don&#039;t fit with other armies. That ends up meaning it&#039;ll mostly made up of MotU homages since those are all pretty oddball figures.

Makes me wonder if they go all out with the Androids/Cell era and give us lots of 2.0&#039;s of everyone, they may give us the buff bodies.
