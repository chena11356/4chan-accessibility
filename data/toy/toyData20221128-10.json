Easily my biggest complaint about Metal as a whole is the clear bias against left spins (being left handed myself). Outside of L Drago and maybe Perseus, there aren&#039;t that many around (I think Twisted Tempo can dual spin as well? can&#039;t remember). It&#039;s one of the bigger reasons Burst quickly became my favorite line. They introduced a number of left spins and dual spin beys after the first generation, and while not all of them are winners, at least Takara Tomy tried to give them gimmicks and abilities that amounted to more than it spins left and can therefore steal spin from a right.<br><br>Plus the fact L Drago is &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;one of a kind&quot; just because it spun left didn&#039;t sit well with me then and it still doesn&#039;t now. At least Perseus can dual spin and it&#039;s probably the only Metal Fight bey I&#039;d ever be interested in buying.", "time": 1669595015, "resto": 10050693}, {"no": 10161676, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)20:05:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10161614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10161614</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lefties can&#039;t right spin.</span>", "filename": "1595525181151", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 768, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669597517279511, "time": 1669597517, "md5": "RgkSN/InhbLLIATXvdCAQg==", "fsize": 174365, "resto": 10050693}, {"no": 10161688, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)20:11:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10161614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10161614</a><br>see plastic gen<br><br><a href=\"#p10089106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10089106</a><br><a href=\"#p10089107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10089107</a><br><br>Basically all beyblades from the second wave on could swap spin.<br><br>This made literally double the stratigic possibilities.", "time": 1669597866, "resto": 10050693}, {"no": 10161800, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)21:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10161614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10161614</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how dry Pegasus looks for an attack type; it&#039;s too damn circular</span><br>The Storm wheel is notoriously bad for Attack.

Pics have been leaked for over half a year now and only like walmart got a few samples of this batcycle set in and then nothing. Why isnt this shipping to stores already? Why the fuck does no one even have it on ebay? Im fucking tired of this bullshit, between spending long intervals between new waves, barely making any new figures in the first place, dodgy fucking distribution like on this swamp thing set and outright skipping figures that absolutely shouldve been made and were essential such as the riddler for the batman toyline, i hope spin master loses the DC license or at the very least the people who are responsible for fucking up shit internally at their company get fucking inoperable dick cancer", "filename": "6E7B7683-67CA-4F95-9FC7-F03A11285B33", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3542, "h": 3542, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669428687076596, "time": 1669428687, "md5": "N3Vepu5pb9s5c7OK44g5Fw==", "fsize": 2307594, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-the-actual-fuck-hasnt-this-set-come-out-yet", "replies": 30, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 25, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 10161400, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)17:15:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10158393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10158393</a><br>Batman and Swamp Thing are friends :(", "time": 1669587352, "resto": 10158393}, {"no": 10161736, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)20:44:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10161256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10161256</a><br>Swamp thing is cooler looking and more toyetic then pooperman or fish fucker", "time": 1669599883, "resto": 10158393}, {"no": 10161742, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)20:48:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10161372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10161372</a><br>I dont even mind batman variants and i have just about every joker recolor theyve made and a bunch of the batman variants, what bothers me morenis that they arent making enough new characters as figures and they keep repainting mid/shit characters like robin or nightwing that i am not interested at all in getting beyond their original releases and am not going to get their repaints consequently.

The generic non batman DC toyline was what brainiac was meant to be a part of but that line doesnt nearly sell as well and i think at one point the assortment got canceled and thats why he didnt get made. I think john stewart GL was going to be in the same wave as brainiac and i also think john got cancelled at one point too but he eventually got released. Im still holding out hope that spin master makes brainiac available in these three packs which include rereleases and repaints of previously hard to find figures from the generic DC line under the batman toyline. They could put in brainiac and include a repainted superman and batman respectively in the set as well as accessories for them <br><br>Also yeah the crowbar that killed jason todd being an accessory for red hood is fucking hilarious", "filename": "4F84ABBB-BC03-4D67-9612-56C9B53C3336", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1669601630846871, "time": 1669601630, "md5": "7uYApw5dshIZhX7EJ8fCVA==", "fsize": 47379, "resto": 10158393}], "last_modified": 1669601630}, {"no": 10129879, "now": "11/06/22(Sun)20:05:52", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Tamagotchi and other Vpets!", "com": "Anyone into Tamagotchi or other vpets?
