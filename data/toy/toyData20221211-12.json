Motivation to unbox is low with reissues so they sat there for a while. I got two since I was confident Kaiyodo wouldn&#039;t make the same mistake twice with the same figure. They make the same mistakes with different figures...but not the same figure as far as I can recall. <br><br>Short answer, everything feels right. BUT plasticizer leakage isn&#039;t exactly positive/negative result out of the box either. But few factors indicate for me this one should be fine, far better than original release for sure even at worst case. <br><br>First of all, the paint quality is much better. They&#039;re evenly spread, no differentiation in hues, and probably less misplaced spots too. Original was rough there already. Main cause for the paint pealing off I bet because it was such a shit job even without plasticizer problem. That alone is worth getting the reissue. <br><br>Another good sign was that none of the parts in contact were stuck. Sure there are plastic keeping some body parts separate but they don&#039;t cover everything. Nothing felt like it got dislodged when moving the figures the first time. Original had some serious stuck paint and transferred paint out of the box.<br><br>Last point is something that concerns me. The reissue still have some softer PVC parts, which increases likelihood of plasticizer leakage since that&#039;s used to make the plastic and paint softer and stretchier. Only for say the gauntlets and crotch piece though, they MIGHT get sticky in years, maybe climate dependent. <br><br>If you&#039;re unsure I say definitely risk it and get the reissue. AY is probably the best Iron Man figure at this size and price range so you shouldn&#039;t miss out on it at it&#039;s full potential.
