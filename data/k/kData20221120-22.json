If you&#039;ve ever played around with a 33 round mag from Glock you know that its awkward to move around with in a way that a 30 round magazine forward of the trigger isn&#039;t. Its a lot easier to move an AR pistol around and it get on target from low ready than it is to do the same thing with a typical handgun with a larger mag. <br><br>You&#039;re also getting an 8-10&quot; barrel compared to a typical duty size pistol. 9mm federal 115gr JHP from a 4&quot; is 1094 FPS vs. 1253 out of a 10&quot;. This translates to a little over 30% more muzzle energy for the long barrel. And while its a bit more of an issue with rifle rounds, you will have less muzzle flash in a low light environment with a longer barrel too.<br><br>The biggest advantage however, is likely handling and ergos. If you watch footage of the SAS raid on the Iranian embassy, they put single point slings on their MP5s, attached to the back of the gun. That way they could pull the gun out in front of them and get tension against their slings to stabilize the gun without having to hold it at full extension like a pistol. The reason they bothered with this, was because they knew they couldn&#039;t get good cheek weld with a gas mask on and figured that they may as well ditch the stocks since they were abseiling and jumping through windows. In a modern HD scenario, there&#039;s alot to be said for the ease of use found in putting a flashlight, a laser, and a single point sling on an something like that 5.7 space gun KelTec put out.

That prevents any slipping. The sight system&#039;s original too. It&#039;s a 3-dot type. It&#039;s got an enlarged front sight, giving it superior target sighting capability. The regular hammer&#039;s been replaced with a ring hammer. That enhances the cocking control and increases the hammer-down speed. They also reworked the grip safety to accommodate the ring hammer. It looks like they eliminated it altogether. This is a tool for pros. The thumb safety and slide stop are extended for precise handling. The base of the trigger guard is whittled down so you can use a high grip, and the trigger itself is a long type for easy finger access. The trigger pull is about 3.5 pounds. that&#039;s about a pound and a half lighter than normal. The magazine well has been widened to make it easier to put in a new magazine. The magazine catch button has been filed down low to make it harder to hit it by mistake. The mainspring housing has been changed to a flat type to increase grip, and it&#039;s even been fitted with stepping so that it won&#039;t slip from the recoil when firing. On top of that, they added cocking serrations to the top part of the slide. That lets you load and eject cartridges faster in an emergency. Oh my god, it even has a watermark.

Start with the barrel and chamber for said round: long or short, light or heavy, rifling or smooth bore, standard or Ackley improved-that last one is for more advanced or reloader anons. Next thing to decide is the type of action. Manually cycling or automatic, both of which can be divided further. If manual then will it be lever actuated, pump, bolt, or something else? If it is semi-auto the cartridge is a factor for what type of action you should use. Consistent Low pressure rounds (older pistol rounds and some carbine calibers) are easy to make blow-back weapons, high pressure rounds such as most rifle rounds need a locking system to fire safely and a means of both unlocking and cycling the arm such as a gas piston. There are other modes of operation, but keeping it simple will help when it comes to learning it. <br>After you have both the caliber, barrel, chamber(s), and action decided next it will be magazine/loading/unloading.
