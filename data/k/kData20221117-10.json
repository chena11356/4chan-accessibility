Giving Ukraine weapons is not at all contrary to this purpose. When everything else has been taken away from Eastern Europeans (humanity, sovereignty, borders, Historical cachet, etc.) weapons and money can be freely given, in an almost openly mocking manner, since a Ukrainian, Pole, Romanian, Estonian, etc. is worth more dead than alive: the effort that started in &#039;45 and is still ongoing is, presumably, of an almost incalculable cost compared to the &quot;aid&quot;, which only serves to reduce the number of Ukrainians before Ukraine is handed over to Russia by the world&#039;s total inaction, and even overt contempt. It is all but impossible for an outsider to imagine to what degree Eastern Europe effectively does not exist. The idea that its people were punished with Russian occupation for their allegiance to the Axis is so vulgar and, moreover, speaks so poorly of the victors, that one can easily infer that its true identity is an apport of an unspeakable ghost. Indeed, its people are nothing but incalculable negative value, kept alive, dare I say against their wishes, in a futile attempt to redeem a debt. Their crime? Who knows?

The rest mostly suck. I&#039;m fine with picking one category of ships to name after states, too. Most states have cool names, and there&#039;s only 50 of them, so they&#039;re usually reserved for some of the most powerful capital ships. USS Alabama, USS Nevada, etc. sound good to me. New Hampshire can suck a dick, though. <br><br>Let&#039;s just cut down to it. The problem is naming ships after people, cities, and battles. Most cities do not sound cool, and who gives a fuck about just one city, anyway. Plus, there&#039;s too many. Likewise, people&#039;s names are rarely good for ships. There are some exceptions, but not many. Really, even if you&#039;re naming it after a badass, it still feels weird and patronizing. Nevermind the fact that the US frequently names ships after civilian senators, civil rights activists, and shitty presidents. The latter is the most obnoxious to me. Now, it&#039;s okay to name some ships after battles, but that really comes down to what the battle was killed. Tarawa isn&#039;t the worst name ever, but it doesn&#039;t sound good either. Plus, you&#039;re still naming your ship after foreign land, even if you meant to refer to the battle. <br><br>Also, stop naming ships &#039;&#039;America&#039;&#039;. That&#039;s fucking silly. <br><br>Of course, there are exceptions to everything. Ticonderoga, Bunker Hill, Nimitz, Spruance, Topeka, etc. sound good to me. <br><br>I still can&#039;t believe we have a ship called The Sullivans. THE Sullivans. USS The Sullivans.

The definition is so broad and there are so many examples proposed in fiction that fill so many different types of niches for so many specific, in-universe purposes, it&#039;s hard to give a definitive answer. As others in this thread have said, the main issue is the value of a supersoldier&#039;s training, equipment and augmentation comparable to the advantage they bring to the battlefiel. By and large, the better option for most modern militaries would be to just stick with outfitting normal, regular footsoliders with standard equipment and faster, cheaper training. That&#039;s not to say the role would never be implemented, there are specialist roles in military and paramilitary organisation that are time-intensive and cost a lot of money in training for the sake of outfitting a person to fulfil a particular strategic niche; it&#039;s literal what special forces are. Consider this along with the fact that most supersoldiers you see in media are written to fill that exact role as special force operators working alongside standard military operatives (Spartans and UNSC Marines, Astartes and Imperial Guard, etc.) then it&#039;s not hard to imagine a potential future where such combatants exist. It&#039;s merely a matter of what kind of appearance and role they&#039;d take, and whether or not something else in our world emerges that changes the way warfare is waged that makes the idea of soldiers to begin with obsolete.", "filename": "6664247383823072d2e79d2479e2d8b2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 736, "h": 385, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1668689847053757, "time": 1668689847, "md5": "GBXLLaLTED7C81zPT9xm5g==", "fsize": 67830, "resto": 56049611}, {"no": 56079889, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)08:34:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56077284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56077284</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;falls ov- ACK</span>", "filename": "D510F324-1A3A-4F58-95AA-E05542D69C3B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668692092967620, "time": 1668692092, "md5": "EIWj2wR2xLmzdRBmQY2BGA==", "fsize": 182524, "resto": 56049611, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56080530, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:41:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56079889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56079889</a><br>Yes that is the noise the robot makes when it hits the ground.", "time": 1668696075, "resto": 56049611}], "last_modified": 1668696075}, {"no": 56080500, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:38:12", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Composition of a battle", "com": "If knowing is half the battle, what is the other half?", "filename": "kihtb", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 630, "h": 630, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668695892021089, "time": 1668695892, "md5": "YgejRANcDmY8nPxiLjyHYA==", "fsize": 51837, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "composition-of-a-battle", "replies": 5, "images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 56080509, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:39:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56080500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56080500</a><br>In your case sucking dick", "filename": "1574969853427", "ext": ".gif", "w": 268, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1668695952488782, "time": 1668695952, "md5": "gMjs+KQGXF0Vki7xdzccFA==", "fsize": 1772037, "resto": 56080500}, {"no": 56080510, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56080500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56080500</a><br>extreme violence", "time": 1668695958, "resto": 56080500}, {"no": 56080511, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56080500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56080500</a><br>Violence", "time": 1668695958, "resto": 56080500}, {"no": 56080514, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:39:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56080500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56080500</a><br>Incredible amounts of violence", "time": 1668695967, "resto": 56080500}, {"no": 56080515, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:39:30", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "e9474be298d32b272eb8fb4ce3a7abac", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1366, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668695970472317, "time": 1668695970, "md5": "+4ToKLvmfPxdnZuP5JgkaQ==", "fsize": 54026, "resto": 56080500, "m_img": 1}], "last_modified": 1668695970}, {"no": 56020281, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)20:42:50", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "budget vs Chad ar15", "com": "So what&#039;s the difference between a budget ar and a top tier one and does it actually matter?", "filename": "th-109187552", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 245, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 129, "tim": 1668303770360549, "time": 1668303770, "md5": "iZy02UxXW2dZfW3FGQNPaA==", "fsize": 11837, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "budget-vs-chad-ar15", "replies": 230, "images": 33, "omitted_posts": 225, "omitted_images": 32, "last_replies": [{"no": 56074572, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)19:38:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56074125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56074125</a><br>Yeah I heard about that.
