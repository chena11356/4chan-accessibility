Its not the metal or gun technology that was the problem for China. It was the society itself that was fucked. Guns/cannons/grenades/hand canons were all used during the Mongol invasion. It was in mass usage in China in before the western european states capitalized on them. The problem was when mongols ruled over China, the society was traumazed as a result of this conquest. Something like half of Chinese lost their livelihood to the resulting chaos. Ming dynasty after the fall of the Mongols greatly utilized the gunpowder weapons across the entire military lineup. It wasn&#039;t a deciding factor at the time because the gun powders were still not advanced enough. The problem was how the government was setup by the Ming and the politics revolving around it. The same problem was with Qing as well (as well as many other Chinese dynasties). <br>The old state politics revolved around confucian politicians from various parts of China forming majority of the rules and emperors taking a more imperial role. But with the Ming, they centralized the power into an absolute monarch system. The confucian politicians were put aside and the imperial enuchs were the ones making the laws. This corrupted the system greatly (although the old system was almost as corrupt). Leading to monarch dissatisfactions and eventual political betrayals by local politicians in favor of Qing dynasty. The disheavel was worse in Qing because they weren&#039;t &quot;Chinese&quot; proper either. Like the Mongols of the past, they were viewed as outsiders and needed to be overthrown/etc. Qing had to wrestle with countless insurgencies throughout the empire as political instability led to their collapse. But even as the political system was on the brink of collapse, their tech/mettalurgy industries never wavered. In fact, more and more guns were used in all walks of life in Chinese military.

I looked in more detail They itemize in the listings. Looks like gun + optic prices are pretty much market. The secret sauce is where they upcharge for the ammo, accessories, and custom work and then add on a premium for putting together the ensemble. For instance, who buys $300 holsters and magnaports everything? The markup isn&#039;t as crazy as I thought, but were the gun to come in a minimal configuration nobody could stomach shelling out for the most expensive light, the most expensive holster, the most expensive optic, etc unless they&#039;re getting a killer deal. I guess if you&#039;re a rich boomer and the worst thing you can imagine doing is thinking through something on your own, this would be the kind of thing you would do, because they&#039;re selling the most expensive version of everything you could possibly consider buying for the gun along with the gun.", "time": 1675685863, "resto": 57038472}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 57038439, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)12:25:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can we do a /k/ related photo thread?

You&#039;re entirely relying on fragmentation or tumbling to occur to get a bigger wound channel than a .22 hole. If you know your ballistic shit, you know all the planets have to align for tumbling and fragmentation to happen. I&#039;d say those are unreliable wounding mechanisms too.

It still is, because modern powder advancements improved .40 loads too. 9mm now consistently makes the minimum penetration requirements, but the one thing .40 still has a leg up on is light barrier penetration. It will go through something like a windshield or car door with less deflection than 9mm. The police agencies may not have made the right decision to drop it, but I wouldn&#039;t invest in it because it won&#039;t be a common round in the future. Just get a 10mm if you want something that blows 9 the fuck out of the water. There&#039;s a lot of badass versatile loads you can get in 10mm that you can&#039;t get with boring cope rounds like .40 or .357. 9mm is just a good all around, very common round.

All the other European nations and Canada needed a replacement for the F-104, each nation put in its requirements and the requirements were a long way apart. In the second round the British required a deep interdiction aircraft with at least twice as much range as the Germans wanted, and all at low level for strike and conventional attack \u2013\u2013 we had wanted an aeroplane for strike and close air support, with an air superiority capability over the battlefield. But we had not been after an aeroplane for deep interdiction\u2026 I told our Chief of Air Staff [General Steinhoff] that my department did not think the projected aircraft would fit the german requirement. And then a funny thing happened.

I had been looking for one of these for about 10 years with zero results until I stumbled on to a CZ99 to fill this niche.<br><br>https://handgunsoftheworld.com/prod<wbr>uct/sirkis-industries-sirkis-sd9-9m<wbr>m-with-case/<br><br>https://handgunsoftheworld.com/prod<wbr>uct/tressitu-mitchell-double-action<wbr>-9mm-with-case/<br><br>He&#039;s also got a Mamba, a CZ 100, a Detonics Pocket 9, an FMK 9C1 Bill of Rights Edition and a Dardick 1500 (!) for sale but I think they&#039;re all way overpriced.", "filename": "tressitu", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1425, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675583655902613, "time": 1675583655, "md5": "eipIXDdKiyPmnsDJhjHsFw==", "fsize": 134790, "resto": 57034486, "m_img": 1, "trip": "!Gummer6chk"}, {"no": 57034628, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)02:59:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I heard that early .40 S&amp;W pistols would effectively beat themselves to death after a large enough round count, would a Beretta 96A1 do the same, from my understanding the A1 is a semi newer entry releasing in 2010 or so, would it have had all the kinks worked out to be truly reliable with 40 S&amp;W?", "time": 1675583951, "resto": 57034486}, {"no": 57034655, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)03:04:35", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "czsp01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2924, "h": 2130, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1675584275231488, "time": 1675584275, "md5": "q9lIQHvOrW19CpFeoXAC1A==", "fsize": 1203388, "resto": 57034486, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57034669, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)03:06:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57034628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57034628</a><br>if you can, check or ask about the locking block, pictured at the lowest.<br>If it&#039;s just got 90 degree angles, its the kind of beretta that fucks itself up.<br>If its a gentle round cut like the one in my picture then all you have to worry about is a crack in the frame, which is unlikely unless the whole gun is a clapped out peice of shit.", "filename": "S__7585839", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1479, "h": 1110, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675584400241082, "time": 1675584400, "md5": "UTkMIIQoasX7chmxcysAXQ==", "fsize": 761642, "resto": 57034486, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57034872, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)03:47:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57034669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57034669</a><br>Thanks for the amazing tip, this is pretty helpful!", "time": 1675586864, "resto": 57034486}, {"no": 57035656, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)06:10:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57034523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57034523</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t get his grips engraved</span><br>p sad ngl", "filename": "FOgkx08XMAcBPKs", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675595440257212, "time": 1675595440, "md5": "tz0pbfrHPGx1y6rv9Rd1QA==", "fsize": 605787, "resto": 57034486, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57035674, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)06:14:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57035656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57035656</a><br>Why? :(", "time": 1675595664, "resto": 57034486}, {"no": 57036004, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)07:19:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57034508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57034508</a><br>usually max loads can be exceeded safely to some degree, but it\u2019s firearm dependent.

I could easily see the elements in the South Korean government/establishment (or power hungry political outsiders) scapegoat Japan or the US, especially if Chinese glowies back them. In many cases, modern South Korea has taken the worst aspects of modern Japan and turned them up to 11 - they have a higher suicide rate, have an even worse work/life balance, and their birthrate has cratered (their birth rate is 0.75 per woman compared to Japan&#039;s 1.34).

That would be a pretty nasty nut to crack for any sort of air attack. and eat up most of the budget since the current cost for 2 is 4.5 that would probably push those 3 batteries to 6~bill. After that i would look into getting a pair or trio of AWACS to extend our radar coverage. Majority of the remainder would go towards getting a squadron of F-15EXs to further augment the air power. The reaming 1.5 billion would go towards well, im not really sure what that would go towards, probably going to expand facilities to help accommodate the new personnel and machines.

You\u2019re going to see some basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, angles, and perimeter, along with the occasional time and distance word problem and potentially some basic probability.<br><br>Section 2: RCT (Reading Comprehension Test): Again, really straightforward stuff. You read a passage of text and are given options of sentences only one of which is totally true based on the text given above. Most will seem true but, only one can actually be derived from the provided passage.<br><br>Section 3: MCT (Mechanical Comprehension Test): The questions in this section are similar to what would find in an intro to physics class. Brush up on your knowledge of basic physics and how it relates to velocity, volume, and pressure as well as the mechanics of simple machines when it comes to gears, electricity, and weight distribution.<br><br>Section 4: ANIT (Aviation and Nautical Information Test): You guessed it! On this section of the ASTB you\u2019re going to need to know some nautical terminology, a little bit of aviation history as well as some principles of aviation like aerodynamic principles, basic aircraft components, and flight rules", "time": 1675570783, "resto": 57030831}, {"no": 57033094, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:21:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57033076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57033076</a><br><br>Section 5: NATFI (Naval Aviation Trait Facet Inventory): You sort of get off easy here as there\u2019s no real way to prepare for this section. It\u2019s a personality inventory that, in the end, will gauge ones suitability for a career in aviation based on their personal characteristics.<br><br>Section 6: PBM (Performance Based Measures Battery): Depending on your tastes this might be the most \u2018fun\u2019 part of the ASTB. You basically get to do a flight simulation. You\u2019ll be given a flight mock-up flight console with a throttle and joystick along with a headset. You\u2019ll also get a map that you\u2019ll need to study before guiding an airplane around on a screen. For a more detailed of explanation of this section check out our full-length article of the different sections of the ASTB called ASTB Test Layout.<br><br>Section 7: BI-RV (Biographical Inventory with Response Validation): This is the part of the ASTB that you can complete from any computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that you complete this section prior to writing the rest of the ASTB. All it is, is a questionnaire about your previous experiences and successes or achievements with aviation. Like section 5 you really can\u2019t prepare for this section \u2013 just answer honestly as there aren\u2019t any real right or wrong responses.<br><br>IOW, bitch you should have prepared lel.

Although combat has intensified the last few weeks, it has peaks and valleys. I can only think of three instances were causalities were known to be high: The first few weeks of the invasion, the second when Russia tried to encircle Sievierodonetsk, and finally during the current push on Bakhmut Only when Russia regroups and regains the initiative for a massive assault does Ukraine seem to take any major casualties. If you&#039;re skeptical, consider that almost every estimate has Ukraine sitting around 100K casualties. This estimate wouldn&#039;t be far off if Ukraine isn&#039;t counting non-serious casualties and all their wounded are completely out of action . If you double the casualty numbers to include non-serious casualties, then you are dead-on for 100K which is in line with every other estimate. For Russia consider that we have repeated heard estimates around 150K-200K in dead and seriously wounded. This is right along those lines. Further, we also know that Russia lacks: proper medical gear, proper evac, proper medical training for soldiers, proper armor/vests/helmets, proper camouflage, protected vehicles, cover for their advances, etc... Russia is the one who is constantly seen on video advancing using human wave tactics into an entrenched enemy. You EXPECT to take at least 3 to 1 casualties in those situations, maybe more. We also know that Russia is taking a 3-to-1 loss ratio in equipment according to the most open and verifiable available data.

It was originally supposed to be the naval gunfire replacement for the Iowa class which up to that point the Navy still retained enough unique battleship components to reactivate. At the same time function as the next generation of mainline cruiser/destroyer. Problem is the program got very expensive and Congress kept slashing the number of total hulls to build. Originally 32 were to be procured, by the time Congress was done monkey fucking it only three would end up being completed. Which in itself isn\u2019t entirely the worst thing because you get three very advanced destroyers and their unique gun systems, however the advanced gun system used a unique round that was guided. With only three ships in the fleet each individual round would cost $1 million which was infeasible when you can buy missiles for that much. This was made worse by the delays in the rail gun program, The zulmwalt was originally designed to incorporate a railgun once development was done but the program is experiencing metallurgical issues. The rails don\u2019t have nearly the longevity and suffered significant damage during testing. The weapon works, problem is it would require swapping out barrels too often. This means the Zumwalt was built in too few numbers for its unique ammunition to be cost-effective to purchase, and its future railgun refit keeps getting pushed farther and farther back. So now they are just going to remove the guns or at least one of them and replace it with a hypersonic missile pack. <br><br>I wish the Navy would just bite the bullet and develop a new battleship class instead of attempting and fucking up the old battleships replacements.", "time": 1675633974, "resto": 57039407}, {"no": 57041022, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:57:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57039407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57039407</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is it shit?</span><br>Its not shit.

expanded gun rights.<br><br>U.S. District Judge Patrick Wyrick, an appointee of former Republican President Donald Trump in Oklahoma City, on Friday dismissed an indictment against a man charged in
