Obviously the STG was abandoned after the fall of the third reich, and everyone just adopted either semi or full auto battle rifles, and used them fairly similarly to how Americans used their Garands which was similar to how everyone used bolt action rifles. The full auto variants were also used similarly to the semi auto ones, except they also adopted the ability to switch to full auto in a pinch or close in, similar to the way STG was able to, however they were much less suited to this role. This was thought of as a fairly niche use and as the wars of the time were largely fought on more open terrain the longer range was thought of as an advantage. Having only one round to produce to go along with your newly adopted general purpose machine gun also helped.<br><br>At this point i want to note that both the STG and AK used shortened cartridges with the same caliber as full size rounds, which don&#039;t really give massive improvements on ammo weight. Of course, you get the lighter weapon and some 30% improvement in carried ammo wouldn&#039;t hurt but unlike the Germany who experimented with both battle rifles and assault rifles and saw lots of trench combat, the countries were reluctant to change their existing eqipment.", "time": 1670379684, "resto": 56302557}, {"no": 56310291, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:31:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56310178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56310178</a><br>Things really changed with the M16, which used a small caliber high velocity round that outright doubled the ammo capacity, with the light rifle allowing even more while the flat trajectory actually improved the soldier&#039;s accuracy at most common combat ranges. This was a tradeoff that was very appealing, especially since by this point armies established their small arms arsenal and the improved manufacturing and logistics allowed an additional small arms round to be much less burdensome to keep. Nobody jumped the gun quite like US and soviet did, who were enamored with the low recoil characteristics of the round due to that idea they had about automatic fire and even had several programs that aimed to improve hit probability in full auto similar to US SPIW program, with AN-94 being the result of one of them. Some countries still keep using battle rifles as their main armament to this day, one example being Greece. More and more countries started adopting the cartridge in the 80s after it became NATO standartized, though, as the benefits were quite real and the round well established.<br><br>However, despite the whole classification as an assault rifles, these guns are still used very similarly to the way their predcessors were used before, with the guns designed for the aimed fire, primarily in semi automatic and use of full auto ranges from very rarely to more situational in different countries, but the focus on the rifle being a rifle remains.
