They will fly in close cooperation with manned aircraft and support pilots in their tasks and missions. Military transport aircraft such as the A400M play an important role in this: as a mother ship, they bring the remote carriers as close as possible to their area of operation and then drop off up to 50 small or up to 12 heavy remote carriers. These then fly in tandem with manned aircraft, operating with a high degree of automation but always under the control of a pilot.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Using new working methods, including rapid prototyping and a joint flight test approach, the multidisciplinary team developed, integrated and prepared the A400M UAV launcher for flight testing in a very short time, Airbus said.

Malaysian soldiers, sailors and airman join the regular forces for the love of the profession, most of them. There are servicemen with an impressive lineage of soldiering. Most Malaysian servicemen have been blooded. Malaysian troops constantly have combined arms exercises throughout the year, they have elaborately planned out training cycles for the individual,units, brigades, divisions and the corps as a whole. They exercise in peace times with imaginery enemies, they have made mistakes, they go back to the drawing boards. They know their weaknesses,they improvise, adapt and overcome. They also conduct lots of cross training with foreign forces.", "time": 1670909872, "resto": 56366989}, {"no": 56381939, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:34:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "After searching for Japanese language sources, the reality is quite different from the OP&#039;s claim.<br><br>AH-1S, AH-64, and OH-1 are retired<br>U-125 and UH-60 SAR types replaced by V-22 or V-280<br>SH-60 and P-1 are not retired, but new builds are stopped and combined with UAVs<br><br>Major future Japanese investments include:<br>Purchase of Tomahawks: 500 rounds.

It might have more applications for civilians than military desu, but how often would a civilian shooter change the configuration either?
