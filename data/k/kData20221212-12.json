The moment the HIMARS showed up smoker-chan started his work. Suddenly the ammo dumps started exploding and the number of artillery strikes tanked. The Russians had to rethink their entire logistic network for feeding things like arty moving dumps farther from the lines as the whole thing was at risk. They also made getting out of Kherson a nightmare by accurately hitting the Antonovsky bridge and putting a bunch of holes in it. A mere handful changed the war. The US has hundreds of them already and is making more as we speak, mayne of them likely earmarked for being sent to Ukraine.
