You can have two guns with similar recoil energy but the one with the higher velocity will feel &quot;snappy&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot; by comparison. Any trustworthy recoil table or recoil calculator online will compute both of those figures.<br>To help visualize it, imagine a strong but fairly slow shove compared to a short, fast, slap. Both could have equal kinetic energy but getting slapped is more painful than being shoved. Lightweight guns and extremely high pressure loads tend to have more &quot;snappy&quot; recoil (i.e. the recoil velocity is high). Heavier guns, those with lower pressure or slower burning cartridges have more of a &quot;shove&quot; sort of recoil.

For a while it was 7.5 Swiss which for 90% of the last year SGAmmo / Midway / AIM has had in stock no issue. Beyond this pretty much every (with some exceptions) smokeless centerfire cartridge you can get for old military rifles has one company loading it. For a few of them you just have to wait for the batches. 6.5 Carcano being an example, PPU still makes it. Multiple places had it this year but sold through, more will show up.

In academic parlance this is the &quot;warrior mindset&quot; vs the &quot;professional soldier&quot; but those labels are insufficient. We all make terrible fucking decisions when we&#039;re horny - for example I was facefucking a dude last night and he was obviously trying to pull of my dick and I didn&#039;t let him.

It&#039;s literally the same thing at play: your brain overriding your faculties of reason to force you to engage in behaviour which is, objectively, stupid.

Modern tech makes an M1 Abrams much more effective but an M60 Patton is about the same size and makes about the same amount of noise so it doesn&#039;t matter what you KNOW intellectually: twenty M60 Pattons is always going to make you horny in a way that a single M1 Abrams can&#039;t.

If you wiki the micro channel plate in a I2 tube you can get the basics better than my phn effort posting, so reader knowledge is assumed to that level. A few threads ago there was a colloquial reference to &quot;chicken wire&quot; as a visual artifact. I can&#039;t relate that to field use, but can describe the process of MCP fab including certain vagaries. Imagine a solid tube of glass that slides through another tube of glass like inside a straw. Bake it until fusion, stack these pic rel and repeat. Like a breadstick, yes? Take it to the Draw Tower, a magical apparatus that you clamp your breadstick into and heat up like a glassblower at &quot;insert local artisan fair village&quot;, except vertical. Now using all your spells and hexs, stretch that motherfucker until the laser micrometer reads X amount, think willy willy skinny. Like a raven hair on the head of a teepee maiden. Break these apart like spagetti. Repeat picrel X times. You now have a fused glass lump of shit called a boule, like a French bread, that goes to cutting . You get back thin quarter sized product, and then more stuff also happens. The real trick is in the &quot;art&quot;. I suggest doing a patent search at the USPO. Probably classified anyway. The Draw Tower has a ladder for the operator, most girls are short anyway. The fire is the &quot;art&quot;. Take your plastic coffee stir stick and bic lighter and stretch it out by hand 2 feet, I believe in you. Oh, make it perfectly even diameter +/- a very isty bitsy amount using SPC tools and math and stuff, then hand select. Anyway, if you can make an MCP from above directions, you&#039;re smarter than the PhDs at (((formerly Litton))). As with the last storytime, throw the majority in the trash, work OT and don&#039;t even give the ladies off Mother&#039;s Day.

Five eyes ended all partnership with Austria because Kickl is in bed with the Russians.

It is actually extremely rare to have a misfire on a percussion gun that is correctly loaded, on a par with a BPCR gun. Many people who are new to flintlocks will struggle making modern reproductions reliable, for a start many reproductions do not have hardened frizzens and the lock geometry is poor, the spring to weak or to hard, they overfill the pan etc. If you have got used to making a flintlock run you will know if it is going to go off.

It looks like fanart, or maybe concept art, based on the anime/manga.

Most couldn&#039;t pass the modern basic Trump Imperium fitness standards for fourteen year olds: a one plate (135lbs) standing military press, a two plate (225lbs) bench press, a three plate (315lbs) squat, and a four plate (405lbs) dead lift, all for five repetitions.

Even the FCG-9 has been forked into &quot;weldless bolt&quot; variations just to skip the welder.<br>If you get into casting, you&#039;ll see on youtube that there&#039;s entire channels dedicated to troubleshooting molds.

IvanTheTroll recently got sheets of 4140 or 4150 laser cut to make a DIY glock slide, where the &quot;locking lug&quot; meets the top of the barrel, and after not many shots the steel was already getting peened. Some Zamak alloys are HiPoint tier and thus usable for firearms, but let&#039;s face it you&#039;re not getting the best casting and cooling/heat treatment from an empty soup can, plaster of paris and your mom&#039;s oven. Still, I&#039;d probably design such a cast around a good grade of steel and attempt to heat treat it to avoid the Zamak from getting beat up and cracking.

It&#039;s also a completely different skillset that requires a lot of work and practice to avoid voids, micro-cracking, and generally getting things to tolerances safely and efficiently. It took me months to get to the point where I was reliably casting small parts in my garage, and was good enough to pick out a bad one before I seriously tested it. I&#039;m not gonna suggest it as a shortcut to someone who just needs a gun, now. If you cast things in a way that&#039;s cheap, relatively safe, and easy to achieve for a novice they&#039;re gonna need a third skillset to finish, rather than ones that make the design easier or safer to build. And I don&#039;t want to add another pile of equipment to the list if it&#039;s not necessary.<br><br>For stuff like your use-case of resurrecting a gun with a torched receiver that you can spend time on casting with safe dimensions, dressing and prepping, it&#039;s a great idea. Especially since you clearly have the experience. Likewise, simple stuff where you mostly just need a block of metal and you can finish them with a drill press and jig (bolt weights, gas blocks, etc) are gonna be fine for newbies.

For a beginner is better to get something like an Ender 3 V2 (theres a NEO version now) or something like the Biqu B1, its kinda of a better, more modern Ender 3 but it&#039;s not from Creality, otherwise you can get a Creality S1 which has a direct drive style extrusion and its super easy to assemble, but you wont be able to print superfast like a bowden style extruder, yet I doubt you will do that anyways.<br><br>As for materials, eSun PLA+ is what I would recommend hands down for /k/ related stuff, dont buy Creality PLA, it sucks and eSun usually cheaper too. TPU which is a flexible material, if you find it from Creality, you can go ahead, Creality TPU is actually pretty decent.<br>For high end resistant materials, you can get either ABS/ABS+ which is great, but its a pain in the ass to print since its VERY prone to temperature change, so you most likely would have to build an enclosure for your printer to keep it all warm, otherwise the print will deform with just room temperature due of material retraction. PETG is basically the better version of ABS since its just as resistant but its kinda similar to PLA+ but just needs the higher temperature to print, but its not very affected by temperature and material retraction, so for parts that have a lot of stress, this material really comes in handy. <br>The problem for entry level printers is that you most likely will have to replace the heat brake with a high quality one made of titanium, yet doing that modification is actually pretty easy, if you get it for a new printer that you haven&#039;t even used, its even easier.<br>Still most /k/ stuff that has been 3d printed just uses PLA+ and it works almost flawlessly if there was no printing issues, besides PLA+ is much more available to buy and more cost effective if you buy in bulks.<br><br>Check out CHEP&#039;s Filament Friday channel, that helped me a lot, and if you have a Creality its a godsend", "time": 1673903755, "resto": 56738766}, {"no": 56788421, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:25:18", "name": "ChaosCustoms", "com": "I prefer the Bill Holmes/Professor Parabellum approach myself<br><br>https://t.me/Guerrillaclub", "filename": "photo_2023-01-16_15-24-47", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 658, "h": 445, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1673904318100598, "time": 1673904318, "md5": "OLMnbJHBtIoXSxHN8+c/XQ==", "fsize": 46989, "resto": 56738766}, {"no": 56788468, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:29:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56748204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56748204</a><br>How you are casting zamak? is that spinning wheel thing or it is like sand casting?", "time": 1673904591, "resto": 56738766}, {"no": 56788501, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:32:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56738766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56738766</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gunsmithing </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sanding and assembling plastic </span><br>Christ", "time": 1673904778, "resto": 56738766}, {"no": 56788522, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:34:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56756054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56756054</a><br>It is not your schizo mind some 3d printer company and slicer said something about that but it is not widespread.", "time": 1673904853, "resto": 56738766}, {"no": 56788546, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:36:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Reverse engineering a couple hi power parts for fun using \u201ceducation only\u201d software from school <br>i paid for it I\u2019m gonna use it", "filename": "834B4952-CA95-429A-967C-8DE40C24EFDA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 1013, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 101, "tim": 1673904982701844, "time": 1673904982, "md5": "hSZ7MsV42TFwx7AYBErqsQ==", "fsize": 1009785, "resto": 56738766, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56788564, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:38:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56763321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56763321</a><br>The issue is that there is strong materials that DO come close to something made just as a cast one, but it is VERY expensive material, that also needs a well controlled environment, and high end parts even tend to wear out altogether when printing.

British troops were known for their professionalism and aggression and until the fall of France they were the only army in Europe to be fully mechanized. The Norwegian campaign was a joint French-British expedition that was essentially doomed to fail due to the lack of decisive moves by allied commanders, causing the beleaguered Norwegians to fight on their own until near the end. With regards to Crete the British had just evacuated Greece and were primarily concerned with theatre concerns like what to do with the evacuated troops and how to deal with events in North Africa. British troops in the fight for Crete were essentially ad-hoc and had limited resources with which to defend the whole island. An airborne assault was mostly unexpected as one of that scale had never been attempted before. Nevertheless the British soldiery was sufficient enough to convince the Germans to never attempt another major airborne operation. The German opinion of the British was positive during this period and the mistakes and gaps in equipment and doctrine were largely ironed out by late 1942. This period also saw the British development of the commando, the successful evacuation of Dunkirk (they still had to abandon several thousands in the rear guard and at Calais with the French), Arras, operation compass and crusader and the British and Soviet occupation of Iran. You also have to remember the British were also spread throughout the entire world, fighting in places as remote as Madagascar and Iraq while at war with the Germans.<br><br>Unironically the worst early war army factoring in its size was the red army.

The most minor ones being that in some of those action sequences theres some real retarded shit that makes zero sense. The most primary one being the hallway scene where the main chicks brother is trying to leave a hotel I think it is. There&#039;s multiple instances where that bodyguard chick should have been fucking riddled with bullets, but random cuts just show her gooning on the teams sent after them. I don&#039;t fucking care how good you are in combat, there is no realistic reason how someone should be able to cross a bare minimum 20 meters down a straight hallway with three shooters aiming for you and come out unscathed while wearing no body armor. But all of that pales to just how fucking retarded Koko is in her goal. Big spoilers ahead in case you give a fuck about this awful series, her goal is to stop war by closing off air travel. The idea is without the means of ease that air weaponry gives to warfare, people will just fighting. There&#039;s retard moment number one. Now, obviously people being people, they&#039;ll just rely on their navies and land based technology, if that happens her plan is to somehow make those not work too with I guess some fucking literal magic. What she&#039;s fucking idiotic about is all she would do is cause MORE war. Take away primarily logistical means by which other countries need to survive?

Instead I would take maybe a dozen planes. Let&#039;s say a trio of B2s or 21s armed with MOPs and the rest F35s. The 35s not escorting would fly upstream and bomb the multitude of honestly just as sizeable arch dams. Hitting probably just the top 4 or 5 would be more then enough to cause a cascade effect that would at the very least lead to overtopping of the other dams if not their complete destruction. The bombers would drop their MOPs on TGD it&#039;s self. These while they wouldn&#039;t destroy the dam by any means would heavily weaken it.
