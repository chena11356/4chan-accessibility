It blocks at least some of the radiation. And no, you&#039;re not getting eye or brain cancer from a CRT; even at sitting-at-desk distances, it gives roughly the same radiation as the sun itself.

Maybe it is adrenaline making them hyperfocused on what\u2019s in their immediate view, but that kind of means that unless you happen upon them, previous IRL experience shows that they\u2019re unlikely to dig you out, and assuming an office corridor with dozens of rooms, hiding seems like a pretty good option for your average panicking civilian.

Imagine a tax department office where customers regularly threatened us, got pushy in the front desk or made hoax calls. <br><br>There were several key key changes<br>A. Our fire exits were assessed for human threats, turns out someone could have parked a car blocking one of our fire escapes because it led into the carpark and we wouldn&#039;t have known unless someone actually tried to use the fire escape. <br>The second fire escape was found to be unsuitable because an external fire could have blocked it. <br>Basically someone could have parked against the first door, walked around with a jerry can and torched the second door and within 30 seconds entered the front door. Bad situation. <br><br>So bollards were put up around the first door to stop anyone parking there, it wasn&#039;t a parking space but people routinely parked there anyway. <br>The second door was fire proofed with an angled cement section to repel flammable liquid and an external sprinkler was installed. <br><br>B. Ability for a shooter to trap people on any section or floor was reduced. <br>Internal security doors were installed, extra doors were put in between rooms, the stairwell was modified so someone standing in the first stairwell couldn&#039;t shoot at the second one. <br><br>C. External security cameras were now able to be monitored by reception staff to better deal with sub critical threats, as these were in public the privacy consideration was considerably less serious, nobody wanted karen to spy on them smoking in the carpark but reception needed that visibility to identify someone who had attempted entry from one side of the building and then went around. That person would be drunk or lost 99% of the time but this let reception lock the front door", "time": 1671365545, "resto": 56428013}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 56430845, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:19:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;his missile doesn&#039;t have an OFFICIAL theme song</span><br><br>OH NO NO NO NO NO", "filename": "Sarmat", "ext": ".webm", "w": 854, "h": 480, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1671301166598828, "time": 1671301166, "md5": "BLwVjC8/w5iAvxk7yo61xA==", "fsize": 2876619, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "his-missile-doesnt-have-an-official-theme-song", "replies": 135, "images": 32, "unique_ips": 81, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 56430866, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:21:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56430845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56430845</a><br>no but it&#039;s actually working", "time": 1671301261, "resto": 56430845}, {"no": 56430873, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:22:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56430866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56430866</a><br>hmmmm<br><br>then why is NATO so scared of the Sarmat<br><br>????", "time": 1671301325, "resto": 56430845}, {"no": 56430884, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:23:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56430873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56430873</a><br>it&#039;s not, its why it walks over every one of your red lines", "time": 1671301413, "resto": 56430845}, {"no": 56430891, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:24:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56430873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56430873</a><br>Because in the west we care about human life, even if it&#039;s just a single one that&#039;s taken by a stray rocket that hits someone on the head without exploding", "time": 1671301465, "resto": 56430845}, {"no": 56430896, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:24:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56430845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56430845</a><br>It&#039;s funny how like 80% of the people in that group look like they are being held at gunpoint.

The second patriarch lost everything when the Takeda clan was effectively destroyed at Nagashino and then won everything back by successfully playing all of the major warlords against each other, to his own benefit.

Practical civilian usage usually revolves around accuracy, whether that be on the range plinking paper or tin cans, hunting, or wildcat autism and very little full auto blasting.

Elephants were used at the same time as black powder muskets. <br>Musket balls couldnt penetrate properly &#039;proofed&#039; armour until the late 17th.c, whereupon armour which remained proofed had to become excessively thick. A musket ball fired from a flintlock, can generally penetrate, according to its calibre, the equivalent cm thickness in steel. For example a .75 brown bess musket could penetrate .75 of a cm in steel, or 7.5mm. Steel breastplates of around 6mm at the centre, which were somewhat angled, were often enough to stop musket balls at their strongest point at close range, or generally at longer range, but it was heavy and cumbersome. Modern cased ammunition is much higher velocity but isnt neccessarily better at penetrating armour unless it is armour piercing. m955 tungsten .556 AP can penetrate 12mm at 100 metres, allegedly. .556 ball is much worse, i cant find exactly how much worse, all i&#039;ve found is 3mm at 600 metres.

Matchlock arquebuses become popular during the Italian Wars, so plate starts becoming thicker to deal with them, although its still resistant. Late 16th.c onwards its much thicker, 3-5mm generally throughout the cuirass. Then proof cuirasses appear, which are heavier and feature a pinched peascod, these tend to be 5-7mm in the centre of the cuirass, and 3.5-4mm around the arm holes and the edges. Theyre completely shot proof until the late 17th.c, and remain shot resistant even afterwards. Now obviously this old steel isnt really comparable with modern steel, but point is that it was thick enough to stop firearms, and given the right angle, even crap steel armour can be of sufficient thickness to stop a rifle bullet. They&#039;d be throwing 20mm armour plates on trolls because trolls are huge and dont care so much about the weight, they take a lot of impacts/hits and the armour wont be regularly maintained, and its hard to make armour that size so thin.

Modern bullets are more effective at armour penetration than muskets certainly, but steel quality improves a lot from the 15th.c onwards, for high quality armour you get high carbon and well tempered +hot quenched steels, which are easily equivalent to modern steels like EN C35-C75. There is absolutely not a big difference between modern mild and medium carbon steels and the steels of decent quality armour, including the ones which dealt with muskets. Yeah munition armour may often be much lower quality, but a lot of it was fairly decent, at least according to the figures given in &quot;Knights and the blast furnace&quot;.

It causes you to look weak and dumb. That&#039;s a free life lesson for you. Here&#039;s another, some grips are way better than others. Nil-grips are some of the best for example. Meanwhile something like the Wilson Combat EDC 9 have super shitty grips. A bad grip will do nothing to help with recoil control or dissuade user error. Many people hate Glock grips and for myself the shape of the full size gen3, for example is one that I tend to a palm a little. My groups will be an inch high and to the side at 10 yards if I&#039;m not careful. A lot of it is personal fit but a slippery grip is much harder to hold steady during recoil and will have incorrect contact points that promote user error. It&#039;s a thing and some grips, which have had a lot invested into making them user friendly, such as on the Walther PPQ are in fact generically better across the spectrum due to superior grip technology.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No?

According to the Soviet-German experience in WW2, most engagements were within 150 meters. It would have been lethal trying to engage beyond that because the opfor had snipers and what would later become DMRs like the Dragunov.<br>As for short range optics like the Aimpoint, it\u2019s not feasible to equip every man with them, and if you train your army to use Aimpoints, they can\u2019t hit shit when they stop working.<br>Further thinking of it, training with iron sights is better for combat because most of the accuracy comes from muscle memory and after that you\u2019re basically just using the front sight. This should be enough for the intended engagement range.<br>So did the AK-47 design intentionally incorporate a \u201csafety feature\u201d making it difficult to mount optics so that some idiot general won\u2019t get any foolish ideas about how to use the weapon? They kept the design in the AK-74 that came years after the Dragunov, so clearly this was to stress the fact that you shouldn\u2019t try to engage the enemy beyond reasonable iron sight range as you\u2019d be going against DMRs and sniper rifles.

Given that .277 has a max pressure of 80k psi and 0.5312in^2 case capacity vs .308 having 62k psi pressure and 0.4985in^2 case capacity you&#039;d basically have to resort to something very close to lying to pretend that 6.8x51mm isn&#039;t huuuugely more powerful and lethal than 7 62x51mm (which has even lower case capacity than 308).", "time": 1671356806, "resto": 56435606}, {"no": 56437737, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)04:59:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56435606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56435606</a><br>you need to be 18 or older to post here", "time": 1671357560, "resto": 56435606}, {"no": 56437748, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:03:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56437687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56437687</a>", "filename": "retard chamber", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 768, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671357785891231, "time": 1671357785, "md5": "Nrz/KR5HPlqFxHBRZ0UEFQ==", "fsize": 175366, "resto": 56435606}, {"no": 56437885, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:34:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56437737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56437737</a><br>What&#039;s underage about my post?", "time": 1671359699, "resto": 56435606}, {"no": 56437986, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:02:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56435606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56435606</a><br>Will Textron make this for public sale in spite of its failure. <br>Please.", "filename": "20221218_060125", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1057, "h": 345, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 40, "tim": 1671361344611725, "time": 1671361344, "md5": "FX8UFPxR3Hr30iG8rJshBg==", "fsize": 44865, "resto": 56435606}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 56437788, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:14:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;severe hyperacusis </span><br>it\u2019s unironically over", "filename": "B6D0C4D5-C6CF-4D1B-BC4E-11CB6C17BFE1", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 278, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 139, "tim": 1671358468483823, "time": 1671358468, "md5": "H2Fzw7yoi0c2lE+X4/R5Ug==", "fsize": 3310287, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "severe-hyperacusis", "replies": 6, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 56437821, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:22:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56437788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56437788</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;browsing/k/ and /fit/</span><br>So you&#039;re buff and autistic?", "time": 1671358953, "resto": 56437788}, {"no": 56437844, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:27:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56437821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56437821</a><br>I browse those as well as /biz/, /mu/, /lit/, /v/, and /pol/.

Granted, it was the &quot;gen 1&quot; model from when they first started making them so maybe they&#039;ve sorted out the issues by now but the trigger on mine had a very gritty/crunchy take-up. I took the thing apart and cleaned and oiled it and could not smooth out the trigger no matter how thoroughly I lubed it up. The sights and barrel alignment were slightly off as well, I had to dial the factory rear sight as far over to the right as it could to get it to match POI.

The NREF was issued US-made Mosin-Nagant rifles that had been purchased by the Imperial Russian government and had been in transit to Russia when the Bolsheviks took over. The Mosins were held in Britain, then issued to the NREF in place of their US M1917 rifles because large supplies of 7.62x54R ammunition were also present in Arkhangelsk and Murmansk and it was thought it would simplify supply issues. It is interesting to see sailors off Olympia carrying them, because I have a picture of Olympia sailors taken earlier in the year when they first arrived in Murmansk and they have M1903s. <br><br><a href=\"#p56426494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426494</a><br>Remington Arms and Westinghouse produced them for the Russians, but the rifles purchased by the US government weren&#039;t used to arm the NREF.

Also use our steel for those sample guns you&#039;re making us, because it&#039;s better.&quot; And be right on both counts. They have the stock disks which were used by armories to record the barrel quality, you can see if your gun was rebarrelled there. Bear in mind the information stamped on the stock is literally decades out of date, so trying to guess the current quality off of that is silly.<br><br>Personally, I would go for the M38, it&#039;s a very cool rifle at a more reasonable size than the M96. I also really like the m1894 carbines, a lot of them were made pre-1899, and therefore not legally a modern firearm so you can have it shipped to your door no background check no FFL without a C&amp;R, which is pretty fucking neato. The M/94 was so far ahead of its time. ~18&quot; barrel, 6.5 caliber rifle in 1894.

If you are looking for an FN Model 50 i can only give you a bit of info, not much out there on these rifles. In the 50s FN made a contract with Colombia, since columbia got a ton of 30-06 surplus from the good ol USA for a good price. They made their last military mausers: The FN Model 50 in 30-06. They have a longer magazine and action and a cutout in the Receiver to accomodate longer 30-06 loads. They also made the stripper clip groove wider, i think for Springfield clips originally. They also send some of these Rifles to the congo, and kept some for their own army in reserve. The Colombian ones got the colombian crest on the receiver, the belgian ones the crown and the kings name in short. The colombians also converted some old 1924 Rifles to 30-06, those will have a &quot;30&quot; behind the stripper clip groove. A lot of the belgian ones will have the crown and other markings scrubbed off like mine. Also they made these with a grey-green type of coating for the colombian navy and the congo and black paint for the colombian and belgian army. They made two types: The shorter 1930 pattern and the longer 1924 pattern, mine is a 1924 pattern with a straight bolt handle and 23 inch barrel. They should take K98, VZ24 and Preduzece and FN bayonets. One very characteristic thing is a special buttplate with a wave pattern for more grip. Generally the &quot;Congo&quot; models saw alot of action and are worn accordingly, the belgian and colombian army ones are normally in great condition. Again, FN made these long after the war with the best materials and 30 years of experience, they are great shooters. Oh also, some (like mine) were refurbished before being sold to the civilian market, mine has a non matching stock in a great color and with FN Arsenal markings, thats normal as well. Also also, some have a 2000 meter rear sight, some have a 1900. Not sure whats up with that, i think they reused old parts for the rear sight", "filename": "FNStock", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2364, "h": 1773, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671311567024526, "time": 1671311567, "md5": "LNu61Iq6d8p3y9AQ/yCudA==", "fsize": 544335, "resto": 56426949, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56432468, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)16:26:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56432361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56432361</a><br>pic related is the buttstock pad, unique as far as i know. works fairly good as well, i swear 30-06 has less recoil than 8x57", "filename": "FN50Buttplate", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2364, "h": 1773, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671312363258585, "time": 1671312363, "md5": "ZGVahUYo4ukO4CN3a9H1XA==", "fsize": 519507, "resto": 56426949, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56433537, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:32:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56431918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56431918</a><br>OP here. Frankly the thing about 6.5 Swedes is they realized, they don&#039;t need to fire artillery shells out of their rifles, because they shoot further and faster than is required for most engagements. 6.5 55 only has about 6-7lb of recoil, which is very forgiving; when they introduced the cartridge a increase in accuracy for their troops was pretty obvious from the start, because it&#039;s easier to have troops that are confident with their caliber and control the recoil easier.

Basically something with very little ability to be hacked externally. Imagine a bot that is doing constant video processing to identify movements (even while subtracting its own) and thermal signatures; you barely poke your head out and it&#039;s spotted some movement, if not thermal. Within milliseconds, it&#039;s decided to aim a telephoto lens at you, then it identifies &quot;guy poking his head out&quot;. Depending of SOP, it could already be moving its servos to aim a weapon in your direction and it hasn&#039;t even been 10 milliseconds. At this point, it&#039;s waiting to see if you have a weapon. An eternety later, you finally raise your rifle to a position where it can spot and identify a weapon, and it&#039;s already firing. <br><br>So mobility depends on what gait this thing chooses. Three legged gaits are weird, but there are a variety of gaits that go from slow and energy efficient, to simply tucking one leg and running on two for higher speed at a cost of regular two-legged gait energy expenditure.<br><br>With high end bot to bot encryption, teams of these could coordinate. They only accept transmission from robot members of their own team. &quot;Hacking&quot; current encryption is still computationally impossible while this level of AI is not (even if we haven&#039;t figured out how to &quot;program&quot; such AI, there&#039;s nothing computationally &quot;impossible&quot; about it at this point). Teams of these would be scarier; you mortar or snipe one of these bots, they&#039;ve already triangulated your mortar position using each other&#039;s microphones.

The case head is quite a bit bigger so by the time the bolt face is machined out enough to accomodate the .458&#039;s case head there is not much material left around the locking lugs. This means that most commercial .458 ammo is loaded very light (say, 30,000 psi or under) and even that cracks bolts. To get the most out of it you need a stronger platform, but there aren&#039;t many of those around. The only one that comes to mind is CMMG. They used to call it the &quot;Anvil&quot;, I&#039;m not sure what they call it now. It&#039;s basically an AR-10 size bolt head but with an AR-15 length action. That is strong enough that you can load the Socom to its max potential but there aren&#039;t any other options like that which I know of, and even then you&#039;re pretty much forced to handload since off the shelf ammo is cucked for the average gun built on an AR-15 bolt head.", "time": 1671307685, "resto": 56431053}, {"no": 56431982, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)15:28:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56431053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56431053</a><br>Is there even an advantage to using it for home defense with 10 shot mags when you can use a 77gr tmk and doesn&#039;t it cost like $2 a round to use it for anything?

I think I&#039;m going to get a .22lr suppressor for hunting, then a PCP, despite the fact that the other way around would probably make more sense. Wait times for stamps are a bitch, though, so the sooner I start the process, the better. I have other air rifles, though, so it&#039;s a niche already partially filled. One partially filled by the Swarm, which I wish were smaller, but I love the quick loading. The other partially filled by the 1377, which I wish was mag fed, a pcp, and .22. You know, basically a Marauder with a stock.<br><br>I figure that buying a marauder with a decent scope will allow me to fill a role with what would otherwise would only be able to be filled by a takedown or an SBR. Pistols (firearms) wouldn&#039;t fill the role either as semi auto .22lr pistols are illegal to hunt with in this state despite semi auto .22lr rifles being totally fine. Bring a Marauder in a small hard (or well padded) case and if no foxes turn up while I&#039;m lugging around my .223, I can at least take it out to shoot some squirrels or maybe even groundhogs. Solves a problem I have, choosing what to take on a specific day. I can take a semi auto .22lr rifle as well as a .223 for fox, but it&#039;s hell on the back having to also bring all my other junk, including a little take-down seat if it&#039;s wet and cold out.<br><br><a href=\"#p56416316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416316</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for a PCP ban</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for an air rifle ban</span><br>Would be news to me.

My grandfather on that side of the family narrowly escaped the Gestapo on more than one occasion and got shot up by British Mosquitos when he fled to England, and his later wife, my grandmother, had nothing good to say about the Germans, but still told me outright that the regular German soldiers never did anything to anyone, and acted properly. That said, some of my grandfather&#039;s compatriots were caught and brutalized by the Gestapo during interrogation, though they survived the war.<br>Obviously there were other issues, like food being confiscated for the war effort and Norwegians being forced to rely on food stamps, with items like cheese, sugar and meat becoming luxury items (and boy do I have some weird stories to tell in that regard), not to mentioned the scorched earth policy in northern Norway when the Red Army invaded, and the decimation of Telav\u00e5g. However, most of the war crimes were committed by the Gestapo, and Terboven&#039;s personal army.<br>However, fewer than 1800 Norwegian civilians died during the occupation, and from what I recall, about half of those were killed due to Allied bombing raids, including one of my grandmother&#039;s cousins, when the Brits bombed an elementary school.", "time": 1671250956, "resto": 56413537}, {"no": 56426170, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:27:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56414055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414055</a><br>Can god also make it legal to get a 12 year old wife because I need one", "time": 1671251225, "resto": 56413537}, {"no": 56426178, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:28:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56426170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426170</a><br>Only if you move to Russia.", "time": 1671251327, "resto": 56413537}, {"no": 56426223, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:36:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56426178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426178</a><br>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s legal there either...", "time": 1671251776, "resto": 56413537}, {"no": 56426235, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:37:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56426223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426223</a><br>It&#039;s not legal, but it&#039;s not like Russians give a shit about laws.", "time": 1671251835, "resto": 56413537}, {"no": 56426285, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:45:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56422283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56422283</a><br>that utterly disgusts and offends me, and goes against one of the things the Scouts was meant to do for boys by giving them activities where they DIDN&#039;T have to deal with a female presence and thus could focus more on teambuilding and friendship.", "time": 1671252357, "resto": 56413537}, {"no": 56426382, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:57:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56426059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426059</a><br>Jiggle.", "time": 1671253078, "resto": 56413537}, {"no": 56426474, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:08:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56425881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56425881</a><br>Same guy as <a href=\"#p56426143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426143</a><br>I read over your post again, and I find it absolutely bizarre that you would claim that the Germans took your family&#039;s horses to plow some imaginary German fields, considering I can&#039;t imagine a scenario where that would be applicable.

The PLA planned to attack Kinmen from nearby Aotou, Dadeng and Lianhe by launching a first attack with 9,000 troops to establish a beachhead, before landing a second force of roughly 10,000 on Greater Kinmen Island, expecting to take the entire island in three days from an ROC garrison not expected to be larger than two divisions. The Communists had incorrectly estimated that there were only 12,000 Nationalist soldiers on the entire island with the belief that they consist of green recruits and demoralized remnants of conscripted units that had survived defeats in central China \u2013 a miscalculation that would contribute to their calamitous defeat. Expecting that a PLA attack was imminent, ROC commanders ordered the immediate construction of fortifications. By October, ROC troops had laid 7,455 land mines, and constructed roughly 200 earthen bunkers on the shores of Kinmen, as well as several anti-amphibious landing beach obstacles. The ROC garrison on Kinmen was also reinforced with armor (1st Battalion, 3rd Tank Regiment, which were veterans of Burma campaign, consisting of 22 M5A1 Stuart light tanks organized into two tank companies), battle-hardened infantry, and supplies from the 12th Army. In the opening hours of October 25, the PLA&#039;s armada (consisting of hundreds of wooden fishing boats) set sail for Kinmen. They intended to land near the village of Longkou on the narrowest part of the island. But due to the crudeness of their craft, choppy waters and winds, many of them were scattered and carried past Longkou and northwestwards toward the shore of Guningtou instead.&quot;", "time": 1671339046, "resto": 56435821}, {"no": 56436666, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:11:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56435901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56435901</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;delousing</span><br>use the MG", "time": 1671343880, "resto": 56435821}, {"no": 56437132, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)02:27:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56435821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56435821</a>", "filename": "1659374554549496", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 972, "h": 750, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1671348476475546, "time": 1671348476, "md5": "5Ph1vCApEBu853Xl4mDV/w==", "fsize": 181293, "resto": 56435821}, {"no": 56437333, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:05:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56435901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56435901</a><br>I like how the Centurion&#039;s first kill was against a friendly Cromwell in Korea that got swarmed by infantry and captured", "time": 1671350747, "resto": 56435821}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 56431338, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)14:20:19", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Palmetto State Armory AR-15", "com": "I just got one of these for my birthday.

PSA is good about labeling models as &quot;blem&quot; or blemished which means there&#039;s something slightly wrong with it, but it&#039;s still a usable rifle. This doesn&#039;t mean the finish is blemished, it could even be a crookedly drilled hole or a slightly misaligned rivet. At least they label these and some people will take the discounted gun and not care for the imperfection. But for ARs this is rare because they get the parts from other sources &amp; just finish them, get a non-blem one and test the barrel for accuracy or look up accuracy test videos. That&#039;s the only thing that can make an AR shit is a bad barrel and from what I know their barrels are fine.", "time": 1671332816, "resto": 56431338}, {"no": 56435400, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:11:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56435101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56435101</a><br>This, who the fuck is still buying ARs?

ARs and other modern military style rifles were a thing, but they were a niche like any other whereas now they are sort of the defacto standard. I think there&#039;s five main reasons why the AR became as popular as it is today:<br>1) the Clinton AWB, and laws like it, made people REALLY want what the gov said that they couldn&#039;t have. Plenty of people who previously didn&#039;t really care one way or the other about ARs suddenly wanted one because this might be their last chance to get one.<br>2) As the market grew ARs became inexpensive. The fact that they are so modular meant that people could buy one part-by-part as they could afford.<br>3) They are available in a variety of calibers and configurations which mean they are honestly a very practical suggestion for a variety of applications, from target shooting to hunting to defense.<br>4) They are honestly very simple to use. Accessible is another way to describe it: Recoil is light, manual of arms is simple, gun is easy to clean, work on, and modify. Ammo is relatively inexpensive compared to other calibers. It is beginner-friendly.<br>5) It&#039;s appearance in media, i.e. games and action movies.

I also remember the gun ranges were alot different. There was an old WW2 vet at our gun club that showed up twice a year with his garand and his 1911 he took home from the war. The guys were all... different. People talked to each other. And being a kid at the time id see someone shooting a cool gun and want to go see it. If i went over most every time they would let me shoot it, then let my dad shoot it, then it just became guys shooting each others guns and having a great time. Hell i even remember me and my asshole friends riding our bikes all over the damn county with our .22s over our shoulders and little CCI 50 round boxes of ammo jammed in our pockets. It was great. When the ban ended me and my dad both bought ARs. He got a full on A2 clone, i wanted an M4 clone.", "time": 1671241404, "resto": 56409001}, {"no": 56425085, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:59:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56424928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56424928</a><br>1990&#039;s gun show nostalgia is great. Fudd lore was the rule of the day and a lot of the guys that were into military rifles were survivalist types that also had conversion books and the jolly roger cookbook on those wire shelves for about $5 apiece. I tried every trigger gimmick like the hellfire and the GAT trigger on my Norinco SKS and they were all shit. Dad and I had fun with it though. I&#039;m lucky to have a cool dad that likes fun shit. I got a ban model MAK 90 and shot hundreds of beavers with it after my uncle would blow their dams with Tovex at our farm. The beavers would come back that same night and I&#039;d light them up. There weren&#039;t really any good ways to mount lights to AK&#039;s back then so dad hose clamped a mag light to it and away I went. The guys at the pawn shop down the road liked me and used to call me when crates of chink 7.62X39 would show up. It smelled like eggs. We have a lot more variety of high quality stuff for better prices these days for sure but those old imports like the Maadis, SKS&#039;s, SAR-1&#039;s, etc were awesome. Everybody hated the WASR-10 63&#039;s when they came out because compared to the others, they were shit.

Which goes against everything I know about the laws here but at the same time the guy runs a company that buys, fixes and sells antique bp guns. <br>The laws are so vage and hard to find out about that i feel that people are just making up their own rules to follow.", "time": 1670876916, "resto": 56324613}, {"no": 56374901, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)15:35:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56374842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56374842</a><br>where you lived", "time": 1670877345, "resto": 56324613}, {"no": 56374938, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)15:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56374901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56374901</a><br>Sweden", "time": 1670877512, "resto": 56324613}, {"no": 56375913, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:02:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Modern interpretation of a Gillespie bump", "filename": "1666415514214", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 558, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 43, "tim": 1670882552061327, "time": 1670882552, "md5": "cLyXwSubDN7UtFUXQY+BWw==", "fsize": 139352, "resto": 56324613, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56375921, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:03:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56374009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56374009</a><br>Southern Appalachia", "time": 1670882591, "resto": 56324613}, {"no": 56375935, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:04:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56374674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56374674</a>", "filename": "D4DF351D-ED40-4763-9033-FFA9650396C6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670882699432755, "time": 1670882699, "md5": "Xd/jESCPNrAh3WVALXcjEA==", "fsize": 3585815, "resto": 56324613, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56376161, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:30:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56375913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56375913</a>", "filename": "0DBE5691-7265-43AD-8539-23092FA2AA19", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670884248594901, "time": 1670884248, "md5": "NOYbBucMLIq9YDaW49yWEQ==", "fsize": 4175301, "resto": 56324613, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56376185, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:33:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If a BP firearm is the best you can use in a war setting, what are your back up/melee weapons?", "time": 1670884387, "resto": 56324613}, {"no": 56376297, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:44:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56376185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56376185</a><br>My AN IX Briquet, circa 1800.
