Certainly true fire control systems that only fire on calculated hits by the ballistics computer will deal with the capacity and recoil issue, but they aren&#039;t used widely yet. I can say that you certainly do see people at those distances. The idea that more range is useless because people haven&#039;t historically chosen to engage outside their weapons effective range is circular reasoning.<br><br>Optics matter a lot. WWI was fought with .30-06 out of 24 inch barrels, often in very open terrain thanks to years of shelling. But the effective range considered for the 1903 was lower than the M4.

The better LMG will be a boost. What will matter more is somehow getting designators or some other system for using rifle fire control systems to flag targets for squad level drones or the battlefield management system so artillery can be directed in by any rifleman. Bullet ballistics don&#039;t matter as much when you&#039;re getting to a point where IFVs or trailing ground drones can carry fully autonomous 60mm or 81mm mortars and sending them in is as easy as designating a spot with target recognition assistance. That&#039;s the fire power that matters. Maybe throw in a drone/small artillery support squad for every 3-4 fire teams so you have rapid spotting, mortar, and 105mm field gun backup on demand, organic. When the gun can aim itself based on a drone feed and fire itself and all the human has to do is fix issues and approve fire missions, you don&#039;t need a big team to run some serious fire power. <br><br>The LMG will still work better and since I think indirect fire will become more and more key, I like the switch.

it only weighed twenty pounds: thus, with a charge of ten drachms [270 grains] of powder, behind a half-pound shell, the recoil was so terrific, that I spun around like a weathercock in a hurricane. I really dreaded my own rifle, although I had been accustomed to heavy charges of powder, and severe recoil for some years. None of my men could fire it, and it was looked upon with a species of awe, and it was named &quot;Jenna-El-Mootfah&quot; (Child of a Cannon) by the Arabs, which being far too long a name for practice, I christened it the &quot;Baby;&quot; and the scream of this &quot;Baby&quot; loaded with a half-pound shell was always fatal. It was far too severe, and I very seldom fired it, but it is a curious fact, that I never fired a shot with that rifle without bagging: the entire practice, during several years, was confined to about twenty shots. I was afraid to use it; but now and then it was absolutely necessary that it should be cleaned, after months of staying loaded. On such occasions my men had the gratification of firing it, and the explosion was always accompanied by two men falling on their backs (one having propped up the shooter), and the &quot;Baby&quot; flying some yards behind them.

It is a deep modernization of Mosin Model 1891/1930 rifle, 7.62 mm caliber.</span><br>Ukrainian gunsmiths upgraded this weapon in accordance with NATO standards. New sniper rifle was designed to use 7.62\u00d754 mm cartridge, and has 730 mm barrel. Rate of fire is up to 20 shots per minute. Cartridges are fed from five- or ten-shot boxtype magazine. VM MP-UOS Sniper Rifle is equipped with optical sight and Harris SBR folding telescopic bipod. The modernization allowed to increase range of fire and to decrease recoil during fire. The sound of shot is diminished considerably due to the use of silencer therefore the rifle can be used stealthily.<br>In the framework of Mosin rifle re-equipment, other alterations in the design were made. Buttstock and wooden rifle stock were replaced by new rifle stock produced of polymer materials and aluminum alloy and adjustable buttstock and pistol grip.

When you&#039;re critically short on labor, and don&#039;t have forklifts, that can matter a lot. Big reason why they were still used in shipping until the invention of the modern ISO containers. Paying your cargo handlers has always been one of the biggest expenses of shipping stuff.<br>Second, barrels only take two machining operations to run off of a belt of sheet metal (cut, roll around a mandrel with the ribs and weld). Then you drop in the inserts, cap &#039;em off with round plates, and run &#039;em out to the back yard. A metal crate takes three folds, four welds, and a much more complex cut for the body, plus you need hinges.

It&#039;s also worth noting that once you get some training neither are really a problem to handle, and you should be doing this anyways. Either way, when you&#039;re shooting faster, you&#039;re not really going to get good shot placement. You realistically just need to be able to mitigate recoil enough to get enough shots on target, ideally the chest cavity to increase odds of hitting something vital. In this regard 5.7 does have the advantage as you can fit more in a magazine.<br><br>I think another metric worth comparing is projectile energy. 9mm has more energy, and the target&#039;s body must disperse that energy to stop the bullet. There are also more readily available options on the market like +P. That being said, it doesn&#039;t matter if the projectile has more energy if it doesn&#039;t hit anything important. The projectile not having enough energy to penetrate does matter, but the 5.7 doesn&#039;t try to expand nearly as much as 9mm.<br><br>For civilian use I don&#039;t really think there is enough of a difference personally for it to matter one way or another. Both are good and significantly better than nothing. I hope that with more 5.7 models on the market the price of the ammo will go down and we will see more use and get better data on effectiveness.", "time": 1674859378, "resto": 56925285}, {"no": 56930260, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:55:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56925878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56925878</a><br>lmao bro, that&#039;s rough.

Revising that would mean a major change in their force composition likely including new tank design and a replacement of most of their tank fleet. That is a multi decade project. They cannot do that in the course of this war. Also, the idea is not bad given logistical constraints of the russian military. It\u2019s simply not feasible to standardize on T80s and T72B derivatives are not up to the task. They could try to replace their entire fleet with T90s, but that is also a decade of production at least.

The primer detonated after approximately 2 seconds, or 15J dissipated energy. The primer actually blew out the back and damaged my alligator clip (pic related).

Doing some back of the napkin math, I think my guess was wrong. A shotgun primer weights ~0.250g. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/gC. If all ~15J was dissipated evenly in the primer itself, it would have raised in temperature by ~155C. The auto ignition temperature of primers is ~170-190C. The shells were at room temperature ~18C initially. This all adds up to the thermal conduction being negligible.<br>I&#039;m looking into this specifically for a single shot breech loader, so charge time and battery life are not major concerns for me.

The barred window was the only view port into the armory and behind it was a tired older woman currently reading through the newest edition of &quot;Loaded Packages Weekly&quot;, a magazine known for its cool guns, and even hotter men.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Um, hello?</span><br> The woman looked up, popping her chewing gum and brushing her lightly silvered hair away from her eyes.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;You the powder-bagger?&quot;</span><br> Anon scratched at his neck, avoiding her gaze.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I guess?

His little home was small, but he was able to pay for it thanks to the large advance from his job. The carpet was a warm gray, already furnished in plain, but comfortable furniture, and his new flatscreen was still humming with the news.<br> Further down in Texas, the Gunslinger Girl Gang was still on the run, having killed three peace officers in a robbery.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Barbarians...</span><br> Anon muttered to himself, then looked down at the case in his hand.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do they even need these things?

One thing Anon loved more than anything was the freedom of choice here in the midwest, especially when it comes to food. Back in California, only approved foods could be bought in stores. Here, anything and everything was up for grabs, and he plucked the ever comforting chocolate pudding snack-pack from his fridge.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oh sweet cancer causing delight, come to me...</span><br> He pressed down on his kettle button then peeled back the film on top of the pudding cup, breathing in the artificial flavors and dairy powders<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oh yeah... thats the stuff.</span><br> Anon managed to only dip his finger once into the pudding, licking his finger as he poured water into his tea mug and plopping a bag into it. With drink and snack in hand, he settled into the couch and flicked through the channels, settling on a war movie channel. Today it was We Were Soldiers, a movie banned back in California due to it&#039;s graphic nature and glorification of war.<br> The snack pack managed to survive halfway through the movie, Anon savoring each bite with his spoon with an almost devilish indulgence. When his tea cup was empty, pudding finished, and Sergeant Major Whoshisface defending the casualty point, Anon began to actually watch the movie.<br> His eyes settled on the 1911 used by the older Sergeant Major, and he narrowed them, watching as the weapon of war was wielded with such ease. His eyes then traveled down to the case on the couch beside him, and he drummed his fingers on his thighs.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They wouldn&#039;t give me one of those, would they?..</span><br>Anon edged closer to the edge of the case, looking down at it while still drumming his fingers on his thighs.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve never even held one of these before.

I have no idea what this is.</span><br>He looked up at the movie, saw no one in particular was using this kind of pistol, then dipped his hand into the case, wiggling the pistol free of it&#039;s plush grooves.

Instead, the second echelon in the north never came. <br><br>Suddenly, reports came in of Ukraine pushing to cut off the traffic jam on the west side of the Dnipro, and it seemed to dawn on everyone that Russia was well and truly fucked and if they didn&#039;t run away they were going to get surrounded and destroyed.

That instantly told me that Russian ballistic missile strikes and CAP have failed to destroy Ukie air force even with the element of surprise. Ukies had very few relatively old planes, their air defense wasn&#039;t great either (allegedly) and so it was immediately obvious that if their airforce survived Russian shock &amp; awe and was actually running CAS at the tip of the frontline, then Russian attacks against other Ukie assents were a dismal, complete failure. Which in turn automatically meant that Russia had already lost the war of maneuver, right then and there. Sooner or later the losses from its checked thunder runs and open flanks will become so high it will have to switch to attritional warfare, just to have a chance to (at some point in the future) to defeat the conventional Ukie military. However, from the ferocious responce of the local Ukie population, even in the &quot;pro-Russian&quot; eastern regions it became immediately obvious that should Russia ever capture most of Ukraine and defeat its military, and some point in the future (back then I still considered that a likely possibility, though at enormous, ruinous attrition cost to russians), then its occupation forces would face the worst insurgency since Tito&#039;s Yugoslavia in WW2. So, the fate of the invasion was sealed then and there, on day 2 or 3 of the invasion.

I have an 11.9&quot; VZ that isn&#039;t too difficult to utilize building clearing tactics with. Keep in mind an AK will typically need a booster if cut to 12.5 (104 length) and the receiver itself is longer than a VZ. The VZ pistol lengths aren&#039;t cut down to the gas block, the gas system is shorter so they leave enough barrel on the end to get good enough powder burn past the gas port to reliably cycle without a booster. So you could run it with just a thread protector for the shortest possible package, or throw a birdcage type flash hider on and still be below AK104 length. Don&#039;t put a slant brake on a VZ, it messes up the recoil impulse since those are designed specifically to mitigate AK recoil impulse.<br><br>Either one you get is going to be good, but this is just my reasoning for why I went with a VZ as the top tier SBR. They&#039;re shorter overall and you&#039;re not limited to lame booster type muzzle devices. Ultimate indoor CQB 7.62x39 though would be an AK bullpup. A 16&quot; barrel AKBP is shorter than my VZ with the stock out. You can get around corners easier, no stock needs to be unfolded, and you get the commonality of an AK. You&#039;d have to chop your charging handle and use a gas tube handle if you want to shoot from the left shoulder. I&#039;ve also considered a 12.5&quot; AK as the bullpup build host but it&#039;s so short it&#039;s almost unsafe with how close your support hand is to the muzzle.

You&#039;ll only need one set of dies for both cartridges, and the .38 spl brass will basically last indefinitely if you load it at standard pressures. Loading .38 spl for a .357 mag gun is also one of the safest ways to start because you&#039;ve got a lot of safety overhead as the gun is way overbuilt for .38 spl. If you just wanna dip your toe I&#039;d get a Lee Hand Press (pic rel), a set of Lee .357/.38 dies, and a basic vibratory tumbler to clean your brass. If you don&#039;t already own a good set of calibers (which every man should) you&#039;ll need that too. The Lee dies will come with a volumetric powder scoop, which is good enough for getting started with .38 spl, but if you want to reload long term a Lee Perfect Powder Measure and a proper powder scale are both good upgrades. Get the carbide dies, then you won&#039;t need to lube your cases. If you have Scheels where you live, they sell these single cartridge reloading booklets that combine all the published data from every company for like $10. Scales are buy once, cry once. Nothing is more frustrating than a cheap scale that is inconsistent, inaccurate, and prone to wandering. Do not buy those Lee single caliber all in one reloading kits that require you to use a hammer. They work, but they are super frustrating and become useless if you decide to go deeper into reloading. The hand press isn&#039;t that much more expensive and I still use mine as a dedicated bullet puller even though I have more expensive bench-mounted presses.
