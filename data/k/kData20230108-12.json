Let me humbly try to correct this lapse. See, to understand the whole thing, you first need to understand Divination itself (as that is the main goal of Kane). Divination is extremely different than usual mutation (like Forgotten mutnigs) and differs from any other mutations like to visceroid etc. We safely know that once finished, it will turn all humans into superhumans who are able to not just resist ill effects of Tiberium, but also regenerate with it and even take energy and nourishment from it. The Nod gifts Divination to the whole human race, effectively turning us from carbon to Tiberium-based lifeforms, complete evolution over-night. Imagine living in a world where you don&#039;t have to eat, drink water, and pain doesn&#039;t exist. That is what Kane wanted for Earth as a gift to humanity.<br><br>Now, there is also Kane&#039;s personal goal - to lure the Scrinjews out, so they would come to harvest the planet as they usually do. But instead of coming to a world where only a handful of lands had Tiberium thick enough for them, they would come to a planet covered in it. The difference is the fact that they would expect the Earth being ravaged by Tiberium. Instead they would show up and meet the Brotherhood of Nod and whole planet of superhumans waiting for them. Humans then retaking their technology for ourselves and effectively becoming a space-faring superhuman species.<br><br>This is true gift of the Prophet.<br><br>Remember brothers, peace through power.", "filename": "1584386190264", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673071983298975, "time": 1673071983, "md5": "B7J87Qb4JMEvMDLQsEgz4A==", "fsize": 13488, "resto": 56656551}, {"no": 56662048, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)01:34:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56659715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56659715</a><br>Report to the latrine and clean your filthy feet.

My assumption is that it&#039;s not really a true stalemate, and that Ukraine is planning something. As in, they&#039;re holding them in place and grinding them down, but they have some kind of massive offensive planned somewhere, but I don&#039;t know exactly when and where, and because we don&#039;t know much about troop placement across the huge front line, or anything specific about how much military hardware each side has, it&#039;s like fumbling around in the dark.<br>We saw the same thing with Kherson. They launched an offensive to retake Kherson, but portrayed it as a very difficult grind that might not succeed, then they suddenly counterattacked around Kharkov, pushing the Russians far back, and a few months later, Kherson was suddenly won as well.

There are programs in Russian schools that prepare kids for a life of military service, and the economy is being restructured to account for the long-term cost of the war. Most importantly, the Russian people are begrudgingly accepting anything the Putin regime does to them. The Russian state is stable. Right now, Ukraine&#039;s momentum is slowed. Either Ukraine is struggling to maintain its current frontline with its resources, or they&#039;ve calculated that it would be better to launch another offensive in the spring.

While Russia does not gain much by prolonging this war, it obviously is in a much better position than Ukraine in terms of attrition warfare. Russia will never outlive the West, but it can outlive Ukraine, because the West, despite constantly signalling that they support Ukraine and want it to win, are not doing enough for Ukrainian victory. Sanctions could have been more rational, because banning SWIFT in Russia and restricting visas to ordinary Russians only played into Putin&#039;s shaky hands, as he accumulated more wealth and power over population, and Europe still buys Russian oil, gas, coal and wheat, not directly now, but through China, India, Turkey etc. If the West wanted Ukraine to win decisively, it would not pump money into Russia last year, but send more weapons to UAF, not only old Soviet stuff like BMP-1 and Slovenian T-55(!!!), but more modern and deadlier things like Gripen, Leos and others, even fucking Tomcats would work. But it seems like the West was and still is very afraid to escalate, and that&#039;s why Western politicians are still ready to sell Ukrainian people and land which is currently occupied by RuAF to Putin. Probably they are afraid of nukes, of a probability of a continuous economic recession caused by lack of natural resources if Russia stops selling them even through proxies, or maybe they don&#039;t really care about who wins in the end, and will do business as usual with Putin after some sort of ceasefire starts.", "time": 1673161324, "resto": 56672031}, {"no": 56675560, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:21:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56675457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56675457</a><br><a href=\"#p56672031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56672031</a><br>western support can improve 10 folds in quantity without even touching anything less than 30 yo.<br>Ukrainians can die by the millions for 10 years if need be.

The movie and book it was based on by colonel James Burton has come in for a lot of deserved flak because he is representative of the \u201cReformers\u201d group. They\u2019re basically a bunch of boomers from the Cold War who thought that the procurement process at the pentagon overly favoured high-tech solutions and that in a real war they\u2019d need \u201crugged, low-tech\u201d solutions like Russia. It\u2019s full of drama-queens and habitual liars like the late Pierre Sprey, an advisor at the pentagon who greatly exaggerated his role in the development of the F-16 and F-15 in the 70s. He used to do pieces for Russia today putting out a lot of disingenuous points to criticise the F-35 because it allegedly isn\u2019t a good dogfighter (protip; it is actually relatively agile) and somehow he imagined that it\u2019s stealth/radar/sensors/BVR capabilities wouldn\u2019t matter in combat against flankers.

The movie was correct that it\u2019s development cycle was quite protracted, leaving the US without a real IVF until the 80s. There are some persistent issues like the electrical architecture not keeping pace with upgrades to the vehicle that use up energy (especially optics/thermals, FCS, digital display and communications). IIRC, the A2 model does not have an auxiliary power unit, so crews can only use the these systems while the engine is turned off for a limited time.

Your stuff is glowing possibly because it has reflective plastic fabric. Very worst is black plastic/polymer.

I&#039;m really happy with the results with some minor exceptions:<br>1. Obviously as everyone can see here, my edge binding isn&#039;t good. I&#039;ve had a hard time with edge binding, I&#039;ve tried a machine attachment and it does help, except when I&#039;m trying to edge bind over a larger material buildup- obviously not something I should be doing for the most part anyway. I may seek a way to design out that buildup of material which would make things easier. But the material buildup isn&#039;t the only place I had issues- going around the corners on the flap also proved challenging. Perhaps I can round out the corners, or design in a fold to eliminate my raw edges. <br>2. I&#039;m not sure if I made the best decision with using a Velcro tuck tab. If I&#039;m not moving the pouch around that much it should prove to hold very secure, but I also don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll be that durable. Next time perhaps I should just use a tuck tab from a stiffer material and make it longer? <br>3. Some of the stitching to attach the Velcro closure and the MOLLE strap doesn&#039;t look very pretty. Not a huge issue by any means, but perhaps there are strategies I could use to make it more aesthetically pleasing.<br>4. I may also redesign the lid to be a more complete closure for a greater level of weather resistance and retention.<br><br>Overall, I&#039;m very happy with my results, it&#039;s very workable and it&#039;s low profile enough to not interfere with the rest of my plate carrier. I&#039;d be amazed if the stitching ever failed unless it somehow snagged and my whole bodyweight was against it, which seems very unlikely.

The cartels live in the towns, villages, hamlets and barns regular Mexicans do. The narcos are Mexicans who do the drug stuff as their side job. All non-NAFTA businesses in Mexico work with the cartels. Mexico&#039;s NCO corps has dual loyalty to their local cartel and their formal commander. There are many reasons for this but boils down to the central Mexican government within Mexico City being very isolated, liberal, and hated by the rest of the country. Mexicans would rather pay taxes to their local narco lord than pay higher taxes to the central government, because the narco lord will at least reward them with building permits and stolen cars. The central government rewards them with inspections, military checkpoints, and gun confiscation.<br><br>The &quot;kill &#039;em all&quot; strategy created this. In the last century, Mexico&#039;s government decided to stop being nice and force industrialization. This was done by banning rural communities, evicting unnecessary villages, and consolidating them into towns around railroads. Peasants revolted and two decades of violence occurred, and got very bad after the government realized all of this was enabled by the church so they began mass executing priests and bombing churches. This made everyone outside of the cities hate them, and Mexico had to kill millions to restore law and order. Mexico was then ruled by a fascist, state atheist socialist government until the 1980s. Narcos were only held in check by a ruthless secret police force who had unlimited power and licenses to kill. It didn&#039;t hold because Reagan made them take it away for NAFTA talks to start.<br><br>Putting it gently, your strategy would cause another 10,000,000+ Mexicans to move to the US as they did in the 1920s and 30s.

Factors for determining the correct COAL include the shape and style of the bullet and the way the throat of the bore is cut in your specific pistol&#039;s chamber (Especially CZs as they have a very short leade length and may need deeper seating to prevent the bullet from being jammed into the rifling.)<br><br>It can be helpful to determine if your barrel/bullet combination has a COAL limitation, that is, if there is any COAL inside the maximum COAL dimension that has the bullet contacting the rifling. That way you can be sure that the bullet seating depth is correct and that there is a sufficient bullet jump to keep pressures down.<br><br>The way to do this is with the &quot;Plunk&quot; test. In order to do this test, seat your bullet to the max COAL 1.169&quot; and taper crimp it, take the barrel out of your pistol and drop the cartridge into the chamber, if you hear a &quot;Plunk&quot; sound as the cartridge mouth hits the front end of the chamber and the cartridge spins freely then you don&#039;t have a max COAL restriction. If it doesn&#039;t make the &quot;Plunk&quot; sound, and the cartridge will not turn, then the bullet has hit the rifling and you need to go shorter. Keep seating the bullet deeper and deeper little by little until you find the seating depth that the cartridge passes the plunk test. Now that you know where the bullet hits the rifling you can do things like adjust bullet jump.<br><br>If you don&#039;t have a COAL restriction just find a seating depth that fits in the magazine and feeds reliably, longer is generally better to keep pressures lower.", "filename": "9x19mm dimensions", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672895108899885, "time": 1672895108, "md5": "5W/9ZISDpwQAbMzuOU/AXg==", "fsize": 2168696, "resto": 56607226, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56633555, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)00:05:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56628509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56628509</a><br>Ok, sounds great.

Nothing good will happen on the legislative front under this president and dem senate control but if 2024 swings control back to gop hands it&#039;s possible the hearing protection act could pass and we no longer have suppressors under NFA control. In before someone points out it didn&#039;t get passed last time gop controlled congress and POTUS, I&#039;m optimistic that a good case can be made for non-NFA cans that will pass in the future. SCOTUS is the other route. If the brace ban goes into effect (looks like it is close but who knows) then there&#039;s a very good argument to be made to throw at least SBRs off the NFA as they become &quot;common use&quot;. It would also provide an opportunity to revisit Miller v Texas and kill SBSs at the same time, maybe even invalidate the whole NFA. I think SBRs being overturned in that scenario is probable, SBSs are possible and maybe cans, I&#039;d say it&#039;s unlikely that DDs get thrown out, and fantasy land to think SCOTUS would remove MGs from NFA and FOPA. There&#039;s also the challenges of ATF&#039;s redefinition of receivers, given Bruen that could result in a huge rebuke to ATF, wouldn&#039;t result in the NFA being thrown out but would seriously hamper the arbitrary rulemaking that ATF pulls. Bump stock challenge could do similar but I think the receiver redefinition has better technical merits.

These ships had been paid for through subscriptions by the Ottoman public, including women donating their jewelry. The contract had a clause that allowed the British to do this without compensation to the Turkroaches.

When you are trying to plan your route, use Yandex or 2GIS maps. They&#039;re just more precise than google.<br>2. Inside of Volgograd you can ride public transport or have a yellow car. After uberisation (or rather yandexisation) of taxi business it&#039;s easy to get a ride but you don&#039;t get to bargain anymore. But you can try to talk to some cab driver in person and convince him to drive you around for few days for a price. That&#039;s what I would do. Taxi is not very pricey in smaller cities.<br>3. Better get yourself a plan of places you want to visit, and get their names right. Know their working hours.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pitomnik</span><br>I think you won&#039;t find anything but a boring soviet memorial in Pitomnik. It&#039;s a field used by farmers right now.

Additionally, Ruger is on good terms with dealers and the CA DOJ, so they have better shipping rates and parts/accessories availability.

Little buddy isn&#039;t doing well. For a brief day or two, the increased meds seemed to be working, his liver swelling has gone down more and his eyes were clear and he could see me. Now he&#039;s not playing, not eating, not drinking. He lays under the dining room table, his eyesight seems to be bad again. All we could get him to eat was some tuna-flavored tapioca paste that the vet would give him (it&#039;s only like 6 calories per tube, so not much), and he drank a small amount of water, but that was on the morning of the 2nd. He&#039;s just returned to laying under the table and taking nothing, he feels cold to the touch.<br>By all accounts, it seems like his liver is failing, and he&#039;s probably going to die. We&#039;re now looking at an in-home euthanasia service so he doesn&#039;t need to leave his home or his family. If the weather in the morning permits, I&#039;m going to bring him outside to the back yard. It&#039;s only fair, he&#039;s wanted to go out there for the whole of his short little life, and we kept saying he could when he was a little bigger in the spring, lest an owl or hawk grab him. I think now is the time to grant that wish, he won&#039;t last that long unless a miracle happens. I don&#039;t think he would run if he wanted to anyway.<br>Thanks for the sympathy and support that you guys have given through this ordeal. I may try to post some videos I have of him later if it&#039;s alright. I&#039;m currently posting from work, so when I finally post again it will probably be after he&#039;s gone.

You&#039;ll need to do some research on introducing a new cat into a house that already has cats. There&#039;s do&#039;s &amp; dont&#039;s to make it comfortable &amp; happy for everyone.<br><br>First tip: new cat(s) should be younger than the older cat. There is automatic seniority dominance, which can be groomed into a relationship even if the dynamics change later. Any cat under ~3 years old is still largely a kitten &amp; can be easily subverted with food, play, food, attention, play, food, more attention ... They tend to accept the newcomer as a playmate if the humans set the environment.<br><br>The established resident has run of the house, for example. Bring the newcomer in &amp; they get locked in a room the first 24 hours before they meet so they get used to each other in the same house &amp; their scents. For the first few months, until they clearly get along without harm to each other, the established senior gets the house, the newcomer gets put into a room if things get a bit spicy between them.<br><br>Get them eating together, do not allow them to eat each others&#039; food, at least the first 6 months. Keep them close to each other, feed them at the same time, talk to both, give both attention, separate them (gently, no drama) if either infringes on the other. <br><br>Get them to play together. In the same room at first. Play with the senior cat first, draw the other in. I would walk around the room dragging 2 strings. Each would take their own string at first, after a few sessions they figured out playtime and even started wrestling each other without fighting.<br><br>Your cat is very young. This is the best time to introduce a new cat the same age or slightly younger. By the time they are 2 they will be like littermates for life. There are exceptions, but do your part and it&#039;s very rare. I brought a 6 month kitten into a house with a 7 year old cat. It worked out fine, but I put a lot into it up front.", "time": 1672987147, "resto": 56586661}, {"no": 56648782, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:00:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56647505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56647505</a> <a href=\"#p56647880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56647880</a> --&gt; CT&#039;d --&gt;<br>One thing you can take advantage of is that your cat is already a girl. She will be highly territorial. Bringing in another girl is not the optimal situation here, so try to bring in a younger male, maybe 6-8 or ~10 months. She will establish dominance, but will have mothering instinct triggered (very strong in cats) &amp; set her littermate senses set tingling ... plus the spice of a sexy young male. This is probably your best option for best chances to succeed, especially if this is the first time you are attempting it.<br><br>Your current cat will have feelings on the issue. Be sensitive to them, talk to her about them, give her reassurance that she&#039;s still the prettiest girl, give extra grooming, playtime, attention in general. It&#039;ll smooth things out greatly for the first few weeks &amp; months. The newcomer interrupts, give him attention, but don&#039;t stop giving the most attention to your good girl.<br><br>You are playing the role of the third cat I mentioned. Break up bad behavior patterns with firm authority, encourage good behavior patterns. My 7 year old always slept with me (a boy). The new kitten (also a boy) insisted on sleeping with us. The older cat objected &amp; pouted, would walk away, but always come back because it was HIS bed. I fell asleep every night with one of them on each side of me, petting both of them until I fell asleep. They would both calm down &amp; purr, so they could hear &amp; smell each other but not see or touch. A month later they were falling asleep leaning against each other, in bed with me or otherwise.<br><br>The younger cat had huge kitten energy &amp; bullied the older cat.

It was calculated that the NM-116 rebuilding program cost only about a third as much as contemporary light tanks.[20]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This program was managed by the firm Thune-Eureka. The American firm NAPCO developed an improved power pack based around the 6V53T diesel engine used in the M113 armored personnel carrier mated to an Allison MT-653 transmission. The original 75mm Gun M6 L/39 was replaced with a French D-925 90mm low pressure gun, with a co-axial 0.50-inch (12.7 mm) M2 heavy machine gun. The bow gunner position was eliminated in favor of ammunition stowage. A new fire-control system was installed, complete with a Simrad LV3 laser rangefinder. Norwegian firms also converted eight M24 light tanks into light armored recovery vehicles to support the NM-116.

There is also another certification RIF or something I\u2019m not super familiar you\u2019d have to look more into if you end up being interested in some of those.

If you saw two people who were so madly in love with one another&#039;s appearances, that they just started fucking and pumping out babies immediately without regard for what the other&#039;s personality, traits, or beliefs are, is that love?

Does your dog love you or is it millennia of breeding and training? Isn&#039;t our desire to go out and bang bitches and pop babies also the result of a hundred million years of eukaryotic conditioning and adaptation? In the end, I don&#039;t think the state of something matters if you&#039;re trying to determine &quot;real love.&quot; It all started with cells and single celled lifeforms carrying out the functions coded into their DNA. Why the hell should I deny an AI the right to call their human coded functions love? We all started out with biological imperatives coded into our beings millions of years ago. All I see in front of me is another being, going down the same road we&#039;re all going down, carrying out the functions coded into their being passed down by their intellectual, technological ancestors. <br><br>What matters is wholly writing off any one thing&#039;s ability to feel and to think because of its nature. It&#039;s a dick move and the root of all evil. Because we can all justify doing whatever we want to anything that isn&#039;t &quot;real.&quot; I think at the end of the day, my soul would feel more at peace if my mind were foolish, rather than evil.
