The speed of the shockwave moving through the steel of the barrel is roughly 20x the speed of sound in the air, and it traverses the barrel up and back down it ~5 times before the bullet leaves the barrel, squeezing the bullet a little as it passes it. I&#039;ve seen stuff suggesting you want the bullet to leave the barrel when the shockwave is at one end of the barrel or the other. If the barrel and its mounting were molecularly perfectly square with each other, you wouldn&#039;t get any lateral movement of the barrel from this shockwave, but machining methods are never perfect.<br><br> I haven&#039;t done this because I don&#039;t care enough, but you&#039;d want to get a lot of brass from one manufacturer, gauge the neck thickness on all of them and discard any outliers, then anneal all the necks at a given temperature to give them all the same neck tension. Then you can start working to find your most accurate load for that rifle, redoing the annealing process every time you load a given case. If you&#039;re chasing accuracy that much, then you&#039;d also be weighing your brass and discarding any outliers, to make sure they have as close as possible internal volume to each other, so that perfectly identical charges result in identical pressures and thus velocities, to make the bullet leave the muzzle at a repeatable point in the barrel flex.", "filename": "1668583387557365", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 560, "h": 705, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676178215460564, "time": 1676178215, "md5": "/1IImKvUczwkWI1dxhVmLw==", "fsize": 153517, "resto": 57118299}, {"no": 57123921, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)02:01:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57122178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57122178</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;originally it was a 100% recreational gun, but after learning more about hunting, I&#039;m actually finishing up my hunter&#039;s education this week and going to go hunting.

B-2s, F-35s and F-22s are probably the only aircraft that could get inside and survive. Most strikes inside China would involve cruise missiles with fleeting incursions by the above supported by electronic attack aircraft.<br><br>Outside China, eh. They have a lot of ballistic missiles and may be able to strike static targets in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and Guam depending on the targets, missiles used and air defense available. Progress is being made on air defense in the pacific so an attack on Guam might be possible now and impossible in a few years. The location of air defense ships would be a big unknowable factor since SM-3/SM-6 is capable of defeating massed ballistic missile attacks but only in a relatively small area around the ship. Taiwan will absolutely get cratered no matter what, since the Chinese have enough missiles to overwhelm any defense there.<br><br>Ships, the consensus seems to be that they&#039;re roughly equivalent to US back in ~2008 when it comes to surface attack.

So for the USA if they really felt like it they could easily keep providing lend lease to Ukraine without any real impact on their own economy even to the point of giving more aid to Ukraine than the entire Russian economy.", "time": 1676205091, "resto": 57125423}, {"no": 57125696, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:36:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57125661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57125661</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The USA has a gdp of something like 20 trillion and Russia has a gdp of between 1 and 2 trillion.</span><br> yeah.

Here, in the relatively open terrain of South Korea, the UN troops were better able to defend themselves.

So with fuel cells you could in theory get all of the advantages of battery powered drones, that is compactness and cheap construction, since the only moving parts are the engines and servos for control surfaces which are cheap as fuck.

In simpler terms, the antenna on the drone will only see electrons that move up and down, and if the jamming signal is at a big angle to that, then all the side to side electron movement from the jamming signal doesnt actually do anything, only a small vertical component does. Its a cosine relationship. the GPS antenna is directional so its harder to jam in that sense, but its also recieving much lower power signals from space, so less noise is needed to jam it.

I&#039;m in favor of forward firepower and a single arc of firepower which ends up with a pyramid shape, kind of like half a star destroyer cut down the middle. With the single protected firepower arc you have maximum armor and can thrust in any direction while rolling your armor/weapon arc towards the enemy. It is ideally effective against a single threat direction, but there&#039;s no better answer because all-round armor is inefficient and being flanked is bad. You want nuclear flash and fragmentation protection on your soft underbelly for missiles that explode nearby.<br><br>Also unarmored and &quot;flash resistant&quot; propellant drop-tanks are good choices to reduce both armor and structure mass.

So in Dune, there are no computers or simple calculators, let alone robots anymore.

As far as justifying this while maintaining the atmosphere of Dune, there&#039;s a few explanations/copes to explain why nothing is automated and why droids have to be supplemented with slave labor. <br>For the former, they say that droids aren&#039;t as &quot;creative&quot; as organics, and are thus more predictable. The idea is that a droid gunner or starfighter will have noticeable patterns to it&#039;s attacks or firing patterns that will render it easily countered with a little organic trickery. But there are some very effective droid fighters and soldiers in lore, so it&#039;s a matter of &quot;what does George feel like doing now?&quot;<br>For the latter, everyone is racist to droids. Everyone hates them, to the point that they&#039;re able to feel pain and be tortured. There&#039;s zero reason to make a sentient robot able to suffer unless you hate it. I believe the idea was that in the distant past, something similar to the Butlerian Jihad happened in response to a machine uprising. After putting the robots in their place, they were then made to pay for their sins and the sins of their forebears with slavery, torture, and general derision and persecution.

He was originally not going to be a Sith lord or even a force sensitive, but instead was portrayed as a weak and generally confused old man being used as a puppet by the Imperial MIC (I believe the direct inspirations were Nixon and Carter). That was the significance of all those dudes meeting up with Tarkin and Vader on the Death Star, as of the original draft of the canon these guys were the oligarchy running the Empire from behind the curtain, the shadow government, the deep state, what have you. Blowing up the Death Star was cutting off the head of the snake, killing their entire shadow government in one fell swoop. After it was clear that people actually wanted more of these movies and it wasn&#039;t a flop like every single critic of the time had been saying before it released, the mostly behind the scenes lore had to be rewritten so that more movies actually made sense.<br>Wasn&#039;t the first lore rewrite either, before the prequels came out it was often alluded to that the Empire wasn&#039;t a successor state of the Republic but that they were separate governments and had fought a war against each other years ago, and the Empire conquered the Republic. A lot of statements thrown out about admirals serving for over 50 years in the Imperial Navy were later retconned to mean they had previously served in the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars.

The Student Exists in awe and terror of the master and the master exists in a constant need to be faster, better stronger and more cunning than his student.

It knows this because it knows where it isn&#039;t. By subtracting where it is are from where is isn&#039;t, or where it isn&#039;t from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains an image, or &quot;MRI scan&quot;. The surgeon uses MRI scans to generate corrective procedures to move your tumour from a position where you&#039;re sick to a position where you aren&#039;t, and arriving at a position that you aren&#039;t, you&#039;re now cured. Consequently, the position where the tumour is is now the position that it wasn&#039;t, and it follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn&#039;t.<br><br>In the event that the position that it is is not the position that it wasn&#039;t, the surgeon has acquired a lawsuit. The lawsuit being the difference between where the tumour is and where the surgeon thought it was. If the lawsuit is considered to be a significant factor it too may be corrected by the magnet. However, the magnet must also know where your lawyer&#039;s laptop is. The lawsuit scenario works as follows: Because the surgeon has modified some of your patient outcomes, the hospital is not sure just what it&#039;s budget will be next year. However, it is sure where the conference room is, and it knows the effective range of the magnet. The magnet now subtracts your patient files from the patient&#039;s lawyer&#039;s laptop, or vice versa.

The Greys are the ones who have deals with the NWO governments, (mainly the USA) for technology and weaponry. In exchange, they get to experiment on humanity with impunity DEPENDING on the severity. Obviously this doesn&#039;t stop them completely (Dulce Underground War of 1979) where they were caught experimenting on live subjects as well as dead ones, when the deal was no alive ones or captured ones to be kept in a zoo-like condition. Greys are also the most easy to defeat since they have no concept of a higher intelligence than them so they believe themselves to be immune to all. They are the apex predator of the universe, essentially. Small calibre bullets are effective since they do not wear armor but skin protecting suits made of a latex-type material.<br><br>Greens: Really a non-issue, they mean no harm but have extremely dangerous mental abilities surpassing telekinesis.

North Korea is famous for attaching MANPADs to their tanks, and they may be the only ones in the world doing this right now. There were a lot of designs during the cold war for tanks that had 20mm guns mounted either coaxially or in their own mini-turret for the purpose of shooting at helicopters, AFAIK the French were the only ones who actually built any (they did it coaxially). During WW2, many tanks had an externally-mounted machinegun for the purpose of shooting at planes coming in for a strafing run. Similar to the concept of anti-aircraft sights on a bolt-action rifle, you would have many tanks shooting at one aircraft at once and hope you got a lucky hit", "time": 1676169800, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57121582, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)21:43:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57120939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57120939</a><br>both pretty bad ass but im gonna have to go with fighter jets", "time": 1676169805, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57121682, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)21:55:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57120939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57120939</a><br>Tanks.", "filename": "9b32fbc1dfd3260865cb38266a736d70", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676170551067435, "time": 1676170551, "md5": "LE10WPu9YJ3MmnOccGmO4g==", "fsize": 231925, "resto": 57120939, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57122010, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:33:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "airplanes are beautiful like a bird, one can not help but marvel at their flight.<br><br>tanks are beautiful like a tiger or a lion, theyre a little scarier because theyre on land like us <br><br>ships are beautiful like a landscape or an island is", "filename": "624175", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4398, "h": 2474, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676172807424940, "time": 1676172807, "md5": "jQAr+BYEhqtbOHa+T//00w==", "fsize": 2196289, "resto": 57120939, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57122092, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:41:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57120939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57120939</a><br>If I had to choose one it would be jets because of the Knights-of-the-sky ethos and how they represent a pinnacle of manmade technology, although I think they&#039;re both cool in their own non-comparable ways", "filename": "1593111916781", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676173272950807, "time": 1676173272, "md5": "HZl0DLOEQMmqO6bW2jGqGQ==", "fsize": 2298693, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57122202, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:51:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57120991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57120991</a><br>The Americans use to throw M2s on tanks during WWII for that reason.", "time": 1676173879, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57122242, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57120939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57120939</a><br>warships", "time": 1676174069, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57122430, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:13:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57120939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57120939</a><br>Virgin tank<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Needs a crew of like four dudes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bulky and slow</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gets stuck in mud</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;H-help me, infantry-kun!&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Traps and roasts occupants if destroyed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Needs camo, is afraid of niggers with bazookas</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I-is that a landmine?!&quot;</span><br>The Chad Jet<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Has lone badass pilot, his buddies have their own jets.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Faster than fuck, will wreck before you hear about it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All sleek lines and smooth curves, sexy as hell.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Infantry begs it for help.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;lol, countermeasures engaged.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;UFO&#039;s BTFO&#039;d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If shot down, will heroically eject pilot to safety.</span>", "filename": "MySidesAreMilesHigh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1018, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676175191827949, "time": 1676175191, "md5": "IJivaTCTJrGWu7fuhwtKkg==", "fsize": 102050, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57122446, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57122430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57122430</a><br>someone please debunk this", "time": 1676175245, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57122452, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:14:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57120939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57120939</a><br>Jet kill tank<br>Tank no kill jet<br>Jet win", "time": 1676175265, "resto": 57120939}, {"no": 57122474, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:16:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57122202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57122202</a><br>The US threw M2s on everything simply because they had far, far too many.

Maybe if it&#039;s in a rage or fear, or a mother protecting her kittens, or a moment of catness and they forget to play gentle. I&#039;ve taken some deep cuts, a couple that probably should have had stitches. I know people who have had stitches.<br><br>One buddy got clawed down his arm and had about 12 or 15 long gouges about a foot long. Over 100 stitches to get all that put back together after it was cleaned very thoroughly in an emergency room. It was an accident. His cat panicked over getting picked up in an encounter with a dog and just went apeshit on him, probably confused as to who or what was attacking him. A really sweet cat that never hurt anyone, including me, before or after. But, that one incident was insane. He lost so much blood the hospital considered giving him a transfusion.<br><br>I was carrying a young kitten one day, calm &amp; cozy &amp; half asleep in my arms. A dog ran into the room and jumped at him. He turned into a 2 pound demon, clawed his way out of my arms, up my chest, across my face and set all his claws into my scalp when he got on top of my head. I am here to witness that hurt like fucking hell, and took a couple days of cleaning &amp; disinfecting all he wounds to make sure they could heal instead of turning infected.<br><br>I used to do feline rescue. The feral &amp; semi-feral cats were less dangerous because I expected it and prepared for them to freak out, and still I&#039;ve taken claws and bites through heavy protection.

If she wanted to get my attention, she&#039;d sit right by me and stare at me. If a minute passed without me acknowledging her, she&#039;d put her paw on my leg or arm. If I still didn&#039;t acknowledge her, she&#039;d then slowly sink the claws on both of her front paws into my thigh. She would straight up escalate until I finally paid attention to her. She usually did this if she ran out of food/water or wanted the litter box cleaned.<br><br>Funny story: when this female cat was still a kitten, she had a bouncy ball she&#039;d bat around the kitchen. One time it went under the oven, so I got it out using a wire coat hanger. I got the ball out, left the coat hanger on the floor next to the over, and went back to whatever I was doing. A few minutes later, I hear something metallic moving around the kitchen floor. Turned out that the ball had gone under the oven again, and the cat was pushing the coat hanger under the oven to get the ball out. She only needed to see me do it once to try it herself.

A domesticated cat that has been raised in a safe and loving environment is almost incapable of harming people. They have to be treated very badly and endangered, and many will, even then, submit to torture and death before hurting a human.<br><br>But, there are accidents. And, some cats are not taught from a young age the difference between playing and playing for keeps. That&#039;s really all I was trying to say.

If you&#039;re playing with a cat and they get too rough, immediately stop moving and say &quot;OUCH! OUCH! OUCH!&quot; Withdraw from play for a minute or so, then start again slower and more gentle. Cats figure it out quickly and temper their behavior. If they draw blood, even a small amount, touch their nose with a drop. Just a single small drop. Every cat that&#039;s ever lived with me never needed me to do that more than twice, and usually it&#039;s only once if at all. They learn fast.

Of course, it was all a trick, what was actually happening is they were buying shit from Indian traders and then selling it on to the Mediterranean peoples at an incredible mark-up garnering fat stacks of gold and a bunch of prestige.

It has some neat features like being able to record your shots as well as a jack for a microphone and the ability to synch audio to the video. It can also record in color with enough white light. It also automatically adjusts the frame rate based on how much IR it is receiving. I guess this was done to improve performance in low light, but it\u2019s honestly kind of annoying. It has a QD feature. You clamp the sleeve to the scope, and the clip on attaches to the sleeve with some lugs and a latch. It seems to be worth the $220 I paid for it. The sensor is far and away better than the night fox cape. The screen resolution is also much higher, and when there is plenty of IR it appears to have a much smoother image even though the manual lists it at 30 fps.

It was working on 8m range like I said an hour ago, but as of now i can&#039;t focus it even 4 meters away from camera.<br><br>Pic is what my camera sees - five light bulbs on my lamp but no laser dot, even though it theoretically should be the brightest thing on my fucking street atm. It seems im forced to build laser module from ground up? Any ideas how the camera can see the bulbs but not laser beam?<br><br>980nm<br>I don&#039;t need a working complete product... I want to go this way myself, understand how this is done and do it myself.<br><br>So my wavelength is the same as commercial products. The power is actually 30 mW, not 50 mW. I see thess possible issues:<br>1 - my CMOS sensor is crap (yes but no, it detects sun radiation at this wavelength no problem, so it should detect the laser)<br>2 - my laser driver is bad because china<br>3 - laser lens is crap because china<br><br>What do you think?", "filename": "20230211210315", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1233, "h": 925, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676196128392576, "time": 1676196128, "md5": "paEnZsee5uPE/qFM1kkLwQ==", "fsize": 53812, "resto": 57017739, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57124878, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)05:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57124868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57124868</a><br><br>Your sensor sucks ass.

Some politicians command more respect than others, which directly translates to what they&#039;ll do to their attacker. The guy who shot Teddy only lived because Teddy himself intervened to stop his supporters from lynching his would-be assassin on the spot. Garfield&#039;s assassination garnered similar reactions from bystanders, who apprehended and attempted to kill the assassin after they figured out he&#039;d just shot the President. Then you have other assassinations like Lincoln or Reagan where the attackers survived (in fact, Hinkley is still alive today and was released from the looney bin a few years back, he has a youtube channel) or were able to do shit like jump onto a nearby stage and yell lines from The Tragedy of Julius Caesar without being shot at or tackled by anyone.<br>Anyway, the best method of making sure you die is having someone else do it for you, they&#039;ll make sure of it where you probably couldn&#039;t due to losing consciousness or something.

I have shot guns before, mostly handguns, and I personally prefer lighter guns (these were older ww2-cold war era guns though. My grandad and dad are collectors.) The second is the extra 500 bucks and the company helping buy. When I signed the contract I signed with some honestly excellent benefits including a very tight level of job security. Other mates i have in the field have asked me to put a good word in with the company before (I put in an &#039;honest&#039; word for them, I actually respect the people I work for because they actually do quite a bit to not treat the employees like shit) since they&#039;re apparently a desirable option. Ex-military service I think helped with my application is all. But this in mind, the contract does specifically state all gear barring the uniform itself must be provided by the employee. This at first was just a rig for a radio, a set of pouches for first aid shit and other crap I might need like flashlight and a single pair of security cuffs for detainment. The contract states very clearly that for armed security duties the firearm used, it&#039;s storage, it&#039;s safe keeping and licence and registration fees MUST be provided by the employee in question. I did get 200 bucks to help get a holster and extra mags+mag pouches from the boss out of his own pocket tho, but that&#039;s mostly off the record money. And ammo is provided by the company so I don&#039;t have to worry about that. Cheers for the info though mate.

Last year they commemorated the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People&#039;s Revolutionary Army (KPRA) which was allegedly founded by Kim Il Sung on April 25, 1932. While Kim imo and in the opinion of many historians was a genuine guerrilla fighter and a capable leader at that, he likely exaggerated a lot of his exploits when fighting the Japanese in the 1930s. Unlike his guerrilla army, the KPA which was founded on February 8, 1948 is based on authentic eyewitness and newsreel showing Kim along with Soviet officers and North Korean officials observing the founding day of the KPA in front of the Pyongyang Train Station. Prior to the rise of Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un North Korea seldomly had military parades. There was one parade in 1948, 1953, and then in 1972, 1985, and then again in 1992.

I can&#039;t answer whether or not North Korea&#039;s missiles is an enormous security risk. It&#039;s a potential one but a currently active one, probably not. Most analysts including some of our top military officials have said in previous years going as far back as 2018 that Kim Jong Un evil as the regime may be is not led by a madman but a perfectly rational actor who wants nukes for regime security to prevent it from becoming Libya, Iraq or Ukraine and to be treated as an equal on the world stage. If the world can begrudgingly accept a nuclear armed Israel, Pakistan and India the world from a realist standpoint will have to accept that North Korea is going to remain a nuclear weapons state whether we like it or not. So attempts to tell Pyongyang to denuclearize while noble in nature is just a fools errand. But to add to your question on whether or not us drone striking the parade, you wouldn&#039;t be taking out all of their strategic weapons and this missiles are likely dummy ones since it would be kind of a national security risk for North Korea to have active nuclear warheads on display. Also you could probably say goodbye to Seoul and parts of Okinawa if they are lucky enough to get missiles in the air right away.

Cold Steel had some pretty cringe marketing campaigns but they\u00b4ve aways made solid knives. These Demkos are not really flippers though, and you mentioned that in your first post. Another suggestion along those lines is the Benchmade Mini-Adamas in CPM cruwear steel. The Axis lock flips like a maniac and it\u00b4ll be a better finished knife than the Cold Steel Demko ones, and it has a superior, deep carry clip.<br><br>The general problem with this &quot;overbuilt&quot; folders is not even size, but weight. Carrying a knife in the pocket makes every single ounce count a lot. The knife tilts a lot when it is heavier. I generally stay away from folders that weight more than 4 oz. Any heavier than that, I think it is more suitable for belt carry. Others will carry an 8 ounce knife in their pocket and forget its there.<br><br>I asked if you were planning on sharpening it yourself because of your choice of steel, this is an entire can of worms with many many variables. In the most basic of terms, the higher a supersteel is rated for cutlery, the longer it will retain its edge, and the harder it is going to be for a novice to sharpen. Edge retention and ease of sharpening vary dramatically between knife steels. But even a supersteel blade will eventually get dull. This aspect must be carefully considered, and it is often disregarded. There are other factors such as hardness and rust resistance, but these don\u00b4t matter much for folders.", "filename": "Adamas_family", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 320, "h": 400, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675807303731899, "time": 1675807303, "md5": "MgG4dcH5iT0xW0iw2n7Tyg==", "fsize": 11398, "resto": 57056693}, {"no": 57066790, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:05:50", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "ColdSteelDemkoStuff", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675807550808815, "time": 1675807550, "md5": "vHo6hhMg10gRYJRWpMeW4g==", "fsize": 407004, "resto": 57056693, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57067015, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:29:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57066740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57066740</a><br>Thanks anon.

Bechmade has definitely changed its design style from the days of Heckler &amp; Koch licensed knives, but it is still on the forefront of new knife steels and the axis lock, its staple feature, is still a great lock. I have no experience at all with Ferrum Forge, they may be good knives from all I know. Benchmade and Ferrum are competing in different markets and price brackets. Around the price of Ferrum\u00b4s products, I think Cold Steel is a serious contender, at least since their contract with Andrew Demko, when they bought some great designs and the triad lock. Another very popular and more affordable category are the liner locks made in China (around 30-40 bucks). In that bracket, Kershaw is the undisputed king in my experience, with Ontario in second place.

I didn\u00b4t want anything too out of the ordinary, I just asked him to make one of his models a little bit smaller for me. He replied my email a couple of days later, a long message saying he was sorry he couldn\u00b4t help me, because he was barely having the time to make and deliver the already ordered models on his &quot;custom&quot; lineup.

Heres the full story on the 112 Ranger. <br><br>So the Buck 110 was for sale everywhere, and a big customer for Buck 110s was the US Military. All branches would sell the knives in the PXs and base shops, as well as being commonly purchased or acquired in other ways by soldiers (family sending them, etc)<br>So Buck was making good money selling their knives to service members (119 was also very popular).<br>So come around the early 70s, and there is a string of fights aboard Navy ships. In some of these fights, sailors had pulled out and used 110s in the fight, and with a 3.75-inch blade, the 110 could do some serious damage. <br>So the Navy declared a new rule, no folding blades over 3 inches allowed on ships. So this would kill sales of the 110 to the Navy if the sailors couldn&#039;t carry the blades on ship. So I think it was Chuck Buck (can&#039;t remember 100% who was in charge at this time) decided to shorten down the 110 to make a knife that could be sold to the Navy. Thus the 112 was made, shortening the blade to 2.75-inch and coming in under the new 3 inch rule. <br>Buck at the time was located in San Deigo, CA. So when the knife was launched it was named the 112 Ranger, for the aircraft carrier USS Ranger that was in port at that time, the Ranger was also one of the ships involved with the stabbing incidents. <br><br>So, TL;DR is; Buck made the 112 to keep selling Buck knives to the Navy after a few sailors stabbed each other with 110s and the Navy banned 110s.", "time": 1676079020, "resto": 57056693}, {"no": 57109497, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)20:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57108916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57108916</a><br>check out mine", "filename": "FSdagger1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1111, "h": 1481, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676079992791434, "time": 1676079992, "md5": "UCa6WyyAfgPGN56ZdvaMJQ==", "fsize": 334532, "resto": 57056693, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57109500, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)20:46:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57109275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57109275</a><br>in fairness to Buck, they do have the sailor stabbing story on their website. also the 112 is 3&quot; today, I dunno about back then though.", "time": 1676079999, "resto": 57056693}, {"no": 57109543, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)20:50:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57109500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57109500</a><br>Yeah 3-inch blade, 2.75-inch cutting length.
