Headshots ensure you get all the meat (maybe barring the end of the neck) but leave you with brains to deal with which especially sucks if you want that part of the pelt and skull for taxidermy. Pellet rifles, anything around 15 foot pounds, will ensure you really don&#039;t have that much of a mess if that&#039;s the case. Hollow point .22 doesn&#039;t exactly &quot;blow their mind&quot; so-to-speak, but I&#039;ve had it make a mess of the base of the skull once so I had to trim the neck short to ensure I wasn&#039;t eating brain.<br><br>The leg meat is the main thing you&#039;ll want. The only &quot;hard&quot; part of eating the front and back leg meat has to go to shoulder blades because the odd shape is hard to scrape meat off but it&#039;s worth it. The &quot;back straps&quot; are good, though shallow. The rib meat, while it isn&#039;t much, is good too, even if it&#039;s for &quot;shredding&quot; (scraping it off after cooking where it tends to come off in small strips) and either eating on its own like pulled pork or putting it in a stew is very good. Any remaining meat on the bones can be pulled later and frozen to use in a stew.<br><br>Only safety/cleaning stuff I forgot is to be sure to remove the lymph nodes from around the body. Two just at the lower back, just above the pelvis. Two in the &quot;armpits&quot; of the front legs between the underside of the arm and the ribs. There will also be a tan/brown tissue surrounding it. IIRC there&#039;s also two on the neck roughly where we have ours, just under and behind the back edge of the jaw. Get the ones on the lower back off first and you&#039;ll easily spot any others by looking for something similar. As for cooking, cook it like chicken; wait until it&#039;s a white/tan color all the way through. To cook the rest of the squirrel (legs removed), simply run your knife up under the ribs to one side of the center of the chest and they&#039;ll cut at the joint. Then break them open flat.

A small woman, for example, has no chance of defending herself against a large unarmed man. If she has a weapon she does. If everyone has a gun, their physical potential in the conflict all roughly equalize based on training. You just assumed that gun owners are the aggressors. This wrong of you. In the vast majority of cases they aren&#039;t and guns save the lives of victims way more than they take the lives of victims.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, the mere presence and risk of guns in opposition hands makes you way more likely to escalate to deadly force.</span><br>Also wrong. The potential for deadly force keeps everyone more safe. If you want to rob someone in a parking lot, you look for easy prey. If you knew everyone was going to try to fight back, maybe with deadly force, you&#039;d be less likely to do it. The fact that I have a gun and have been carrying it concealed daily for well over 10 years without pulling it, keeps others safer.

There are a ton of pages set up with manufacturer names in their URLs that are scams. If I&#039;m ordering from someone I don&#039;t 100% KNOW is legit I always find the physical address of the place and google it, find out what actually exists there, then use google to find a phone number for that business, NOT WHATEVER PHONE NUMBER IS ON THEIR PAGE SINCE THOSE ARE OFTEN FAKED TOO.

First off, most military issue pistols have been beaten to fuck and gone, then rebuilt several times over their lifespan. The vast majority of them weren&#039;t cared for by one dude who had to rely on it to save his liver personally, they were used by guys on MP duty who pulled one from the armory, carried it for a watch, and returned it. Those guns spent multiple shifts every day rain, snow, or shine sitting in a holster and exposed to the elements. Second, the 92 has a very &quot;snappy&quot; feeling to the recoil because of the way it&#039;s built, which some people absolutely hate. I prefer smoother recoil and a lower bore axis, my brother in law loves the way the 92 fits in his hand and doesn&#039;t give a shit. Then it has an open-topped slide that makes the gun more liable to get gunked up in use than some other designs.<br>And of course there&#039;s an equally vocal group of people on the other side of the MUHNINTEENELEVUN divide who hate it because it&#039;s still a heavy, full-frame metal pistol and not a compact poly-frame. <br><br><a href=\"#p56766718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56766718</a><br>PCCs, for one.

You can&#039;t go by objective factors like weight or length since they&#039;ve thrown in &quot;rifle&quot; examples that include MP5Ks and Glock 17s (not making this up, someone made a stock adapter for a G17 and ATF has one in their inventory so they weighed and measured it). So even though the reference 120 ounces as a reasonable weight test for something being a &quot;rifle&quot; they also give examples of rifles being as little as two pound. Same with lengths, I don&#039;t recall the length of an MP5K off the top of my head but they&#039;re damn short, there are definitely common high powered revolvers of the type that would benefit from a brace that are longer.

It also caused a rift between Patton and his mentor John Pershing that effectively ended their decades-long friendship. The Slappening was nonetheless a demonstration of Patton&#039;s impulsivity and occasional but shockingly poor judgement that arguably made him unfit for any higher levels of command such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff.", "filename": "surprised anne", "ext": ".png", "w": 246, "h": 252, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673861685050369, "time": 1673861685, "md5": "sOYxEkgCFS/g06+FWVwUpw==", "fsize": 70607, "resto": 56770045}, {"no": 56782493, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56776528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56776528</a><br>worse than the 1930 version but still alright", "time": 1673862881, "resto": 56770045}, {"no": 56782893, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:15:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56777892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56777892</a><br>I think the guys in the Navy are too busy fighting the mutated demons that emerge from the bowels of their ships to have enough time for that.", "time": 1673867728, "resto": 56770045}, {"no": 56782903, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:17:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56777019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56777019</a><br>The great musician and Philosopher Rambo Amadeus explained turbofolk :<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;folk is The people, and turbo is a process of injecting gasoline under preassure into an internal combustion engine cilindre.

You are discovering what eye dominance means. Do something as simple as pointing at something (some distance away, like 20 or 100 yards) with your finger. Do it with both eyes open. Then do it again with one eye closed, then alternate to the other eye. Do it quickly &amp; naturally so you don&#039;t over-think it and shift your focus.

Now go to a search engine and look up eye dominance, handedness, and aiming (guns or anything). You&#039;ll start to develop the vocabulary you need to do more &amp; better searches.

It nicely occupies that &quot;scale slot&quot; between most wargames (Closest gameplay can be found in Combat Mission) and a proper operational-strategic game (Of which, to my knowledge, is only currently occupied by TOAW3).<br><br>The WEGO system simulates an OODA loop: You give orders, the battle progresses, and you don&#039;t get to issue orders again until your command cycle hits the next phase. And then your units don&#039;t act until they&#039;ve received, processed, and decided on their orders: This cycle isn&#039;t static and its length depends on a multitude of factors such as # of HQs, readiness of those HQs, and enemy EW activity.

The government, eager to get even more power, told the people that only a massive military arsenal would create a balance between the Soviet Union and the US, leading to the MIC basically becoming the biggest part of the American industry. Nuclear war would be only devastating for the US. They have cities that would be like 7th place in world trade alone. What does Russia have? Dogshit Moscow? Lmao. Russia would literally not care and America would get rid of 80% of its niggers, Mexicans and democrats if population centers would be nukes by ICBM.

A limited nuclear war that somehow stops before MAD kicks in (lol, good luck) would result in the second option. If all out nuclear war happens everybody is dead or just as good as dead. Just a single 300 kiloton nuclear bomb will create a fireball with a radius of about 3.5 miles and spontaneously ignite shit for another mile out. Now imagine a thousands of those going off around the world targeting just about every decent sized human settlement around planet. All the ash that would be created would be radioactive and would be the stuff that poisons the remaining biological life while triggering a multi-year global nuclear winter, which would essential kill off the majority of the humans who were spared immediate nuclear annihilations. And don&#039;t get me started about the bioweapons that a nation might release into the environment as another f-you. <br><br>You may still be in disbelief that things could go as bad as MAD but you need to realize from just the little that has been declassified or leaked from both Soviet and US documents, even the big wigs in charge planned on things escalating to that (read up on SIOP). The fact is that defense planning done by major nuclear powers wasn&#039;t designed to accommodate a limited nuclear war. Also remember that most ballistic missiles today carry multiple high yield thermonuclear warheads, which means it is much easier to reach MAD in a very short amount of time. The Trident II SLBM can carry 8 W88 warheads that have a yield of 450ish kilotons each and a single Ohio-class submarine can carry 20 Trident IIs. Maybe with all the arms reduction since the end of the cold war there won&#039;t be as many nuclear warheads flying around but I doubt it really matters in the end when there&#039;s still thousands that would be flying around.<br><br>Don&#039;t have enough space or knowledge to answer the rest.

You could also use that same powder in a .500 S&amp;W, which is definitely a handgun - unless you then stuff it into one of those custom lever action rifles, or an Encore with a long barrel.<br>What&#039;s important is simple: the burn speed of the powder needs to be suitable for your combination of cartridge, barrel length and bullet (weight). Yes, there is some correlation with that between rifle and pistol, but not enough to definitively say that &#039;&#039;rifle powders&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;pistol powders&#039;&#039; exist.

If you wiki the micro channel plate in a I2 tube you can get the basics better than my phn effort posting, so reader knowledge is assumed to that level. A few threads ago there was a colloquial reference to &quot;chicken wire&quot; as a visual artifact. I can&#039;t relate that to field use, but can describe the process of MCP fab including certain vagaries. Imagine a solid tube of glass that slides through another tube of glass like inside a straw. Bake it until fusion, stack these pic rel and repeat. Like a breadstick, yes? Take it to the Draw Tower, a magical apparatus that you clamp your breadstick into and heat up like a glassblower at &quot;insert local artisan fair village&quot;, except vertical. Now using all your spells and hexs, stretch that motherfucker until the laser micrometer reads X amount, think willy willy skinny. Like a raven hair on the head of a teepee maiden. Break these apart like spagetti. Repeat picrel X times. You now have a fused glass lump of shit called a boule, like a French bread, that goes to cutting . You get back thin quarter sized product, and then more stuff also happens. The real trick is in the &quot;art&quot;. I suggest doing a patent search at the USPO. Probably classified anyway. The Draw Tower has a ladder for the operator, most girls are short anyway. The fire is the &quot;art&quot;. Take your plastic coffee stir stick and bic lighter and stretch it out by hand 2 feet, I believe in you. Oh, make it perfectly even diameter +/- a very isty bitsy amount using SPC tools and math and stuff, then hand select. Anyway, if you can make an MCP from above directions, you&#039;re smarter than the PhDs at (((formerly Litton))).

Author interview D.<br>26. Ibid.; author interview H; and inspection of recovered R-77-1 and R-27 missiles, Ukraine, October<br>2022.<br>27. Author interview D; and author interview G. Supported by footage released by the Russian<br>Ministry of Defence showing three R-77-1s being launched by an Su-35 flying at Mach 1.1 and<br>around 33,000 ft with a launch acceptable region (LAR) indicator on the heads-up-display showing<br>around 75 km at the start of the clip. Since missile effective range is proportional to launch<br>altitude and speed, as well as target aspect and speed, an Su-35 flying faster than Mach 1.1 at, for<br>example, 40,000 ft+ (well within its performance capabilities) could easily have an LAR in excess<br>of 100 km against a low-flying closing target.

Even the FCG-9 has been forked into &quot;weldless bolt&quot; variations just to skip the welder.<br>If you get into casting, you&#039;ll see on youtube that there&#039;s entire channels dedicated to troubleshooting molds.

IvanTheTroll recently got sheets of 4140 or 4150 laser cut to make a DIY glock slide, where the &quot;locking lug&quot; meets the top of the barrel, and after not many shots the steel was already getting peened. Some Zamak alloys are HiPoint tier and thus usable for firearms, but let&#039;s face it you&#039;re not getting the best casting and cooling/heat treatment from an empty soup can, plaster of paris and your mom&#039;s oven. Still, I&#039;d probably design such a cast around a good grade of steel and attempt to heat treat it to avoid the Zamak from getting beat up and cracking.

It&#039;s also a completely different skillset that requires a lot of work and practice to avoid voids, micro-cracking, and generally getting things to tolerances safely and efficiently. It took me months to get to the point where I was reliably casting small parts in my garage, and was good enough to pick out a bad one before I seriously tested it. I&#039;m not gonna suggest it as a shortcut to someone who just needs a gun, now. If you cast things in a way that&#039;s cheap, relatively safe, and easy to achieve for a novice they&#039;re gonna need a third skillset to finish, rather than ones that make the design easier or safer to build. And I don&#039;t want to add another pile of equipment to the list if it&#039;s not necessary.<br><br>For stuff like your use-case of resurrecting a gun with a torched receiver that you can spend time on casting with safe dimensions, dressing and prepping, it&#039;s a great idea. Especially since you clearly have the experience. Likewise, simple stuff where you mostly just need a block of metal and you can finish them with a drill press and jig (bolt weights, gas blocks, etc) are gonna be fine for newbies.

There are a lot more factors that go into &quot;just a bullet&quot; than you are communicating with your post. 5.56 cases do not have the volume to get enough conventional propellants inside to accelerate a &#039;more advanced&#039; projectile to &#039;adequate speed&#039; out of conventional barrels. The whole point of the 6.8 cartridge is that you can get 3k fps out of a 13&quot; barrel with a relatively high BC projectile with good penetration characteristics. Velocity and sectional density are the big factors in determining penetration characteristics against the vast majority of potential targets. .22 caliber bullets, by the beautiful nature of being smaller do not have the potential to perform as well at distance as a larger bullet. That&#039;s physics. BC matters, velocity matters, and balancing the platform to be man-portable and supply-able using existing supply chains is what matters. That&#039;s why they went with 6.8. It can propel a much more efficient projectile faster with a shorter barrel while also being suppressed and working well with modern, non-fantasy manufacturing techniques.

There is no functional difference. I would go the 9mm instead or 10mm because I love 10mm and the extra penetration abilities are useful in some situations.<br>However, my argument is the same. I have a trained a lot for a long time with pistols. I can hit what I&#039;m aiming at real good with a handgun. So to me a handgun is just better for moving around corners and being able to use 1 handed. <br>Let&#039;s say hypothetically you hear a bump in the night. What do you do? You aren&#039;t going to call the cops if you don&#039;t know what it is. You&#039;re going to go find it. You&#039;re going to take your HD weapon of choice. Now picture yourself exiting your bedroom. You&#039;re in a narrow hallway. Now you have to turn a sharp corner. At any moment an intruder could lunge at you with zero a zero distance gap. If you chose a longer gun, they may have grabbed the barrel first as you rounded that corner with it. You have to take your support hand off to manipulate door handles and light switches. My belief is that a handgun is something I can keep closer to my body, manage tight corners better with and still retain 90% use while my support hand is occupied elsewise.<br>Then if I actually do have to shoot it, I keep a short suppressor on it which is still loud enough to scare someone but is light enough the gun cycles confidently. It will also not cause permanent hearing damage. The trade off is that the handgun lacks stopping power. So, training is even more important.<br><br>Just out of curiousity, how many times have you practiced clearing your house with your gun?

I don&#039;t know jack shit about bowyery but I&#039;ve always wanted to make a semi-automatic crossbow so figured why not just try it out.

Here&#039;s a video of test firing today:<br>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0Ghm<wbr>fe2TyEA<br>But right now it seems the biggest limiting factor for performance is the bolts and could use some recommendations in this regard (note how much they veer in flight - probably doesn&#039;t help that I carved tapers in with a knife because belt sanding was too slow). Bolts currently must fit within the profile of a 3/8&quot; diameter - no fletching. Doing some research it seems that the Chinese didn&#039;t using fletching for their Chu Ko Nu bolts and it was just a spray and pray weapon. <br>They about 8 inches in length. For proof of concept I just sanded a point on one side and a taper on the other. I plan to make some steel cones on the lathe (with a protrusion to mate with a hole on the shaft), heat treat them, then probably just glue them into the hole in the shaft..<br>Would cutting either spiral or straight fluting on the shaft improve accuracy? Should I change the length to diameter ratio? Would be hard pressed to make bolts larger but could do some redesign to shrink length or diameter.

Or draw a centerline and drill and tap it yourself. Use a picatinny rail section that is made for round top guns that has screw holes pre-drilled. If it&#039;s the wrong radius on the bottom, simply tape a section of fine (400+ grit) sandpaper to your &quot;suppressor&quot; and run the rail along it until it&#039;s conformed to the shape well enough. Could always shove some JB Weld under it too if it doesn&#039;t seem to keep zero. Oh yeah and remember to make sure it&#039;s clocked correctly on the gun BEFORE you drill and tap it for a rail (eg. put it on the gun and mark the very top somehow). Could go the crush washer route as well if its clocking ever gets screwed up. A &quot;suppressor&quot; with wrench flats could help you get it clocked the same every time and snug enough that it won&#039;t unscrew itself.<br><br>Disclaimer: I&#039;m not a gunsmith, nor have I ever tried that, but it works in my head.

For a while it was 7.5 Swiss which for 90% of the last year SGAmmo / Midway / AIM has had in stock no issue. Beyond this pretty much every (with some exceptions) smokeless centerfire cartridge you can get for old military rifles has one company loading it. For a few of them you just have to wait for the batches. 6.5 Carcano being an example, PPU still makes it. Multiple places had it this year but sold through, more will show up.

This is pretty much on par with every single full size centerfire rifle cartridge minus .308/7.62 - which is the only round in this class I see under $1 a round regularly. .243 / .270 / 6.5 /.30-06 and the like are virtually all over $1 a round with many going well beyond that for hunting loads.
