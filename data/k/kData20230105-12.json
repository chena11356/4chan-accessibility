So you need at least a high wing jet to start with, which rules out converted passenger jet &quot;transports&quot;.<br><br>They are built structurally to have enough reinforcement to concetrate all of their payload into a small dense area. <br><br>They tend to have engine spacing such that they can carry missiles on wing pylons, with the engines placed accordingly so that rocket motor exhaust doesn&#039;t interfere with the engine air intake.<br><br>To offset the additional weight of all the structural reinforcement that they need, they tend towards having much thinner fuselages than comparable civillian and transport aircraft to avoid unneeded drag. They are designed around carrying a lot of weight concentrated in a small volume.<br><br>Lobbing bombs out of transports is a thing, but it&#039;s an additional nice to have, not a core replacement for dedicated bomber aircraft, and any talk about &quot;converting airliners&quot; is just retardation (it always comes up)", "time": 1672917464, "resto": 56635051}, {"no": 56636112, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)06:20:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56635159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56635159</a><br>how will they ever recover<br>we don&#039;t even need the missiles the pallets would do it", "time": 1672917652, "resto": 56635051}, {"no": 56636149, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)06:27:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56635051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56635051</a><br><a href=\"#p56635058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56635058</a><br><a href=\"#p56635099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56635099</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be murica</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;offshore all of your heavy industry</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no longer able to affordbly procure things like you used to</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;incapable of building new bombers without breaking the bank</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your new &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;strategic bomber&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; has the payload of an F-111 and costs as much as a B-1</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;solution: have mexican women push bombs out of a cargo plane</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;soiface.jpg</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;HOOOLY SHIT THIS IS SUCH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY!!!!&quot;</span>", "time": 1672918040, "resto": 56635051}, {"no": 56636178, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)06:32:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56635099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56635099</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDO<wbr>V4vx4peg", "time": 1672918341, "resto": 56635051}, {"no": 56636185, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)06:32:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56636149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56636149</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have big planes that can&#039;t get close to enemy airspace</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;load them with a shitton of cruise missiles instead</span><br>What exactly is the problem here?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the payload of an F-111</span><br>Oh no you&#039;re retarded.", "filename": "wat", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 373, "h": 438, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672918377200300, "time": 1672918377, "md5": "RUZhNCeABjmltzyBnpFugw==", "fsize": 45139, "resto": 56635051}, {"no": 56636205, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)06:35:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56635099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56635099</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pallet fails to deploy payload</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9 cruise missles land on the iraqi home for limbless war orphans</span>", "time": 1672918521, "resto": 56635051}, {"no": 56636271, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)06:45:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56636185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56636185</a><br>The B-21 has the payload of an F-111 and the price tag of a B-1.

There is also another certification RIF or something I\u2019m not super familiar you\u2019d have to look more into if you end up being interested in some of those.

Next, spend an hour comparing units you liked/hated/feared from the campaign and build a basic deck with some of them. Don&#039;t worry about filling every slot or following a meta, you won&#039;t have the skill to succeed with it yet. I advise starting with specialty decks in 5000pt 10v10 &quot;tactical&quot; servers. Give yourself a mission, like &quot;I will prevent a bridge crossing&quot;, &quot;I will sneak special forces into this backline capture zone to identify and ambush opportunity targets&quot; or &quot;I will provide artillery support in this sector&quot;, and just focus on controlling and succeeding with the small cluster of units needed to accomplish it. Expect to lose badly or feel like you didn&#039;t help the team win, everyone starts that way. After a few games you&#039;ll get the flow of battle better and can more effectively command the various units you&#039;ll need to succeed.

It will take days for the armies to return to Minas Tirith, longer for the mobilization. The people I mobilize in the city itself are from a stock of snooty useless nobles and lesser nobles and will be mostly fodder. <br><br>Exactly two seconds after the mobilization order, I would light the beacons. I would probably not know that Rohan is dealing with it&#039;s own tailor made shitshow but who knows, maybe someone will be able to get word to Rohan sooner, and thus, get a more prompt response than in the film. <br><br>I would then order the complete evacuation of the city of Osgiliath. It&#039;s a wall-less city, impossible to defend from an outside invasion and located on a flat plain.

Little buddy isn&#039;t doing well. For a brief day or two, the increased meds seemed to be working, his liver swelling has gone down more and his eyes were clear and he could see me. Now he&#039;s not playing, not eating, not drinking. He lays under the dining room table, his eyesight seems to be bad again. All we could get him to eat was some tuna-flavored tapioca paste that the vet would give him (it&#039;s only like 6 calories per tube, so not much), and he drank a small amount of water, but that was on the morning of the 2nd. He&#039;s just returned to laying under the table and taking nothing, he feels cold to the touch.<br>By all accounts, it seems like his liver is failing, and he&#039;s probably going to die. We&#039;re now looking at an in-home euthanasia service so he doesn&#039;t need to leave his home or his family. If the weather in the morning permits, I&#039;m going to bring him outside to the back yard. It&#039;s only fair, he&#039;s wanted to go out there for the whole of his short little life, and we kept saying he could when he was a little bigger in the spring, lest an owl or hawk grab him. I think now is the time to grant that wish, he won&#039;t last that long unless a miracle happens. I don&#039;t think he would run if he wanted to anyway.<br>Thanks for the sympathy and support that you guys have given through this ordeal. I may try to post some videos I have of him later if it&#039;s alright. I&#039;m currently posting from work, so when I finally post again it will probably be after he&#039;s gone.

Factors for determining the correct COAL include the shape and style of the bullet and the way the throat of the bore is cut in your specific pistol&#039;s chamber (Especially CZs as they have a very short leade length and may need deeper seating to prevent the bullet from being jammed into the rifling.)<br><br>It can be helpful to determine if your barrel/bullet combination has a COAL limitation, that is, if there is any COAL inside the maximum COAL dimension that has the bullet contacting the rifling. That way you can be sure that the bullet seating depth is correct and that there is a sufficient bullet jump to keep pressures down.<br><br>The way to do this is with the &quot;Plunk&quot; test. In order to do this test, seat your bullet to the max COAL 1.169&quot; and taper crimp it, take the barrel out of your pistol and drop the cartridge into the chamber, if you hear a &quot;Plunk&quot; sound as the cartridge mouth hits the front end of the chamber and the cartridge spins freely then you don&#039;t have a max COAL restriction. If it doesn&#039;t make the &quot;Plunk&quot; sound, and the cartridge will not turn, then the bullet has hit the rifling and you need to go shorter. Keep seating the bullet deeper and deeper little by little until you find the seating depth that the cartridge passes the plunk test.

Artillery guns themselves are mostly stationary. because they are sitting on a stockpile. The problem about field guns is they are purely defensive without mobility and their ammunition was a component to the gun instead a whole unit. A field gun will forever be a part of a battery that needs to share a supply chain because the gun itself can&#039;t store ammunition on the go. An SPG can easily be detached to support a different unit that don&#039;t have the ammunition supply chain for it&#039;s artillery gun. <br><br>Manpower<br>SPGs have less crew required than actual field guns. More personnel with a field gun is needed to rotate out personnel. Re-correct gun sight after firing, pass down the fresh and spent ammunition, maneuvering the gun carriage after it&#039;s unhitched. An SPG takes away all of those requirements. The cost of fuel on deployment alone is less than a soldier&#039;s combat pay.<br>.<br>Strategy <br>An SPG has a radio at the ready.

You better have the decency to save it all and study it carefully.<br><br>There&#039;s a lot of info missing for context, but I&#039;ll suggest a couple of main forks you need to make decisions on. Decide if your story involves American guns or European guns, or both. You&#039;ll need to explain (by example in-plot) why. How prominently do guns feature as integral to the plot? If you&#039;re considering a 100 minute movie, how many minutes of screen time will each weapon see? This will help determine how much thought &amp; research needs to go into each weapon &amp; character wielding it.<br><br>When did the guns originate from? Will they be mostly WWI surplus? Will they be largely civilian models from the era? Will they be new (manufactured ~1920) or older, used? Because, you might be looking at what was commonly available during the 1890s. In 1920 Mexico, there may be surplus guns (and ammo) from several wars (around the world) conducted during the 1890s and up to about WWI.<br><br>Did the hero bring his own gun(s) to Mexico? Or did he make do with what he found when he got there? This will determine likely availability both for the hero and other characters. The question will also apply to long guns that may make appearances.<br><br>For one example of many possibilities, a fairly &quot;modern&quot; cartridge designed for revolvers in 1907 is the .44 Special (by Smith &amp; Wesson).

I have a rifle that with good stance and control i can send 147gr slugs with rapidity into the brush close up and if need be I also can shoot over a valley 600-800m away and have decent success with heavy winds. Besides just being a cool configuration bullpups do have advantages and disadvantages. Nothing is ever for free. Laying prone with extended mags, reloading from prone, reloading in general is a tad slower but that isn&#039;t so much a disadvantage as everyone highlights. I guess if you plan on 1v6 ing a bunch of people you may want to reconsider another platform.<br><br>Overall i would say that a lot of bullpups suffer from adequate forends. I&#039;ve seen some sweet AUGs with nice forends that allow good control and attachment space. Another thing a good forend allows is space to brace. The Tavors generally have a cutlass grip and shorter rails which is nice for stabilizing in some ways but also now you have a single pivot point and when you&#039;re trying to keep steady for a 400m+ shot, you get a lot of vertical play. I wish the Tavor7 had just 2-3 more inches and i would be super happy with that as i have long arms and it feels more comfortable with longer shots.

That said, I&#039;d suggest using earpro alongside cans for any rifle unless you&#039;re getting into truly quiet subsonic stuff. Suppressors help a ton, going from 160-175dB down to 120-140dB is a huge help particularly since it doubles up perfectly and works even in an emergency. But that&#039;s still LOUD. Don&#039;t believe industry horseshit about how &lt;140dB is &quot;hearing safe&quot;, that&#039;s merely the level at which you don&#039;t suffer significant instantaneous permanent hearing loss. But you shouldn&#039;t be dealing with that kind of noise for lots of shooting, and being near any sort of hard objects (particularly indoors) that can reflect sound can increase exposrue as well. Pic related, NIOSH guidelines for actual real work.<br><br>Advantage of suppression is that plain earpro maxes out at ~40dB reduction, and that&#039;s if you do everything perfectly. Suppressor means you can get away with cheaper, easier 20-30dB earpro and still be fine, and you&#039;ve got safety margin in case of bad fit or marginal conditions (like indoor range or next to cliffs or something) etc. It should be a basic cheap OTC safety option like in a lot of the EU even.

We, just like the western analysts of the 1980s, routinely imagine the baseline as far higher than it is, and then apply it to our opponents.<br><br>I got a recent reminder of this via a war story or two about master gunners training Ukranian tankers pre-invasion. The Ukranians still in effect used the soviet model of gunnery training. They would roll up to their range position, fire at an assortment of targets, hit some, miss some and be generally pleased that they now knew how to shoot - at which point they&#039;d be out of training ammo. In fairness, their T64s were by any mid cold war standard shooting quite lethally, a definite mark up from WWII gunnery, but just as definitely not the &quot;75+% hit rate on the move!&quot; the technology should have been able to do.<br><br>By western standards, their performance would be appalling. A western crew under range conditions does not miss; virtually ever. They race the clock to see if they can kill targets fast enough to reduce each threat before a very good enemy could acquire them and shoot back, in a wide array of situations. They fire more ammo, have more reps, and do loads of simulator work before that - and the chances are if they are too slow too often, let alone missing shorts, they get disqualified and have to try to qual again.<br><br>The difference that dedicated crew-tech fusion provides vs &quot;good enough&quot; and new tech is so gapingly astronomical that it boggles any of our conceptions of the classic wargaming parameters of &quot;green, regular, veteran, elite&quot; with some bonuses/maluses off a basic core of performance.", "time": 1672855426, "resto": 56621684}, {"no": 56627667, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:05:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56627641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56627641</a><br>But again, NATO didn&#039;t know that.

We know that Soviet artillery doctrine, particularly for the RAGs that make up so much of the support, was fairly rigid. The RAG commander and a small staff rode near or with the Regimental commander and primarily designed his fire plan in support of that commander. He was chief of staff, fire control center, and unit commander all in one. He would stay in contact with the CRTA, but his guns really weren&#039;t a universal asset.

You need to find a cause and run<br>with it. Luckily, you don&#039;t have to know anything the cause to piss people<br>off. Generally you can promote this cause with much more fervor if you have a<br>bias one way or another with it. The possibilities are endless. Hand out<br>NAMBLA literature in front of a church. Hold up a sign with a penis on it<br>stating, &quot;The uncircumcised have rights too.&quot; It&#039;s best to insult something<br>that is very dear to someone, like something they have wasted (and &#039;wasted&#039; is<br>the key word), their lives plugging away. A t-shirt that says &quot;Breast cancer<br>is good. More breathing room on the train&quot; will definitely do the trick.<br>Getting people angry with you will waste time, and you might actually get<br>people to join your moronic cause. Then you can get money out of them. Look<br>what it did for Scientology. Racism is also very important when you are<br>offending people. There is nothing that offends people more than racism. You<br>don&#039;t have to be a racist to practice racism at all. Buy a dirty joke book and<br>make it your bible. Then you can stand in Harvard Square with a microphone<br>saying things like, &quot;How do you get a black guy out of a tree in Mississippi?<br>Cut the rope!&quot; Huh huh.<br><br><br><a href=\"#p56585172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56585172</a><br>sadly no", "filename": "1667362071073877", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 453, "h": 604, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672523787014644, "time": 1672523787, "md5": "zumO7Bkvud6uAeYzg53+Tg==", "fsize": 66494, "resto": 56582924}, {"no": 56585375, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)17:05:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;56583773</span><br>he... he actually listed it like that?", "time": 1672524307, "resto": 56582924}, {"no": 56585394, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)17:06:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56584518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56584518</a><br>&quot;no immunities&quot; posts dont count lol.", "time": 1672524398, "resto": 56582924}, {"no": 56585405, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)17:07:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56584155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56584155</a><br>What level is he?", "time": 1672524460, "resto": 56582924}, {"no": 56585410, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)17:07:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56585375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56585375</a><br>Can&#039;t exactly take an SKS to the emergency room.

Many--probably the majority--criminal escapes involved violence. Runaways attacked, shot, and suffocated armed guards, as well as free workers and local residents. They did not spare their fellow inmates either. One of the standard methods of criminal escape involved cannibalism. Pairs of criminals would agree in advance to escape along with a third man (the &quot;meat&quot;), who was destined to become the sustenance for the other two on their journey. Buca also describes the trial of a professional thief and murderer, who, along with a colleague, escaped with the camp cook, their &quot;walking supply&quot;//<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They weren&#039;t the first to get this idea. When you have a huge community of people who dream of nothing but escape, it is inevitable that every possible means of doing so will be discussed. A &quot;walking supply&quot; is, in fact, a fat prisoner. If you have to, you can kill him and eat him. And until you need him, he is carrying the &quot;food&quot; himself.</span><br><br>SOURCE: Gulag: A History, by Anne Applebaum (Anchor Books, 2003), pp. 395-398", "time": 1672860831, "resto": 56627476}, {"no": 56628690, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)14:40:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56627944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56627944</a><br>Maybe in your shit tier country of america.", "time": 1672861203, "resto": 56627476}, {"no": 56629250, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)15:37:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56627576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56627576</a><br>How do they get fresh ice for their freezer?
