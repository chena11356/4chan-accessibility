There are several reasons they won\u2019t go further:<br><br>1. The equipment they are holding back (tanks, f35 etc.) sucks ass. The husks of maintenance intensive, prone to breaking rocket magnets would be a terrible advertisement campaign for NATO, hence their refusal to send their \u201cmodern\u201d equipment that just runs in very controlled environments. See turkey with their Leo\u2019s. Clapped by Milan, fagot and tow. <br><br>Same goes for F35 or other modern fighter jets. Most of them won\u2019t leave an airfield due to rain or wind, needing so much maintenance and sore parts, even western nations operating these have use half of their fleet as spare part kits. <br><br>2. NATO wouldn\u2019t want their own men to die in droves. Antiwar sentiment is already high in NATO countries, now imagine Germans, French and Italians dying by the hundreds in Ukraine. Lmaoing my ass off, this war would be over faster than they could spell retreat. <br><br>3. The Russians have learned to live with superior nato intelligence. They have decided to just make up for it by loss of human life. They don\u2019t care. Ultimately every war is about making someone unwilling to sacrifice life further through the use of life ending technology. Russia has shown that it doesn\u2019t care. It will send troops at you by the millions no matter what you throw at them. NATO can\u2019t compete. <br><br>TL;DR The Ukraine war is as far as NATO is willing to go. They would lose a direct confrontation politically and on the ballot box, their equipment would be demystified as the trash it is.

They feel like they are made out of a glass reinforced polymer (pistol frames are made out of it). The locking tabs have aluminum reinforcements in them. The only other metal to speak of is the spring and they also put two pieces of aluminum in the follower I think to act as a hi vis contrast when looking through the ammo counter witness holes.

Slovenia modernized 30 T-55 tanks in the inventory of its armed forces. The last T-55 was modernized to the M-55S standard in May 1999. The original 100mm tank gun was replaced by the NATO-standard 105mm one with a thermal sleeve. The armour protection of the tank was improved considerably by attaching Rafael ERA blocks to the hull and the turret. A digital ballistic computer was installed in order to improve the fire control system (FCS). The gunner has the Fotona SGS-55 two-axis stabilized day-and-night sight with an integral laser rangefinder. In addition to the integral optic sight the commander has the Fotona COMTOS-55 sight with an independent line-of-sight stabilization, which allows him to acquire targets and lay the gun independently if required. The driver has the Fotona CODRIS combined day/night observation periscope. The LIRD-1A laser illumination warning receiver was mated with front-mounted IS-6 smoke grenade launchers (of which there are six in two clusters, one per side of the turret) and can be automatically activated in an emergency. Modernization of the V-12 diesel engine resulted in an increase in power from 520hp to 600hp. The running gear has rubber side skirts and the tank was outfitted with new rubber and metal tracks. Improvements were also made to the communications aids.[42] In October 2022, Slovenia gave 28 M-55S to Ukraine; Germany provides 40 transport vehicles to Slovenia, as Prime Minister Robert Golob and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arranged some weeks ago. The vehicles will also serve for protection and rescue.[184] </span><br>can use the same munition as the French AMX-10 RC that will be delivered too btw", "filename": "M-55S", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1673430987910613, "time": 1673430987, "md5": "4/sSDYvRHd5WqNQBp2ItzQ==", "fsize": 195926, "resto": 56712970, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56714711, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)04:58:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56712970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56712970</a><br>Just give them Shermans already, then Russians can deploy their T-34s and we can finally settle the issue of who&#039;s tank is better.", "time": 1673431137, "resto": 56712970}, {"no": 56714714, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)04:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia fields T-62Ms</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Ha retards have run out of tanks, absolutely useless!&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ukraine gets sent T-55s &quot;super upgraded&quot; with gen 1 ERA, a gun from the 1950s and thermals of an indeterminate age</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Ackshually that&#039;s really smart to use these old tanks, literally no reason not to use them if you have them&quot;</span>", "time": 1673431172, "resto": 56712970}, {"no": 56714726, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)05:01:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56712970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56712970</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;September 22</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HATO IS OUT OF TANKS RUSSIA WILL WIN SOON!!!!!</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;December</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Czechs just sent another 100 T-72s </span><br><br>Nato is not &quot;Running out of tanks&quot;<br><br>Ukraine&#039;s been using these tanks for like 2 months now fine.", "time": 1673431318, "resto": 56712970}, {"no": 56714748, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)05:04:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56712970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56712970</a><br>Hegellian T-55&#039;s are fucking awesome and are already deployed since a while back.

It&#039;s also worth taking into account that naval gunnery is notoriously wild when talking accuracy and the ranges of engagement involved. By adding more main battery rifles and throwing more shit at the wall you improve your chances somewhat of actually hitting something (though that&#039;s not always the case, see HMS Agincourt at Jutland). With innovations in radar and fire control it could be seen to be beneficial to go for larger guns rather than more of them, if you hit what you&#039;re shooting at you&#039;re likely to do more damage.

Little buddy isn&#039;t doing well. For a brief day or two, the increased meds seemed to be working, his liver swelling has gone down more and his eyes were clear and he could see me. Now he&#039;s not playing, not eating, not drinking. He lays under the dining room table, his eyesight seems to be bad again. All we could get him to eat was some tuna-flavored tapioca paste that the vet would give him (it&#039;s only like 6 calories per tube, so not much), and he drank a small amount of water, but that was on the morning of the 2nd. He&#039;s just returned to laying under the table and taking nothing, he feels cold to the touch.<br>By all accounts, it seems like his liver is failing, and he&#039;s probably going to die. We&#039;re now looking at an in-home euthanasia service so he doesn&#039;t need to leave his home or his family. If the weather in the morning permits, I&#039;m going to bring him outside to the back yard. It&#039;s only fair, he&#039;s wanted to go out there for the whole of his short little life, and we kept saying he could when he was a little bigger in the spring, lest an owl or hawk grab him. I think now is the time to grant that wish, he won&#039;t last that long unless a miracle happens. I don&#039;t think he would run if he wanted to anyway.<br>Thanks for the sympathy and support that you guys have given through this ordeal. I may try to post some videos I have of him later if it&#039;s alright. I&#039;m currently posting from work, so when I finally post again it will probably be after he&#039;s gone.

You&#039;ll need to do some research on introducing a new cat into a house that already has cats. There&#039;s do&#039;s &amp; dont&#039;s to make it comfortable &amp; happy for everyone.<br><br>First tip: new cat(s) should be younger than the older cat. There is automatic seniority dominance, which can be groomed into a relationship even if the dynamics change later. Any cat under ~3 years old is still largely a kitten &amp; can be easily subverted with food, play, food, attention, play, food, more attention ... They tend to accept the newcomer as a playmate if the humans set the environment.<br><br>The established resident has run of the house, for example. Bring the newcomer in &amp; they get locked in a room the first 24 hours before they meet so they get used to each other in the same house &amp; their scents. For the first few months, until they clearly get along without harm to each other, the established senior gets the house, the newcomer gets put into a room if things get a bit spicy between them.<br><br>Get them eating together, do not allow them to eat each others&#039; food, at least the first 6 months. Keep them close to each other, feed them at the same time, talk to both, give both attention, separate them (gently, no drama) if either infringes on the other. <br><br>Get them to play together. In the same room at first. Play with the senior cat first, draw the other in. I would walk around the room dragging 2 strings. Each would take their own string at first, after a few sessions they figured out playtime and even started wrestling each other without fighting.<br><br>Your cat is very young. This is the best time to introduce a new cat the same age or slightly younger. By the time they are 2 they will be like littermates for life. There are exceptions, but do your part and it&#039;s very rare. I brought a 6 month kitten into a house with a 7 year old cat. It worked out fine, but I put a lot into it up front.", "time": 1672987147, "resto": 56586661}, {"no": 56648782, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:00:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56647505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56647505</a> <a href=\"#p56647880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56647880</a> --&gt; CT&#039;d --&gt;<br>One thing you can take advantage of is that your cat is already a girl. She will be highly territorial. Bringing in another girl is not the optimal situation here, so try to bring in a younger male, maybe 6-8 or ~10 months. She will establish dominance, but will have mothering instinct triggered (very strong in cats) &amp; set her littermate senses set tingling ... plus the spice of a sexy young male. This is probably your best option for best chances to succeed, especially if this is the first time you are attempting it.<br><br>Your current cat will have feelings on the issue. Be sensitive to them, talk to her about them, give her reassurance that she&#039;s still the prettiest girl, give extra grooming, playtime, attention in general. It&#039;ll smooth things out greatly for the first few weeks &amp; months. The newcomer interrupts, give him attention, but don&#039;t stop giving the most attention to your good girl.<br><br>You are playing the role of the third cat I mentioned. Break up bad behavior patterns with firm authority, encourage good behavior patterns. My 7 year old always slept with me (a boy). The new kitten (also a boy) insisted on sleeping with us. The older cat objected &amp; pouted, would walk away, but always come back because it was HIS bed. I fell asleep every night with one of them on each side of me, petting both of them until I fell asleep. They would both calm down &amp; purr, so they could hear &amp; smell each other but not see or touch. A month later they were falling asleep leaning against each other, in bed with me or otherwise.<br><br>The younger cat had huge kitten energy &amp; bullied the older cat.

The only real difference is the bullet shape/size and obviously the powder load. The actual .277 fury cartridge itself is remarkably similar to it&#039;s .308 parent case. The cartridge wall diameter for .277 fury is 11.71mm where the taper begins and it&#039;s 11.53mm for .308, at the base of the cartridge it&#039;s 11.94mm for .277 fury and 11.96mm for .308.

Well, it depends on the definition of &quot;winning&quot;. There was probably a lot of shit behind the curtains, but now we may say for sure that in 2014 Russia didn&#039;t want any Novorossiya with Odessa, Kharkiv etc. Their masterplan was to re-integrate Donbass into Ukraine on terms of giving them autonomy (so called &quot;federalisation&quot; of Ukraine). Now you can guess that in this case any Ukrainian government would have to listen to this vocal minority when any major issue is raised, such as entering EU or NATO. This would forever place Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence.<br><br>But it never happened. Ukies used Minsk agreements to freeze war and prepare themselves for the future. Donbass could still be utilised as the source of instability, but that surely wasn&#039;t so impressive. Such were the things until 2021 when coronavirus hit hard and Russian government handled it very poorly, causing discontent among populace. That&#039;s when they remembered about Crimea and how everyone loved Putin for it.

The plan was to capture Kyiv in a swift attack, establish a loyal pro-Russian government, suppress potential resistance that wasn&#039;t expected to be high, bypass and encircle any strongpoints of AFU in order to quickly capture major cities and that&#039;s pretty much it. The military part of the operation was to have taken no more than a week with matters of organising occupation and establishing a new order to have taken no more than 3-4 months. Well, we all know what happened with this plan in reality. But the fact is that it looks like the Russians still haven&#039;t come up with anything else that would at least give them some guidance on the strategic level. Like, they can take Bakhmut, Kramatorsk, whatever, but what then? The whole country? Or only territories with the Russians on it?

They don&#039;t know, so they constantly make contradictory statements about their wargoals and do contradictory things that can make no sense both militarily and politically?<br><br>Why were they so sure that Ukraine would fall quickly? Well, they did believe that pro-Russian sentiments in Eastern Ukraine were high and that they would be met as liberators. Maybe it was true in 2014, but in 2022 it surely wasn&#039;t and their intelligence failed spectacularly not to have seen that. They also believed that Ukrainian army was weak, which again was true only 8 years ago. They overestimated themselves obviously.

The fighters do not have heavy weaponry but are extremely skilful at fashioning whatever comes to hand into battle arms.<br><br>Their guerrilla warfare relies heavily on mines and explosives. Lacking conventional mines, they use unexploded mines and rockets. Sometimes they simply surround the rockets with explosive and blow them up. Often they heat the unexploded weapons over fire and obtain liquid explosive, which they pour into containers, to which they then add metal bolts, nuts and nails to create shrapnel.<br><br>The Russian high command, and especially its main spokesman Ilya Shabalkin, has frequently said that its soldiers have found medical syringes at captured militant bases and used this as proof that many fighters are drug addicts. However, it appears that most of these syringes are being used as detonators for mines. De-miners can detect metal objects but do not pick up the presence of plastic syringes.<br><br>The guerrillas are also skilled at reusing captured weaponry. Major Medvedev said they had found a heavy machine gun in a militant base in Vedeno in southern Chechnya which had been removed from the turret of an armoured vehicle. \u201cEven those officers who had served in many conflict zones were amazed at what they saw,\u201d he said.<br><br>\u201cThe fighters put it on a rotating tripod, fixed bicycle handlebars to it, and connected the mechanism of electric trigger to an ordinary battery.

Weapons were produced mainly in Grozny at some of the workshops of the half-destroyed Krasnyi Molot and Elektropribor factories and in the third largest city in Chechnya, Argun. The Argun factory mainly produced mortars and grenade launchers.<br><br>An FSB officer in Chechnya, who wished to remain anonymous said, \u201cAccording to our information, before they invaded Dagestan in the summer of 1999, the units of Shamil Basayev and the Arab fighter Khattab received over 250 such mortars and about a thousand auxiliary grenade launchers, which had been manufactured in Argun. Also, in Grozny, Makarov pistols were being made on a territory of a former tram depot. Components were purchased at military factories in Russia.\u201d<br><br>Even today in Chechnya one can buy Makarov pistols, refashioned from gas pistols for between 100 and 150 dollars. Makeovers that have an \u201cOssetian\u201d barrel from North Ossetia are the most popular with the buyers.
