Use a US military issue poncho to replace the frog toggs and external pack waterproofing material. <br><br>Freezedried foods are tasty and light - but for the cost and size they&#039;re seriously lacking in calories and demand giant amounts of water to prepare. Unless you&#039;re in an area you know water sources for or which is extremely water abundant it&#039;s better to skip those and the stove and to just carry calorie dense food you can eat cold like peanut butter, trail mix, jerky, etc. so you can eat till you&#039;re just barely not hungry during the day and that you&#039;re pleasantly full before you sleep. That lends you the ability to leave the stove behind as well if you&#039;re willing to eat cold food - even if you do the &quot;leave no trace&quot; principle.

You won&#039;t get nice views as you move, but you&#039;ll be more subtle, have a less crowded trail, and move faster which are all good things if you&#039;re in a situation that&#039;s more /k/ than /out/.<br><br>Another consideration completely missed by this list is internal organization of the pack, this is important for minimizing time taken in temporary halts. big empty bags without mesh pockets are dumb<br><br>this list is built for a physical invalid walking on meticulously curated trails on dayhikes or 1.5 day hikes.", "time": 1675891964, "resto": 57072600}, {"no": 57079505, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)16:40:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57074446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57074446</a><br>wear loose pants without underwear. it&#039;s called going commando for a reason.

A sawyer squeeze mini, or something. They are cheap, extremely lightweight, bomb proof, and quick. Get smartwool briefs, or something with a high merino wool blend, theyre worth every cent. Also, you should get some proper trail running shoes or light boots. Road runners will disintegrate if you&#039;re moving through rugged terrain. <br><br>Besides that, I would say you really need to try using some of this stuff in the field. A common folly is people overcorrecting when it comes to weight reductions (see &quot;stupid light&quot;). Comfort and convenience are really important. Many people carry 2-person tents even when solo. The weight increase is tolerable relative to a 1P, and the extra space makes a HUGE difference especially when you have wet gear and need to spread out a bit. Also, a bigger cooking pot. I carry the TOAKS 1600ml. I can actually cook meals in it, and also in a &quot;bugout&quot; situation you could boil a lot more water. An nice inflatable sleeping pad is a big investment, and it is one more thing to break/pop, but good sleep is priceless. Those foam pads dont work for many people, I do use them. These are all just suggestions, you may be perfectly happy with all of this gear. I can tell you&#039;ve done a lot of research and have made good choices (S-tier pick for packliner btw), but there really is no substitute for just getting out there. Theres a saying in the thruhiking community &quot;hike your own hike&quot;. Everyone wants/needs different things to be comfortable. The suggestions Ive made, if implemented thoughtfully, represent probably less than a pound of pack weight. <br><br>P.S. A lightweight roll top dry bag is a great thing to have. Mine weighs 2.5oz.

They&#039;re essentially Arians (not to be confused with Aryans, look up Arius for more info).<br>Regardless, I respect them despite their theology being so far removed from mine, and I have a lot more respect for them than the Protestants or Orthodoxy despite their closer theology to us or greater numbers. The former largely came about out of political convenience and went wild with fracturing the faith into thousands of broken pieces and adding retarded ideas out of nowhere like the Rapture, and the latter was more of the same except with more Slavic idiocy and Greek bullheadedness. At least the Mormons never caved so far as to let communists and muslims choose their patriarchs, the closest they came was the idea of Deseret being a US state governed by a theocracy. Besides, a Protestant or Orthodox (or other Catholics for that matter) could be anyone, with any motive behind them. With Mormons, you know exactly what you&#039;re getting, so it&#039;s far easier to pass a good judgement upon them. I don&#039;t agree with them on matters of deeper theology, they likely don&#039;t agree with me there either, but in their behavior I can say that they are probably more likely to see heaven (or at least, have a very mitigated time in purgatory before seeing heaven, but who among us won&#039;t other than saints?) than some who fully accept the doctrines but don&#039;t live by them.

Sure, we can say &quot;oh, you dumb capitalist, don&#039;t you know REAL communism isn&#039;t supposed to work that way?&quot;, but we&#039;d be ignoring the way it really does work in our world, not in the unachievable fantasies of books.", "time": 1676015406, "resto": 57090888}, {"no": 57099556, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:51:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "playable WarBell Russia path soon?", "filename": "WarBel III", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 751, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676015478739880, "time": 1676015478, "md5": "2dXNwciuiV5PkYLVvT6c/A==", "fsize": 119931, "resto": 57090888}, {"no": 57099574, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:53:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57099261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57099261</a><br>The fuck do you mean?

Cold Steel had some pretty cringe marketing campaigns but they\u00b4ve aways made solid knives. These Demkos are not really flippers though, and you mentioned that in your first post. Another suggestion along those lines is the Benchmade Mini-Adamas in CPM cruwear steel. The Axis lock flips like a maniac and it\u00b4ll be a better finished knife than the Cold Steel Demko ones, and it has a superior, deep carry clip.<br><br>The general problem with this &quot;overbuilt&quot; folders is not even size, but weight. Carrying a knife in the pocket makes every single ounce count a lot. The knife tilts a lot when it is heavier. I generally stay away from folders that weight more than 4 oz. Any heavier than that, I think it is more suitable for belt carry. Others will carry an 8 ounce knife in their pocket and forget its there.<br><br>I asked if you were planning on sharpening it yourself because of your choice of steel, this is an entire can of worms with many many variables. In the most basic of terms, the higher a supersteel is rated for cutlery, the longer it will retain its edge, and the harder it is going to be for a novice to sharpen. Edge retention and ease of sharpening vary dramatically between knife steels. But even a supersteel blade will eventually get dull. This aspect must be carefully considered, and it is often disregarded.

You also need to have the orbit go over the target, which means either waiting until the orbit&#039;s inclination and the targets latitude to align, or changing the ship&#039;s inclination, which costs fuel (you have a limited amount), is easily observable, and makes it very obvious what&#039;s about to happen. Assuming the target is on the equator and the ships orbit has zero inclination (ideal circumstances), you only have one deorbit window per 90 minutes (assuming ~350km orbit), so if you miss that window you need to wait another hour and a half, which is enough time for the nuclear war to be lost.<br>Things to keep in mind next time you read some retard claiming the x37b is a space bomber", "time": 1676004168, "resto": 57096692}, {"no": 57098079, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:44:03", "name": "[PLEBSPOTTERS] BigC", "com": "<a href=\"#p57097553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57097553</a><br><a href=\"#p57097820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57097820</a><br><a href=\"#p57097577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57097577</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s not how orbits work</span><br>you can definitely eject a warhead with compressed gas out of a tube or just use a small solid booster to send it on it&#039;s way, imagine &quot;rods from god&quot; minus the kinetic part, it&#039;s just a nuke<br>you&#039;re not thinking about this with the right mindset", "time": 1676004243, "resto": 57096692, "trip": "!PAWS/PFILI"}, {"no": 57098125, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:47:54", "name": "[PLEBSPOTTERS] BigC", "com": "<a href=\"#p57098079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57098079</a><br>literally exactly what i said has already been proposed and designed, so idk why you retards are all seething at me for even mentioning it<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The bomb would naturally contain a large kinetic energy because it moves at orbital velocities, around 8 kilometres per second (26,000 ft/s; 8,000 m/s; Mach 24) in orbit and 3 kilometres per second (9,800 ft/s; 3,000 m/s; Mach 8.8) at impact.

Probably the most famous case of this causing problems is that when borders were getting redrawn after the First World War, the people drawing the lines didn&#039;t take these groups into account, so a lot of them got mixed up into the same country together, and has spawned a lot of essentially inquisition-turned-civil-wars.

Secondly, most of the country is arid or mild temperate, so much less inhospitable to Europeans than hot lowland tropical regions with malaria. <br><br>I think it&#039;ll either the Cape will secede (essentially the south western part of the country) and the rest will descend further into a dysfunctional shithole, or the entire country will collapse and later coalesce into a Cape state (Western Cape, Northern Cape and Western half of the Eastern Cape) and a state comprising the highveld region (including Gauteng) and the Freestate, with the eastern half of the Eastern Cape, most of KZN and the low lying parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo reverting back to deep Africa since they have climates amenable to the African way of life and strong ethnic groups. These places wil probably be contested frontier territory. <br><br>The Cape state will probably be multi ethic and mulatto dominated and be a bit like Brazil, the Highveld state will be pretty chaotic, since the centre of power would be Gauteng, and the goal would be to keep control of the farmland and mineral resources in the region. There aren&#039;t many strong black tribal identities in region, and the Afrikaners are likely too few and too scattered to unite and exert power. What I suspect will happen is that a cosmopolitan black elite will try to keep control of the region by using the Afrikaners as a sort of janissary class to control the lower classes and keep some of the infrastructure going to maintain control.", "time": 1675852920, "resto": 57069338}, {"no": 57074182, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)08:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57073192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57073192</a><br>bedankt voor de uitleg <br>de Afrikaner hebben altijd een thuis in de lage landen maar ik denk niet dat ze hier goed zouden aarden in dit koude, natte en vooral stedelijke gebied", "time": 1675861293, "resto": 57069338}, {"no": 57075541, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:44:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "They weren&#039;t that isolated.

I whispered this to my father, who whipped off his glove and brought his scope to his eye. It was an easy shot for the old man, dead broadside, 200 Yards, wind to our backs.

The JSP was only founded in 1945, but if I can recall a related party, the Japanese Communist Party, we can go back and see something odd. The JCP was founded in 1922, and was then outlawed 3 years later. Throughout World War 2, it&#039;s members were imprisoned and subject to general repression. One was even found to be a Kremlin spy and was executed.<br>Then in 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the Allied occupation forces curiously re-legalized the Japanese Communist Party, along with many other far-leftist parties, which is where the Japanese Socialist Party came into the scene. And this occupation was entirely consisting of western soldiers, the Soviet Union decided it didn&#039;t want to place their captive citizens under the command of a US general like MacArthur.<br>I have to question why, at the beginning of the Cold War, would the US leadership allow these entities to continue to exist in Japan. Personally, I blame FDR as always. Fucking tyrannical faggot, if he hadn&#039;t happened to be in office during the war he&#039;d never have such a reputation as he does. He&#039;d be better known as a wannabe dictator who continually abused the systems of government to gain more power and colluded with our enemies (the Soviets).

Maybe if it&#039;s in a rage or fear, or a mother protecting her kittens, or a moment of catness and they forget to play gentle. I&#039;ve taken some deep cuts, a couple that probably should have had stitches. I know people who have had stitches.<br><br>One buddy got clawed down his arm and had about 12 or 15 long gouges about a foot long. Over 100 stitches to get all that put back together after it was cleaned very thoroughly in an emergency room. It was an accident. His cat panicked over getting picked up in an encounter with a dog and just went apeshit on him, probably confused as to who or what was attacking him. A really sweet cat that never hurt anyone, including me, before or after. But, that one incident was insane. He lost so much blood the hospital considered giving him a transfusion.<br><br>I was carrying a young kitten one day, calm &amp; cozy &amp; half asleep in my arms. A dog ran into the room and jumped at him. He turned into a 2 pound demon, clawed his way out of my arms, up my chest, across my face and set all his claws into my scalp when he got on top of my head. I am here to witness that hurt like fucking hell, and took a couple days of cleaning &amp; disinfecting all he wounds to make sure they could heal instead of turning infected.<br><br>I used to do feline rescue. The feral &amp; semi-feral cats were less dangerous because I expected it and prepared for them to freak out, and still I&#039;ve taken claws and bites through heavy protection.

If she wanted to get my attention, she&#039;d sit right by me and stare at me. If a minute passed without me acknowledging her, she&#039;d put her paw on my leg or arm. If I still didn&#039;t acknowledge her, she&#039;d then slowly sink the claws on both of her front paws into my thigh. She would straight up escalate until I finally paid attention to her. She usually did this if she ran out of food/water or wanted the litter box cleaned.<br><br>Funny story: when this female cat was still a kitten, she had a bouncy ball she&#039;d bat around the kitchen. One time it went under the oven, so I got it out using a wire coat hanger. I got the ball out, left the coat hanger on the floor next to the over, and went back to whatever I was doing. A few minutes later, I hear something metallic moving around the kitchen floor. Turned out that the ball had gone under the oven again, and the cat was pushing the coat hanger under the oven to get the ball out. She only needed to see me do it once to try it herself.

A domesticated cat that has been raised in a safe and loving environment is almost incapable of harming people. They have to be treated very badly and endangered, and many will, even then, submit to torture and death before hurting a human.<br><br>But, there are accidents. And, some cats are not taught from a young age the difference between playing and playing for keeps. That&#039;s really all I was trying to say.

If you&#039;re playing with a cat and they get too rough, immediately stop moving and say &quot;OUCH! OUCH! OUCH!&quot; Withdraw from play for a minute or so, then start again slower and more gentle. Cats figure it out quickly and temper their behavior. If they draw blood, even a small amount, touch their nose with a drop. Just a single small drop. Every cat that&#039;s ever lived with me never needed me to do that more than twice, and usually it&#039;s only once if at all. They learn fast.

Their supply lockers will last for over a year with minimal crewing. The missiles are sealed in a climate-controlled, EMP shielded, and very heavily-armored tube with no salt and very limited water exposure. They&#039;re auto-calibrated on a weekly basis with no influence from water motion. They can fire from a 30+ degree tilt after a strike and still hit the target, and those were the &lt;de&gt;classified tests. Communication is near-instant rather than relying on encrypted ELF in a combat posture. If the phone lines to the armed and ready to fire missiles are cut, the missile goes into dead man&#039;s hand status and launches on its own in a few hours unless specifically overridden. More importantly, a field can ripple launch some or all of its warheads depending on the appropriate response, and still be well-hardened enough to soak up vastly more firepower to disable than the sub.. which is now dead. The sub has to alpha strike with the first shot, because there likely won&#039;t be a second. The land site can launch a counterforce attack with enough MIRVS to launch a second counterforce or a countervalue attack afterwards.

There are 360+ mods that add 30+ High-quality long quests (tens of hours), a ton of bug patches and fixes, and 4 major campaigns (dozens of hours) - Tales of the Commonwealth, Thuggysmurf mods, and Sim Settlements 2 (SS2). SS2 functionally alone makes FO4 an entirely new game and one that doesn&#039;t suck. Thuggysmurf mods either replace or augment the entire main campaign, depending on how you want to play the game. I personally use version 104.<br><br>The survival mode that comes with this mod collection is savage. You must drink, eat, and sleep else you take damage; infections are real and common, bleed damage / break damage occurs, etc. Nasty. <br><br>About personal vertibird: <br>With no fast travel in survival mode, the game is difficult. You&#039;ll be local to Sanctuary and a few other places until you&#039;ve sufficiently progressed to getting blueprint + parts for a vertibird. Once you have a vertibird, you can use it as a way to travel (30 minute max travel time to cross the map). Get into a pinch? Call in air support. Settlement under attack? Load up your 4-6+ companions and become a QRF, dropping into a combat zone with battle-hardened troops. <br><br>Bottom line: A Storywealth + personal vertibird gets you a settlement building, hardcore survival-focused FPS RPG with newly written main quests and oodles of new functionality. Turning off fast travel and using the personal vertibird is game changing - nothing like walking to new places and calling in a QRF team when things get hairy. Survival is not guaranteed. For me personally, the act of building settlements, securing food / water / shelter, getting settlers, and then battling disease and raiders is truly rewarding and a real experience to behold.", "time": 1675900150, "resto": 57078374}, {"no": 57081426, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57081188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57081188</a><br>Fallout 4&#039;s biggest weakness by far is the story, which is even more nonsensical than 3&#039;s and does an even worse job of establishing player investment.

But if you&#039;re really struggling, get on a caravan, either in the Hub in FO1 or Redding in FO2, and just do nothing as your caravan cleaves through high level enemies, then grab the guns of everyone that dies. Instant profit, unless you get incinerated by mutants but that doesn&#039;t happen that often.", "filename": "ay9W0xq_460s", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 460, "h": 348, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1676010503365515, "time": 1676010503, "md5": "lFID2noSTOHnrugtW7T21Q==", "fsize": 18599, "resto": 57078374}, {"no": 57098900, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:32:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57098303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57098303</a><br>I didn&#039;t know they allowed raging faggots in /k/", "time": 1676010722, "resto": 57078374}, {"no": 57099180, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:03:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57097704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57097704</a><br><a href=\"#p57097973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57097973</a><br>This.

The Nerevarine has similar equivalents, Jesus is an obvious pick, but one could say he&#039;s also closely based on Elijah or Elisha, prophets who were persecuted by the pagans who had supplanted the worship of God in Samaria/Northern Israel. In fact, I&#039;d say the Nerevarine&#039;s later disappearance is somewhat close to Elijah being taken into Heaven in body and soul, technically not having died.<br>The actual morality of their Temple and associated factions of course differs, and there are some more eastern concepts in there too, but these strike out at me the most.<br>As for the Redguards, it&#039;s sort of a mix of all of them.

First of all, do not turn on that radio in the OP without an antenna hooked up to it. If you accidentally key it up without an antenna you will burn out the finals. Second of all, getting a license isn&#039;t optional with the radio in the OP if you want to transmit. HF is not plug and play like the radios that commonly get talked about here, and the only way to truly learn how to use it is by actually making contacts with other people over it. I&#039;d recommend studying for a general class amateur radio license since it covers voice and data modes while the lower technician class license only covers morse code.<br><br>How much use you can get out of this one: <a href=\"#p57098232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57098232</a> depends on your area. Again, don&#039;t turn it on without an antenna hooked up, and don&#039;t try to talk to people on the amateur radio bands without a license as they don&#039;t like that. You can check on repeaterbook.com for 2 meter repeaters in your area to see if there&#039;s any significant activity, along with on the 2 meter calling frequency (146.520 MHz), and any websites for amateur radio clubs in your area to see if there&#039;s another designated local simplex frequency along with the dates and times they might host nets. Don&#039;t try to scan entire amateur radio bands as your radio will not scan fast enough for you not to miss what little activity there is.

It has some neat features like being able to record your shots as well as a jack for a microphone and the ability to synch audio to the video. It can also record in color with enough white light. It also automatically adjusts the frame rate based on how much IR it is receiving. I guess this was done to improve performance in low light, but it\u2019s honestly kind of annoying. It has a QD feature. You clamp the sleeve to the scope, and the clip on attaches to the sleeve with some lugs and a latch. It seems to be worth the $220 I paid for it. The sensor is far and away better than the night fox cape. The screen resolution is also much higher, and when there is plenty of IR it appears to have a much smoother image even though the manual lists it at 30 fps.

A sand caster is kinda like the step between a coil gun (big slugs) and a typical particle accelerator (superheated gas) in terms of velocity. If you could mass produce complex structures with huge amounts of surface area like this for a gun, you&#039;d basically be able to throw buckets of sand at 10,000,000+ m/s. If a single dust grain hits that that speed, you might drill a millimeter or two into a slab of metal, but there is also a million particles lined up right behind it. That isn&#039;t the scary part though.<br><br>If you&#039;re able to make this kind of ammo, you could also give it *payloads*.

For another example you take a non free floated firearm and exert force onto the structural parts then you&#039;ll experience POI shifts from where you&#039;re sighted, like with the M4s that don&#039;t have a FF handgrip. What free floating the barrel does is it makes it so you&#039;re dealing only with barrel resonance that is isolated from the rest of the gun and by extension the shooter&#039;s grip. If the foregrip can deal with the forces of resting on a bipod, being held at different points which can shift the resonance node of the barrel and being pushed up against a window then that increases accuracy. However when you&#039;re looking at an autocannon installation that doesn&#039;t really apply since they&#039;re not resting the cannon against surfaces and the only load path is going into the mount. What that stiffener structure does is that it makes the barrel&#039;s virtual diameter a little bigger in that it acts like a pretend taper barrel. You can find examples of this in small arms with carbon fiber encased barrels or &quot;hollow&quot; barrels that look like water jackets but use the larger diameter to increase stiffness.", "time": 1675939885, "resto": 57086631}, {"no": 57087161, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:51:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57087155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57087155</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;turreted guns have wobbled up to 180 degrees</span>", "filename": "10967453", "ext": ".png", "w": 326, "h": 326, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675939885800136, "time": 1675939885, "md5": "9xYRwf/BSfTkDL2F8kC0vw==", "fsize": 42848, "resto": 57086631}, {"no": 57087163, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:52:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57087155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57087155</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this has nothing to do with why free-floating barrels are more accurate</span><br>Free-floating has everything to do with that lmao.

Most all of the HMMWV on govplanet have had parts robbed off them and are at best 80% complete. Expect to go through fuel system/ cooling system/ steering and suspension before it is remotely reliable. The electrical system on these trucks is 24v. <br>They don\u2019t actually take a key. There is a cable under dash you can lock steering wheel with. You can add a keyed switch to interrupt the signal to fuel shutoff solenoid or neutral safety switch in order to disable the truck when you\u2019re not with it. <br><br>I\u2019m averaging around 10 MPG with the old 3speed trans and 42inch tires. Top speed is 67 mph. You can technically go faster than 67mph but you are over speeding the engine and you can\u2019t do it for long. <br><br>The original 6.2 and 6.5 engines are underpowered for such a large heavy truck.
