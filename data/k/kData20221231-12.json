Because I think stealth is proven and difficult to surmount, but reaching a point of diminishing returns while the turn away from energy tactics like 40 years ago allowed a lot of materials science to mature to the point where a major leapfrog forward in speed and endurance is now possible. <br><br>Stealth is a battle against signal processing, so the defending asset is essentially free, ie the fix. Speed is a battle against the interceptor, the missile, so it inverts the cost equation between IADs and aircraft. The famous example being how many SAMs were launched at SR-71s. Speed also gives major kinetic boost to weapon performance, time to merge from scramble, rate of climb and probably also electrical generation through the AGB for DEW. <br><br>To me stealth makes sense when your airfields are known and constrained, like for the USAF. Speed is more effective for the Navy not only because DCA is a bigger focus for them but also because the launch point is hidden and variable.

It was never supposed to be a long-term defence line, but it was never supposed to be a breeze to take either. Back when izyum and Lyman were in Rusky hands, it was meant to be a sizeable speed bump for the Russian push to the donetsk district borders.<br><br>Yet here we are. Ukies basically saw that they can hold it fairly comfortably, with a nice K/D ratio. Let&#039;s not kid ourselves here, ukrainians are deffo coming up on top here, they&#039;ve been in bad situations in the past and retreated in order to avoid casualties, clearly that&#039;s not the case here. The city is not in a cauldron (yet), can easily be supplied, and has the full backing of M777s and HIMARS now. It&#039;s likely that it will eventually fall as ukraine pulls troops out of there, but given that it&#039;s been under siege for over 6 months now, I am not ruling out Russia simply giving up eventually. <br><br>People ignoring the rest of the frontline however, which is kinda funny. Ukraine is steadily advancing in Luhansk, and gearing up for a potential break-through south. Look at what&#039;s being reported, and read between the lines. Huge HIMAR strikes in the south, targeting logistics and barracks. Same shit that happened in Kherson for months, resulting in Russia&#039;s retreat.

You can have primitive societies that do existential slaughter, you can also have societies that are organized which engage in theatrical warfare (Renaissance Italian cities, Ancient greek cities for a time). It&#039;d be neat to study what makes the shift and why. Nor is it technological - African civil wars are often peak theatrical, yet also peak existential slaughter of civilians.</span><br>Both with Italian Condottieri and early Greek city-states, scholarship is now seriously challenging the notions that either engaged in theatrical warfare. In the former case, it seems to be entirely based on Machiavelli&#039;s political dislike for the Condottieri, who dismantled most of the Italian Republics for profit. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Speaking of dick-sucking, a real terrible and uncomfortable realization I had is with the level of pederastic abuse and molestation we see in say the modern Catholic church (or homosexual rape in the Russian army) - why should we believe it was anything less in the past?</span><br>I think it mostly has to do with the power of soldiers vs officers (and between subgrades of soldiers). So back in the kabinetkrieg era, when soldiers were harshly disciplined and from the lowest classes, I would bet there was a lot of buggery there. But in the medieval period, soldiers were from better social classes, and I assume that the higher the social class the less buggery. A knight could get away with buggering some farmer from the local levy, but buggering a burgher or an aristocrat would make you some serious enemies and you might be sued or feuded against.<br>I have a hunch this is what Sun Tzu was talking about when he said that the officers shouldn&#039;t be too powerful.", "time": 1672444794, "resto": 56565889}, {"no": 56575405, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:00:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56565985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56565985</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;calls OP out on reddit spacing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proceeds to reddit space himself</span>", "time": 1672444829, "resto": 56565889}, {"no": 56575419, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:01:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56565889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56565889</a><br>You need a good hard face slap.", "time": 1672444881, "resto": 56565889}, {"no": 56575423, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:01:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56565889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56565889</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Time feels like an illusion and I can feel the roman and medieval eras almost as strongly as the current day and not the romanticized theme park costume most people reduce the past to.</span><br>Holy fuck anon I get this feel too", "filename": "1671912374763864", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 682, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672444919352080, "time": 1672444919, "md5": "H5iMEQYW3p1YGpd0s7CTmw==", "fsize": 846497, "resto": 56565889}, {"no": 56575435, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:04:26", "name": "Mandic", "com": "<a href=\"#p56565889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56565889</a><br><br><br>How will you drape, bitches!<br>Throwing everything and cursing everything,<br>Pathetically wringing his hands -<br>&quot;And what am I for, me?<br>Well, what the hell am I, an aggressor?<br>I&#039;m not Putin or Shoigu!<br>I&#039;m not a doctor or a professor -<br>What do I know and what Can I?<br>I can finally do that Ukrainians, that the Greeks!<br>Disassemble them - not my fucking work!<br>Well, they told me - Crimea is ours forever!<br>Who knew that they would lie again?<br>They told me - and without arguing, I<br>believed in new frontiers!<br>Well, I sold everything to live by the sea!<br>And where am I now - a bum?!&quot;<br>How will you beat each other -<br>Elbow, claw, thigh, hook,<br>Daughter - mother, husband - wife,<br>Hurrying to the last ferry!<br>Tearing clothes, trampling the fallen,<br>Beating muzzles against the fence<br>With the doom of the losers,<br>Realizing their sentence,<br>How will you climb the wall,<br>Getting a butt in the forehead,<br>And waking up - cramming Shevchenko,<br>So that again on your knees - bang!<br>But they won&#039;t let the slaves go to paradise,<br>No matter how much you lick the whip,<br>They only poke the tibia from the edge<br>And contemptuously throw: &quot;Get out.&quot;<br>Well, for those who in one underwear will still<br>be able to break into the port, To climb the last board<br>along the slippery gangway with blood , Only it will be more difficult, And not from the cramped cabins, Just a collapsing Rashka - This is a very bad shelter.<br>A donut will make a hole for you,<br>And perhaps in your head,<br>Kadyrka will teach you<br>Sharia in his Moscow.<br>And those who thought that only eggs are<br>cooler than the Russian thug soul,<br>The Chinese will adapt to plow<br>All day for a glass of noodles.<br>Yes, and their own bandits,<br>Very irritable,<br>Will be very angry with you.<br>After - famine, winter, plague ...<br><br>Let at least all of you be hunted down by dogs<br>Or drowned in the slop bucket,<br>You deserved it yourself,<br>The whole country yelling: &quot;Crimea is ours!&quot;<br>For meanness - there is no forgiveness!<br>Deserved - what you bought, then chew!

The first movie with a woman star showcases how shit and out of her element the woman is with real criminals.

You could ask the same question about .30cal/7.62mm cartridges, which were being used as early as the late 1800s. Sometimes someone long ago found a certain designed worked best nobody has been able to improve it since. It is likely that the development of the ammunition was more or less figured out, so the major improvements to be made were in the delivery system. Chiefly, portability. After that, range and accuracy. The M777 takes advantage of modern materials (mostly titanium) and manufacturing methods that were not available during the designing of the M198. As a result, it is 41% lighter. In modern warfare, artillery becomes a priority target and the ability to shoot and scoot is paramount. The firing crew of the M777 can easily set it into a towing mode where it can be moved by hand and quickly attached to the rear of a truck for transport. The light weight also means that a CH-47 chinook can sling-load it and potentially set the guns up in a location that motorized transport methods couldn&#039;t reach. The integrated GPS system of the M777 means that the gun always knows where it is, and where it is pointed, an automates a lot of the aiming process using factors like atmospheric conditions to significantly improve accuracy. Using the Excalibur GPS guided munition, the M777 can put a 155mm HE shell inside of a 10-digit gridsquare (1 meter x 1 meter) at 26 miles away. That means if your target is a pickup truck, you can choose if the shell lands on the engine, the cab, or the bed (at the distance of a marathon!!) Using the same ammunition as the legacy system means that logistics are simplified, old stockpiles from both us and our allies are still useful, and further developments in ammunition can be passed back to allies that still use the legacy system.

The point is that all parts have some kind of tolerance. For an easy to explain example, take the length of the barrel. Let&#039;s say it&#039;s supposed to be 5 inches. None of the barrels will be exactly 5.0000000 inches on the dot. some will be 4.95, some will be 5.01, and so on. The same thing applies to how straight the bore of the barrel is machined relative to the rest of it. It&#039;s supposed to be perfectly straight, but again in real life nothing is ever perfect, and one barrel might be .001 degrees to the left, the next might be .01 degrees up and .005 right, the next might be .01 left and .1 down, and so on. That&#039;s why guns have adjustable sights, so you can adjust them to account for all those production imperfections. You know the two barrels you have are different from each other, but nothing you wrote so far suggests that one of them is &quot;not seated right&quot;. It is normal and expected for the POI to change if you swap barrels in a pistol.

Pry under the back of the receiver with an old rounded off flathead gently. Do so until the disassembly button is no longer popping back into place with a tap or bump of the gun (no more than a half inch gap at most). Use a small rubber mallet to smack one side of the trigger guard gently; do it too hard and you&#039;ll probably split the wood. Repeat on other (left and right side of trigger guard).

We talk about the military and contractors burning money in dumb ways or being in bed over contracts these days, but the Japanese didn&#039;t even talk about it, it was so natural to them there was nothing to talk about. All of their service branches were basically owned by individual business monopolies, e.g. Mitsubishi was not just the main contractor, it practically owned the Navy, Mitui practically owned the Army... I&#039;m talking about controlling every aspect of procurement from (on the industrial side) mining ore, through steel foundries, to finished equipment, as well as (on the business/political side) their own political party for pushing through contracts and their own major bank for organizing financing. All of that in one, monopolistic business conglomerate. Every single Japanese procurement decision until late in the war was driven primarily by maximizing parent company profits.

I have a rifle that with good stance and control i can send 147gr slugs with rapidity into the brush close up and if need be I also can shoot over a valley 600-800m away and have decent success with heavy winds. Besides just being a cool configuration bullpups do have advantages and disadvantages. Nothing is ever for free. Laying prone with extended mags, reloading from prone, reloading in general is a tad slower but that isn&#039;t so much a disadvantage as everyone highlights. I guess if you plan on 1v6 ing a bunch of people you may want to reconsider another platform.<br><br>Overall i would say that a lot of bullpups suffer from adequate forends. I&#039;ve seen some sweet AUGs with nice forends that allow good control and attachment space. Another thing a good forend allows is space to brace. The Tavors generally have a cutlass grip and shorter rails which is nice for stabilizing in some ways but also now you have a single pivot point and when you&#039;re trying to keep steady for a 400m+ shot, you get a lot of vertical play. I wish the Tavor7 had just 2-3 more inches and i would be super happy with that as i have long arms and it feels more comfortable with longer shots.

With an underbarrel launcher you can keep it loaded (and unlike a rifle grenade this doesn&#039;t add a bunch of length to your rifle), you can shoot the rifle whenever you want, regardless of if you have a grenade ready or not, you just take a firing grip and eyeball your trajectory.

The heavy snow will come in the first week of February. the men in the 20 mile stretch of front will first feel cold and miserable for a few days and then teh temperature really plunges, -5 -20C. All the fuel is already gone and the wet muddy poor quality clothes offer little protection. There is a lack of movement in mile after mile...and a complete silence. In the morning one of the remaining officers starts making calls for reports and call after call goes unanswered mile after mile of trenches filled with frozen corpses or the corpses of those who died of carbon monoxide <br>poisoning huddled in earth pits. By the time the sun is fully up the first Ukrainian drone operators are reporting the situation and by midday the Ukrainian forces are moving forward into the Russian positions. Panic sets in behind the Russian lines but the remaining officers are spending hours trying to contact their departed superior and colleagues back in Russia and are working to destroy the receipts for their share in thye load of winter socks and vests that they stole and dumped onto the Russian black market in Vladivostok in exchange for a lorry load of stole filter less cigarettes.

He can strike with it as and where he likes, as he can with stones or pieces of wood or iron and so forth, unlike in the use of other weapons.<br><br>Question: Where is the mace carried on the saddle?<br>Answer: On the right side. Horsemen of old used to put it on the left of the saddle, but the right is better.<br><br>Question: How does the mace-bearer strike a blow with<br>his mace?<br>Answer: He strikes a sideways blow with it so that it does not slip from his hand and injure either his mount or himself.<br><br>Question: Where should he strike his enemy with his<br>mace?<br>Answer: He should strike a man on his nose. If he is unable to do this then he should strike the forehead. If this is impossible, then on his right upper arm if he is on the right side, or his left upper arm if he is on the left. Alternatively, he should strike the front of his opponent&#039;s horse&#039;s head, on the forelock, or if that is impossible on the front of one of its shoulders.<br>(cont.)", "time": 1672317305, "resto": 56553538}, {"no": 56558274, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)07:36:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56558265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56558265</a><br>Question: What does the mace-bearer do when he meets the bearer of any other weapons?<br>Answer: He can break lances, swords, bows, or shields. He can smash helmets, forearms, thighs, and trunks, and he can shatter bones. He can also throw his mace at the horseman or his horse, or at the footsoldiers. Or he can do whatever occurs to him.<br><br>Question: Where does the horseman hold his mace when he has withdrawn it from its suspensory strap before an encounter?<br>Answer: He holds it between his hands on the saddle, in the centre part of the saddle between himself and the pommel.<br><br>Question: How should the footsoldier hold his mace in an encounter?<br>Answer: He should lay it on his left forearm gripping it with his right hand and with his shield in his left hand, in the same way as a sword.<br><br>Question: When is it appropriate for the footsoldier to hold<br>his mace vertical? Answer: He should hold it thus, as we mentioned concerning the sword, on passing between ranks of troops and in the presence of kings and sultans.<br><br>Question: How should the mace be thrown? Answer: The mace-bearer should take hold of it at the grip withthe head of the mace held away from the body and lift the hand until it is level with the shoulder. Then he should stretch out his hand to full extent so that the weight of his mace may have more effect.<br><br>Question: How heavy should a mace be?<br>Answer: Its weight should not be beyond the strength of the man carrying it so that he can weild it effectively. I have heard it said by friends who fought in campaigns against against the Unbelievers that a mace should weigh 150 dirhams. That is a good weight; a mace may be less than that but not more.<br><br>NOTE:<br>In modern Egypt a dirham is about 3.12 grams. In twelfth century Syria it was apparently about 3.14 grams (see W. Hinz: Islamische Masse und Gewichte, Handbuch der Orientalistik, Leiden 1955). 150 dirhams would thus equate to about 470 grams, or just a hair over one pound.<br>PS---Albion is gay.", "time": 1672317376, "resto": 56553538}, {"no": 56558282, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)07:37:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56558254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56558254</a><br>I&#039;ve handled those and I&#039;ve handled Albions, and there&#039;s very little difference in quality.

My argument is that a shotgun is excellent for home defense for a far bigger reason than just because they&#039;re &quot;good enough&quot; or &quot;familiar&quot;. They&#039;re better than carbines for this. You blurred the lines between the two in your previous post. A practiced shooter can send off two rounds of buckshot faster than even the fastest competition shooter can accurately send off five rounds of 5.56 - and that would mean 18 impacts to the torso vs. 5, albeit with less energy per shot. Each pellet, however, would penetrate far more than enough to disable someone. The advantages of a carbine are moot in a home invasion, they only become &quot;better&quot; for home defense once people disingenuously rope in militia hero LARP scenarios that take place outside of their home. The argument is also deeply tainted by politics because pro-2A guys realized that leftoids want to promote the effectiveness of shotguns as a reason why civilians &quot;don&#039;t need&quot; AR-15s.

Plenty of people and even some institutions running around with M855 these days for instance. I think if you did a statistical analysis of things and limit it to buckshot vs any 5.56 load then the shotgun probably has a notable benefit in terms of rounds to stop. If you limit that to Buckshot and quality defensive loads(nothing yaw dependent) the difference likely shrinks considerably and I seriously doubt either one averages over 2.

I had to refine the search a bit, but finally I had it scanning for explosives and cameras.<br>\u201cAnyone have a dedicated signal scanner?\u201d I asked, and Jori pulled out the small device. I flicked my IR laser on to point him in the right direction, and had him scan each camera my visor was highlighting. Thankfully, none of them were actively transmitting, but that didn\u2019t mean much. I tapped Javier and we used our thrust packs to fly to the cameras, using multimeters to check for a charge.

His Hurricane was a hellacious weapon, spitting out a bright blue tracer every third round.<br>\u201cBounding retreat!

I saw them again, and fired twenty threshers at the spot on reflex. I was rewarded with a series of flashes as a few found their targets, and I saw bodies illuminated by the small explosions. I ducked back in to cover before the return fire started skittering off my girder. I felt like a couldn\u2019t breath, my suit was too tight and my heart was trying to jump out of my chest.

I waited to see another muzzle flash, and willed my self to ignore the implications. I saw a dark silhouette floating up the cavern wall briefly illuminated by Jamar\u2019s tracers, and flicked my IR illuminator on for half a second. The man was wearing a dark brown jumpsuit, with a look of pure terror on his face when he realized he had been spotted. Two of my ten millimeter slugs caught him, one in the abdomen, and the other in the shoulder. I was sure his arm would have been blown off if it wasn\u2019t for the vacuum suit holding it in place.<br>\u201cLila, move up!

It hit exactly where the hiding hostiles were, and blew out the entire corner of the steel girders. I felt the pings of shrapnel bounce off the steel I was laying on top of, but the shooting seemed to have stopped.<br>\u201cEveryone alright?

We floated twenty meters farther up where the cargo door was open, and I went in first.<br>It seemed clear, my LIDAR wasn\u2019t picking up anything, and I waved the others in. I pinged a stack of containers with \u2018Tent?\u2019 to Jamar as he kept trying to get in touch with Gurna. I got an affirmative and found a small alcove to set up the pressure shelter. Javier took it off my back, and the shelter self inflated in fifteen seconds. Jamar had given up on the radio, and pulled Jori inside the airlock section.

This confliction is not aided by the lack of anthropologic, historic, or linguistic written record of the term&#039;s use; evidence points to the term first arising variously between Cumberland, Frederick, and Towson amongst others; these are generally geographically disparate places. The first written record can be found in a publishing in a local newspaper in Hagerstown dating From October the fourth of Year 366; however even in this article the term is used similarly to the way it is used today.

Patients become slightly paranoid, reporting feeling that something about the nearby environment is unsafe, unwelcoming, or plainly &quot;off&quot;, as if the Cross itself has &quot;rejected&quot; them. Distinguishing this paranoia from the similar, rational fear of the Cross that is begotten by its uncanny atmosphere is difficult. CAES Stage 1 paranoia is most clearly seen as distinct from the aforementioned feeling in that patients often describe these feelings in such a way as to personify the Cross as having emotions, however such descriptions may also occur in absence of CAES.

Patients report seeing visions and hearing voices of people they know; those with or who have had significant others occasionally report feeling the touch of a past or current partner. Patients may see multiple familiar people at once; patients may also perceive a hallucination of someone simultaneous to that person&#039;s real presence. However, whenever this occurs patients never report perceiving the hallucination and the real person at the same time. These hallucinations are differed from Walkers by a number of factors; patients report the hallucinations are odorless or odored similarly to the corresponding person, hallucinatory speech is either coherent past dialogue or fluent generated dialogue, and the hallucinations correspond to how the patient mentally perceives the individual regardless of their current dress. These hallucinations are reported as performing a number of tasks including walking, fleeing, observing something imperceptible to the patient, sitting on objects in the environment, and sometimes making terse interactions with the patient (which almost always fools the patient). Paranoia develops from Stage 1 in parallel as patients begin to believe that their loved ones, friends, or associates are out to maliciously trick or fool them; as a result a weighty, salient mistrust of them begins to arise. This is especially apparent when lost loved ones appear; the following revelation of their irreality creates a deep-seated loathing or anger.</span>", "filename": "1671244354900110", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672358383026844, "time": 1672358383, "md5": "cKqqTykCY2CfktidmtC93w==", "fsize": 587190, "resto": 56561631, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56564903, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:01:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56564873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56564873</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stage 3A: Hallucinations begin to concern individuals with whom the patient is totally unfamiliar. Patients report seeing lone individuals or groups of individuals; these individuals are characterized by historical/period dress and, if grouped, being a part of a uniform social group-- families, coworkers, miners, factory workers, and schoolchildren have all been named amongst others. These independent hallucinations, either lone individuals or groups, are termed &quot;units&quot;. Units always appear to be in the middle of a task or errand or are otherwise involved in something which the patient is a separate observer of. Patients may observe multiple units at once, but these units never interact with one another As well, these units also never superimpose on top of one another. Scholars have attempted to match descriptions of units to historical records of individuals but no connections have ever been identified. Units are the only type of person that is hallucinated this stage; hallucinations of personal associations always ceases. Similarly, paranoia shifts from these associates and back towards either the Stage 1 personified Cross or the units themselves/the demographic groups they represent. Patients believe that either the Cross or the units have turned from rejection to spite, and that they are being personally haunted out of malice.</span>", "filename": "1635152043084", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 697, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1672358518810100, "time": 1672358518, "md5": "zli6CEJILnhSHA4Pnwt9Fw==", "fsize": 102065, "resto": 56561631}, {"no": 56564922, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:03:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56564903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56564903</a><br>Stage 3B: Hallucinations of units persist, although the patient no longer appears as the observer in these hallucinations.

Multiplicity and non-superposition continues, although all units that the patient observes concurrently are reported as engaging in the same task of silent observation. Paranoid blame shifts from beings that might presently occupy the Cross to a conspiratorial anger towards what caused the situations of the Cross to arise, such as the Steelmen, Peacemakers, or the Appalachian Collapse itself. The strangest aspect of this blame is that patients always describe this anger as if they have personally wronged by these actors or elements on a direct, physical, level-- they do not hold these items accountable for setting off a causal chain that has resulted in the currency of time, but instead hold a vitriol that would only seem applicable had they been alive during the Collapse despite this demonstrably not being the case.", "filename": "1625506246050", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 723, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1672358624564406, "time": 1672358624, "md5": "Sq7EzycJczboKYQ2VfbTkg==", "fsize": 130079, "resto": 56561631}, {"no": 56564936, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:05:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56564903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56564903</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stage 4: Patient&#039;s sensory modes become so lucid so as to be nearly sterile or numb.

Patients report hallucinating Units once more, but that the units have ceased observation and instead appear themselves to be in severe distress. Reports include units appearing to be reeling for injury or harm; cowering, fleeing, screaming, clutching the face and other signs of clear anxiety or distress; and being laid upon nearby objects or terrain silent, bloodied, mutilated, or injured etc. In rare but vivid cases there are descriptions of extremely large units, upwards of hundreds or even thousands of people all wailing and fleeing; one patient reported they had &quot;glanced beneath themselves at a valley and seen a massive tide of people ebbing and flowing, unilaterally emanating a terrible chorus&quot; .

This feeling overtakes all others and corrodes into cognitive processes, leading to immobilization/incapacitation as the patient is too fearful to engage in any activity. This is frequently accompanied by vocalization of this fear, which is unceasing until the patient is either sedated, tired out, or damages their vocal facilities to the point of being unable to (not for lack of trying).

As he stood alone, the rain seemed to be his only companion, pitter-pattering on the spruce and soggy ground.

Careful not to make contact, the muzzle of a suppressed pistol was levied at the base of the peasant&#039;s skull.

Not only was he physically imposing; an armored chestplate and pauldrons prevented an easy, stealthy kill, but he was alert and active despite the weather. A disciplined opponent made the task of sneaking past difficult. The assassin weighed his options in the shadows of the trees as the sentry paced along, his lantern casting light into the treeline. A long-distance shot was compromised by the rain- water had already pooled into the open-faced emitter of the optic. Attempting to sneak past with the amount of ambient light was a tough task even for the stealthiest elf. Some kind of hand-to-hand option would prove difficult against an opponent of equal skill, not to mention the longsword at the sentry&#039;s hip.<br><br>With a sharp exhale, the assassin decided on his course of action. As still as a stone, he lay in wait as the sentry patrolled along the treeline. As the sentry grew closer, the assassin studied his prey. The well-worn scabbard and handle of his longsword denoted significant use. A emblem of a white rose was stitched to the inside of his left forearm- an insignia of some kind?

With brute strength and a shout, the knight broke the pin, attempting to slash at the assassin too late.

Rolling in the mud, the two struggled for the upper hand. A flurry of gut punches from the squire were met with a swift knee strike with nothing held back. The assassin captured one arm and rolled into an arm-bar, breaking it. The squire let out a desperate scream as a sharp, fiery pain shot up from his broken arm, burning white-hot in his mind&#039;s eye. A soggy arm quickly wrapped around his throat in a vice-like grip as the squire thrashed, uselessly attempting to break the assassin&#039;s choke. Within seconds, the squire blacked out.

Of course the effects of the collapse of the electrical grid, food distribution will also help. We should be able to easily kill over a 100 million of them.

Nonetheless obviously every effort should be made to coordinate a total strike against Russia with the sinking of their submarines by the hunter killers tailing them, sabotage, conventional assaults by airpower against their strategic bombers and silos etc to minimise casualties. I believe that the USA and Europe would ultimately emerge far stronger and unthreatened. This is important very important, the USA and Europe ARE civilisation. It would be a dark age and death for mankind if some rancid worthless stew like communist china or india became the dominant power in the world. All innovation and progress would die along with democracy, rule of law truth and freedom. The USA and EU and UK have more than enough nukes to destroy them as well if they utter a word and indeed that is what should be done.

Who knows.<br><br>Either way Scholz will do enough to please his voters, they don&#039;t care if shit arrives, just being told Germany is helping is enough. France has done basically nothing (for a country of its size). Other countries have tried to do stuff but have been blocked by Germany. Basically if you&#039;re not the Baltics, UK or USA the support has been minimal. Not entirely their fault but yeah.<br><br>Scholz at least has not actively said that Ukraine should surrender - unlike Macron. Who keeps on doing it. He said that NATO has to give &#039;security guarantees&#039; to Russia as a starting point for peace. Which is tantamount to going &#039;You were 100% right to be afraid of NATO, it is our fault, we forced you into this and your population was right to listen to your claims&#039;.
