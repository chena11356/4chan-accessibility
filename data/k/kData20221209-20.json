That&#039;s actually why I picked maritime patrol as an example. In contested waters, you&#039;ll have planes over those waters, it also being contested airspace. Losing a few planes creates significant gaps in coverage, and will happen. If you lose the drone that was shadowing ships, the C-130 has zero ability to attack those ships now. It&#039;s much easier and cheaper to saturate a land based theatre with sensors.<br><br>Okay I thought of another way to explain this. Most targets that Rapid Dragon is good against are in situations where almost any plane can launch some kind of missile at a target. Other planes have so much better capability without endangering critical logistical capability. The C-130 is too vulnerable and important to commit to combat.<br><br>Okay, let&#039;s imagine a scenario. It&#039;s going to be a situation where the enemy is temporarily vulnerable, play along. Some primary and secondary objectives are potential targets in an area defended by SAMs. You send F-35s in first for SEAD, assuming you have good intel on all SAM sites. The enemy will either lose their SAMs and/or they&#039;ll quickly pack them up and move them in reaction, meaning you&#039;ve cleared time for a bombing run. You&#039;d much rather have B-2s than C-130s, even if they&#039;re both carrying the same number of missiles. The C-130 can only blow its load at once, attacking all targets, primary and secondary, at once. The B-2 can target the primary targets, expend a few missiles, wait for confirmation, and if your missiles got surprise intercepted then it&#039;s still possible to try again. The F-35s can take care of the surprise missile defense system, and the B-2 tries again.

Soldiers on both sides are also looking for safe places to hide equipment caches and are also looking for supplies, and unlike average civillians, they have the expertise and tools to get into those bunkers you see being built on YT. IMO, if you&#039;re in a warzone and cannot get out for years on end, best thing to do is find a inactive mineshaft or quarry, prep yourself to move farther into the mineshaft as needed e.g. quick erecting barriers and quickly constructed traps in reinforced positions further into the mine, and set yourself up to live deep underground in the mine for a long-ass while. YT has tons of videos on mines and mineshaft exploration. It&#039;s a project but if you can pull it off and manage to even have an underground aquafer access, it&#039;s the best way to go, especially if you have masonry and carpentry skills.<br><br>If you want to see how it&#039;s done correctly, look at how the Finnish and Swedish build their bunkers.
