You also have a side arm with a few extra reloads as well. Your EDC bag and shit are also in the vehicle. Suddenly a dense fog surrounds you and when you make it through you are now in France. The year is between 1764 and 1767, luckily the french peasants you encounter all speak your native language too. You are taken to some fancy people and they want you to hunt a beast prowling the country side. If you can slay the beast you will get either a trad french waifu or help to return to any year you want<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; the beast was generally described as a wolf-like canine with a tall, lean frame capable of taking great strides. It was said to be the size of a calf, a cow, or, in some cases, a horse. It had an elongated head similar to that of a greyhound, with a flattened snout, pointed ears, and a wide mouth sitting atop a broad chest. The beast&#039;s tail was also reported to have been notably longer than a wolf&#039;s, with a prominent tuft at the end. The beast&#039;s fur was described as tawny or russet in color but its back was streaked with black, and a white heart-shaped pattern was noted on its underbelly</span><br>What is your rifle and sidearm?

Theres no argument for russian optics. Side rail is also a trivial matter. There are actually 4,5 or more companies making SVD spec picatinny side mounts. Nothing modular like RS regulate though. I think the SAG side rail (not the chassis) is one of the better side rails. The chassis is also good though and I think they make them in MLAWK now. The problem with the military SVD (my wife) is that 24&quot; pencil barrel. This is the most glaring issue in 2022. Dragunov was tasked to make the gun as long as the PU mosin, so the barrel is skinny to keep it light which was also a requirement. The compromise is not worth it from 2022 perspective where 16, 18, and 20&quot; barrels are most popular for 308 platforms. A thicker barrel is almost entirely worth the detrackors. Im not sure what advancements in fast burning powder are available for 54r. But I think the most popular SVD barrels are 24&quot; (SVD) 22&quot; (SVDS and SVDM) and 20&quot; (Tigr) but the tigr is also available in the other two, and maybe more perhaps.
