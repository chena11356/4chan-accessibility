Every country has their own interests. Some of those interests align with each other and they can work together. The U.S. maintains diplomacy with Ukraine since it felled and the U.S. also signed a treaty with them in exchange for their sovereignty being protected by giving away their nukes(Ukraine had the third largest stockpiles btw). In which case, the U.S. saw potential in Ukraine and also feel for the country because its trying to pull away from russian sphere of influence along with thinking the invasion of crimea and the artificial set up of the rebels to be retarded. Aside from thinking that the russians are retarded in not letting their neighbors thrive, they view Ukraine to have alot of potential in being a geopolitical ally in the region and can offer to be an alternative to russian gas in europe. Which will lead to them being less reliant on russia and decrease their soft power over the region. Which will lead to america increasing its soft power. Russia&#039;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014/2022 solidifies NATO&#039;s existence along with increasing the soft power of america. Overall, they think the invasion was retarded and feel for Ukraine in trying to westernize itself while being under the russian teeth. But there is always other geopolitical interests that may prove to be useful too and fuel the support. Welcome to geopolitics, faggots. Russia also has its own geopolitcal interests, but every country that has a strong russian influence will always turn to shit. Which is why you see many countries joining NATO after the soviets fell. Because everything the russians touch will always be shit. Russia&#039;s soft power does not lead to strive. Only fools will mistake them to lead to salvation. Do not mistake their intent, for all will be a slave to the russian bear and your will not be happy.", "time": 1675895902, "resto": 57062733}, {"no": 57080304, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)17:40:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57064632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57064632</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lethal chem loads on vog17 shells</span><br>c-can I load it into the gmg still?", "filename": "dbb3ka4-31cdf9be-89a7-43f1-9085-159e1a94a74d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675896017000205, "time": 1675896017, "md5": "gJFjq8fsGoKsSnPJJHOZig==", "fsize": 207246, "resto": 57062733}, {"no": 57080354, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)17:44:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57080279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57080279</a><br>Russia cannot escape the 19th century Imperialist mindset, it&#039;s why all of their districts outside of Moscow and Saint Petersburg are such decrepit shitholes.<br><br>If you are part of Russian Flyover country the only thing they want to give you is the bare minimum you need to survive and keep providing whatever resource they need from you.<br><br>They don&#039;t want you to prosper because if you prosper you might decide you don&#039;t need Moscow anymore.<br><br>It&#039;s the same concept behind giving people on Welfare just enough money so they can live to keep voting for the guys who give them welfare.

South Africa isn&#039;t a recently colonised tropical african shithole. The Afrikaner people don&#039;t have a mother country to return to, and the Anglos here are much more alienated from the anglosphere than for example the Rhodesians were, most of whom had British citizenship or had parents with British citizenship. Secondly, most of the country is arid or mild temperate, so much less inhospitable to Europeans than hot lowland tropical regions with malaria. <br><br>I think it&#039;ll either the Cape will secede (essentially the south western part of the country) and the rest will descend further into a dysfunctional shithole, or the entire country will collapse and later coalesce into a Cape state (Western Cape, Northern Cape and Western half of the Eastern Cape) and a state comprising the highveld region (including Gauteng) and the Freestate, with the eastern half of the Eastern Cape, most of KZN and the low lying parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo reverting back to deep Africa since they have climates amenable to the African way of life and strong ethnic groups. These places wil probably be contested frontier territory. <br><br>The Cape state will probably be multi ethic and mulatto dominated and be a bit like Brazil, the Highveld state will be pretty chaotic, since the centre of power would be Gauteng, and the goal would be to keep control of the farmland and mineral resources in the region. There aren&#039;t many strong black tribal identities in region, and the Afrikaners are likely too few and too scattered to unite and exert power. What I suspect will happen is that a cosmopolitan black elite will try to keep control of the region by using the Afrikaners as a sort of janissary class to control the lower classes and keep some of the infrastructure going to maintain control.", "time": 1675852920, "resto": 57069338}, {"no": 57074182, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)08:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57073192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57073192</a><br>bedankt voor de uitleg <br>de Afrikaner hebben altijd een thuis in de lage landen maar ik denk niet dat ze hier goed zouden aarden in dit koude, natte en vooral stedelijke gebied", "time": 1675861293, "resto": 57069338}, {"no": 57075541, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:44:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "They weren&#039;t that isolated.

For another example you take a non free floated firearm and exert force onto the structural parts then you&#039;ll experience POI shifts from where you&#039;re sighted, like with the M4s that don&#039;t have a FF handgrip. What free floating the barrel does is it makes it so you&#039;re dealing only with barrel resonance that is isolated from the rest of the gun and by extension the shooter&#039;s grip. If the foregrip can deal with the forces of resting on a bipod, being held at different points which can shift the resonance node of the barrel and being pushed up against a window then that increases accuracy. However when you&#039;re looking at an autocannon installation that doesn&#039;t really apply since they&#039;re not resting the cannon against surfaces and the only load path is going into the mount. What that stiffener structure does is that it makes the barrel&#039;s virtual diameter a little bigger in that it acts like a pretend taper barrel.

Over 100 stitches to get all that put back together after it was cleaned very thoroughly in an emergency room. It was an accident. His cat panicked over getting picked up in an encounter with a dog and just went apeshit on him, probably confused as to who or what was attacking him. A really sweet cat that never hurt anyone, including me, before or after. But, that one incident was insane. He lost so much blood the hospital considered giving him a transfusion.<br><br>I was carrying a young kitten one day, calm &amp; cozy &amp; half asleep in my arms. A dog ran into the room and jumped at him. He turned into a 2 pound demon, clawed his way out of my arms, up my chest, across my face and set all his claws into my scalp when he got on top of my head. I am here to witness that hurt like fucking hell, and took a couple days of cleaning &amp; disinfecting all he wounds to make sure they could heal instead of turning infected.<br><br>I used to do feline rescue. The feral &amp; semi-feral cats were less dangerous because I expected it and prepared for them to freak out, and still I&#039;ve taken claws and bites through heavy protection.

If I still didn&#039;t acknowledge her, she&#039;d then slowly sink the claws on both of her front paws into my thigh. She would straight up escalate until I finally paid attention to her.

Cats figure it out quickly and temper their behavior. If they draw blood, even a small amount, touch their nose with a drop. Just a single small drop.

By comparison, the low-set carousel autoloaders of T-64, T-72, and T-80 are a much safer form of ammo stowage due to keeping the dangerous ammo very low in the hull.

There are 360+ mods that add 30+ High-quality long quests (tens of hours), a ton of bug patches and fixes, and 4 major campaigns (dozens of hours) - Tales of the Commonwealth, Thuggysmurf mods, and Sim Settlements 2 (SS2). SS2 functionally alone makes FO4 an entirely new game and one that doesn&#039;t suck. Thuggysmurf mods either replace or augment the entire main campaign, depending on how you want to play the game. I personally use version 104.<br><br>The survival mode that comes with this mod collection is savage. You must drink, eat, and sleep else you take damage; infections are real and common, bleed damage / break damage occurs, etc. Nasty. <br><br>About personal vertibird: <br>With no fast travel in survival mode, the game is difficult. You&#039;ll be local to Sanctuary and a few other places until you&#039;ve sufficiently progressed to getting blueprint + parts for a vertibird. Once you have a vertibird, you can use it as a way to travel (30 minute max travel time to cross the map). Get into a pinch? Call in air support. Settlement under attack? Load up your 4-6+ companions and become a QRF, dropping into a combat zone with battle-hardened troops. <br><br>Bottom line: A Storywealth + personal vertibird gets you a settlement building, hardcore survival-focused FPS RPG with newly written main quests and oodles of new functionality. Turning off fast travel and using the personal vertibird is game changing - nothing like walking to new places and calling in a QRF team when things get hairy. Survival is not guaranteed. For me personally, the act of building settlements, securing food / water / shelter, getting settlers, and then battling disease and raiders is truly rewarding and a real experience to behold.", "time": 1675900150, "resto": 57078374}, {"no": 57081426, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57081188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57081188</a><br>Fallout 4&#039;s biggest weakness by far is the story, which is even more nonsensical than 3&#039;s and does an even worse job of establishing player investment.

Reunification used to be talked about only in the context of a war of conquest, and anything else was essentially verboten, but these days peaceful and mutual reunification is talked about more like an eventuality in some vague far off time. Kim was educated oversees, and signs point to him not wanting to manage the decline of his people into greater misery and while he&#039;s obviously not trusting of outsiders (except for Trump and Dennis Rodman weirdly) he also seems able to see NK&#039;s historical way of doing things isnt in it&#039;s best interests long term.<br>In the last five to ten years there has actually been unprecedented tension between NK and it&#039;s &quot;Greatest Ally&quot;, mostly chest beating and troop movements making each other uncomfortable, but there&#039;s also been rumors that the Nuclear program is considered a deterrent against China (Perhaps invading them to &quot;stabilize a situation&quot; or some shit you know how commies talk) and not against the United states, Japan, or the South. <br>The &quot;War&quot;, the inevitable war with the south, is now joked about where before it was deadly serious. <br><br>Also, this is rather subjective, but while many public statements have been made about cracking down, the black market for southern media has actually exploded over the last ten years due to lax enforcement. Some speculate this is actually on purpose, to try to acclimate people to the idea of less hostility with the South.

You\u2019re going to see some basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, angles, and perimeter, along with the occasional time and distance word problem and potentially some basic probability.<br><br>Section 2: RCT (Reading Comprehension Test): Again, really straightforward stuff. You read a passage of text and are given options of sentences only one of which is totally true based on the text given above. Most will seem true but, only one can actually be derived from the provided passage.<br><br>Section 3: MCT (Mechanical Comprehension Test): The questions in this section are similar to what would find in an intro to physics class. Brush up on your knowledge of basic physics and how it relates to velocity, volume, and pressure as well as the mechanics of simple machines when it comes to gears, electricity, and weight distribution.<br><br>Section 4: ANIT (Aviation and Nautical Information Test): You guessed it!

You basically get to do a flight simulation. You\u2019ll be given a flight mock-up flight console with a throttle and joystick along with a headset. You\u2019ll also get a map that you\u2019ll need to study before guiding an airplane around on a screen. For a more detailed of explanation of this section check out our full-length article of the different sections of the ASTB called ASTB Test Layout.<br><br>Section 7: BI-RV (Biographical Inventory with Response Validation): This is the part of the ASTB that you can complete from any computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that you complete this section prior to writing the rest of the ASTB. All it is, is a questionnaire about your previous experiences and successes or achievements with aviation. Like section 5 you really can\u2019t prepare for this section \u2013 just answer honestly as there aren\u2019t any real right or wrong responses.<br><br>IOW, bitch you should have prepared lel.

And even if it&#039;s just because the Ukies will only get the A5 variant of the Leopard 1 which means Thermal Vision and lots of other shit because the fire control is the same as the one of the Leopard 2 A4 (minus its gun stabilizer)<br>1) While the 105mm might not be up to date anymore there&#039;s still ammo available that CAN penetrate T-72s etc from the frontal arc. Such ammo was developed first by the Israelis in the early 80s after their first encounters with (then) impenetratable T-72s<br>2) Thanks to the fielding of the 105mm Stryker ther has also been some ammo development in this century<br>3) The Leopard 1 was NEVER meant to slug it out. Even the T-54/55 series 100mm gun could penetrate it, even before the advent of rifled gun capable APFSDS ammo. The entire survical concept of the Leopard 1 is about being small (harder to be seen and aimed at) and nimble (power to weight aint up to date anymore compared with M1 and Leo-2 but still at least decent)<br>4) I&#039;m pretty sure nobody will use these Leopard-1s mostly for tank vs. tank battle. They will fill a very specific nieche against light and light armored vehicles which are either a) too heavily armored for auto cannons / MGs of other vehicles, b) not valuable enough to waste an ATGM on them or c) too far away for other weapons aside from ATGMs.<br>5) Giving the Ukies the Leopard 1 in reasonable numbers will enable them to free more modern and/or heavier armored and/or heavier hitting tanks for the real brute tank vs. tank fighting. <br><br>Most of you guys just don&#039;t think enough about this.

Basically in a situation where you need something big enough to drop a wounded steer or a dog at 100 yards, but don&#039;t need more than 5 rounds on tap. It&#039;s something you&#039;re carrying lashed to your ATV or in a saddle scabbard on your horse, because a 20&quot; .357 lever doesn&#039;t fit as well/safely there but works admirably as a truck gun.

They&#039;re also fun as fuck on the range, especially if you engrave &quot;I cast fireball&quot; on the action. Which is the only acceptable use of the really heavy-bore shit. <br>I could also see an argument for using something like screwdriver rounds out of a .44mag for home defense, but at that point I&#039;m just using a shorty shotgun or suppressed pistol if I&#039;m gonna cash in a stamp for it.<br><br><a href=\"#p57085918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57085918</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A revolver or a pistol with a detachable stock like people used back in the day just seems to make more sense.</span><br>Stocked revolvers fucking suck.

It has some neat features like being able to record your shots as well as a jack for a microphone and the ability to synch audio to the video. It can also record in color with enough white light. It also automatically adjusts the frame rate based on how much IR it is receiving. I guess this was done to improve performance in low light, but it\u2019s honestly kind of annoying. It has a QD feature. You clamp the sleeve to the scope, and the clip on attaches to the sleeve with some lugs and a latch. It seems to be worth the $220 I paid for it. The sensor is far and away better than the night fox cape. The screen resolution is also much higher, and when there is plenty of IR it appears to have a much smoother image even though the manual lists it at 30 fps.

This also cuts down on scent and other potential target indicators like infra red light from a fire or lingering thermal trace on any cooking site and equipment.<br><br>Additionally, if you&#039;re shooting for maximum travel on minimum weight you&#039;re going to want to sleep during the day when it&#039;s warmer (lighter sleeping system) and walk at night (moving around will keep you warmer, and you can moderate your pace and layers in tandem to avoid excessive cycling of water or carrying unnecessary material) - just don&#039;t get lost or carry a garmin in the weight you saved by cutting down your sleep system. You won&#039;t get nice views as you move, but you&#039;ll be more subtle, have a less crowded trail, and move faster which are all good things if you&#039;re in a situation that&#039;s more /k/ than /out/.<br><br>Another consideration completely missed by this list is internal organization of the pack, this is important for minimizing time taken in temporary halts. big empty bags without mesh pockets are dumb<br><br>this list is built for a physical invalid walking on meticulously curated trails on dayhikes or 1.5 day hikes.", "time": 1675891964, "resto": 57072600}, {"no": 57079505, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)16:40:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57074446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57074446</a><br>wear loose pants without underwear. it&#039;s called going commando for a reason.

A sawyer squeeze mini, or something. They are cheap, extremely lightweight, bomb proof, and quick. Get smartwool briefs, or something with a high merino wool blend, theyre worth every cent. Also, you should get some proper trail running shoes or light boots. Road runners will disintegrate if you&#039;re moving through rugged terrain. <br><br>Besides that, I would say you really need to try using some of this stuff in the field. A common folly is people overcorrecting when it comes to weight reductions (see &quot;stupid light&quot;). Comfort and convenience are really important. Many people carry 2-person tents even when solo. The weight increase is tolerable relative to a 1P, and the extra space makes a HUGE difference especially when you have wet gear and need to spread out a bit. Also, a bigger cooking pot. I carry the TOAKS 1600ml. I can actually cook meals in it, and also in a &quot;bugout&quot; situation you could boil a lot more water. An nice inflatable sleeping pad is a big investment, and it is one more thing to break/pop, but good sleep is priceless. Those foam pads dont work for many people, I do use them. These are all just suggestions, you may be perfectly happy with all of this gear. I can tell you&#039;ve done a lot of research and have made good choices (S-tier pick for packliner btw), but there really is no substitute for just getting out there.

Cold Steel had some pretty cringe marketing campaigns but they\u00b4ve aways made solid knives. These Demkos are not really flippers though, and you mentioned that in your first post. Another suggestion along those lines is the Benchmade Mini-Adamas in CPM cruwear steel. The Axis lock flips like a maniac and it\u00b4ll be a better finished knife than the Cold Steel Demko ones, and it has a superior, deep carry clip.<br><br>The general problem with this &quot;overbuilt&quot; folders is not even size, but weight. Carrying a knife in the pocket makes every single ounce count a lot. The knife tilts a lot when it is heavier. I generally stay away from folders that weight more than 4 oz. Any heavier than that, I think it is more suitable for belt carry. Others will carry an 8 ounce knife in their pocket and forget its there.<br><br>I asked if you were planning on sharpening it yourself because of your choice of steel, this is an entire can of worms with many many variables. In the most basic of terms, the higher a supersteel is rated for cutlery, the longer it will retain its edge, and the harder it is going to be for a novice to sharpen. Edge retention and ease of sharpening vary dramatically between knife steels. But even a supersteel blade will eventually get dull. This aspect must be carefully considered, and it is often disregarded.

Wanna say it was uranium vanadium and they didn&#039;t disclose the third metal. Maybe niobium. I&#039;m still phone posting so I&#039;ll also post that too if the thread lives. It&#039;s also pretty damn old. And I could not tell you if any of that research made it into actual use.

If you don&#039;t have the firepower to mass for a large breakthrough operation, have the numbers to sustain that fight and exploit any advantage/repel the counter-attack, and have the logistics to keep it going, then any war of this magnitude will break down into static &quot;trench&quot; warfare. Just look at the Iran-Iraq war as a horrific example of that.</span><br>Exactly what point are you trying to make here? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Insurgents fight and hide amongst a civilian population that is either sympathetic to your cause or is unsupportive to the COIN force on account of not wanting their heads being chopped off in the middle of the night for ratting out insurgents. Even these guys will have safehouses, caches, and fighting loads that they can quickly don and doff. Guerrilla fighters on the other hand typically fight away from population centers and generally have enough firepower and bodies to temporarily decisively engage COIN forces, the VC and more specifically the NVA are good examples of this. </span><br>So boogtard shit that is completely unrelated to this discussion.<br><br><a href=\"#p57058148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57058148</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An American civil conflict would very quickly transform into an insurgency, with small teams hitting soft targets with varying forms of attack.</span><br>Yeah, like the Troubles.

There&#039;s also hollowpoints if you&#039;re going to apply it to a dedicated home defense role, Wolf makes those too.<br><br>Generally best ammo is between Wolf and Golden Tiger.

The police carbine has a modern rail which allows one to mount a light further up the front end of the rifle and not cast a gnarly shadow off the barrel. Assuming both had the same optic, most people would agree that the carbine setup with the Bendy Bill rail is better.
