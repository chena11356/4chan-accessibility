I think this is in part why nobody bothered to make particularly special AP shells for naval artillery.

I assumed, given this is 4chins and not a university classroom people just wanted gross overgeneralizations rather than rigorous mathematics but I guess I assumed wrong, apologies. Unfortunately, Frank and Zook&#039;s papers are behind a paywall but you&#039;d be looking for &quot;ENERGY-EFFICIENT PENETRATION AND PERFORATION OF TARGETS IN THE HYPERVELOCITY REGIME&quot; from 1987, published in the Journal of Impact Engineering. Here is a plot of the penetration depth vs velocity I whipped up in Desmos using the S2 formula, which assumes Y = H, not the best assumption but it&#039;s better than assuming a non-eroding projectile. Green line is density = 19000 kg/m^3 and orange line is density = 25000 kg/m^3. I&#039;ve placed an arbitrary line at V = 1400 m/s to show a possible penetrator velocity for tank guns. I hold the penetrator mass steady at 5 kg and a diameter of 28 mm, typical-ish values for APFSDS rounds. The target is set to be a RHA steel target. The red line is the Odermatt equation for Tungsten penetrators at density = 19000 kg/m^3 for reference, using the same penetrator dimensions and approximately the same steel. The theoretical result doesn&#039;t match the physical result because of the Y = H assumption being off but at you can see the theory is reasonable in shape and values compared to an empirical formula. You see here that for the same sectional density (A is constant and m is constant) you get two different penetration curves and that above a certain impact velocity (in this case 982 m/s), density influences the penetration less than the length, thus making length king. Over 8,224 m/s however, density once again becomes king as the initial advantage in penetration of the less dense projectile is overcome by the higher slope past the hydrodynamic limit (the point where the graphs start to flatten out).", "filename": "1647377478820", "ext": ".png", "w": 912, "h": 250, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 34, "tim": 1671185839006417, "time": 1671185839, "md5": "ocjS48AASfdjGfkXFykIHQ==", "fsize": 47842, "resto": 56404241}, {"no": 56417110, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)05:27:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56416757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416757</a><br>You&#039;d get better performance but given the low velocity the benefit might honestly be marginal assuming it hits properly.

And since you&#039;re actually interested in the subject and do want to talk about it on a higher level here let me add some context to my overgeneralization. When talking about armor penetration, it&#039;s really impossible to narrow down to a single most important factor because everything ties together. When I say length and L/D is king, really it&#039;s semantics as this conclusion is derived from a very restrictive set of assumptions that everything apart from length and density is unchanged and we&#039;re firing at a perpendicular, infinite target. In the real world at this specific range of velocities where the behaviors are as I described, materials have more benefits than just density and the range of impact velocities might not fit the restrictions I&#039;ve placed so this conclusion is really altogether not that relevant, just as sweeping conclusions like &quot;sectional density is king&quot; are similarly irrelevant. A lot more considerations come into play too, can you even load such a long round, will the round bend or break due to lateral loads, do denser materials have other benefits that might make them favorable etc. and it becomes a balancing act as any engineering problem. Anyways, the materials I&#039;ve presented you with are just really meant as a primer, the subject is quite complex after all and I can&#039;t possibly write an exhaustive list of references on the subject.

When organized warfare was advanced to a more Napoleonic model with discrete uniform units and a chain of command, it became militarily a bad habit to let your troops run around and pillage, your enemy will attack you while you&#039;re raping.

It&#039;s not really designed to stop rape so much as keep the troops in line and where they belong at all times. You see a lot of &#039;don&#039;t mix with the locals&#039; and camping outside of towns they liberate to stop fraternization.

Maneuver warfare and deep battle is atavism of WWII and outdated in the year 2022. WWII has very specific strategic deployment. Forces consisted from high - low mix. 10% of armored and mechanised divisions and 90% of foot slooging horse cart drawing infantry difisons. With vastly different mobility and combat strength in unprepared battle. This created naturallly scenario of operation: armored division circling and attacking line of communications of infantry instead if attacking them head on. But Germans and their horse carts are no more. You can&#039;t cosplay WWII, that&#039;s era gone. Low tier armed forces today have car based mobility too, Ukraine has vast net of hard paved roads (thing unheard in the USSR 1941 where combat happened) and can move operationally at sonic speeds. If anything modern armored brigade moves slower than militia mounted on technicals. There is no inherit advantage of amored division in maneuver that promotes succeus in scenario of deep strike and encirclement. Operation of encirclement is circumstantial not guaranteed success.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But American&#039;s used deep strike during 1991 and 2003 in Iraq! We want play like big boys too, reeeee!</span><br>Things is US had air supremacy, their Air Force isolated battlefield and suppressed enemy ability to maneuver. Thus again creating disparity in maneuver like in WWII (tank and Studebaker truck vs horse cart) and making maneuver Great Again. But guees what? Russian Air Force can&#039;t isolate battlefield, they cope with FFAR loft launches without crossing frontline.<br><br>2. Russian BTG structure is very bad for maneuver warfare. BTG is essentially brigade that had everything above battalion cut off. BTG has no resupply capability, not engineering support to breach obstacles and river, not enough infantry to provide all around rear security of BTG HQ elements and conduct capture of urbanized strong points.", "filename": "Hf_7_Stahlfeldwagen_205_ID", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671167024928377, "time": 1671167024, "md5": "vKVjWP5CEoooDb95J7rHag==", "fsize": 49400, "resto": 56415077}, {"no": 56415506, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)00:28:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56415127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415127</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ostnesibly try to minimize casualties taken</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;attack collapses due to unsustainable casualties rendering attacking units combat-incapable</span>", "time": 1671168486, "resto": 56415077}, {"no": 56415627, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)00:42:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56415323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415323</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;outdated</span><br><br>Yeah, uh, tell that to literally every single modern army in existence.

Look at the initial push for Kiew as an example. Even though the plan to attack Hostomel airport to create a solid foothold right next to one of the major operational targets was good, it was too obvious and had too few troops actually committed to secure the corridor in the initial attack. You can also be sure that russian attacks on the country had been wargamed a gazillion times to find out what the Russians would likely do. The only way to make it viable would have been to drop substantial amounts of VDV on every chokepoint along the MSR to Hostomel and have support YOLO rush down the road to reinforce the initial wave of paratroopers. I personally do not think that the Russians even had enough helicopters to pull this off. <br>Additionally they attacked along multiple axis, committing too few troops per objective.

I think I&#039;m going to get a .22lr suppressor for hunting, then a PCP, despite the fact that the other way around would probably make more sense. Wait times for stamps are a bitch, though, so the sooner I start the process, the better. I have other air rifles, though, so it&#039;s a niche already partially filled. One partially filled by the Swarm, which I wish were smaller, but I love the quick loading. The other partially filled by the 1377, which I wish was mag fed, a pcp, and .22. You know, basically a Marauder with a stock.<br><br>I figure that buying a marauder with a decent scope will allow me to fill a role with what would otherwise would only be able to be filled by a takedown or an SBR. Pistols (firearms) wouldn&#039;t fill the role either as semi auto .22lr pistols are illegal to hunt with in this state despite semi auto .22lr rifles being totally fine. Bring a Marauder in a small hard (or well padded) case and if no foxes turn up while I&#039;m lugging around my .223, I can at least take it out to shoot some squirrels or maybe even groundhogs. Solves a problem I have, choosing what to take on a specific day. I can take a semi auto .22lr rifle as well as a .223 for fox, but it&#039;s hell on the back having to also bring all my other junk, including a little take-down seat if it&#039;s wet and cold out.<br><br><a href=\"#p56416316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416316</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for a PCP ban</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for an air rifle ban</span><br>Would be news to me.

ARs and other modern military style rifles were a thing, but they were a niche like any other whereas now they are sort of the defacto standard. I think there&#039;s five main reasons why the AR became as popular as it is today:<br>1) the Clinton AWB, and laws like it, made people REALLY want what the gov said that they couldn&#039;t have. Plenty of people who previously didn&#039;t really care one way or the other about ARs suddenly wanted one because this might be their last chance to get one.<br>2) As the market grew ARs became inexpensive. The fact that they are so modular meant that people could buy one part-by-part as they could afford.<br>3) They are available in a variety of calibers and configurations which mean they are honestly a very practical suggestion for a variety of applications, from target shooting to hunting to defense.<br>4) They are honestly very simple to use. Accessible is another way to describe it: Recoil is light, manual of arms is simple, gun is easy to clean, work on, and modify. Ammo is relatively inexpensive compared to other calibers. It is beginner-friendly.<br>5) It&#039;s appearance in media, i.e. games and action movies.

I personally believe the use of lasers in a indiscriminate attack warrants a nuclear response for a nation state and if a terrorist uses a laser in any fashion it should carry a life sentence.", "time": 1671043913, "resto": 56391242}, {"no": 56396666, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:53:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56396531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56396531</a><br>Kek", "time": 1671044020, "resto": 56391242}, {"no": 56396695, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56392195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56392195</a>", "filename": "6E169213-70E7-4AAC-A249-AF57BEBE50C0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 738, "tn_w": 121, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671044209496980, "time": 1671044209, "md5": "uUnCkQPrTUX+LayvWdXL8A==", "fsize": 95833, "resto": 56391242}, {"no": 56396739, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)14:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Styropyro made a video of a modified tattoo removal gun that fired a pulse of a laser instead of a continuous beam and it had a shotgun scatter like effect which he claimed could blind a portion of a football stadium with just one burst from distance.

Pashtun Sultan of the Sur Empire, Sher Shah Suri defeated the Indian Hindu Rajputs under Puran Mal. The Afghan Pashtun Sunnis who had war elephants slaughtered the Indian Rajput Hindus including Puran Mal. The surviving Indian Rajput Hindu women and children were enslaved, among them were 3 of Puran Mal&#039;s nephews or sons who were castrated and became eunuchs so that their family line would not continue while Puran Mal&#039;s daughter was enslaved as a dancing girl as were other Hindu girls who were captured.[70]<br><br>The Turkic and Iranian Persian Twelver Shia Muslim royal family ruling the Oudh (Awadh) state in India obtained their eunuchs (khwajasarais) through crushing Hindu rebellions by their Indian Hindu subjects that they ruled, massacring Hindu men and enslaving the Hindu women and children with the South Asian Indian Hindu boys being castrated and sent into the harems for service as eunuchs. Jawahir Ali was a eunuch of Oudh state who was born a Hindu. The rulers of Oudh (Awadh) state were Twelver Shia while Rajput Hindus made up most of the local cultivator landholding rajas. The Hindu Rajas of Khairabad rebelled since they refused to pay taxes to the Twelver Shia district administrator Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan so Nawab Muhammad Ali defeated the Hindus in battle and the Muslim historian Muhammad Faiz Bakhsh recorded in his book Tarikh Farahbakhsh that Muhammad Ali sent &quot;hundreds of unbelievers (Hindus) to hell&quot;, enslaving their children and women and castrated the Hindu boys among the children. Adult Hindu women, Hindu girls, and Hindu boys like Jawahir Ali were enslaved by their Twelver Shia ruler. One Hindu boy died from being castrated but the rest of the Hindu boys including Jawahir Ali survived the castration and entered Muhammad Ali&#039;s service as eunuchs.", "time": 1671163690, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56414824, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:09:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56414558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414558</a><br><a href=\"#p56414811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414811</a><br>https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpres<wbr>sebooks/view?docId=ft0f59n6r9&amp;chunk<wbr>.id=d0e12707&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=uc<wbr>press;query=russia<br><br>The court eunuchs served as another interface between Hinduism and Shi\u2018ism. The nawabs and their begams enslaved these boys, most often sons of Hindu Rajput warriors captured in battles with the central government, castrating them and bringing them up in their own households. Owing to the patrimonial nature of the Awadh state, the notables often entrusted their eunuchs with official duties, such as managing their owners&#039; estates or even tax-farming entire provinces, transforming them into a mamluk (slave-ruler) substratum of the government. The slave eunuch officials accumulated vast properties that legally belonged to their masters, although they often could influence the disposition of their property, maintaining close ties to their Hindu relatives. When, for instance, a British subject pressed claims against the great tax-farmer Almas \u2018Ali Khan, whom Nawab Sacadat \u2018Ali Khan owned, the ruler refused to intervene, on the grounds that if he put too much pressure on him the eunuch might transfer his property to Bahu Begam (the nawab&#039;s mother) in Faizabad, resulting in a serious loss to the nawab.[5]<br><br>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id<wbr>=1lhbDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT183&amp;lpg=PT183&amp;dq<wbr>=rajput+castrated+awadh+families&amp;so<wbr>urce=bl&amp;ots=YFAoTV81ZB&amp;sig=ACfU3U1B<wbr>fCXGyCMMUWS4692jO0TntvdtOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa<wbr>=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-7pL8k9n7AhWX8rsIHai<wbr>TDocQ6AF6BAguEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=rajput<wbr>%20castrated%20awadh%20families&amp;f=f<wbr>alse<br><br>Many of the eunuchs were warriors from Rajput families who were captured in the battles.

Sher Shah gave the daughter of Puran Mal to some itinerant minstrels (bazigars) that they might make her dance in the bazaars, and ordered the boys to be castrated, so that the race of the oppressors (i.e. the Hindus) might not increase.\u201d", "filename": "India", "ext": ".png", "w": 1243, "h": 1477, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671163813380795, "time": 1671163813, "md5": "PE1HHZZQAPGaQ9oqe0wUJw==", "fsize": 299612, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56414850, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:11:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56414558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414558</a><br><a href=\"#p56414811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414811</a><br><a href=\"#p56414824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414824</a><br><a href=\"#p56414840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414840</a><br>https://www.tornosindia.com/role-of<wbr>-eunuchs-in-muharram-of-awadh/<br><br>The rulers were always on the lookout of trustworthy eunuchs.

Nonetheless, in a later letter to her sister, she avoided eating pork and dreaded attending church, stressing that she remained Muslim in secret.[4] She had given birth to a son, Heinrich, in Aden in December 1866; he died in France en route to Germany in the summer of 1867.[5]</span><br><br>This is the Muslim princess&#039;s autobiography.<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00ruetgoog/page/n11<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00stragoog/page/n9<br><br>Her descendants with the Christian German man still live in Florida in the US I&#039;ve heard.", "filename": "Salma_bent_said", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 322, "h": 468, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671169351366973, "time": 1671169351, "md5": "GppG639XxUMv7QbQc/dt7A==", "fsize": 69055, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56415635, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)00:43:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56415520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415520</a><br><a href=\"#p56415527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415527</a><br><a href=\"#p56415538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415538</a><br><a href=\"#p56415548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415548</a><br><a href=\"#p56415559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415559</a><br><a href=\"#p56415567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415567</a><br><a href=\"#p56415587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415587</a><br><a href=\"#p56415597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415597</a><br><a href=\"#p56415608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415608</a><br><a href=\"#p56415615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415615</a><br><a href=\"#p56415620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415620</a><br><a href=\"#p56415626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415626</a><br>https://archived.moe/his/thread/102<wbr>49882/#q10252747<br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252747</span><br><br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252747</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252754</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252705</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252738</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252742</span><br>England conquered Malaysia, Iraq, Egypt, Sudan and the Arab Emirates of the Persian Gulf.<br><br>British forces were outnumbered by Gulf Arabs but slaughtered the Gulf Arab forces with a 1,000:5 casualty ratio, destroyed their navy and subjugated them.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirac<wbr>y_in_the_Persian_Gulf#1819%E2%80%93<wbr>1820_expedition<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans<wbr>port_vessels_for_the_British_campai<wbr>gn_against_the_Al_Qasimi_pirates_(1<wbr>819-20)<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persi<wbr>an_Gulf_campaign_of_1809<br><br>This is the world record for fastest British victory and not a single British death.

The Mamluks decided to fight an open battle outside the city walls.

They included ejaculating on the face of a veiled woman and having another woman kneel, bound, and gagged while he urinated on her.[3][4] After returning to Belgium, he published the photos on the internet under the pseudonym, &#039;Belguel&#039; and included captions such as, &quot;There is no better drug than to ejaculate on the veiled face of a woman.&quot; &quot;These sluts are so naive.

I&#039;ve regressed into a quasi-NEET finishing up what schoolwork I have left. I have no idea what I want to do in life. Originally I wanted to be a lawyer, but after these five years I wouldn&#039;t want to go to law school even if I could pass the LSAT. It&#039;s run by a corrupt company that I don&#039;t want to support. Also I&#039;d have to score highly on the test anyways since COVID crushed my GPA. I wanted to focus on 2nd amendment cases and do my part to help out. I still want to help, I&#039;ll just have to do so in other ways.

Worse yet, I feel that focusing on it like I have ultimately ruined my college years. I only joined one club that ultimately fell apart and after that every friendship I made was ephemeral. I swipe endlessly on tinder and bumble just to ghost or be ghosted. I even met someone who had a crush on me for a long time and messed that up. I&#039;ve heard all the same tired advice, &quot;There&#039;s someone for everyone,&quot; &quot;All you need is confidence,&quot; &quot;There&#039;s plenty of fish in the sea.&quot; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s true.

Hell I can walk outside and up a hill in any direction and shoot if I want. I can and have test fired every gun the first time I bring it home in my back yard and the neighbors have never said anything. People don\u2019t bother you if you don\u2019t bother them here and the cops only get called to clean up or if something really gnarly is going on. We have constitutional carry and the closest state to me (KY) does as well. Hell they banned red flag laws and enforcement on a state level here (most people don\u2019t know this or never bring it up). We have the best white demographic outlook into the 2040\u2019s. Cons: what you heard about the job situation and local economy is most likely correct. Things here revolve around the coal industry, if you aren\u2019t a miner your job relies on the money from miners. The cost of living here is lower than about anywhere though and you can find decent places to live for around $30,000. Crime isn\u2019t too bad really, no worse than anywhere else, the whole country is experiencing a meth &amp; fentanyl epidemic.

I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home.

Kamenev, Zinoviev, Bukharin and Stalin overthrew Trotsky and expelled him from the USSR. But a couple of years later it turned out that Kamenev, Zinoviev and Bukharin were also enemies and pests. Then the valiant comrade Heinrich Yagoda arrested them. A little later, Yagoda was arrested as an enemy agent by Yezhov. But a couple of years later it turned out that Yezhov was not a comrade, but an ordinary traitor and an enemy agent. And Yezhov was arrested by Beria. After Stalin&#039;s death, everyone realized that Beria was also a traitor. Then Zhukov arrested Beria. But soon Khrushchev learned that Zhukov was an enemy and a conspirator. And he exiled Zhukov to the Ural. And a little later it was revealed that even Stalin himself was an enemy, a pest and a traitor. And with him, most of the Politburo. Then Stalin was taken out of the mausoleum, and the politburo was dispersed by honest party members led by Khrushchev. Several years passed and it turned out that Khrushchev was a voluntarist, a crook, an adventurer and an enemy. Then Brezhnev sent Khrushchev to retire. Soon Brezhnev died, and it turned out that he was a pest and the cause of stagnation. Then there were two more, whom no one even had time to remember.

The point is that I&#039;m familiar with what&#039;s good and what&#039;s not as well with the Arex. People shitting on new production sigs, with the exception of whatever is going on with the p320 need stop quoting memes. Yes, the company is a marketing bitch. Yes they make you buy a more expensive version with an anime name to get it built without cheap parts. Yes, the optics are Chinese and many of the parts are Indian. All that&#039;s true and they&#039;re still cranking out the the nicest shooting guns on the market. The p238 is by far the most accurate best micro pocket pistol you can buy. The p365xl is still the absolute best EDC and while I do think personal fit plays a major role, the p226 is for me still the best shooting combat pistol. It&#039;s not perfect, nothing is.<br>As for the Arex I owned, it worked fine. It looked cool and when I bought it, it was still the hot new shit on the market fresh off of MAC&#039;s glowing torture test review from back when people gave a shit. The factory grips were cheap plastic and it had the texture of a high point. It felt less refined in every way and the factory sights were not good. Nothing about it was as good as a p226, it just wasn&#039;t. I also did not shoot it as well which surprised me but again, personal fit is huge.<br>I&#039;m familiar with what&#039;s out there. I&#039;m familiar with the Arex, at least in it&#039;s earlier forms, and people can shit on &quot;nu-sig&quot; all day long but the p238, p365xl and p226 being produced today are the best in class, period.", "time": 1671156059, "resto": 56400312}, {"no": 56414151, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)21:47:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56413641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56413641</a>", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 238, "h": 220, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1671158868757998, "time": 1671158868, "md5": "TiktKcJ84jGM1+cOmP/uBQ==", "fsize": 35106, "resto": 56400312}, {"no": 56414153, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)21:48:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does the Arex fit in p226 holsters?
