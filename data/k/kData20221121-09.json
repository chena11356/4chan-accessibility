The nickname speaks to its tragic history. It was built by the hundreds of thousands of political prisoners who were exiled to the region\u2019s gulags under the Stalin regime from the 1930s to the 1950s, under Dalstroy construction directorate. The first stretch was built by the inmates of the Sevvostlag labor camp in 1932. The work was done with very rudimentary methods, such as shovels and wheelbarrows. The construction continued (by inmates of gulag camps) until 1953. Thousands were shot for not working hard enough, while others died from the gulags\u2019 brutal conditions. The cold was another killer: with temperatures recorded as low as some -70C, the Kolyma is located in the world\u2019s coldest inhabited area. Many of the dead simply were buried beneath the road\u2019s foundations. It is said that the Kolyma Highway cost one death for every meter of road built. In fact, to circulate on it involves traveling over a colossal mass grave that houses many thousands of corpses. The road is treated as a memorial, as the bones of the estimated 250,000\u20131,000,000 people who died while constructing it were laid beneath or around the road. The ruins of that cruel era are still visible today.", "time": 1669021253, "resto": 56122023}, {"no": 56122942, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)04:26:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56122089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56122089</a><br><a href=\"#p56122099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56122099</a><br>It&#039;s a bit of both.

One great example is the Kalthoff repeater which is familiar to many here.<br><br>It was first produced in the 1620s, at which time the average soldier was still using either a pike or a matchlock musket/arquebus as their primary arm.

With paper cartridges, flintlocks could be expected to hit firing rates of 3-4 per minute in the hands of a skilled soldier, compared to 1-2 for a matchlock.<br><br>The Kalthoff shat all over this. It used a flintlock mechanism, but with two big differences from the common rabble. One, it was a breechloader, meaning you didn&#039;t have to upend the whole gun to load it. Two, it had a sliding box-breech loading mechanism that could hold up to 30 shots and push them into place. With this it could obtain a firing rate of over 30 rounds per minute, with comparatively quick reload. It was also decently reliable.<br><br>The downside: not only was it ruinously expensive, but it was so complex that if it ever broke, it would require a master gunsmith to repair it. And even he&#039;d need some time to do so. Probably only a few hundred were ever made, and they only saw use by one military unit, the Scanian Guard.
