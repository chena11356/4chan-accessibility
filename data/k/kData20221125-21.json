It can be read affirmatively, neutrally or as an anti-war book.</span><br><br>Why I recommend it: Its accurately describes how the war actually was, all the details.

All we have to do is literally sit back and send our 2nd rate equipment to Ukraine and Ukraine is destroying Russia for us. If we knew it was this easy to destroy Russia, we&#039;d have just done it decades ago. Everyone was predicting Russia to stomp out Ukraine, and when Russia not only didn&#039;t but started to lose ground, pretty much any country who has a beef with Russia (ie 90% of the world) jumped at the opportunity to send in spare equipment and let Ukraine do it for us. <br><br>Nukes are certainly one of the reasons why NATO doesn&#039;t fully intervene, but the main reason is we just don&#039;t need to. It&#039;s a lot harder to justify full scale military interventions in Western countries, a consequence of belonging to Democratic societies, as unless the entire nation is onboard with such actions, it can lead to massive repercussions for the current ruling administration of that country. There&#039;s a lot more emphasis put on human lives in the West, and even one soldier dying is seen as a tragedy. But imagine if NATO sent in actual soldiers, battlegroups &amp; frontline equipment to Ukraine; Russia would be cleared out in weeks. In 9 months, Ukraine went from nearly 40% of their country occupied/under siege by the Russians to more around 10% and with that number decreasing nearly every week. And they&#039;re on track to GAIN territory with likely retaking Crimea. <br><br>The threat of nukes or not, the moment Russia actually USES nukes, even on Ukraine, means a full scale intervention of all of NATO + even China fully cutting off Russia.

I am not outraged by Russia. I would have been before 2008. I thought all those stories about the Russians being murderers, rapists and looters were Fascist propaganda. But then I saw it with my own eyes happen over and over again. While the Poles were elated with their freedom, while we celebrated and even peacefully, amicably parted ways with Slovakia, the Russians were a bitter, spiteful people.<br>It took me decades to understand that there simply is something wrong with Russians. Every other nation, maybe with the exception of Hungary and Belarus, embraced their new freedom and buried the hatched, so to speak. But Russians almost immediately voted in another dictator.<br>Even after having shared decades of history and politics together, the Russian mind is alien to me. I have given up trying to understand them, instead I treat them as what they are: A threat. Give them an inch and they will take 1968.<br>I need to stress this: I genuinely, honestly do not understand Russians. Yes, the 90&#039;s sucked, maybe worse than for most other former Communist countries, but while even Romania managed something vaguely akin to a free, democratic state, Russians just snapped.<br>And wanna know the most hilarious part in all of this? They are worse than any of the Fascist boogeyman they conjured up for us before 91. They are in every sense of the word the &quot;Fascists&quot; they warned us about.<br>They want to drag us all back into the dark ages, just to reclaim some vague notion of being a superpower again. So my only comment is this: Not outraged, not surprised, deeply saddened. Saddened in the way you are if you have to put down an animal you used to like, but has now turned violent and dangerous. There will be no peace in Europe, as long as there is a Russia.<br><br>That said, as a former Vojin I am amazed by the combat footage we are getting.

The American gun culture is radically different from European gun culture in its origins that way. For much of western europe it wasn&#039;t about frontiers or even protection really--it was about being a rich guy riding on a horse and wing-blasting deer so your dogs could chase it as it bled out. Or it was about extreme focus on like, 1 bullet for mega accuracy. In contrast American gun culture was far more stripped of pomp and circumstance--it was utilitarian because &quot;scalped by Comanche&quot; was a thing that could happen, because &quot;I am moving 1000 miles from the coast into the great plains&quot; was a thing, because &quot;Holy shit it&#039;s freezing and there&#039;s no food, I must find a buffalo to kill&quot; was a way of life, and because &quot;raided by Mexican desperados&quot; was a thing.<br><br>Our gun culture wasn&#039;t ornamental unless you were rich.

Decorations means less when there are 100000 others completely identical. And on the flipside, the more artistic and stylistic the decorations, the more likely it is to only have niche appeal, which then greatly increases cost per unit and raises manufacturer/retailer risk (have inventory sitting around unsold longer). Yet we still see guns designed with aesthetics in mind all the time, and people do do stuff like custom color jobs or furniture at least. There is a desire for cool stuff, but same as the entire rest of modern society it&#039;s not necessarily that compatible with current industrial practice.<br><br>I think advancing technology will eventually give us back what was once taken. As stuff like 3D printing continues to improve and drop in cost, eventually it may become a more common service to get smaller more custom runs of stuff that still can hit close to mass manufactured pricing.
