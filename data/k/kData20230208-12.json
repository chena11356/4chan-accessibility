US Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO&#039;s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said in January that the scale of the war is &quot;out of proportion with all of our recent thinking.&quot; He also noted the importance of an adequate defense industrial base capable of providing the necessary equipment and supplies to satisfy the voracious appetite of large-scale, high-intensity warfare. Cavoli also pointed to Ukraine&#039;s surprising battlefield successes as evidence that &quot;precision can beat mass,&quot; but warned that NATO may not have time to come to the rescue of its smaller neighbors that lack strategic depth. The US is probably the best prepared for a long war, but even then, America&#039;s defense industry will need years to ramp up production of artillery shells.

Children can often be more agile and resilient than adults, making them more suitable for certain types of combat. In addition, they can be a source of motivation for other soldiers, and may be seen as symbols of courage and hope in a situation of conflict. Furthermore, sending children to fight can be seen as a form of protection, as they can be used to divert attention away from more experienced soldiers and thus spare them from potential harm. Finally, by participating in the fight, children can be empowered and gain valuable life experiences that can help them become more successful and well-rounded individuals in the future. Ultimately, while sending children to fight is not an ideal solution, it can be a necessary one.", "filename": "123fc21928144c1fae675b8276941bfd", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 656, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1675847456211537, "time": 1675847456, "md5": "oGYei/nwMXpQGHt2UxPYDA==", "fsize": 32469, "resto": 57072515}, {"no": 57072679, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:12:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57072664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57072664</a><br>didnt read lol", "time": 1675847577, "resto": 57072515}, {"no": 57072685, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:13:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57072515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57072515</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;posting shit that actually hurts your team</span><br>you east euros are so fucking dumb", "time": 1675847613, "resto": 57072515}, {"no": 57072696, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:14:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57072679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57072679</a><br>It&#039;s ok since he didn&#039;t write it either.", "time": 1675847674, "resto": 57072515}, {"no": 57072701, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:15:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57072662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57072662</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spamming the same weeks-old bullshit</span><br>yeah that&#039;s a subhuman /pol/nigger posting alright, why don&#039;t you post hands and guns you thirdworlder cunt", "time": 1675847738, "resto": 57072515}, {"no": 57072706, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:16:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57072599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57072599</a><br>90% of ukrainians say they would still fight even after a nuclear attack.

You\u2019re going to see some basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, angles, and perimeter, along with the occasional time and distance word problem and potentially some basic probability.<br><br>Section 2: RCT (Reading Comprehension Test): Again, really straightforward stuff. You read a passage of text and are given options of sentences only one of which is totally true based on the text given above. Most will seem true but, only one can actually be derived from the provided passage.<br><br>Section 3: MCT (Mechanical Comprehension Test): The questions in this section are similar to what would find in an intro to physics class. Brush up on your knowledge of basic physics and how it relates to velocity, volume, and pressure as well as the mechanics of simple machines when it comes to gears, electricity, and weight distribution.<br><br>Section 4: ANIT (Aviation and Nautical Information Test): You guessed it! On this section of the ASTB you\u2019re going to need to know some nautical terminology, a little bit of aviation history as well as some principles of aviation like aerodynamic principles, basic aircraft components, and flight rules", "time": 1675570783, "resto": 57030831}, {"no": 57033094, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:21:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57033076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57033076</a><br><br>Section 5: NATFI (Naval Aviation Trait Facet Inventory): You sort of get off easy here as there\u2019s no real way to prepare for this section. It\u2019s a personality inventory that, in the end, will gauge ones suitability for a career in aviation based on their personal characteristics.<br><br>Section 6: PBM (Performance Based Measures Battery): Depending on your tastes this might be the most \u2018fun\u2019 part of the ASTB. You basically get to do a flight simulation. You\u2019ll be given a flight mock-up flight console with a throttle and joystick along with a headset. You\u2019ll also get a map that you\u2019ll need to study before guiding an airplane around on a screen. For a more detailed of explanation of this section check out our full-length article of the different sections of the ASTB called ASTB Test Layout.<br><br>Section 7: BI-RV (Biographical Inventory with Response Validation): This is the part of the ASTB that you can complete from any computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that you complete this section prior to writing the rest of the ASTB. All it is, is a questionnaire about your previous experiences and successes or achievements with aviation. Like section 5 you really can\u2019t prepare for this section \u2013 just answer honestly as there aren\u2019t any real right or wrong responses.<br><br>IOW, bitch you should have prepared lel.

It was noted at the time that they would outrange the typical archer.<br>They were quite common for the abovementioned reason.<br>If you get hit in the head, yes, then they are quite deadly. Less so if you get hit in a fleshy part. But they could break bones in the hands, feet, collar bones, possibly shins (unless the enemy was wearing greaves, of course). Above all, they are good at supressing the enemy skirmishers and other troops, getting them to hunker down and put up their shields. This prevents them from being proactive.<br>A single slinger won&#039;t make a difference on the battlefield, of course, so they are more of a &#039;formation&#039; thing. See, the thing is, imagine skirmishers forming up in a sort of &#039;cloud&#039; in front of the main force. Their job is primarily to fix the enemy forces and mask the movements of the own main force. Nobody expected skirmishers to win, or even decide, a battle. They were useful for many reasons. First, it&#039;s an easy entry into the profession of soldiery since the bar is set pretty low. You only need a sling or two and some stones/lead balls. It&#039;s a good way for a lad of some 15 years to get some soldiering experience without putting his life into too much danger. That way, when they amass a little wealth, they can purchase into a heavier, more professional class of soldiery and they will already be battle-proven. You don&#039;t want your elite heavy troops to never have seen battle before. If they start small, as a slinger, they can acclimate slowly to the dangers of the battlefield. Also, the older soldiers would be loathe to participate in too much field works and sentry duties; they feel they have done their bit, so the young guys pick up the slack.", "time": 1675855581, "resto": 57073129}, {"no": 57073535, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:37:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57073462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57073462</a><br>Can you hit someone with it one on one?<br>How many of his shots does a trained slinger hit?<br>At what speed do the balls travel?", "time": 1675856224, "resto": 57073129}, {"no": 57073704, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:57:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57073535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57073535</a><br>I couldn&#039;t tell you the answer to those more technical questions.

Its diplomatic influence is over outside of dances with dictators and criminals is over and its arms export industry is over.

It really has the battle of the bulge feel but without the tanks or surprise......there is no possibility of Russia winning anything or coming out of this with any gain in territory whatsoever.

They have no idea what is going on or how enormous their losses are. Putin just wants to be able to say he took Donetsk, even if it is only for a few months while he declares the war won and in his crazy head tells the Ukrainians its time for peace.

My grandad worked on the Minuteman engines and shows up in one of the photos, which was pretty neat. <br><br>TL:DR the silos are situated and hardened so that it will take dozens of overlapping strikes to knock the base out.

For instance in my own squad half off us will say &quot;Triple seven gun tube&quot; while the other will say &quot;Triple seven cannon tube&quot; While the TM will refer to cannon tube assembly. Though to my understanding the M252 120mm (on the M1 not the mortar) is referred to as gun tube in its TM but near exclusively called a cannon tube by tankers. at least the other M252 120 is referred

South Africa isn&#039;t a recently colonised tropical african shithole. The Afrikaner people don&#039;t have a mother country to return to, and the Anglos here are much more alienated from the anglosphere than for example the Rhodesians were, most of whom had British citizenship or had parents with British citizenship. Secondly, most of the country is arid or mild temperate, so much less inhospitable to Europeans than hot lowland tropical regions with malaria. <br><br>I think it&#039;ll either the Cape will secede (essentially the south western part of the country) and the rest will descend further into a dysfunctional shithole, or the entire country will collapse and later coalesce into a Cape state (Western Cape, Northern Cape and Western half of the Eastern Cape) and a state comprising the highveld region (including Gauteng) and the Freestate, with the eastern half of the Eastern Cape, most of KZN and the low lying parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo reverting back to deep Africa since they have climates amenable to the African way of life and strong ethnic groups. These places wil probably be contested frontier territory. <br><br>The Cape state will probably be multi ethic and mulatto dominated and be a bit like Brazil, the Highveld state will be pretty chaotic, since the centre of power would be Gauteng, and the goal would be to keep control of the farmland and mineral resources in the region. There aren&#039;t many strong black tribal identities in region, and the Afrikaners are likely too few and too scattered to unite and exert power. What I suspect will happen is that a cosmopolitan black elite will try to keep control of the region by using the Afrikaners as a sort of janissary class to control the lower classes and keep some of the infrastructure going to maintain control.", "time": 1675852920, "resto": 57069338}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 57072174, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)02:33:25", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "weird guns thread", "com": "What gun is this?

If not, it was some guidebook written during the middle ages, maybe the Renaissance, can&#039;t remember exactly. At the time it was written, the standard equipment allocated to duelists in a judicial duel was a sword, spear, and buckler. The author says that you could unscrew your sword&#039;s pommel and throw it at your opponent&#039;s face to stun and daze him, and then while he&#039;s still recoiling from having a solid chunk of steel thrown at his face, you charge in and quickly run him through with a spear.

It has a blast door and its own power supply and is surrounded with 200L water tanks that were cast over with cement and rebar, I had the H frames from a bunch of shop presses the hydraulic rams had died on (fucked seals a whole truck full of them) and they give it fuck knows how much strength. Its way over specification for anything, one end of it is a larger through another 48 inch inches of solid cement block passageway and then an air gap and outer stone walls. In there is about 400L of bottled water, bleach, dish soap, thrash bags, few hundred cans of beans, tinned tomatoes, meatballs, tuna, salmon, chopped ham, condensed and coconut milk tinned pears, peaches you name it, masses of that Augeston farms big can crap as well. Have jerry cans spark plugs, two stroke oil every fucking thing from solder to sulphur 100 butane gas cans, there&#039;s a 10 kw generator and a back up for it (little 500 watts) I have a 10 2KW batteries daisychained. I got a bunch of radiation detection stuff from a Ukrainian company a decade ago so I can monitor all around the outside and inside, cameras as well. Have a ham rig and a bunch of other stuff. I am on my own 24/7 7 days a week, 365 days a year. I have been a long time. I get bored and do this, I make gun racks, restore old guns. I was flying drones with flir around five years ago at night. Anyway. Good luck .

Any heavier than that, I think it is more suitable for belt carry. Others will carry an 8 ounce knife in their pocket and forget its there.<br><br>I asked if you were planning on sharpening it yourself because of your choice of steel, this is an entire can of worms with many many variables. In the most basic of terms, the higher a supersteel is rated for cutlery, the longer it will retain its edge, and the harder it is going to be for a novice to sharpen. Edge retention and ease of sharpening vary dramatically between knife steels. But even a supersteel blade will eventually get dull.

Despite the fact that I just spent ten years in the middle east where it was immediately apparent that effective counterinsurgency relies on social dynamics, IED construction, and long range accurate shooting from concealment I don&#039;t teach any of those things because my purpose is now to make hypebeasts and boomers feel like operators as they shoot paper. My elite students get to train CQB with me in a plywood room even though I saw first hand that CQB only works at night against sleeping targets and any coordinated resistance results in immediate casualties of the entire team. I have been inhaling lead particulate 2 hours a day for 15 years straight and I am developing cancerous tumors on various organs. I have severe CTE from daily concussive weapons during CQB training, which when used in the field resulted in the deaths of some of my best friends; this emotional trauma I will never be able to shake even when I am a normal looking middle aged man and no one will ask or care about what I did in the military thirty years ago. Some of my friends smuggled drugs or were involved in human trafficking during their military career as a side hustle.

That&#039;s the reason that silver based wound dressings are in vogue for antimicrobial stuff, since the human body is actually pretty good at clearing it and not accidentally moving it into the pathways that would see it doing collateral damage on the scale that it acts as a bacterio and fungicide.<br><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC7177798/", "time": 1675805980, "resto": 57059000}, {"no": 57066498, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)16:41:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57065198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57065198</a><br>I remember that shit.

of wearing body armor. Armor Piercing Ammo might work. <br><br>Some Vampires use a similar kind of protection but are more occult-based, so the rule of physics are thrown out the window. Piercing damage doesn&#039;t work, so switching to something non-letal (like beanbags) could slow down your target and wear him/her out. Then go for the kill. <br><br>However, please remember that most, if not all vampires, are weak to fire, so carrying dragon breath shells, cocktail molotovs or flashbangs is a dream. <br><br>If you ARE a vampire killing fellow vampires, be VERY CAREFUL using these shells since you might gravely injure yourself just by being so close of the heat. <br><br>My personal recommendation is a shotgun of your choosing. Kel-tec, as much a meme they are, actually allows you to switch between your shells, letting you use two sets of rounds and can get very versatile. If you have the money for it, get a bunch of 00 buckshot or slugs. But a good old 12 gauge can do the trick. <br><br>As for a Rifle, bring something compact and comfortable. But also something you can hide. I doubt any of you get paid and/or are backed by any agencies to kill vamps, so bringing something light is recommended. Just avoid cops and authorities, you gonna have a very hard time explaining yourself. Especially when you&#039;ll learn that some powerful vamps have contacts in your local police department and may not be happy to learn you&#039;re hunting them. So keep your gear hidden. <br><br>As for sidearm, forget your 9mm and your 45, we deal with undead superpowered scumbags, bring a 9mm for a backup and aim for the head but for the actual thing, try revolvers with big calibers. If you can handle it, a Desert Eagle in 357 or 44 can pack a solid punch, .50 AE is just too much for humans. <br><br>However, if you&#039;re a vamp, and you can handle the recoil, .50 AE can be considered. <br><br>Enjoy your hunting :)", "time": 1675816430, "resto": 57059000}, {"no": 57068552, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)19:34:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57061722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57061722</a><br>Lol", "time": 1675816492, "resto": 57059000}, {"no": 57068593, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)19:38:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57059000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57059000</a><br>Tank, Combat, Full Tracked, 120-mm gun M1A2 SEPv3", "time": 1675816685, "resto": 57059000}, {"no": 57068622, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)19:40:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57068539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57068539</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;.50 AE is just too much for humans.</span><br>Are you retarded?", "time": 1675816842, "resto": 57059000}, {"no": 57068625, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)19:40:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57068593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57068593</a><br>Jesus man that overkill, even for me. <br><br>Just a 12 gauge in the jaw can do the trick man... <br><br>Or make the vampire you&#039;re trying to kill eat a bunch of .45 ACP... but fuck man that too much firepower for one vamp man...", "time": 1675816852, "resto": 57059000}, {"no": 57068632, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)19:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57068271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57068271</a><br><br>Pretty that&#039;s just a sexual assault.

Extreme cold and famine are the obvious ones, but hibernation also has the power to combat conditions that plague modern humans, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke and heart attack. It could even hold the key to longevity and colonising space. No wonder some researchers are keen to reinstate what might have been our long-lost superpower.<br><br>The idea that ancient humans could hibernate may seem far-fetched, but mounting evidence suggests that many non-hibernating mammals retain an ability to enter reduced-energy states, including through dormant brain-signaling pathways that slow metabolism. \u201cThe distribution of hibernating species on the tree of mammals makes the likely conclusion that the common ancestor of all mammals was a hibernator,\u201d says Sandy Martin at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we all have the genetic hardware.\u201d", "time": 1675675139, "resto": 57041332}, {"no": 57046783, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)04:22:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57046751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57046751</a><br><a href=\"#p57046762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57046762</a><br><a href=\"#p57046722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57046722</a><br><a href=\"#p57046733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57046733</a><br>What is Kleine-Levin syndrome?<br>Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS), also known as \u201csleeping beauty syndrome\u201d or \u201cfamilial hibernation syndrome,\u201d is an extremely rare condition that causes intermittent episodes where you sleep for long periods of time, which prevents you from staying awake during the day (hypersomnia).

If you want to make the most of our time or just chill around for two years,<br><br>The most time-productive is going with FWDL 7 (in my cause with the Paratroopers): 3 months of bootcamps (AGA) and directly after that, 3 months of specialized training (SGA) with 2\u20133 weeks of free time. SGA training is with MG3, offensive attacks, and, with luck, Panzerfaust or even Mortar. Paratroopers are either in Saarland (Merzig AGA and Zweibr\u00fccken SGA) or Seedorf. Zweibr\u00fccken is a dump, but it&#039;s ok if you are only here for a short time. J\u00e4gers are too in Saarland. Seedorf idk. Calw is KSK, and Pfullendorf is focused on training.

In my opinion, it is not really worth your time, and the officers will not really invest a lot of time in you as SAZ2. The money is not really worth it.<br><br>Also, you have a lot of leverage with FWDL over the system: two internships every year, and you have more options if your life turns to shit or you want to switch to SAZ. Always use your leverage because the system will always try to fuck you. My suggestion, go fwdl and check it out. If you want to stay longer than 2 years, go with the highest position you can get.

In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus&#039; allies, the Aetolian League, hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking the Aetolians&#039; countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to the rescue of his Aetolian allies. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000\u201325,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius&#039; army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, and Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus&#039; bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king&#039;s victory, the Epirotes resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus&#039; army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of &#039;Eagle&#039; upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus&#039;s victory, marched back to Macedon.

You pick up the pieces of divinity strewn around the world and you learn how to put them back together into something magnificent.<br>The point is you can trust the sword *you* made. You know where the ore came from, you know how each step of the forging process went, you know every piece of it, it&#039;s origin, it&#039;s strengths and weaknesses, or you should at least. You can trust it as much as you trust yourself. You know it as deeply as you know yourself.<br>That&#039;s the symbol of having the sword break in the hand of Thulsa Doom&#039;s lieutenant. He couldn&#039;t trust that steel, he knew nothing about it, not really.<br><br>Steel is an expression of your effort, study, and practice going beyond what is possible for the body, beyond animal strength.

For the Romans not only made a jest of those who fought with the edge of that weapon, but always found them an easy conquest. A stroke with the edges, though made with ever so much force, seldom kills, as the vital parts of the body are defended both by the bones and armor. On the contrary, a stab, though it penetrates but two inches, is generally fatal. Besides in the attitude of striking, it is impossible to avoid exposing the right arm and side; but on the other hand, the body is covered while a thrust is given, and the adversary receives the point before he sees the sword. This was the method of fighting principally used by the Romans, and their reason for exercising recruits with arms of such a weight at first was, that when they came to carry the common ones so much lighter, the greater difference might enable them to act with greater security and alacrity in time of action.</span>", "time": 1675761699, "resto": 57059045}, {"no": 57060106, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:23:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57060099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57060099</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; THE POST EXERCISE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We are informed by the writings of the ancients that, among their other exercises, they had that of the post.
