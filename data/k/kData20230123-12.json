An EU Battle Group is a stand-by military force designed to give member states the ability to provide rapid response elements in support of the Petersberg tasks (\u201cmilitary tasks of a humanitarian, peacekeeping and peacemaking nature\u201d). This is the first time Ukraine has joined such a group and she will work alongside the other nations for a six-month period, contributing 10 staff officers, a company of Ukrainian marines with their armoured vehicles, and an IL-76 strategic lift aircraft.<br><br>This is good stuff and shows the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to cooperate with those of EU member states to practical effect. It also reflects on support provided by the UK, including a month-long training package in Crimea designed to help Ukrainian troops work with those of other countries; and English-language and other professional training. The Ukrainian marines have a good reputation \u2013 the UK is grateful to them for having helped evacuate British nationals, alongside Ukrainians and other nationalities, from Tripoli in April.

Supported by footage released by the Russian<br>Ministry of Defence showing three R-77-1s being launched by an Su-35 flying at Mach 1.1 and<br>around 33,000 ft with a launch acceptable region (LAR) indicator on the heads-up-display showing<br>around 75 km at the start of the clip. Since missile effective range is proportional to launch<br>altitude and speed, as well as target aspect and speed, an Su-35 flying faster than Mach 1.1 at, for<br>example, 40,000 ft+ (well within its performance capabilities) could easily have an LAR in excess<br>of 100 km against a low-flying closing target.

Now, take the 9ft booster and strap your 2000lb 10ft mine on the front, and you have a 20ft surface launched mine. Problem is, it will be sticking 6ft-7ft out of your HIMARS launcher, and have a range of 75km max.

Now, if you&#039;re wanting more than 75km range, you&#039;re going to need to add another booster to that ATACMS, which is going to get you a 30ft long SL-mine that will need a custom launch tube.

Whilst it is mostly focused on the wagner forces, by actually having the plot follow Ukrainian groups at certain times it gives them a lot more character and depth. Whereas in movies like Blackhawk Down or other more modern US war movies every &quot;bad guy&quot; is a nameless jackie iraqi, in this film it felt like they gave a lot of respect to Ukrainian forces. They were not shown as just paper target retards. <br><br>The film in several scenes depicts Ukrainian soldiers as ferocious, vicious fighters, brave, cunning, calculating and dedicated. Of course this treatment is also the same for the depiction of Russian wagner forces too. The film also isn&#039;t above showing the grittier or less than honourable stuff. For example there is one scene where a wagner PMC is overrun by Ukr soldiers and hides under a dead Ukr to ambush one of the soldiers (then he is swiftly gunned down), both sides shoot at enemy wounded. <br><br>In terms of overly dramatic stuff, there are a few showcases from both the wagner and Ukr forces of soldiers being &quot;fucked&quot; e.g a tank is immobilised and makes a last stand, a guy is hit in an artery and rushes another guy with grenades in his hands ect. It does detract from the otherwise more grounded tone of the film but it is still cool.<br><br>The ending is very pyrrhic and is not shy about showing the cost of the war. <br><br>One of my favourite aspects was the creative cinematography of certain shots. I won&#039;t get too into it but it adds a lot of amazing effects to the pacing and spices up the energy of it all.

As a brief summary (from what actually makes sense), the war was declared because Venice was being the Italian version of a kike and everyone else was sick of these literal merchants having so much power. After they&#039;d nearly beaten Venice, the Pope realized that the French were now invading Italy, so everyone then joined Venice to try and expel the French. At some point the Scots and English got involved somehow, then opted out. During this phase of the war, a council was convened between the various pasta-states of Italy and they collectively (aside from Venice) agreed &quot;yeah but still fuck Venice though.&quot; This is where Venice leaves them and joins the French.

Who really have hit the limits of what those old cartridges can do. There is no doubt as a matter of fundamental physics that some of the new ones have much higher BCs and will carry more energy farther, flatter. We can manufacture stuff now with precision that we couldn&#039;t 50 or 75 or 100 years ago. People who know what they&#039;re doing can go with whatever they want.

The past couple of updates have just included made up shit such as, .366 AP and .45 AP which yeah is a minor complaint but it&#039;s a troubling sign of bsg&#039;s loss of focus and vision. there&#039;s a zeroing system but each gun is coded to a certain load in its respective caliber and so are scopes but nobody uses zeroing soooo... <br><br>TL;DR:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;combination of fantasy rpg and shooter game, done poorly.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;severe item bloat</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;identity crisis</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shady devs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unoptimized entirely and this patch is particularly bad</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s operator dress up if you want to play offline</span><br><br>t. 800+ hours + 3-4 wipes played.", "filename": "1663636935060936", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 360, "h": 280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1674418560115618, "time": 1674418560, "md5": "o9MZlwVC0+e2vU0c3hMeVg==", "fsize": 25814, "resto": 56862919}, {"no": 56865294, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:18:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Tarkov is held back by tech and engine.

The anarchists of the Spanish Civil War were a perfect example of this, they would show up to their designated barricade, fire off a couple our rounds into the air, then go home, considering their daily duty to the republic complete.

This is problematic for several reasons. Life is hard and full of inconveniences, putting your recruits through a mandatory process that changes them as individuals is important in being able to work better as a team. There is a difference between pure abuse, and just tough love. As a child might be parented, so do troops, this is for their own good.

The treaty meant Norway could not add one tank to the roster - but they could chop up the old ones.

Every wargame or exercise we&#039;ve done have shown that well-placed armour, ie an MBT or an IFV, can wreck havoc along chokepoints when placed in defensive roles. This is especially relevant for defence down the main northern MSR&#039;s which is dominated by valleys, narrow roads etc. <br>This ofc relies on area control against flanking movements such as light infantry and airborne etc, which is reflected in Norwegian armored battalions being that in name only, and actually closer to mechanized battalions with a 3-1 split between IFV and MBT squadrons. <br>As for the Finnmark plateau, you actually have quite a bit of maneuver freedom and nice, long areas of fire. Once the frost sets in proper, you can achive quite a lot of maneuver freedom as well. <br>Ofc there you open yourself up quite a lot to long-range ATGM-fire, which is one of the reasons why APS is presented on both the A7 and K2. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chillin&#039; in the woods with some AT weapons is the way to go</span><br>Funny you should mention that, because that exact line of though is why the CV90 is the way it is, ie without a mounted ATGM capability like the Bradley has (bar the BILL demo and the new dutch ones).

The Cv90 was to engage channelized armor from the flank with the 40mm, while heavier AT was to be provided by dismounted infantry using ERYX or similar. <br>Turns out that this is pretty transferable to both Norwegian and Finnish terrain as well, although Norway has replaced the ERYX with the Javelin in recent years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Norway wants Panthers</span><br>Lol.

Japan invaded and took two of my coastal cities because I had neglected my navy, but I counterattacked by sending cavalry behind his lines and pillaging all his luxury resources so he was forced to return the cities or face total collapse from the unhappiness penalty. Morocco also attacked but didn&#039;t really do anything other than loot a trade route.

Also remember that the volume of higher orbits is exponentially higher than that of lower orbits, meaning that Kessler Syndrome would already be much less dangerous simply due to all the debris being spread over a much larger space.<br><a href=\"#p56850373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56850373</a><br><a href=\"#p56851199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56851199</a><br>E2E certainly (probably) won&#039;t be a big market like human transport or regular package shipping, but it is absolutely doable and viable for military application.

With all of their production they are able to built one stack per month. Each stack can only fly once per month. After one month they have built and flown one Starship, capable of launching 100 tons to low Earth orbit. After two months they have built two Starships. The first has flown a second time and the new one has flown for its first time. They have a total 300 potential tons of mass to LEO so far. After three months they have built and flown a third one, and the other two have flown once again. Total potential mass to LEO thus far of 600 tons. At four months this is 1000 tons. At five months this is 1500 tons. At six months this is 2100 tons. After one year in which they build one stack per month and each stack flies once per month they have a total annual mass to LEO of 7800 tons. In their second year they have a total annual mass to orbit of 22,200 tons. Year three is 36,600 tons. Year four is 51,000 tons. Year five is 65,400 tons. After five years their total lifetime mass to LEO is 183,000 tons. After ten years the total lifetime mass to LEO of Starship is 726,000 tons.<br>I also did some more number crunching for a scenario in which SpaceX still builds one Starship per month but is able to launch each one once per week. The annual total for each year is 32,500 tons year one, 100,100 tons year two, 159,900 tons year three, 235,300 tons year four, 287,300 tons year five, 370,500 tons year six, 414,700 tons year seven, 505,700 tons year eight, 542,100 tons year nine, and 640,900 tons year ten.

Nothing special, just slow, schoolgirl slice-of-life stuff. Very kid-safe, topical to our modern, changing world. I&#039;d watch it again for mindless relaxation and some smiles &amp; light feels.

The acquisition of the contraband we were originally motoring for out there was secondary now to what the hell that antique was, and what it could be. To any of our admittedly limited knowledges, the Seminole&#039;s or whoever lived out there never really ventured that far out, not with their little stick boats. <br>We all gave it looks by lamplight in the boats cabin as we travelled along the outskirts of the keys, eventually harboring in Key Largo, and making the deal. the money was inconsequential in our monthly dealings, and besides its doling out into our pay, was quickly forgotten. <br>It seemed to be a metal chunk, but for being in the water so long, it remained without a speck of rust. Inscriptions coated the surface with their valleys, remarkably empty of detritus. Some were pretty obvious- people, maybe spears, children. others we couldn&#039;t decipher. Flowers maybe? Vast and strange planets overlooking people, and maybe buildings. <br>It was better kept up than the fine china from our grandmothers which made this sort of thing difficult to present to any potential inspectors, beyond the ramifications of it perhaps gaining popularity. Lot of people would be asking why we were so far out from sugar key loaf in the first place. <br><br>Jerry&#039;s dad, the eccentric bastard he was made himself known the day after we found ourselves at the harbor. Making a quick visit to his pops ultimately turned into him spilling the beans on his discovery. His father, ever the avid radio hobbyist kept tabs on most ships entering the harbor, and knew most of the captains or radio operators by one name or another, at least from what he told us.

A little surveying off Sugar Loaf dug up something more interesting than saltwater, it was that simple. <br>It was the evening after we had sold the goods. A quick knock- not any of our codes. I grabbed for my piece, and so did Milo. Jerry didn&#039;t stir and we were about ready to make a quick strained whisper for him to grab a knife, some knuckles, one of our 12s off the table, anything, but before we could get our words out, they were stopped dead by that voice we heard so often over the radio.

According to him he&#039;d have them sent out by monday of the next week, but he had no clue when his friends would get back to them.<br>Still, we were in a better position then we were a few nights ago. Our immediate concerns shifted that week- word came from one of those unnamed specters that flickers at the top of a hierarchy of crime like a message from God. A few teens with too much money for their own good were beginning to bankroll cubans from Miami to start shuffling coke around the Southern tip of Florida, and they were attracting a lot of attention on the routes we used to ply our trade. Something had to be done.<br>That night was spent in discussion of our possible steps. These guys were small time dealers, they weren&#039;t hardened transporters. Just some opportunists who got in contact with the right rich USF student. But the sway of a continued flow of money could convince people to continue doing mighty idiotic things unless violence was added into the mix, as hesitant as we were at the idea. <br>The bosses never gave any official word on our course of action- it was left up to our own discretion. <br>Milo suggested just telling them to leave, and maybe adding a bribe. Jerry agreed. <br>Mike second guessed it though- suppose the kids wanna get these guys deported if they turn tail and run on them. That makes it so much more difficult. It didn&#039;t seem likely, but if they thought the Cubans would go to the feds, they could probably get enough evidence to suggest they were bringing coke in on their own accord.

The civilization that built these roads had a habit of digging through hills, not going above them. This may be ideal for easy travel, but it also makes a successful ambush exponentially easier to perform. Colton&#039;s squad had their positions prepared right outside one of these tunnels. Perhaps even more influential than the preferential terrain would be the recent cold front. The southern cascades are host to a variety of dangerous phenomena, from poisonous insects to energy fields that will turn off a man&#039;s nervous system like a lightbulb. Fortunately, most of these invisible threats can be stopped with full CBRN protection gear, provided by Colton&#039;s company. This permits safe travel throughout the area, but at a heavy cost. In the summer months, heat stroke is a danger just as significant as any anomaly, and long marches with a full ruck can become hellish ordeals. Cold weather may very well be a gift from Vaana herself in the eyes of most mercenaries. So, in high-spirits, his platoon had prepared itself for its grim work. The contract was strange, but not entirely unheard of. His company had been hired by the Valsan electorate of Hostalec-auf-H\u00fcgel to steal the plunder of another group of contractors, who themselves had been hired by another electorate, Krigzend, to secure some ancient relic or whatnot.

With the other gun teams in position, there was nothing else to do but wait. Only about half an hour had passed until we received a force assessment from scouts on the other side of the tunnel. 4 personnel carriers, old surplus from the 50s, and a civilian truck.

Colton readied his rifle as the first personnel carrier made its way out of the tunnel, waiting for the ATGM to fire, which would signal the beginning of the ambush. The lead vehicle was some old Novetian model, an 8 wheeled metal box with sloped armor good enough to resist small arms-fire. Instead of the usual machine-gun, it&#039;s turret housed a nasty looking howitzer, certain to make short work of their positions. It didn&#039;t get the chance to fire. A guided missile flew right through the top armor of the vehicle, detonating an ammo rack and sending the turret flying onto the pavement.

Their ambush had been so successful that the enemy had not managed to fire a single shot. <br><br>Orders from the sergeant, a veteran of the Waldfurt conflict, were for the riflemen to advance and disarm the surrendering hostiles. Most complied without incident, and any issues were resolved by a firm strike with the butt of a rifle. The PCs were secured and the captured soldiers were put into restraints. There was little ill-will between the companies, so the typical contractor&#039;s etiquette would be practiced. It was common among groups who engaged each other for purely contractual reasons to release captured prisoners, and sometimes equipment, after leaving the site of the engagement.

The primer detonated after approximately 2 seconds, or 15J dissipated energy. The primer actually blew out the back and damaged my alligator clip (pic related).

Doing some back of the napkin math, I think my guess was wrong. A shotgun primer weights ~0.250g. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/gC. If all ~15J was dissipated evenly in the primer itself, it would have raised in temperature by ~155C. The auto ignition temperature of primers is ~170-190C. The shells were at room temperature ~18C initially. This all adds up to the thermal conduction being negligible.<br>I&#039;m looking into this specifically for a single shot breech loader, so charge time and battery life are not major concerns for me.

What if you need to use your unaided eye? On a non-articulating system you have to stow your goggles all the way up. Which comes to one of the biggest drawbacks to any non-articulating system that uses the dovetail mount interface. When the goggles are stowed they stick very far off your helmet and it throws off your center of balance. It will cause neck strain after any extended period of time. Ask any Sentinel, RNVG, or RPNVG user to show their side profile when their goggles are stowed and it becomes readily apparent. This is less of an issue if your non-articulating system is either very lightweight or uses the ball detent mounting system that was specifically designed for the non translating ANVIS goggles.<br><br><a href=\"#p56865623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56865623</a><br>It&#039;s controversial because you are looking at the eyepieces in a position that is off-axis, which could potentially lead to image quality loss. This ends up not being an issue if you&#039;re using good glass. Carson PVS-14 eyepieces maintain amazing image quality even off-axis, and I don&#039;t notice any image clarity loss even at max pan. <br> <br>Panning is a compromise between increased wide field of view, at the loss of stereoscopic vision. The further out you pan, the less depth perception you have on the edges of the image. Panning to around 60 - 65\u00b0 you maintain enough stereoscopic vision in the center that it doesn&#039;t become an issue in real world use. Panning is so useful that it is becoming a ubiquitous feature on new binocular systems. <br><br><a href=\"#p56866082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56866082</a><br>I haven&#039;t sent out the free ones to the anons yet.

Yes, America suffered big time in &#039;Nam at first when Phantoms didn&#039;t have a nose gun and early AIM-7&#039;s and AIM-9&#039;s were absolute shit, however it&#039;s pretty easy to see how missile technology has evolved considerably and engagements are now flinging fire and forget missiles that are guided in by AWACS rather than needing to be guided in with the fighters own radar.<br><br>I guess I would be on the &quot;gun not required&quot; side more than the &quot;gun required&quot; one, but I dunno, there&#039;s a lot of factors that can cause an actual engagement of a peer to peer enemy to make having guns a necessity. Stealth makes it so you can&#039;t just fling missiles from 100km away as you can&#039;t detect the planes until you&#039;re within 10-20km, and a lot of engagements are going to wind up being on the deck as non-stealth planes use the higher air resistance at sea level to cause missiles to lose a lot of their range. I think in a WW3 scenario where the best of the best is fighting massive, dozen+ jet battles, guns will end up being needed just as much as close-range IR missiles.
