Both of these shots are as he\u2019s down on his side, the bullet is traveling through his entire chest cavity and possibly into his neck. <br><br>Still breathing. I shoot him a fourth time, amazed at his will to live but a bit despondent. Still fucking breathing after the fourth shot, I grab my 300 Blackout with subsonics. I verify on my phone that I know where to shoot to hit the brain , and walk out to the coyote. I shot him 11 times in succession with subsonic 300 blackout at point blank range in the head. He would not stop breathing, and even rolled his head around. At this point I\u2019m in shock, distraught that this animal won\u2019t die. I ended up shooting him one more time in the side of the head at the base of the ear, and he finally stopped breathing. <br><br>I\u2019ve hunted deer and turkey and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. Every deer I\u2019ve ever shot was a double lung, several double lung + heart. Every turkey has been a quick kill severing the neck. I know coyotes are tough but I don\u2019t know he survived that long. I\u2019m going to skin him tomorrow and take a close look at what was hit. Was it nerves? How did he continue to breathe? <br><br>Sorry for the blogpost but holy cow that was rough", "filename": "A6F1E47B-F983-484C-AE79-D130C304BB2A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 862, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 168, "tim": 1668487993894224, "time": 1668487993, "md5": "hFp9nRBKYXwwZf4/vMb1Iw==", "fsize": 401804, "resto": 0, "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "well-i-just-had-the-most-horrifying-hunting", "replies": 142, "images": 25, "omitted_posts": 137, "omitted_images": 24, "last_replies": [{"no": 56055159, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:12:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56055048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56055048</a><br>why you (you)ing me?", "time": 1668539523, "resto": 56048250}, {"no": 56055200, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:14:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56048294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56048294</a><br>kek this nigga based", "time": 1668539644, "resto": 56048250}, {"no": 56055247, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:16:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56048250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56048250</a><br>JUST STEP ON ITS CHEST PUSSY", "time": 1668539784, "resto": 56048250}, {"no": 56055268, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:17:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Skulls are fun to keep.", "filename": "IMG_20220721_133517261", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1224, "h": 918, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1668539836195941, "time": 1668539836, "md5": "iPVi2Xv1zdd/souG4szSHg==", "fsize": 261973, "resto": 56048250, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56055663, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:35:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56048294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56048294</a><br>Coyotes are vermin.
