Though, that depends on if your sensor is Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Medium/Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR), or a dual sensor of both. IIRC the F/A-18E/F IRST21 can target at about the same distance as its radar ~70mi. That&#039;s for non-stealth platforms not designed with IR reduction only second to radar reduction like the F-117, B-2, B-21, and F-35A/B/C are. Then you&#039;re limited by atmospheric conditions, too. Which will degrade your sensor&#039;s ability to see further. The biggest hurdle is the manufacturing, and fielding of IR sensors with the resolution and sensitivity to see very faint IR signatures at long distanced, added to a powerful enough processor to take advantage of your extensive threat library to detect, track, and ID a platform at any angle. The threat library is made up of IR signatures of a known platform at different distances, angles, and configurations. Which takes an extensive ISR system to get in the first place. Other countries would be hard-pressed to make the sensors, let alone have the processing power, algorithms, and threat library to detect US stealth planes at any tactically relevant distances.

Gunpowder burns slowly and generates lots of gas pressure within the chamber. This gas pressure is the fundamental to operating the action regardless of what action is being used. <br><br>Your half baked idea attempts to contain this pressure in an even smaller area which would require even higher pressures since you have less time to allow energy to build. You also don\u2019t have a constant pressure as you do with real firearms. The entire time the bullet is in the barrel it is under pressure and gaining energy. Yours is almost instantaneous which would require all the power of a bullet in a fraction of the time actually guns are under pressure. Your idea would turn any gun ever made or concocted into a pipe bomb. <br>It seems you think it would be a case-less design as well, but you fail to understand newtons 2nd and 3rd laws. The energy used to force the piston back must also be overcome again to drag the piston out with it. This will always prevent you from having an efficient cartridge. <br>Your \u201cgun\u201d would need to hold 100x the pressure for longer than any current metallurgy can contain.

The bullet is pushed through by the propellant and the case (along with many other roles such as obturation) drives the action back (in recoil based designs, not gas operations). You need to loose mass (such as the loss of powder and case) to have any level of efficiency with a cased cartridge. <br>If your idea includes having the piston be left behind or ejected congrats you\u2019ve just made the worst gun and bullet that could ever be technically be considered a gun and bullet.", "time": 1671916140, "resto": 56508262}, {"no": 56510813, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)16:37:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56509546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56509546</a><br>any pressure requirement is totally speculative.<br>letting youtubers live in your head rent free is not a good look.<br><br>the force transfer in a captive piston only has to occur for a fraction of the time that a traditional cartridge does.<br>it also has a fraction of the space that must be filled with that pressure.<br>a captured piston can use an incredibly short barrel.<br>many spigot mortars have no barrel at all, as a matter of fact. the fins stabilize it.<br><br>a regular cartridge must apply pressure for the entire length of the barrel, and overcome rifling.<br>they also get the barrel hot, and must eject cases.<br><br>weight and durability concerns are baseless.<br>there is nothing intrinsically weaker or heavier about it.<br>you&#039;re inventing problems to complain about.<br><br>take the PSS pistol, for instance. it has a 153 grain .30 cal bullet traveling at 600fps. i am suggesting a sub 100 grain spitzer bullet, preferably .50 cal for increased powder volume and a high BC.<br>keep in mind the SP4 captive piston ammo is a retrofitted 7.62x39 case using a solid bullet with a very tiny powder charge. picrel<br>i am suggesting a hollow bullet with a much more voluminous charge.<br>it is absolutely feasible. perhaps the hypothetical bullet will end up being as light as 50 grains.<br>it&#039;s simply a shell containing powder and a flat piston similar in size to the SP4&#039;s.", "filename": "927627_1485823444966003_353862461_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671917864964854, "time": 1671917864, "md5": "66Rnoq1tFE98XfiCIWMS2A==", "fsize": 29546, "resto": 56508262}, {"no": 56510863, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)16:43:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56510551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56510551</a><br>you&#039;re pulling figures out of your ass. captured piston ammo exists and is fielded in the form of mortars and grenades,<br>i don&#039;t care if you think it breaks physics.<br>my idea is to optimize existing, working designs for small size and speed. that&#039;s it.<br><br>you can invent bullshit all day if you want, it&#039;s meaningless white noise.", "time": 1671918184, "resto": 56508262}, {"no": 56510949, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)16:54:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56510863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56510863</a><br>Well you\u2019ll never actually make anything except burgers at McDonald\u2019s.

But here\u2019s the catch: you need to then decide which ribbon color you want to keep then hop on K and offer the remaining medals to other anons- spread the Christmas cheer a bit.<br><br>From Switzerland to anywhere stateside is 44 Swiss francs. If interested please reply with a burner email. First come first serve.

Not only are there accounts of slingstones and lead sling bullets penetrating significantly into human bodies, but we know for a fact it happened because there were recorded medical procedures and tools for attempting to remove them.<br>Now heavy slings require years to become proficient with (just like bows), and lighter slings are less effective. Even the mightiest Longbows and Arbalests were always niche, a useful support to your main force most of the time, and Slings were no different. <br>The advantage of slings over bows (for both the light ones kind of suck and the strong ones take forever to train) was in Logistics: While lead, carved stones and even clay projectiles were superior, ammunition, rough stones could be used to resupply if necessary, and even the hand crafted Sling ammo was far easier to make and supply than arrows. Slings could also be replaced for almost nothing, and could be issued to men who were only passable in their use for little extra bulk in case they needed to make do as skirmishers.", "time": 1671964411, "resto": 56514593}, {"no": 56515296, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)05:35:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56514603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56514603</a><br>retard<br>ever seen any protest and nigger ?<br><br>kids in palestine play with sling like it&#039;s baseball", "time": 1671964531, "resto": 56514593}, {"no": 56515309, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)05:38:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56514593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56514593</a><br>Longer range and more powerful until you get to fairly advanced bows.", "time": 1671964701, "resto": 56514593}, {"no": 56515319, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)05:42:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56515132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56515132</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s always been considered a pathetic pittable weapon.</span><br>It&#039;s been considered a pathetic, pitiable weapon in modern times only, as the use of it has died out and David has been transmogrified into a child in popular conception and historical slings were associated with forked-stick children&#039;s toys.<br>For all of history, generals basically made use of all the dedicated slingers they could get their hands on, and prized them highly. <br><br><a href=\"#p56515105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56515105</a><br><a href=\"#p56514897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56514897</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nearly the stopping power of a modern .44 magnum handgun, according to recent experiments.</span><br>You need to stop spreading this noguns meme, it&#039;s embarrassing for those of us who actually appreciate slings and their underappreciated power.<br><br>A sling can have as much or more Momentum than a .44 magnum bullet, yes, but that isn&#039;t the entire story.

Even before him the French Republican Armies resorted to these methods, but that was out of necessity more than by design. They just didnt have the resources to support large trains. Also the new Republican officers and rankers were not accustomed to rely on camp followers and servants as much as the the nobles and professional soldiers. <br>Napoleon separated logistics from the fighting component, main forces were tasked to destroy the enemy in decisive battle as quick as possible, for a limited time living off the land and carried provisions, and after them went separate units that set up the depots and ensured the delivery of supplies.

Missile defense \u2013 in effect hitting a bullet moving through the sky at supersonic speeds with another bullet \u2013 is an extremely expensive undertaking. Frequently used metaphors \u2013 such as \u201cshield\u201d or \u201cdome\u201d \u2013 are misleading. Missile defenses are really point defenses, capable only of defending limited high-value areas against a few incoming missiles. The Saudi success comes from firing at least two Patriot missiles \u2013 which cost the Saudis an estimated $3 million to $4.3 million each \u2013 at each target. The incoming missiles, predominantly Iranian made, cost a fraction of this; drones cost even less, probably less than $20,000.

At one point I probably had 50+ guns including several Tec 9s, MAC clones, Saturday Night Specials, etc. Then my life went to shit, she ran up credit cards and everything else, and I sold a lot of shit to secure us a house that ended up just being my house because things went south. This included most of my firearms, anything that wasn&#039;t sentimental besides a few essentials. <br><br>I built myself back up best I could, and now I mostly focus on higher quality pieces that I find at great deals. I still buy a few cheap shitters sometimes, but I&#039;m at the stage in my life where I&#039;d rather spend for quality with items that either make sense or have some kind of oddity appeal because I haven&#039;t outgrown my eccentric hipsterism. I rarely sell anything anymore, because there are guns I&#039;ve sold in years past that I really wish I still had and won&#039;t get the opportunity without spending crazy money (like the $1600 FS2000 gen 1 I got in 2009).<br><br><a href=\"#p56480442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56480442</a><br><br>Harbor freight has good deals on the cheap black tape, but the blue scotch is pricey but is great stuff.

It&#039;s no different than having a discussion about building homes with but a few if any in the discussion being carpenters. Much of the discussion necessitates that it is spent educating the participants, while letting their egos shut down debate especially on the more critical counterintuitive subjects. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that /k serves more to neuter the populations understanding of weapons and violence rather than to advance that understanding. That said, this thread in particular has highlighted my observations. I&#039;ve seen and been in many violent situations with edged and bludgeoning weapons in both open and tight quarters. Anyone who works in or has been confined to a violent American state prison for over a decade has this experience. My experience is with the Texas prison units known as gladiator farms. A dagger is the prison equivalent of an M4. Any offender armed with an effective dagger is nigh unstoppable while indoors. It would take time and special conditions for the staff to bring a firearm to bear. If outdoors, it&#039;s over in a second as the picket towers have M4 rifles with optics. A dagger is highly effective for what it&#039;s designed to do: Multiple deep and fatal stabs in quick succession. It goes in and out of flesh quickly and fairly easily due to its design. Its shape also induces far more trauma than a spike. It is a very good assassination weapon: Easily concealed, quick to bear, fatal wounds inflicted in less than a second. That&#039;s the only purpose of a dagger, it is by no means a utility knife of any sort, its a killing device under specific conditions. Such is the case of many weapons. Can you hunt white tail deer with .338 Lalpa? Technically, yes, but WHY? Especially if you had the goal of harvesting that deers meat. Weapons are tools. Tools are designed for the work asked of them.

Here are some complaints I&#039;ve heard:<br>- Lousy sheath. Yes, two-piece stitched leather sheath is a common design seen all over the world, however it has downsides, for example, a knife is kept in place only by a button which may open when you move through the bushes and the knife might fall out. And when, for example, you wear large backpacks with belts, you might have troubles with accessing your knife. And when you fall from anywhere, like, off the bike in an accident, the knife may cut through the sheath and wound you. Better alternative would be antique bottleneck style sheath hanging freely on the loop, as featured in many ethnic and ethnic-themed designs, such as puukkos, yakut blades, Helle Viking and Peltonen M95. <br>- The handle. It&#039;s assembled with large leather pieces. It feels relatively good in hand, it&#039;s better for cold environments than G10 or other synthetic materials. However leather requires care, can get worn faster than wood or bone, it soaks so the tang might get rusty, also it&#039;s round rather than barrel-shaped, so edge alignment in the dark might suffer. Why would they make those leather pieces large instead of using multiple small pieces anyway?", "time": 1671956956, "resto": 56498176}, {"no": 56515033, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:15:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56498176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56498176</a><br>Modern military knives are typically just kbars or a modern version of the m3.

There were all sorts of whacky not great ideas, typically either kbar,m3, or a stilleto combined with a knuckle duster of sorts.<br>What do you mean by dagger? Like a medieval dagger?

He is the Emperor of Russkind by the will of banan, and master of a million vatniks by the might of his inexhaustible corruption.

Vast armies give battle in his name in uncounted villages. Heaps of broken flesh fill the trenches. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Veh Deh Veh, the Blyat Marines, vodka-addled super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Rosgvardija and countless PMC forces, the ever vigilant FSB and the priests of the Russian Orthodoxy to name only a few.

With a few months of the kind of hard work that makes you curse the day of your birth, you&#039;ll be able to make something that *looks* like a Sten gun, and fires, and maybe even loads cartridges more often than it doesn&#039;t. But going from that to actually having an SMG that has 1 to 200 and not 1 to 5 failure to fire rate is basically impossible without machine-tools (at least a full-sized lathe). That&#039;s starting at &gt;$3000. I&#039;ve never seen proof to the contrary. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s literally impossible - but the amount of years it will take you to hand-craft a functional self-loader is far better invested into buying the machinery. Then you&#039;ll be able to breeze through it in a couple of weeks (if you already have your blueprints), then fine-tune for several months, and it&#039;s possible you&#039;ll get and SMG that could actually compete with WW2 surplus (if you&#039;re a good designer and machinist).<br>Human hands and hand-held power tools simply cannot replicate the precision of even mediocre machines. Yes, 2nd gen SMG&#039;s look &quot;simple&quot;. But they aren&#039;t. If you want to make a slam-bang or a pipebomb - sure, that&#039;s doable. If you want to make self-loading weapons that you could actually bring into fucking combat and not just plinking in the woods - you will have to become a machinist, with all of the severe costs that implies. It&#039;s why you almost never see weapons manufactured from scratch in rogue stays or partisan movements - and the few SMG&#039;s that they have are visibly made using machine-tools. Good example is the Chechen &quot;Borz&quot; series of SMG&#039;s. Sure, they managed to produce them immediately prior to and for a few months during the First Chechen War. But as soon as the Russians have flattened the Red Hammer factory and captured Grozny, that production stopped - forever. Same with ISIS.

There&#039;s nothing wrong with flapper-lock gas operation or other gas action designs, but I recommend rotation, as it&#039;s the most well-studied. Gas operation is very, very forgiving in its modification and tuning, much more so than any delayed blowback, let alone the cursed r*coil operation which should not be mentioned outside of shotguns or HMG&#039;s.<br>Specifically, gas operating rotating bolt is vastly superior to G3&#039;s *roller* delayed blowback, the most complex and finicky of the common delaying mechanisms. It is not simple, it is not easy, it is one of the hardest non-r*coil operated actions. Read about the development of Stg 45 and Mp 5; it takes an immense amount of prototyping and extreme precision to manufacture - don&#039;t even try this. If you ever want to try delayed blowback (I know I wouldn&#039;t, except maybe gas-delayed pistols), you should only try the lever-delay, that one is sort-of-simple, but the amount of precision milling operations you&#039;ll have to do is not significantly different from those on the AK BCG. Yes it doesn&#039;t have a gas system but it&#039;s not as if that&#039;s some kind of meme magical supercomputer clockwork time machine.

I think I&#039;m going to get a .22lr suppressor for hunting, then a PCP, despite the fact that the other way around would probably make more sense. Wait times for stamps are a bitch, though, so the sooner I start the process, the better. I have other air rifles, though, so it&#039;s a niche already partially filled. One partially filled by the Swarm, which I wish were smaller, but I love the quick loading. The other partially filled by the 1377, which I wish was mag fed, a pcp, and .22. You know, basically a Marauder with a stock.<br><br>I figure that buying a marauder with a decent scope will allow me to fill a role with what would otherwise would only be able to be filled by a takedown or an SBR. Pistols (firearms) wouldn&#039;t fill the role either as semi auto .22lr pistols are illegal to hunt with in this state despite semi auto .22lr rifles being totally fine. Bring a Marauder in a small hard (or well padded) case and if no foxes turn up while I&#039;m lugging around my .223, I can at least take it out to shoot some squirrels or maybe even groundhogs. Solves a problem I have, choosing what to take on a specific day. I can take a semi auto .22lr rifle as well as a .223 for fox, but it&#039;s hell on the back having to also bring all my other junk, including a little take-down seat if it&#039;s wet and cold out.<br><br><a href=\"#p56416316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416316</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for a PCP ban</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for an air rifle ban</span><br>Would be news to me.
