The campaigns, such as the Solomons, always sought to isolate the offensive theater and achieve overwhelming local superiority while preventing enemy replenishment.

Some accounts claim the station was equipped with a Nudelman-Rikhter &quot;Vulkan&quot; gun, which was a variant of the 23 mm Nudelman aircraft cannon, or possibly a Nudelman NR-30 30 mm gun. Later Russian sources indicate that the gun was the virtually unknown (in the West) Rikhter R-23.

The Rigellians attacked all races that they encountered, and killed the inhabitants of any planets that they conquered. Several less developed races were encountered and destroyed before the Rigellians simultaneously came into contact with the Federation and the Khanate in Interstellar War 3. Initially, the Rigellians had an advantage due to their exclusive use of strikefighters. But the other two nations were able to quickly develop their own designs, and the massive weight of numbers against the Rigellians eventually caused their defeat. Due to the genocidal tactics used by the Rigellians during ISW-3, it was decided that the only way to bring a real end to the war was to bomb every Rigellian world encountered, and the Rigellians were nearly destroyed as a race. The only known survivors were on a planet belatedly discovered some time later. The Rigellians on that world had fallen back to a pre-space level of technology, but were just as xenophobic as they had been when they flew through the cosmos.</span>", "time": 1673525719, "resto": 56731417}, {"no": 56731474, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:17:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56731435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56731435</a><br>Lmao coping this hard already in the thread?", "filename": "9oDrcRU", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 599, "h": 376, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1673525832667432, "time": 1673525832, "md5": "957z54YIlKCtZOYaWSlwyA==", "fsize": 19177, "resto": 56731417}, {"no": 56731530, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:26:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56731417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56731417</a><br>fuck...

In September, Zaluzhny gave an interview in Time magazine in which he praised his opposite number, Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, something unthinkable, for example, for a politician. \u201cI was raised on Russian military doctrine, and I still think that the science of war is all located in Russia,\u201d Zaluzhny told Time. \u201cI learned from Gerasimov. I read everything he ever wrote\u2026 He is the smartest of men, and my expectations of him were enormous.\u201d Savchuk interprets this as holding a double meaning: that Ukrainian officers understand their enemy. \u201cUnlike the Russian generals, they have shown that they are military men and that they command the Armed Forces.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zaluzhny was trained by the Red Army. This knowledge of the enemy has been key and something that the Russian military has shown it does not possess. Zaluzhny gave an example in his Time interview. Despite numerical inferiority, he laid a trap for the Russian troops advancing on Kyiv, which proved effective because his opponents did not know what they were facing. Months before the invasion, Zaluzhny had identified the three main routes Russia would use to invade from the north, via their own territory and Belarus. Instead of engaging the invader in the early stages of the invasion, he allowed them to advance to Kyiv\u2019s first defensive line and then staged swift attacks with small units on their rear and supply chains. Moscow\u2019s troops discovered too late that the population was not on their side either.</span>", "time": 1673486153, "resto": 56724111}, {"no": 56725702, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:16:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56725583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56725583</a><br>From Time&#039;s feature article on Zaluzhnyi:<br>https://time.com/6216213/ukraine-mi<wbr>litary-valeriy-zaluzhny/", "time": 1673486191, "resto": 56724111}, {"no": 56725717, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:17:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56725154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56725154</a><br>Alhamdulillah all my Brothers hate Russia.", "filename": "$_88", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 347, "h": 297, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1673486256399640, "time": 1673486256, "md5": "MfV1zwiChi3OPOOWyzAL5A==", "fsize": 43344, "resto": 56724111}, {"no": 56725725, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:18:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56724730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56724730</a><br>You know the Russian government promotes immigration of Central Asian Muslims to address their demographic/labor problems, right?<br><br>There&#039;s no real difference between the two.

He led the defense of Kyiv and with Kovalchuk masterminded the lightning counter-offensive on the Kharkiv front, which forced a Russian retreat back beyond the borders of Luhansk. The commander of Ukrainian Ground Forces proved that his men knew how to attack as well as defend. Syrskyi\u2019s tactics were based on NATO doctrine, but also on Gerasimov\u2019s own. Unlike the Russian Army, the Ukrainians prefer a less hierarchical structure, where front line commanders have autonomy to act on their own initiative.

I&#039;ve known plenty of non white girls who got pulled from school by their parents because they started screwing around with white guys. How many white parents do you think would cut their daughter&#039;s off for dating inter-racially? Non white men don&#039;t let white guys fuck their women. A leftist will couch this with some sociological justification along the lines of &quot;they had to sit on their hands at gunpoint and watch us fuck their women for centuries&quot;, but as a scientists I&#039;ll tell you the truth. It&#039;s a simple biological competition between different subspecies of man. Even socialist POC nations didn&#039;t allow white men to have consensual relations with their women. Take Cuba for example, a socialist nation built by the descendants of black and indigenous slaves. During the Cuban missile crisis there were a lot of Ruskies stationed there. These Russians would often canoodle with local women when on leave, and the Cubans hated it due to their history with whites in the past.

Little buddy isn&#039;t doing well. For a brief day or two, the increased meds seemed to be working, his liver swelling has gone down more and his eyes were clear and he could see me. Now he&#039;s not playing, not eating, not drinking. He lays under the dining room table, his eyesight seems to be bad again. All we could get him to eat was some tuna-flavored tapioca paste that the vet would give him (it&#039;s only like 6 calories per tube, so not much), and he drank a small amount of water, but that was on the morning of the 2nd. He&#039;s just returned to laying under the table and taking nothing, he feels cold to the touch.<br>By all accounts, it seems like his liver is failing, and he&#039;s probably going to die. We&#039;re now looking at an in-home euthanasia service so he doesn&#039;t need to leave his home or his family. If the weather in the morning permits, I&#039;m going to bring him outside to the back yard. It&#039;s only fair, he&#039;s wanted to go out there for the whole of his short little life, and we kept saying he could when he was a little bigger in the spring, lest an owl or hawk grab him. I think now is the time to grant that wish, he won&#039;t last that long unless a miracle happens. I don&#039;t think he would run if he wanted to anyway.<br>Thanks for the sympathy and support that you guys have given through this ordeal. I may try to post some videos I have of him later if it&#039;s alright. I&#039;m currently posting from work, so when I finally post again it will probably be after he&#039;s gone.

You&#039;ll need to do some research on introducing a new cat into a house that already has cats. There&#039;s do&#039;s &amp; dont&#039;s to make it comfortable &amp; happy for everyone.<br><br>First tip: new cat(s) should be younger than the older cat. There is automatic seniority dominance, which can be groomed into a relationship even if the dynamics change later. Any cat under ~3 years old is still largely a kitten &amp; can be easily subverted with food, play, food, attention, play, food, more attention ... They tend to accept the newcomer as a playmate if the humans set the environment.<br><br>The established resident has run of the house, for example. Bring the newcomer in &amp; they get locked in a room the first 24 hours before they meet so they get used to each other in the same house &amp; their scents. For the first few months, until they clearly get along without harm to each other, the established senior gets the house, the newcomer gets put into a room if things get a bit spicy between them.<br><br>Get them eating together, do not allow them to eat each others&#039; food, at least the first 6 months. Keep them close to each other, feed them at the same time, talk to both, give both attention, separate them (gently, no drama) if either infringes on the other. <br><br>Get them to play together. In the same room at first. Play with the senior cat first, draw the other in. I would walk around the room dragging 2 strings. Each would take their own string at first, after a few sessions they figured out playtime and even started wrestling each other without fighting.<br><br>Your cat is very young. This is the best time to introduce a new cat the same age or slightly younger. By the time they are 2 they will be like littermates for life. There are exceptions, but do your part and it&#039;s very rare. I brought a 6 month kitten into a house with a 7 year old cat. It worked out fine, but I put a lot into it up front.", "time": 1672987147, "resto": 56586661}, {"no": 56648782, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:00:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56647505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56647505</a> <a href=\"#p56647880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56647880</a> --&gt; CT&#039;d --&gt;<br>One thing you can take advantage of is that your cat is already a girl. She will be highly territorial. Bringing in another girl is not the optimal situation here, so try to bring in a younger male, maybe 6-8 or ~10 months. She will establish dominance, but will have mothering instinct triggered (very strong in cats) &amp; set her littermate senses set tingling ... plus the spice of a sexy young male. This is probably your best option for best chances to succeed, especially if this is the first time you are attempting it.<br><br>Your current cat will have feelings on the issue. Be sensitive to them, talk to her about them, give her reassurance that she&#039;s still the prettiest girl, give extra grooming, playtime, attention in general. It&#039;ll smooth things out greatly for the first few weeks &amp; months. The newcomer interrupts, give him attention, but don&#039;t stop giving the most attention to your good girl.<br><br>You are playing the role of the third cat I mentioned. Break up bad behavior patterns with firm authority, encourage good behavior patterns. My 7 year old always slept with me (a boy). The new kitten (also a boy) insisted on sleeping with us. The older cat objected &amp; pouted, would walk away, but always come back because it was HIS bed. I fell asleep every night with one of them on each side of me, petting both of them until I fell asleep. They would both calm down &amp; purr, so they could hear &amp; smell each other but not see or touch. A month later they were falling asleep leaning against each other, in bed with me or otherwise.<br><br>The younger cat had huge kitten energy &amp; bullied the older cat.

Eventually got one. Got a killer deal on it in a trade. Some dumbass hillbilly wanted a &quot;tactical gun&quot; so I traded him a WASR back when they were like $500. Turns out the model he had a Lew Horton exclusive 686-1. Even gave me a custom leather iwb for it. Took it to the range once a month. One day I was range shooting and felt something blow back and hit my cheek. Unloaded the gun and went about inspecting it immediately. A small piece of the forcing come had broken off and the inside of the barrel had cracked. I was obviously very concerned and upset. Contacted S&amp;W. First guy I spoke with seemed genuinely concerned for my safety when I told him what had happened. All went well but we got disconnected. Second guy sounded like I had woken him from a nap and was very rude and insincere. Told me they&#039;d send me a postage to use for sending the gun in. I would have to pay $60 for their gunsmith to inspect my weapon and after they determined the issue they would send me an estimate for the cost of repairs. I told them to fuck themselves. Sold it as-is to a gunsmith I know and bought a Ruger. From what I hear their customer service used to be dogshit awful and since then it&#039;s improved greatly but I will still use every opportunity I get to tell that story.

Keep in mind this is the period of time before Russia get&#039;s the majority of it&#039;s meat shields into the country.</span><br>The smartest thing the Ukrainians can do during the attrition period besides holding the line is to keep targeting Russian heavy equipment wherever they can find it. Hit it with their artillery, their guided shells, their GMLR rockets, their drones, their HARM, their JDAM, anything that can reach out and touch them. Russian tanks, artillery guns, AFV&#039;s, trucks, aircraft, supply depots, anything. Lose shit in the process if they have to, it will be replaced, the Russian shit won&#039;t. At the end of the day 1,000 men in an armored, mechanized force properly supported by artillery is a lot more dangerous than 10,000 men with 5,000 rifles. Thankfully it seems like they&#039;ve done a good job of it so far.<br>The second most important thing is training men, as many as they can. Ukraine has something like over seven million men considered fit for military service. I am not saying throw them into the war and over burden logistics, but start cycling them through basic training and get as many potential replacements ready to deploy as needed. I would imagine they are doing this as well.<br>Third I would say is equipment. The west is furnishing Ukraine for a Spring offensive, we are already seeing the armor roll in. On the more secretive side the Ukrainians captured an absolute fuck ton of gear from the Russians at Izium, it is apparently being refurbished for Spring as well. They are generating a massive armored force whilst degrading the Russians in return, we will see the real fruits of that in a few months.

There&#039;s something wrong, either the length of pull or the drop of the stock. If you have a gun nearby it&#039;s fairly easy to check the drop.<br>Pick some point in the distance you can focus on and concentrate your vision on that point. Hold your shotgun and then quickly raise it up to your shoulder as though you are going to shoot--basically pretend that whatever spot you picked is a clay. Concentrate your vision on that spot, not the gun. Now, after you&#039;ve raised the gun up, what do you see when the rib is in your vision? If you can see the rear of the rib but not the bead then your stock has too much drop and the result is that the barrels are pointing slightly down. And vice-versa: if you can see the front bead and the whole length of the rib, sort of like what a runway looks like from the perspective of a landing plane, there is not enough drop and as a result the barrels are pointing slightly high.

And since everybody likes to think that their gun is extra special or maybe they&#039;re just trying to maximize their return, so they ask high prices.<br><br>There&#039;s basically two ways go to about finding milsurp without getting ripped off. One is to just keep looking as much as possible--constantly scour auction listings, forums, dealers who specialize in surp, hit up the local pawn shops and LGS that carry used guns. Make sure those places know what you&#039;re looking for--you want to cultivate a relationship with them so whenever the get surp in they contact you and ask if you&#039;re interested. Eventually you will find deals, it&#039;s just a numbers game, but it&#039;s a lot harder than it was pre-internet. Use tools like saved searches on Gunbroker. Remember to search for typos and misspellings.<br>The other way is to buy it from a reputable auction house or a dealer who specializes in this kind of thing. The price won&#039;t be great, but it will usually be fair, and those kinds of places tend to stand behind what they sell so the risk of the gun being a fake or having problems is a lot lower.<br><br>Also do you fucking homework before you buy. Study up on the variations of the gun(s) you are interested in. Learn to identify fakes.

The prices really depend on how many of that kind of gun are in the auction. For example, say there&#039;s a big surp auction coming up at RIA, you want a G41(M) and they just happen to have one. Problem is, you have to battle it out with the other people who also want one. And depending on how many people there are and how badly at least two of them want the gun the price could go very high. On the other hand, let&#039;s say they have three of them in the auction instead. Now there are more to go around so the price won&#039;t rise as high. It doesn&#039;t necessarily even have to be the same gun; I&#039;d expect a lone G41(M) to sell for a lot more in an auction where it was the only high-end German WWII piece, whereas if the auction also had a bunch of other similarly priced German stuff it may not have as many people fighting over it. Watch for that.<br><br>The other rule of auctions is not to get carried away in the hype. Know your budget and stick to it.
