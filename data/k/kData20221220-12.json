Precision is not only vastly more efficient in the effects it delivers but also allows the force to reduce its logistics tail and thereby makes it more survivable.

Sometimes the opposite happens - another Napoleon innovation was to split up the army into Corps which could fight independently or concentrate as needed. (Sound familiar? Dispersion.)

They have consistently failed to sway public opinion towards gun control since Columbine in 1999 so America has been subjected to an endless stream of mass killings ever since. (Plus operation Fast and Furious.) Just like getting America into WW1 with the sinking of the Lusitania, banning Americas guns will take a lot of government influenced violence.<br><br>In Australia the guns are already gone (due to just one mass shooting) so further false flags are not needed, hence no more mass murder in Australia. New Zealand, the UK, and Canada are all the extact same thing.

Repeaters are for when your radio isn&#039;t powerful enough to get your signal to where it needs to go; if the repeater is close enough that you can use less than the maximum wattage but want to avoid being detected then it&#039;s pretty obvious that you&#039;re very close to the repeater - which, as its entire point is to blast a signal farther than you can, is generally less than stealthy.

Repeaters are definitely a juicy target though because destroying one can severely impair enemy coordination and information sharing - especially if they&#039;re also doing something like routing traffic. Imagine the black circle in pic rel is the repeater&#039;s range, red is Lt. Sasha, Blue is Sgt. Alexi and green is Sgt. Ivan. With the repeater up, only Sasha is in TX range of the repeater but the repeater is more powerful and will send it back out to both Alexi and Ivan. Sasha and Alexi can talk to each other without the repeater because they&#039;re within range of each other, but they can&#039;t reach Sgt. Ivan and Sgt. Ivan can&#039;t reach them. If Lt. Sasha gets a call on the satphone telling him that there are BMPs moving to flank Sgt. Ivan and that Sgt. Ivan needs to get out of there, he needs the repeater to pass that along and if the repeater is down then Sgt Ivan is on his own.<br><br><a href=\"#p56457593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56457593</a><br>Reminds me of that guy from Kentucky.", "filename": "repeater", "ext": ".png", "w": 1152, "h": 648, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671523370682451, "time": 1671523370, "md5": "NDg/ZZDkGzZdQDbgJWHxCQ==", "fsize": 14258, "resto": 56450475}, {"no": 56457742, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)03:09:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56450475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56450475</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Disclosure: Murz is a communication officer in the Russian army.</span><br>No. He is in DNR.

Fewer people are going to upload videos where their hit fails to cause significant harm to the tank. Besides that, it kind of depends on ERA, some ERA, like Kontakt I, the bricks, are vintage like early 1980&#039;s stuff, so they will have very limited effectivenss against munitions that are designed to counter them. Secondly, I think we have to consider how effective they are compared to having nothing extra at all. Even if they will provide little protection against more modern munitions or only provide protection for one or two hits, that&#039;s still better than just having &#039;70&#039;s vintage composite armor of a T-72 or T-64. A lot of munitions available to both Russia or Ukraine are older munitions that ERA may be more able to counter; I think this especially works in favor of Ukrainian tanks with ERA as the Russians have fewer Western AT munitions. Thirdly, cope squares aren&#039;t necessarily useless. It&#039;s pretty common for militaries to allow troops to have things that may not provide much tangible benefit, but which might make crews or ground troops feel safer and therefore have a higher morale (e.g. tankers in WWII putting sandbags or tracks on their tanks).", "time": 1671499277, "resto": 56454864}, {"no": 56455495, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:20:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56454864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56454864</a><br>Cope Cubes", "time": 1671502807, "resto": 56454864}, {"no": 56455665, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:37:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56454864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56454864</a><br>There have been several.

If you are looking for an FN Model 50 i can only give you a bit of info, not much out there on these rifles. In the 50s FN made a contract with Colombia, since columbia got a ton of 30-06 surplus from the good ol USA for a good price. They made their last military mausers: The FN Model 50 in 30-06. They have a longer magazine and action and a cutout in the Receiver to accomodate longer 30-06 loads. They also made the stripper clip groove wider, i think for Springfield clips originally. They also send some of these Rifles to the congo, and kept some for their own army in reserve. The Colombian ones got the colombian crest on the receiver, the belgian ones the crown and the kings name in short. The colombians also converted some old 1924 Rifles to 30-06, those will have a &quot;30&quot; behind the stripper clip groove. A lot of the belgian ones will have the crown and other markings scrubbed off like mine. Also they made these with a grey-green type of coating for the colombian navy and the congo and black paint for the colombian and belgian army. They made two types: The shorter 1930 pattern and the longer 1924 pattern, mine is a 1924 pattern with a straight bolt handle and 23 inch barrel. They should take K98, VZ24 and Preduzece and FN bayonets. One very characteristic thing is a special buttplate with a wave pattern for more grip. Generally the &quot;Congo&quot; models saw alot of action and are worn accordingly, the belgian and colombian army ones are normally in great condition. Again, FN made these long after the war with the best materials and 30 years of experience, they are great shooters. Oh also, some (like mine) were refurbished before being sold to the civilian market, mine has a non matching stock in a great color and with FN Arsenal markings, thats normal as well. Also also, some have a 2000 meter rear sight, some have a 1900. Not sure whats up with that, i think they reused old parts for the rear sight", "filename": "FNStock", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2364, "h": 1773, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671311567024526, "time": 1671311567, "md5": "LNu61Iq6d8p3y9AQ/yCudA==", "fsize": 544335, "resto": 56426949, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56432468, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)16:26:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56432361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56432361</a><br>pic related is the buttstock pad, unique as far as i know. works fairly good as well, i swear 30-06 has less recoil than 8x57", "filename": "FN50Buttplate", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2364, "h": 1773, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671312363258585, "time": 1671312363, "md5": "ZGVahUYo4ukO4CN3a9H1XA==", "fsize": 519507, "resto": 56426949, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56433537, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:32:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56431918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56431918</a><br>OP here. Frankly the thing about 6.5 Swedes is they realized, they don&#039;t need to fire artillery shells out of their rifles, because they shoot further and faster than is required for most engagements. 6.5 55 only has about 6-7lb of recoil, which is very forgiving; when they introduced the cartridge a increase in accuracy for their troops was pretty obvious from the start, because it&#039;s easier to have troops that are confident with their caliber and control the recoil easier. As other anon said, they are only now deciding to use 6.5 in military rifles, which wasn&#039;t something they just &quot;realized&quot; everybody just choose to be retards and use artillery shells instead. <br><br>I found my M96 in a pawn shop, all the parts match, and it&#039;s in practically factory condition besides minor rust spots that I&#039;ve since steel wooled off, the bluing on the steel is some of the best quality I&#039;ve seen from this period, I mean seriously the bluing looks better than some of the newer rifles I have.", "time": 1671319952, "resto": 56426949}, {"no": 56433559, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:35:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56431797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56431797</a><br>why are fags like you coming on a weapons board and complaining about people posting weapons. kys faggot", "time": 1671320123, "resto": 56426949}, {"no": 56434065, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)19:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56426949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426949</a><br>Never expected to enjoy shooting this fella so much.", "filename": "Mosin Nagant PU", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4690, "h": 970, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 25, "tim": 1671323503349472, "time": 1671323503, "md5": "uJ4wLuhDXumZLOWUpN1qQg==", "fsize": 1290194, "resto": 56426949, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56434982, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)21:11:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Here&#039;s my American Made Savage No.4 Mk.1*<br>She was missing parts when I got her, despite being in beautiful condition.<br>She was missing both barrel band screws, The front sight protector and screw, her magazine, the bolt was stuck in upside down.

As other anons have already said, target identification is many times easier with a magnified optic than the naked eye. A PSO optic also comes with a rangfinder for both standing and prone targets, which makes determining the range of a target simple. You place the target between the two lines. That&#039;s it. So now you want to take your shot. That thin chevron is a much smaller focal point to focus on, rather than the wide, flat top of a front sight post. At distances greater than 200+ meters, your front sight post is going to look wider than the target and trying to place that in its center is simply going to take more effort, and more time. You have to continually move your focus between the front sight post and your target to ensure a good shot can be made, all while keeping sight allignment and sight picture. Once you find the focal point in an optic it&#039;s the only one you have to be made. These, when paired together, are all fantastic net positives for a bit of extra weight.<br><br>Other optics like the ACOG have features like a bullet drop indicator, making shot placement require less effort.<br><br>Nobody, at all, ever, once in this thread, tried to tell you that they make objects bigger.

I think I&#039;m going to get a .22lr suppressor for hunting, then a PCP, despite the fact that the other way around would probably make more sense. Wait times for stamps are a bitch, though, so the sooner I start the process, the better. I have other air rifles, though, so it&#039;s a niche already partially filled. One partially filled by the Swarm, which I wish were smaller, but I love the quick loading. The other partially filled by the 1377, which I wish was mag fed, a pcp, and .22. You know, basically a Marauder with a stock.<br><br>I figure that buying a marauder with a decent scope will allow me to fill a role with what would otherwise would only be able to be filled by a takedown or an SBR. Pistols (firearms) wouldn&#039;t fill the role either as semi auto .22lr pistols are illegal to hunt with in this state despite semi auto .22lr rifles being totally fine. Bring a Marauder in a small hard (or well padded) case and if no foxes turn up while I&#039;m lugging around my .223, I can at least take it out to shoot some squirrels or maybe even groundhogs. Solves a problem I have, choosing what to take on a specific day. I can take a semi auto .22lr rifle as well as a .223 for fox, but it&#039;s hell on the back having to also bring all my other junk, including a little take-down seat if it&#039;s wet and cold out.<br><br><a href=\"#p56416316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416316</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for a PCP ban</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for an air rifle ban</span><br>Would be news to me.

For example, the F-35 has integrated helmet controls, so a pilot can turn his head and lock onto an enemy aircraft and launch a missile.

It wasn&#039;t one weapon that did it. <br><br>I will say though the Ottomans had a couple of aces up their sleeve that they owe their success to. <br>-A proffessional army, they weren&#039;t that unique in this regard but they were early adopters compared to most of their neighbors, and levies and knights can&#039;t compare.<br>-Coffee, imported from africa and then the Middle East, it allows your soldiers to stay awake during marches and sieges, as well as good for boosting morale, arguable the only real combat drug that exists. <br>-Vaccines, the islamic world better preserved knowledge of the Classical Age, and would rub all the kids of the village against the sick one to innoculate them, other times they&#039;d cut off a bit of the sick kids skin and sew it underneath again for innoculation. The Ottomans did this likewise meaning that their population growth was way higher than the average for Europe, meaning the nation bounced back after major battles way faster than European Nations thought possible. <br>-Cannons, this wasn&#039;t an edge they had for long as the Mongols helped introduce gunpowder to the rest of Europe and the Middle East, but one of the prominent early use of Cannons was in the Seige of Constantinople that was vital to breaking their legendary defenses.", "time": 1671420299, "resto": 56436809}, {"no": 56445498, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)22:35:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56436809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56436809</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Matchlocks for Oda vs Takeda at Nagashino</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Turtle ships for Koreans vs Japs a few decades later</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Big sail ships for the Portuguese at Cochin</span><br><br>In general, plenty of engagements around the time firearms were introduced.", "time": 1671420929, "resto": 56436809}, {"no": 56445512, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)22:39:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56436809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56436809</a><br>Maybe radar?<br><br>Although it&#039;s about as far from a self-proclaimed superweapons as you can get, they tried to cover up it&#039;s existence as long as possible.", "time": 1671421168, "resto": 56436809}, {"no": 56445534, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)22:44:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56444794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56444794</a><br>This is %100 cope.

Because they likewise tended to keep their ace pilots in the field.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most airplanes at the time had vacuum sealed gas-tanks.</span><br><br>Actually, self-sealing tanks were very much a rarity when the A6M hit the field in 1940. (And they weren&#039;t vacuum sealed. The way they generally worked was by layering vulcanized rubber, untreated rubber and treated reinforcing fabric over each other. In case of a leak, the untreated rubber around it would soak up escaping fuel, swell up and seal the hole.)<br><br>To put it into perspective, the F4F-3 Wildcat was one of the earliest USN planes with self-sealing tanks, and only entered production around the same time the Zero had its first flight. And the inital tank design on the F4F-3 also didn&#039;t work properly. They only managed to get working ones mere days before Coral Sea.<br><br>The Zerodidn&#039;t remove anything, it just didn&#039;t have something that most planes of its generation didn&#039;t have. Later adoption proved problematic because the extra weight and reduced range would cause a lot of issues and the Japanese were hesitant to make major model changes out of fear of having to reduce production. The A5M5 model received one-shot nitrogen fire extinguishing systems for its fuel tanks instead, which just wouldn&#039;t save the remaining fuel in the tank. Late M5s and the M6 model then finally introduced full self-sealing tanks.<br><br>Again, I can only recommend watching this:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApO<wbr>fbxpL4Dg&amp;t=7092s [Remove]", "time": 1671426756, "resto": 56439487}, {"no": 56446256, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:15:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56446240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56446240</a><br>Interesting info on the Zero&#039;s.

I really dreaded my own rifle, although I had been accustomed to heavy charges of powder, and severe recoil for some years. None of my men could fire it, and it was looked upon with a species of awe, and it was named &quot;Jenna-El-Mootfah&quot; (Child of a Cannon) by the Arabs, which being far too long a name for practice, I christened it the &quot;Baby;&quot; and the scream of this &quot;Baby&quot; loaded with a half-pound shell was always fatal. It was far too severe, and I very seldom fired it, but it is a curious fact, that I never fired a shot with that rifle without bagging: the entire practice, during several years, was confined to about twenty shots. I was afraid to use it; but now and then it was absolutely necessary that it should be cleaned, after months of staying loaded. On such occasions my men had the gratification of firing it, and the explosion was always accompanied by two men falling on their backs (one having propped up the shooter), and the &quot;Baby&quot; flying some yards behind them.

Tangent, but related: CRT TVs put out a small amount of radiation; some time in the 40s or 50s IIRC some cheap TVs were putting out a little too much so the government (US) ended up regulating how much radiation they can put out and started requiring companies to just make the front of the picture tubes out of leaded glass. It blocks at least some of the radiation. And no, you&#039;re not getting eye or brain cancer from a CRT; even at sitting-at-desk distances, it gives roughly the same radiation as the sun itself.

I was not carrying at the time because I hadn&#039;t got my CC permit, so I took a wood-stocked Mossberg pump and decided this would do on my budget if I had to defend myself, be it home defense or having to fight my way through a horde of darkies to get there first.<br>In the end, the police here ended up shutting it down before it even got to the chimpout phase, so it was quiet for the rest of the year and I felt dumb for panic-buying it when I didn&#039;t need it, especially because I lost out on the double barrel I wanted and because I probably could have gotten something better for the price like an SKS or something.<br>After that I decided I would never let my fears get the best of me again. It certainly shouldn&#039;t happen again because I&#039;ve armed myself better since then with guns I&#039;ve done a fair bit of research on. If something like 2020 Floydfest does happen again, my AR should suffice. And I do still have that shotgun, so perhaps one day it&#039;s purchase will be vindicated.", "time": 1671519014, "resto": 56455893}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 56453556, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:47:49", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Military tunnel boring machine", "com": "Is it time for a tunnel boring machine for the field?", "filename": "national-museum-of-military", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 367, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1671490069623711, "time": 1671490069, "md5": "ZHv1wNtuGXHIUZrM7z+3rg==", "fsize": 43452, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "military-tunnel-boring-machine", "replies": 20, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 16}, {"no": 56453929, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:29:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "That&#039;s a trencher<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do you even heavy equipment?</span>", "filename": "1670882976601853", "ext": ".gif", "w": 384, "h": 378, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1671492540954327, "time": 1671492540, "md5": "tFP+nWy9D+z4ncNjdaQ4ZA==", "fsize": 2286894, "resto": 56453556}, {"no": 56454484, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:31:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56453929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56453929</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bots broken</span>", "time": 1671496271, "resto": 56453556}, {"no": 56455738, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:43:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56453556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56453556</a><br>Unironically yes", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 871, "h": 487, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1671504199404593, "time": 1671504199, "md5": "bGJWyhuZ9p7IMrAk2c9xsw==", "fsize": 353077, "resto": 56453556}, {"no": 56456415, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:02:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56453556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56453556</a><br>Subterrene warfare is not talked about enough.
