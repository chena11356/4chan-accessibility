The mutts had been meekly obeying british demands for the entire century prior, and their continued obedience made them ideal subordinates to finance the British effort in the Great War, and then serve as cannonfodder auxiliaries once they realised that Britain had them yet again by the balls and could collapse their whole economy by just defaulting on those loans.

A revolver with six shots should be perfectly adequate for self-defense. So 6+1 semi-auto should be enough for pocket pistol, yes?<br><br>2) Service weapons. For Police, military, security forces use. These are the full-sized guns that you openly carry as part of your uniform.<br>I think that the standard load-out for these is something like 15-18 rounds in a gun + two space mags on the belt, yes? A Beretta M9 seems to do just fine with only 15 rounds, and is kinda-sorta seen as acceptable choice. CZ75 (which has been used as service weapon for like 30 major countries + numerous clones) holds 16. Glock 17 holds 17, and is pretty much considered the modern standard, if for nothing else than easy procurement and availability of spare parts. <br><br>3) Competition/sports/hobby guns. These are the fancy ones. With all the bells and whistles with red-dots and attached flashlights and hair triggers and whatnot. These usually have a slightly higher mag capacity than the service models, anything between 18-20 or so. They also seem to be often hammer-fired and have a dedicated safety switch. Usually for match rules. <br><br>So in this thread I would just like to ask, what do you consider to be &quot;suitable&quot; amount of ammo for specific uses? Don&#039;t just say &quot;as much as possible&quot; because that&#039;s the easy way out. <br><br>So? is 6+1 enough for a pocket pistol? Is 15 enough for a service weapon or do you REALLY need that extra 2-3 rounds?
