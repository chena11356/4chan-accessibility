How do you stop a bunch of rifle sized drones coming at your position from every angle at 10-3,000 feet above the deck? You can&#039;t be spewing flak above your head 24/7.<br><br>Active protection and having your own drones up will likely be the best way to counter them.<br><br>Of course, hard limits on silicone processing efficiency and battery life might temporarily cap drone efficiency. But only temporarily, wetware and hybots solve that problem. You can run a human brain, petaflops of processing power, off a Snickers bar. Evolution has already given us a model for computation orders of magnitude more efficient than our best processors. That&#039;s where the next big revolution will likely be. Hell, companies are already writing jpgs, mp4s, and ASCII text to DNA. A DNA hard drive lets you store the information content of the entire internet circa 2017 in a shot glass in a way far more stable than hard drives. The bio-information revolution is the future.<br><br>So 2150, maybe you don&#039;t even do urban combat.
