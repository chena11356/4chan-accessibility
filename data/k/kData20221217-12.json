I think I&#039;m going to get a .22lr suppressor for hunting, then a PCP, despite the fact that the other way around would probably make more sense. Wait times for stamps are a bitch, though, so the sooner I start the process, the better. I have other air rifles, though, so it&#039;s a niche already partially filled. One partially filled by the Swarm, which I wish were smaller, but I love the quick loading. The other partially filled by the 1377, which I wish was mag fed, a pcp, and .22. You know, basically a Marauder with a stock.<br><br>I figure that buying a marauder with a decent scope will allow me to fill a role with what would otherwise would only be able to be filled by a takedown or an SBR. Pistols (firearms) wouldn&#039;t fill the role either as semi auto .22lr pistols are illegal to hunt with in this state despite semi auto .22lr rifles being totally fine. Bring a Marauder in a small hard (or well padded) case and if no foxes turn up while I&#039;m lugging around my .223, I can at least take it out to shoot some squirrels or maybe even groundhogs. Solves a problem I have, choosing what to take on a specific day. I can take a semi auto .22lr rifle as well as a .223 for fox, but it&#039;s hell on the back having to also bring all my other junk, including a little take-down seat if it&#039;s wet and cold out.<br><br><a href=\"#p56416316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416316</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for a PCP ban</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone calling for an air rifle ban</span><br>Would be news to me.

Would cost more than a Mini-14 but the cheaper AR magazines will make up the difference.<br>https://fightlite.com/lowers/scr-ri<wbr>fle-lowers", "time": 1671253283, "resto": 56425233, "trip": "!!97+h1uLls6Q"}, {"no": 56426487, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:11:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56426418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56426418</a><br>beautiful, thanks anon", "time": 1671253862, "resto": 56425233}, {"no": 56426763, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:52:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56425233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56425233</a><br>You forgot your M203 king.", "filename": "G3 M203 in Mexico", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 675, "h": 844, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671256323509362, "time": 1671256323, "md5": "AeYDEOR2rCGR+jBGwbJ4ww==", "fsize": 230560, "resto": 56425233}, {"no": 56426819, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:58:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56425233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56425233</a><br>G 3 M A S T E R R A C E<br>3<br>M<br>A<br>S<br>T<br>E<br>R<br>R<br>A<br>C<br>E", "filename": "81C9E37E-442E-48F1-8EF2-E0C4F0CB9E84", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 529, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 68, "tim": 1671256722738630, "time": 1671256722, "md5": "MqqnX16ft6QBShN8HGLTAg==", "fsize": 45635, "resto": 56425233}, {"no": 56426832, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:59:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56425616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56425616</a><br>they&#039;re like 1200+ now", "time": 1671256797, "resto": 56425233}, {"no": 56427129, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:04:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56425333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56425333</a><br>Thry&#039;te both stamped retardio", "time": 1671260653, "resto": 56425233}, {"no": 56427353, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:52:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56425233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56425233</a><br>don&#039;t know about more but i prefer this", "filename": "m1a", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671263529718458, "time": 1671263529, "md5": "pZgCeaF2k9f0i0iI/usefA==", "fsize": 2943330, "resto": 56425233, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56428123, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)06:52:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56425590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56425590</a><br>It sucks<br>My first army issue<br>Glad i rock the m16 now", "time": 1671277925, "resto": 56425233}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 56424577, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:05:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be French</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;made one gun that shoots 3 bullets at once</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the mag capacity is not divisible by 3</span>", "filename": "famasf11", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 358, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1671239112097829, "time": 1671239112, "md5": "XdrkK8U661dd4kRlMFRUIQ==", "fsize": 44629, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "be-french", "replies": 53, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 33}, {"no": 56424597, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:07:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56424577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56424577</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be French</span><br>well there&#039;s the problem", "time": 1671239278, "resto": 56424577}, {"no": 56424601, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:08:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56424577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56424577</a><br>They decided at the last minute to change it from a 5 round burst to 3.

Granted, it was the &quot;gen 1&quot; model from when they first started making them so maybe they&#039;ve sorted out the issues by now but the trigger on mine had a very gritty/crunchy take-up. I took the thing apart and cleaned and oiled it and could not smooth out the trigger no matter how thoroughly I lubed it up. The sights and barrel alignment were slightly off as well, I had to dial the factory rear sight as far over to the right as it could to get it to match POI.

The ass goes up and the nose goes down. It became a big lever with the fan acting as the fulcrum. Effectively for most of a second the fulcrum moving cancelled out the force from the engine. Then the fan was no longer able to keep up and continue canceling out the engine. The force applied then caused the load on the other end that is the nose to go down. If the fan was powerful enough to counteract with enough lift the plane would have just gone up instead. Please don&#039;t make me draw diagrams.

Though if you look at the video you can see the fan IS actually doing it&#039;s thing but the engine still pushes the back up and nose down. I&#039;m sure if the pilot had set the throttle properly it would have been plenty recoverable.

My grandfather on that side of the family narrowly escaped the Gestapo on more than one occasion and got shot up by British Mosquitos when he fled to England, and his later wife, my grandmother, had nothing good to say about the Germans, but still told me outright that the regular German soldiers never did anything to anyone, and acted properly.

Like you can call in any fire support from AI artillery using your radio with a slow response time and a rigid order of fire, but if you&#039;ve got a human manning the gun and able to type in the coords you say, then the artillery is more accurate, since a human can account for azimuth and fire high/low to make the rounds arrive quicker and can fire as fast as the gun reloads; plus a player can offer sheafs to fit requests.

This plan was put on hold after several major peace demonstrations following the Pentagon Papers leak to the Washington Post, which became Nixon&#039;s priority ultimately resulting in the Watergate scandal.

ARs and other modern military style rifles were a thing, but they were a niche like any other whereas now they are sort of the defacto standard. I think there&#039;s five main reasons why the AR became as popular as it is today:<br>1) the Clinton AWB, and laws like it, made people REALLY want what the gov said that they couldn&#039;t have. Plenty of people who previously didn&#039;t really care one way or the other about ARs suddenly wanted one because this might be their last chance to get one.<br>2) As the market grew ARs became inexpensive. The fact that they are so modular meant that people could buy one part-by-part as they could afford.<br>3) They are available in a variety of calibers and configurations which mean they are honestly a very practical suggestion for a variety of applications, from target shooting to hunting to defense.<br>4) They are honestly very simple to use. Accessible is another way to describe it: Recoil is light, manual of arms is simple, gun is easy to clean, work on, and modify. Ammo is relatively inexpensive compared to other calibers. It is beginner-friendly.<br>5) It&#039;s appearance in media, i.e. games and action movies.

I also remember the gun ranges were alot different. There was an old WW2 vet at our gun club that showed up twice a year with his garand and his 1911 he took home from the war. The guys were all... different. People talked to each other. And being a kid at the time id see someone shooting a cool gun and want to go see it. If i went over most every time they would let me shoot it, then let my dad shoot it, then it just became guys shooting each others guns and having a great time. Hell i even remember me and my asshole friends riding our bikes all over the damn county with our .22s over our shoulders and little CCI 50 round boxes of ammo jammed in our pockets. It was great. When the ban ended me and my dad both bought ARs. He got a full on A2 clone, i wanted an M4 clone.", "time": 1671241404, "resto": 56409001}, {"no": 56425085, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:59:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56424928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56424928</a><br>1990&#039;s gun show nostalgia is great. Fudd lore was the rule of the day and a lot of the guys that were into military rifles were survivalist types that also had conversion books and the jolly roger cookbook on those wire shelves for about $5 apiece. I tried every trigger gimmick like the hellfire and the GAT trigger on my Norinco SKS and they were all shit. Dad and I had fun with it though. I&#039;m lucky to have a cool dad that likes fun shit. I got a ban model MAK 90 and shot hundreds of beavers with it after my uncle would blow their dams with Tovex at our farm. The beavers would come back that same night and I&#039;d light them up. There weren&#039;t really any good ways to mount lights to AK&#039;s back then so dad hose clamped a mag light to it and away I went. The guys at the pawn shop down the road liked me and used to call me when crates of chink 7.62X39 would show up. It smelled like eggs. We have a lot more variety of high quality stuff for better prices these days for sure but those old imports like the Maadis, SKS&#039;s, SAR-1&#039;s, etc were awesome. Everybody hated the WASR-10 63&#039;s when they came out because compared to the others, they were shit.

Maneuver warfare and deep battle is atavism of WWII and outdated in the year 2022. WWII has very specific strategic deployment. Forces consisted from high - low mix. 10% of armored and mechanised divisions and 90% of foot slooging horse cart drawing infantry difisons. With vastly different mobility and combat strength in unprepared battle. This created naturallly scenario of operation: armored division circling and attacking line of communications of infantry instead if attacking them head on. But Germans and their horse carts are no more. You can&#039;t cosplay WWII, that&#039;s era gone. Low tier armed forces today have car based mobility too, Ukraine has vast net of hard paved roads (thing unheard in the USSR 1941 where combat happened) and can move operationally at sonic speeds. If anything modern armored brigade moves slower than militia mounted on technicals. There is no inherit advantage of amored division in maneuver that promotes succeus in scenario of deep strike and encirclement. Operation of encirclement is circumstantial not guaranteed success.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But American&#039;s used deep strike during 1991 and 2003 in Iraq!

Thus again creating disparity in maneuver like in WWII (tank and Studebaker truck vs horse cart) and making maneuver Great Again. But guees what? Russian Air Force can&#039;t isolate battlefield, they cope with FFAR loft launches without crossing frontline.<br><br>2. Russian BTG structure is very bad for maneuver warfare. BTG is essentially brigade that had everything above battalion cut off.

Look at the initial push for Kiew as an example. Even though the plan to attack Hostomel airport to create a solid foothold right next to one of the major operational targets was good, it was too obvious and had too few troops actually committed to secure the corridor in the initial attack. You can also be sure that russian attacks on the country had been wargamed a gazillion times to find out what the Russians would likely do. The only way to make it viable would have been to drop substantial amounts of VDV on every chokepoint along the MSR to Hostomel and have support YOLO rush down the road to reinforce the initial wave of paratroopers. I personally do not think that the Russians even had enough helicopters to pull this off. <br>Additionally they attacked along multiple axis, committing too few troops per objective. A common estimate for basic operational planning is that you will need an army corps per axis of advance.

Pashtun Sultan of the Sur Empire, Sher Shah Suri defeated the Indian Hindu Rajputs under Puran Mal. The Afghan Pashtun Sunnis who had war elephants slaughtered the Indian Rajput Hindus including Puran Mal. The surviving Indian Rajput Hindu women and children were enslaved, among them were 3 of Puran Mal&#039;s nephews or sons who were castrated and became eunuchs so that their family line would not continue while Puran Mal&#039;s daughter was enslaved as a dancing girl as were other Hindu girls who were captured.[70]<br><br>The Turkic and Iranian Persian Twelver Shia Muslim royal family ruling the Oudh (Awadh) state in India obtained their eunuchs (khwajasarais) through crushing Hindu rebellions by their Indian Hindu subjects that they ruled, massacring Hindu men and enslaving the Hindu women and children with the South Asian Indian Hindu boys being castrated and sent into the harems for service as eunuchs. Jawahir Ali was a eunuch of Oudh state who was born a Hindu. The rulers of Oudh (Awadh) state were Twelver Shia while Rajput Hindus made up most of the local cultivator landholding rajas. The Hindu Rajas of Khairabad rebelled since they refused to pay taxes to the Twelver Shia district administrator Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan so Nawab Muhammad Ali defeated the Hindus in battle and the Muslim historian Muhammad Faiz Bakhsh recorded in his book Tarikh Farahbakhsh that Muhammad Ali sent &quot;hundreds of unbelievers (Hindus) to hell&quot;, enslaving their children and women and castrated the Hindu boys among the children. Adult Hindu women, Hindu girls, and Hindu boys like Jawahir Ali were enslaved by their Twelver Shia ruler. One Hindu boy died from being castrated but the rest of the Hindu boys including Jawahir Ali survived the castration and entered Muhammad Ali&#039;s service as eunuchs.", "time": 1671163690, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56414824, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:09:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56414558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414558</a><br><a href=\"#p56414811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414811</a><br>https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpres<wbr>sebooks/view?docId=ft0f59n6r9&amp;chunk<wbr>.id=d0e12707&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=uc<wbr>press;query=russia<br><br>The court eunuchs served as another interface between Hinduism and Shi\u2018ism. The nawabs and their begams enslaved these boys, most often sons of Hindu Rajput warriors captured in battles with the central government, castrating them and bringing them up in their own households. Owing to the patrimonial nature of the Awadh state, the notables often entrusted their eunuchs with official duties, such as managing their owners&#039; estates or even tax-farming entire provinces, transforming them into a mamluk (slave-ruler) substratum of the government. The slave eunuch officials accumulated vast properties that legally belonged to their masters, although they often could influence the disposition of their property, maintaining close ties to their Hindu relatives. When, for instance, a British subject pressed claims against the great tax-farmer Almas \u2018Ali Khan, whom Nawab Sacadat \u2018Ali Khan owned, the ruler refused to intervene, on the grounds that if he put too much pressure on him the eunuch might transfer his property to Bahu Begam (the nawab&#039;s mother) in Faizabad, resulting in a serious loss to the nawab.[5]<br><br>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id<wbr>=1lhbDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT183&amp;lpg=PT183&amp;dq<wbr>=rajput+castrated+awadh+families&amp;so<wbr>urce=bl&amp;ots=YFAoTV81ZB&amp;sig=ACfU3U1B<wbr>fCXGyCMMUWS4692jO0TntvdtOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa<wbr>=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-7pL8k9n7AhWX8rsIHai<wbr>TDocQ6AF6BAguEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=rajput<wbr>%20castrated%20awadh%20families&amp;f=f<wbr>alse<br><br>Many of the eunuchs were warriors from Rajput families who were captured in the battles.

Sher Shah gave the daughter of Puran Mal to some itinerant minstrels (bazigars) that they might make her dance in the bazaars, and ordered the boys to be castrated, so that the race of the oppressors (i.e. the Hindus) might not increase.\u201d", "filename": "India", "ext": ".png", "w": 1243, "h": 1477, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671163813380795, "time": 1671163813, "md5": "PE1HHZZQAPGaQ9oqe0wUJw==", "fsize": 299612, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56414850, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:11:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56414558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414558</a><br><a href=\"#p56414811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414811</a><br><a href=\"#p56414824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414824</a><br><a href=\"#p56414840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56414840</a><br>https://www.tornosindia.com/role-of<wbr>-eunuchs-in-muharram-of-awadh/<br><br>The rulers were always on the lookout of trustworthy eunuchs.

Nonetheless, in a later letter to her sister, she avoided eating pork and dreaded attending church, stressing that she remained Muslim in secret.[4] She had given birth to a son, Heinrich, in Aden in December 1866; he died in France en route to Germany in the summer of 1867.[5]</span><br><br>This is the Muslim princess&#039;s autobiography.<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00ruetgoog/page/n11<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00stragoog/page/n9<br><br>Her descendants with the Christian German man still live in Florida in the US I&#039;ve heard.", "filename": "Salma_bent_said", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 322, "h": 468, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671169351366973, "time": 1671169351, "md5": "GppG639XxUMv7QbQc/dt7A==", "fsize": 69055, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56415635, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)00:43:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56415520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415520</a><br><a href=\"#p56415527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415527</a><br><a href=\"#p56415538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415538</a><br><a href=\"#p56415548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415548</a><br><a href=\"#p56415559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415559</a><br><a href=\"#p56415567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415567</a><br><a href=\"#p56415587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415587</a><br><a href=\"#p56415597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415597</a><br><a href=\"#p56415608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415608</a><br><a href=\"#p56415615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415615</a><br><a href=\"#p56415620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415620</a><br><a href=\"#p56415626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415626</a><br>https://archived.moe/his/thread/102<wbr>49882/#q10252747<br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252747</span><br><br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252747</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252754</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252705</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252738</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/10252742</span><br>England conquered Malaysia, Iraq, Egypt, Sudan and the Arab Emirates of the Persian Gulf.<br><br>British forces were outnumbered by Gulf Arabs but slaughtered the Gulf Arab forces with a 1,000:5 casualty ratio, destroyed their navy and subjugated them.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirac<wbr>y_in_the_Persian_Gulf#1819%E2%80%93<wbr>1820_expedition<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans<wbr>port_vessels_for_the_British_campai<wbr>gn_against_the_Al_Qasimi_pirates_(1<wbr>819-20)<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persi<wbr>an_Gulf_campaign_of_1809<br><br>This is the world record for fastest British victory and not a single British death.

The Mamluks decided to fight an open battle outside the city walls.

They included ejaculating on the face of a veiled woman and having another woman kneel, bound, and gagged while he urinated on her.[3][4] After returning to Belgium, he published the photos on the internet under the pseudonym, &#039;Belguel&#039; and included captions such as, &quot;There is no better drug than to ejaculate on the veiled face of a woman.&quot; &quot;These sluts are so naive.

On the one hand, they opposed Japanese incursions into northeast China and the rise of Japanese militarism in the area, in part because of their sense of a longstanding friendship with China. On the other hand, most U.S. officials believed that it had no vital interests in China worth going to war over with Japan. Moreover, the domestic conflict between Chinese Nationalists and Communists left U.S. policymakers uncertain of success in aiding such an internally divided nation. As a result, few U.S. officials recommended taking a strong stance prior to 1937, and so the United States did little to help China for fear of provoking Japan. U.S. likelihood of providing aid to China increased after July 7, 1937, when Chinese and Japanese forces clashed on the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing, throwing the two nations into a full-scale war. As the United States watched Japanese forces sweep down the coast and then into the capital of Nanjing, popular opinion swung firmly in favor of the Chinese. Tensions with Japan rose when the Japanese Army bombed the U.S.S. Panay as it evacuated American citizens from Nanjing, killing three. The U.S. Government, however, continued to avoid conflict and accepted an apology and indemnity from the Japanese. An uneasy truce held between the two nations into 1940.<br><br>The United States was the main supplier of the oil, steel, iron, and other commodities needed by the Japanese military as it became bogged down by Chinese resistance but, in January, 1940, Japan abrogated the existing treaty of commerce with the United States.

Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga&#039;s camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners,[33] mostly by crucifixion and decapitation[34] with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek&#039;s teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as &quot;a very sweet and pleasing maiden&quot;, while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses.[35][36][37] The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that &quot;the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.&quot;[38] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga&#039;s but it came to nothing.[39][40][41]</span>", "filename": "Taiwan", "ext": ".png", "w": 1717, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671205105367262, "time": 1671205105, "md5": "iRRS8qd+zKjZKzcK7ObMYQ==", "fsize": 785060, "resto": 56408084, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 56419041, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)10:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56416169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416169</a><br><a href=\"#p56418381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56418381</a><br>Kaiser Wilhelm II openly said Japanese were subhuman Mongoloid yellow peril parasites who needed to be eradicated for the white Christian race to be safe.<br><br>What was wrong with nuking them again since according to you Germany was the good guy before Weimar?<br><br>In fact Kaiser Wilhelm II said that Japan must never dominate Asia otherwise they would lead all Mongoloids to genocide the white race and destroy Europeans and Christianity.<br><br>Jewish financiers backed Japan during the Russo Japanese war as well.

Wu worked on the Manhattan Project, where she helped develop the process for separating uranium metal into uranium-235 and uranium-238 isotopes by gaseous diffusion. She is best known for conducting the Wu experiment, which contradicted the hypothetical law of conservation of parity. This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics, and earned Wu the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978.

The majority of Japanese left behind in China were women, and these Japanese women mostly married Chinese men and became known as &quot;stranded war wives&quot; (zanryu fujin).[25][26] Because they had children fathered by Chinese men, the Japanese women were not allowed to bring their Chinese families back with them to Japan so most of them stayed. Japanese law only allowed children fathered by Japanese fathers to become Japanese citizens. It was not until 1972 that Sino-Japanese diplomacy was restored, allowing these survivors the opportunity to visit or emigrate to Japan.

And what is the life like for the Japanese immigrants? So, could you talk about who are these people who are coming over from Japan? Where do they come from in Japan, and how many people are we talking about?<br><br>And at some point, they met procurers, who talked about nice things of America: job opportunities or a chance to have an American education or marry rich landowners in California, who turned out to be peasants or hired hands who forced them into prostitution. I also found that not all women were unaware of what kinds of work they would do in their destinations. Some women had already sold sexual services to local foreigners in Yokohama working as servants in the houses of Chinese merchants. Others worked in brothels and dance halls, catering to foreign sailors and merchants.

The wearing of Western clothing for everyone was encouraged--for women, blouses, skirts, brassieres, and panties instead of kimonos, and for men, shirts, trousers, and boxer shorts. It may be noted that while Japanese men traditionally wore a loincloth known as a fundosi, women generally went commando under their kimonos--it was observed that on windy days they would &quot;often be blown open, presenting quite an eyeful.</span>", "filename": "Karayuki-san burial", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 510, "h": 680, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671213257709459, "time": 1671213257, "md5": "8SBd1ClNng0zBFgZyxIzAg==", "fsize": 99529, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56420329, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)12:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56415223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56415223</a><br>canadian chink is absolutely seething in this thread", "time": 1671213322, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56420330, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)12:55:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56416169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416169</a><br><a href=\"#p56418381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56418381</a><br><a href=\"#p56419821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419821</a><br><a href=\"#p56419837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419837</a><br><a href=\"#p56419929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419929</a><br><a href=\"#p56419939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419939</a><br><a href=\"#p56420096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420096</a><br><a href=\"#p56420106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420106</a><br><a href=\"#p56420116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420116</a><br><a href=\"#p56420173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420173</a><br><a href=\"#p56420185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420185</a><br><a href=\"#p56420316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420316</a><br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/12535371</span><br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/his/12391175</span><br>https://compasscultura.com/japan-hi<wbr>story-sex-and-suffering/<br><br>A detail from Tsukioka Settei\u2019s hanging scroll, \u201cReading by Lantern Light\u201d circa 1776-1786<br>\u201cThe artwork is very much glamorized and idealized,\u201d she continues. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to 17th-century Japan so I don\u2019t know what it was actually like, and the women didn\u2019t write about it, so we don\u2019t have their firsthand accounts. To imagine it from a woman\u2019s perspective, it must have been a very harsh reality. There\u2019s been some modern scholarship that promotes the idea that the women working as prostitutes had an economic power that they might not have otherwise had. But I think the day-to-day reality of living in the Yoshiwara could not have been pleasant.\u201d<br><br>For one thing, most of the women involved didn\u2019t have a choice about their occupation. Born into impoverished farming or fishing villages, they were sold to brothels by desperate parents around the ages of seven or eight. This tradition was rationalized by Confucian ideals that allowed the children to work out of a duty to their parents, who usually brokered ten-year contracts with the brothel owners that their girls would have to work off. The little girls would do daily chores at the brothels and tended to their \u201csister\u201d courtesans, cleaning and delivering messages.

This was not the case nearly four decades ago when a young Tokyo housewife turned investigative historian, Yamazaki Tomoko, produced seemingly out of nowhere one of the most important works on the history of lower-class Japanese women. Entitled Sandakan hachiban shokan: teihen joseishi josh, the book presents an inside account of a Karayuki-san, a Japanese peasant girl who went &#039;south&#039; into the Nanyo (literally &#039;South Pacific&#039;, but referring more specifically to Southeast Asia) to work as a prostitute in Singapore, and Sandakan, on the east coast of British North Borneo. The publication of the book in 1972 gave rise to immediate controversy. The inexplicable silence surrounding the contribution and experience of these women could no longer be swept under the rug in the study of Japanese imperialism and colonialism. Despite the difficult lives many of the Karayuki-san led abroad, they were often stalwart patriots who sent money back home to support both their impoverished families and Japan&#039;s expansionist wars-against China in the mid 1890&#039;s and Czarist Russia in 1905. The brothel owners used the idea of national good to enslave the young girls and women who were told that their bodies belonged to the state and that they constituted a form of female army. Critics argued over the young housewife&#039;s evidence, distortion and possible bias. Yamazaki Tomoko, had apparently decided to devote her life to documenting the history of the exchange of women between Japan and other Asian countries since 1868. Her endeavour, however, was recognised by some historians and the public at large as pioneering a new way for research on a sector of the Japanese population offshore, whose outlook and experience had not been adequately represented or documented.", "filename": "sandakan", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 175, "h": 267, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671213927008514, "time": 1671213927, "md5": "3P0d0h5dBBUkj7lpjt1gVg==", "fsize": 9448, "resto": 56408084}, {"no": 56420455, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)13:06:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56416169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56416169</a><br><a href=\"#p56418381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56418381</a><br><a href=\"#p56419821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419821</a><br><a href=\"#p56419837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419837</a><br><a href=\"#p56419929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419929</a><br><a href=\"#p56419939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56419939</a><br><a href=\"#p56420096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420096</a><br><a href=\"#p56420106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420106</a><br><a href=\"#p56420116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420116</a><br><a href=\"#p56420173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420173</a><br><a href=\"#p56420185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420185</a><br><a href=\"#p56420316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420316</a><br><a href=\"#p56420330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420330</a><br><a href=\"#p56420330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420330</a><br><a href=\"#p56420348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420348</a><br><a href=\"#p56420374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420374</a><br><a href=\"#p56420393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420393</a><br><a href=\"#p56420417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420417</a><br><a href=\"#p56420430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420430</a><br><a href=\"#p56420443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56420443</a><br>99% of Japanese American diaspora mixed itself out of existence by Japanese women fucking every non-Japanese men that moves<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi<wbr>_Osaka<br><br>Naomi Osaka was born on October 16, 1997, in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Osaka in Japan to Tamaki Osaka (\u5927\u5742 \u74b0, \u014csaka Tamaki) and Leonard Fran\u00e7ois.[1] Her mother is from Nemuro, Hokkaido, Japan, and her father is from Jacmel, Haiti.
