Until 1914, the country was under-industrialized to the point where the US had to start producing Mosin Nagants for them to equip the Imperial Russian Army.

While there was industrialization of unprecedented scale under Stalin, the Red Army continued to lag behind despite developing some fairly impressive tech such as the SVT-40 and the BT and KV-series.

Motor oil actually IS a good lubricant, BUT it does not have the corrosion inhibitors that good-quality gun oil has. So motor oil will keep the action operating smoothly, but when your gun is sitting in storage , or if you forgot to clean it after your last Louisiana duck hunting safari, it isn&#039;t super effective at preventing the reddish-brown blight. Skeptical? Caleb has seen his share of customers come into the shop with rusty guns that had been wiped down with motor oil.

I think the M92 with its 10 inch barrel and vented handguard looks better than a 74u with a 8 inch barrel and no vents on the handguard but thats just me. krink is cool but it is very stub compared to the M92 which I think looks more balanced front to back.<br><br><a href=\"#p57123936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57123936</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Idk how zastava did it but holy fuck is this think a tac driver.</span><br>short + thicc barrel and decent sight radius are a big help for accuracy. Also it is nearly impossible for Zastava to make them with canted sights because the front sight is part of the gas block and if it cants too much one way or the other then the piston wont go all the way forward because it will bind making the gun non-functional, meanwhile if they tilt the hinged dust cover too much either way it wont lock because it is hinged and fastened in place at the front and cant flex meaning it wont shut and will also be non functional so the M92/M85 design lends itself well to accuracy because it HAS to be assembled right in order to leave the factory (As opposed to WASR where they could mount the front sight upside down and the gun would still technically function mechanically speaking). It also helps that Zastava seems to actually center the front sight post into the front sight block (centered up and down, left to right) which is all it really needs since the rear sight has no adjustments aside from flipping between 200 and 400 meters.<br><br>The longer the AK the more leverage you get for bending or flexing things in such a way that harms accuracy even if a longer barrel should theoretically be more accurate. Also the AKM has a rather thin barrel relatively speaking with spaghetti harmonics that flexes a lot in use.

I have one of those and it works fine but the Century M92&#039;s from that era were not nearly as refined as they are now. To get those old ones &quot;proper&quot; you typically had to remove the thread protector, install a muzzle detent kit (sold seperately), put on a booster (which you should always have anyways because its cool), install slightly longer RPK trigger pins (the standard ones were barely long enough and some people had them fall out of place into the receiver), replace the shepherd hook with a trigger retainer plate, and lastly install some sort of rear sling swivel. Then they were fine aside from the odd burr like you had in your gas port.<br><br>HOWEVER, since 2020 none of this has been an issue anymore since Zastava actually seems to listen to their customers. New M92 pistols are g2g out of the box and have the following features as standard from the factory now: bulged front trunnion and 1.5mm reciever (as opposed to the thinner 1mm reciever and thinner slab sided trunnion of the century imported M92&#039;s), chrome lined barrel (old Century ones are just nitrided), muzzle brake spring detent comes standard now, RPK trigger pins come standard now, trigger retainer plate is standard now, and they all come with a hole in the rear trunnion for a standard $10 quick detach sling swivel instead of having to buy a $35 third party sling plate like the originals needed.<br><br>All AK47&#039;s have gone up in price since 2020 but only the Zastava M92/M85 has actually added features to offset or justify its rise in price.

It has some neat features like being able to record your shots as well as a jack for a microphone and the ability to synch audio to the video. It can also record in color with enough white light. It also automatically adjusts the frame rate based on how much IR it is receiving. I guess this was done to improve performance in low light, but it\u2019s honestly kind of annoying. It has a QD feature. You clamp the sleeve to the scope, and the clip on attaches to the sleeve with some lugs and a latch. It seems to be worth the $220 I paid for it. The sensor is far and away better than the night fox cape. The screen resolution is also much higher, and when there is plenty of IR it appears to have a much smoother image even though the manual lists it at 30 fps.

The reason we use fossil fuels stem from their qualities as energy density and practical handling/distribution characteristics, moreso than their availability. <br>Chemical processes to turn biomass into fossil fuel analogues exist already, the reason that these are not our primary source of fossil fuels is their cost - a figure owing to both technological limitations and energy requirements. Established oil extraction infrastructure simply makes natural deposits cheaper. For the moment. We will not run out of fossil fuel the same way you run out of gas on the high way. Oil and gas deposits are discovered continuously, but what deposits are targeted for extraction depends on their accessibility. How expensive extraction will be in comparison to projected production. Naturally the most easily accessible deposits are ones to be utilized first and new technology constantly allows for previously economically unviable deposits to be accessed, but we extract at a higher rate than the technology develops. All this in a nutshell means that fossil fuels won&#039;t blink out of existence like a black man being told he&#039;s gonna be a dad - they will just become increasingly expensive untill a different fuel type is the better option. <br>This will not necessarily be hydrogen or li-ion batteries, their current use in western countries are the result of public perception of what climate-friendly technology looks like and a low cost stemming from (in comparison to conventional fuel) low proliferation.

You adjust for this by moving the optic on your rail as necessary to accommodate your LOP. You do not stick the optic in any random position and force your face to move to it. Once your eye relief is set up properly, no distance is particularly better or worse than another, discounting the extremes.<br><br>Eye relief forgiveness is how far your eye can move forwards or backwards before you start losing FoV. I find the Elcan to be relatively average in this respect, better than the TR25 Accupoint and worse than the TR24, approximately equal to the Razor Gen 3 1-10x. Frankly I do not generally notice this dimension of scope performance much unless I am deliberately trying to evaluate it, as I simply don\u2019t move my head forwards and backwards on the stock very much.<br><br>Eyebox is how much you can move off center when you\u2019re at the correct eye relief before your image blacks out entirely.

It&#039;s more of a family and the world doesn&#039;t keep spinning without you. Rumor mill says no more extended deployments to cuba.<br><br>On the other hand sector MEs are more chill. But you&#039;d be a reservist in a mostly active unit, and you&#039;ll have some awkward downtime where the command isn&#039;t quite sure how to make use of you.

P-38) could go to Berlin with big enough drop tanks, going to Berlin and coming back however was reliant on actually being good at the air superiority escort role which the P-47 wasn&#039;t. The Mustang had a 11:1 aerial kill ratio against the Thunderbolt&#039;s 4.3:1 and the Thunderbolt was inferior in every metric of air-to-air combat except climb rate. Most of its aircraft kills were on the ground. The vast majority of American aces got their kills in P-51s and the majority of allied pilots strongly preferred it when asked about the two types in post-war interviews while German pilots overwhelmingly feared the P-51 more. There&#039;s a good reason the P-47 got replaced. You can argue that it made first contact with the enemy and was more important to the pre-1943 air war but it certainly wasn&#039;t a better fighter or more suited for that role.

Cold Steel had some pretty cringe marketing campaigns but they\u00b4ve aways made solid knives. These Demkos are not really flippers though, and you mentioned that in your first post. Another suggestion along those lines is the Benchmade Mini-Adamas in CPM cruwear steel.

Carrying a knife in the pocket makes every single ounce count a lot. The knife tilts a lot when it is heavier. I generally stay away from folders that weight more than 4 oz. Any heavier than that, I think it is more suitable for belt carry. Others will carry an 8 ounce knife in their pocket and forget its there.<br><br>I asked if you were planning on sharpening it yourself because of your choice of steel, this is an entire can of worms with many many variables. In the most basic of terms, the higher a supersteel is rated for cutlery, the longer it will retain its edge, and the harder it is going to be for a novice to sharpen. Edge retention and ease of sharpening vary dramatically between knife steels. But even a supersteel blade will eventually get dull.

I have no experience at all with Ferrum Forge, they may be good knives from all I know. Benchmade and Ferrum are competing in different markets and price brackets. Around the price of Ferrum\u00b4s products, I think Cold Steel is a serious contender, at least since their contract with Andrew Demko, when they bought some great designs and the triad lock. Another very popular and more affordable category are the liner locks made in China (around 30-40 bucks). In that bracket, Kershaw is the undisputed king in my experience, with Ontario in second place.

Heres the full story on the 112 Ranger. <br><br>So the Buck 110 was for sale everywhere, and a big customer for Buck 110s was the US Military. All branches would sell the knives in the PXs and base shops, as well as being commonly purchased or acquired in other ways by soldiers (family sending them, etc)<br>So Buck was making good money selling their knives to service members (119 was also very popular).<br>So come around the early 70s, and there is a string of fights aboard Navy ships. In some of these fights, sailors had pulled out and used 110s in the fight, and with a 3.75-inch blade, the 110 could do some serious damage. <br>So the Navy declared a new rule, no folding blades over 3 inches allowed on ships. So this would kill sales of the 110 to the Navy if the sailors couldn&#039;t carry the blades on ship. So I think it was Chuck Buck (can&#039;t remember 100% who was in charge at this time) decided to shorten down the 110 to make a knife that could be sold to the Navy. Thus the 112 was made, shortening the blade to 2.75-inch and coming in under the new 3 inch rule. <br>Buck at the time was located in San Deigo, CA. So when the knife was launched it was named the 112 Ranger, for the aircraft carrier USS Ranger that was in port at that time, the Ranger was also one of the ships involved with the stabbing incidents. <br><br>So, TL;DR is; Buck made the 112 to keep selling Buck knives to the Navy after a few sailors stabbed each other with 110s and the Navy banned 110s.", "time": 1676079020, "resto": 57056693}, {"no": 57109497, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)20:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57108916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57108916</a><br>check out mine", "filename": "FSdagger1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1111, "h": 1481, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676079992791434, "time": 1676079992, "md5": "UCa6WyyAfgPGN56ZdvaMJQ==", "fsize": 334532, "resto": 57056693, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57109500, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)20:46:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57109275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57109275</a><br>in fairness to Buck, they do have the sailor stabbing story on their website. also the 112 is 3&quot; today, I dunno about back then though.", "time": 1676079999, "resto": 57056693}, {"no": 57109543, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)20:50:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57109500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57109500</a><br>Yeah 3-inch blade, 2.75-inch cutting length.

HOWEVER it is probably under by 10-20-% because a lot of Russian armour was destroyed in small engagements in the first few months fairly chaotically. In terms of modernised tanks Russia is pretty much done though and we know that because they were risking using the Indian T90s (India GAVE them to Russia by the way) as well as the best of the Belarussian tanks. 3300 is also very generous, a lot of people would have said they started with 2800 and that is not all new built, that just means has undergone some modernisation since the late 90s. Any experienced professional tank crews Russia had are dead. The AP)C/IFV count is also probably low by a few hundred, AA systems and MLRS, specialised engineering and command veniches as well as lorries, tankies etc are not included on that. Russia has lost well over 5000 lorries and tankers alone, as well as 1000 MLRS, AA and Special vehicles. In total they have lost about 20,000 vehicles heavy weapons, aircraft and ships.

Maybe if it&#039;s in a rage or fear, or a mother protecting her kittens, or a moment of catness and they forget to play gentle. I&#039;ve taken some deep cuts, a couple that probably should have had stitches. I know people who have had stitches.<br><br>One buddy got clawed down his arm and had about 12 or 15 long gouges about a foot long. Over 100 stitches to get all that put back together after it was cleaned very thoroughly in an emergency room. It was an accident. His cat panicked over getting picked up in an encounter with a dog and just went apeshit on him, probably confused as to who or what was attacking him. A really sweet cat that never hurt anyone, including me, before or after. But, that one incident was insane. He lost so much blood the hospital considered giving him a transfusion.<br><br>I was carrying a young kitten one day, calm &amp; cozy &amp; half asleep in my arms. A dog ran into the room and jumped at him. He turned into a 2 pound demon, clawed his way out of my arms, up my chest, across my face and set all his claws into my scalp when he got on top of my head. I am here to witness that hurt like fucking hell, and took a couple days of cleaning &amp; disinfecting all he wounds to make sure they could heal instead of turning infected.<br><br>I used to do feline rescue. The feral &amp; semi-feral cats were less dangerous because I expected it and prepared for them to freak out, and still I&#039;ve taken claws and bites through heavy protection.

If she wanted to get my attention, she&#039;d sit right by me and stare at me. If a minute passed without me acknowledging her, she&#039;d put her paw on my leg or arm. If I still didn&#039;t acknowledge her, she&#039;d then slowly sink the claws on both of her front paws into my thigh. She would straight up escalate until I finally paid attention to her. She usually did this if she ran out of food/water or wanted the litter box cleaned.<br><br>Funny story: when this female cat was still a kitten, she had a bouncy ball she&#039;d bat around the kitchen. One time it went under the oven, so I got it out using a wire coat hanger. I got the ball out, left the coat hanger on the floor next to the over, and went back to whatever I was doing. A few minutes later, I hear something metallic moving around the kitchen floor. Turned out that the ball had gone under the oven again, and the cat was pushing the coat hanger under the oven to get the ball out. She only needed to see me do it once to try it herself.

A domesticated cat that has been raised in a safe and loving environment is almost incapable of harming people. They have to be treated very badly and endangered, and many will, even then, submit to torture and death before hurting a human.<br><br>But, there are accidents. And, some cats are not taught from a young age the difference between playing and playing for keeps. That&#039;s really all I was trying to say.

If you&#039;re playing with a cat and they get too rough, immediately stop moving and say &quot;OUCH! OUCH! OUCH!&quot; Withdraw from play for a minute or so, then start again slower and more gentle. Cats figure it out quickly and temper their behavior. If they draw blood, even a small amount, touch their nose with a drop. Just a single small drop. Every cat that&#039;s ever lived with me never needed me to do that more than twice, and usually it&#039;s only once if at all. They learn fast.

Last year they commemorated the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People&#039;s Revolutionary Army (KPRA) which was allegedly founded by Kim Il Sung on April 25, 1932. While Kim imo and in the opinion of many historians was a genuine guerrilla fighter and a capable leader at that, he likely exaggerated a lot of his exploits when fighting the Japanese in the 1930s. Unlike his guerrilla army, the KPA which was founded on February 8, 1948 is based on authentic eyewitness and newsreel showing Kim along with Soviet officers and North Korean officials observing the founding day of the KPA in front of the Pyongyang Train Station. Prior to the rise of Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un North Korea seldomly had military parades. There was one parade in 1948, 1953, and then in 1972, 1985, and then again in 1992.

I can&#039;t answer whether or not North Korea&#039;s missiles is an enormous security risk. It&#039;s a potential one but a currently active one, probably not. Most analysts including some of our top military officials have said in previous years going as far back as 2018 that Kim Jong Un evil as the regime may be is not led by a madman but a perfectly rational actor who wants nukes for regime security to prevent it from becoming Libya, Iraq or Ukraine and to be treated as an equal on the world stage. If the world can begrudgingly accept a nuclear armed Israel, Pakistan and India the world from a realist standpoint will have to accept that North Korea is going to remain a nuclear weapons state whether we like it or not. So attempts to tell Pyongyang to denuclearize while noble in nature is just a fools errand. But to add to your question on whether or not us drone striking the parade, you wouldn&#039;t be taking out all of their strategic weapons and this missiles are likely dummy ones since it would be kind of a national security risk for North Korea to have active nuclear warheads on display. Also you could probably say goodbye to Seoul and parts of Okinawa if they are lucky enough to get missiles in the air right away.

Crazy stuff.<br><br>But really, the reason why Martians were so badly affected by Earth bacteria is because (according to HG Wells, whose opinions were a little dated) they &quot;evolved&quot; so far ahead of Humans that they had eliminated disease and the need for most of their internal organs. They don&#039;t eat, they take in nutrients directly into their bloodstream (which is retarded, btw). So because of this, their bodies had no immune system to fight off basic diseases, and bacteria just went to town.", "time": 1676261561, "resto": 57132235}, {"no": 57135556, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:17:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57132235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57132235</a><br><br>A banana.<br><br><a href=\"#p57132508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57132508</a><br><br>Man, the mid-2000s US Military right before ACUs were adopted were kino af", "time": 1676261822, "resto": 57132235, "filedeleted": 1, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57135884, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)00:01:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57132235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57132235</a><br>P61 black widow", "filename": "Pose as a team, cus shit just got real 3b copy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3000, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1676264463418750, "time": 1676264463, "md5": "d93Yz2QV3EkrebVOVvdEgg==", "fsize": 768367, "resto": 57132235, "m_img": 1}, {"no": 57135920, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)00:05:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57132508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57132508</a><br>I still don&#039;t understand why the ayylmaos getting the coof made the shields turn off", "time": 1676264708, "resto": 57132235}, {"no": 57135926, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)00:05:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57135884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57135884</a><br>God, those threads trying to decide what got painted onto the Widow.
