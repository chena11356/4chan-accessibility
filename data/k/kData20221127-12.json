Just because the Ukrainians know how to use them doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s the best option, sending Bradleys is the much better option.

So might as well get your money out of them by having them destroy Russian forces that they were originally designed to destroy.<br><br>* There are robust supply chains to Europe already- and somewhat to Ukraine (M270 MLRS is the same chassis and because of that Ukraine already has experience maintaining most of the mechanical parts).<br><br>* Ukraine already has experience with anti-tank TOW missiles and TOW missiles on Bradleys destroyed more Soviet-made Iraqi tanks than did Abrams tanks did.<br><br>* 25mm cannon is effective against everything else. Armor piercing rounds have been reported to have destroyed T-72 tanks.<br><br>* It&#039;s lightweight enough to traverse most bridges, can ford up to about waist height, and is amphibious with preparation<br><br>* It has ~0.5-0.75 of the ground pressure of an M1 Abrams or T90.<br><br>* Boring V8 diesel engine means generic automotive maintenance skills overlap reasonably well, a fraction of the fuel required vs a MBT.<br><br>* Obviously it&#039;s an infantry carrier so it can carry troops/supplies, plus I&#039;m sure Ukrainian infantry would appreciate armored mobility and protection from artillery. There are also many variants including air defense.<br><br>* They&#039;re far better than M113s and other lightly armored APCs already sent and better than the Soviet vehicles that Ukraine already use. Soviets cut corners building them to overwhelm NATO through sheer numbers.

It was designed largely in response to observing the M16 in use.<br>The only design characteristic that stands out to me is that it&#039;s more tapered than 5.56mm is, which is good for extraction and somewhat of a necessity given that most ammunition for this caliber is steel cased. It&#039;s still significantly less tapered than 7.62x39mm so you don&#039;t get as much magazine curve which is a minor improvement.<br><br>In terms of the ammunition available, there is far less variety than either 5.56mm or 7.62x39mm because it hasn&#039;t been around as long or been used by as many people. It&#039;s also less common on civilian markets. there is some variety out there, but the vast majority of it is 7N6. The 7N6 loading is pretty clever and offers a good compromise between penetration and terminal performance, but it is also meant for cheap large scale production so it&#039;s not exactly meant for precision. Not a bad shooter though.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is it more inaccurate than akm 762?</span><br>Far from it, most 5.45 guns tend to shoot better.

As far as 5.45, you won&#039;t find the same variety in ammo as 5.56. It&#039;ll almost be all steel core, steel cased so no firing it at your local indoor range. That also means barrel life is somewhat reduced. My understanding is that it was designed to get better ballistics out of a shorter barrel (16.1&quot;) than the 5.56 (20&quot; for the original M16).

How could anyone like those things?!</span><br>Why are people like this? Literally every reason for preferring repeaters over autos/gas guns, can be applied to preferring single shots over repeaters. There&#039;s just something about cracking the breech block open, or breaking the gun in half, and pulling out the spent round that will (to me) always be more fun then simply racking a lever. Not to mention they&#039;re even shorter, even lighter, more simpler and more reliable than repeaters.<br><br>Unless your goal is to kill lots of humans in a short time, a single shot will suit you far better than a repeater or an autoloader. Simply put, there were too many compromises made to make guns into weapons of war.<br><br>For me, it&#039;s single shots.", "filename": "IMG_20221127_102058", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 774, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 179, "tim": 1669562931874600, "time": 1669562931, "md5": "W9pt8xwJqdBWe853Spn3oQ==", "fsize": 80964, "resto": 0, "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "me-i-like-lever-guns-because-of-simplicity", "replies": 22, "images": 9, "omitted_posts": 17, "omitted_images": 8, "last_replies": [{"no": 56198020, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)11:54:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56197920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56197920</a><br>Its true most of the seethe in these threads is from noguns zoomer tardniggers armed with a search engine and bullshit", "time": 1669568062, "resto": 56197130}, {"no": 56198059, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)11:57:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56197965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56197965</a><br>His reasoning is wrong.

You&#039;re gonna have to think about what you&#039;re going to use it for more often - hunting or plinking or range shooting - and kind of weight your decision in that direction because a rifle that&#039;s best set up for shooting small groups is probably going to be a cunt of a thing to carry around for a long time, whereas something feather light and easy to carry and shoot rabbits won&#039;t necessarily be the best for pushing .223 out to 600 or 700m. <br><br>Some basic starting places: <br>Tikka T3X - there&#039;s a big swathe of options here between stock type, barrel profile, overall weight. If you want something that&#039;s mostly for the range if you shop around you can probably squeak in on a CTR and an optic, although typically it&#039;s kind of the done thing to suggest that you spend half your budget on glass <br><br>As the kiwi anon said, Howa 1500s are supposed to be exceptional value, and leave you a lot of room for your optics budget. You can get a chassis variant in a lower-priced MDT chassis that will make life easier for target shooting and that aren&#039;t overly more expensive. <br><br>Bergara B14s are becoming quite popular.

Again, good on value, and the Predator can take AR PMags if that&#039;s useful. <br><br>If you&#039;re leaning more towards memey fun, if you&#039;re lucky and quick you might find a secondhand Warwick WFA-1 or WFA-1L inside that budget, and depending on how lucky that might include some kind of optic. <br><br>Southern Cross Small Arms has a new addition in the meme-gun department, the Taipan - it&#039;s a .223 pump action that is vaguely AR shaped and takes PMags.

Unlike US who had plans publicly laid out and programs going on all the way to the late 40s soviets were operating in secrecy and dumped massive resources into their program, carefully shielded of any failures or accidents. US also launched their satelite within half a year and put a man into space within a month after Gagarin, not to mention the controversy with the soviets using parachutes to return to earth which was against the requirements of FAS at the time which demanded the pilot returning in their spacecraft. They were trying to keep this a secret too.<br><br><a href=\"#p56193148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56193148</a><br>There is one misconception about rocketry and nazis, especially Von Braun. Before the space race he wasn&#039;t very involved in the US rocketry development and he was largely working on liquid fueled rockets, so the claim that he or German scientists are responsible for US ICBM developments are largely unfounded. Of course some knowledge would be applied to new missiles from older liquid fuel ones however by and large US solid fuel developments are the product of American industry and engineering. <br><br>The whole thing about operation paperclip usually ignores one aspect that is very important.
