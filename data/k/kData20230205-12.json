Regarding the azov thing, he just caved to the pressure because he thought it would save his ass - classic mistake, but it&#039;s literally the only reason we&#039;re all in this mess to begin with. Sadly, the majority of even right-leaning white people are like this because the brainrot goes deep. That doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not worth saving.

It would be launched vertically by rocket, taking it to an apogee of 95 km (59 mi); after re-entering the atmosphere it would enter a supersonic glide phase, when its single ramjet would be ignited. It was hoped that this would provide 15 to 20 minutes of cruise at 2,900 km/h (1,800 mph) and would allow the aircraft to return to its base and make a conventional runway landing assisted by a drag chute. However, the Air Ministry had no requirement for such an aircraft and the proposal was rejected. Similar concepts (though uncrewed) were produced after the war in the form of the US SM-64 Navaho missile and the USSR&#039;s Burya, both intercontinental cruise missiles with ramjet propulsion.[28]</span>", "time": 1675520536, "resto": 57020621}, {"no": 57023588, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)09:25:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57023054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57023054</a><br><br>The US Secretary of State cancelled a visit to China over this.

You do not want to get into an exchange of any form, so a weapon that allows you to be the most lethal in the least amount of time is the best bet.", "time": 1675550501, "resto": 57025042}, {"no": 57029290, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)17:42:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57026328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57026328</a><br>100% this.<br><br>That being said, I did not get expect the level of negative effect that indoor rifle fire without earpro had on my concentration.

SERE includes a live practice where they get fake kidnapped out of their beds, handcuffed or tied, put in a van, driven off base somewhere, then they have to escape and evade their way back. We were told to arrest them if we saw them in their white jumpsuits. They&#039;re supposed to straight up steal clothes and shit to blend in or use the woods to get back. I didn&#039;t find any of them, would&#039;ve been illegal to just arrest them without probable cause anyway unless it&#039;s consensual training.

You\u2019re going to see some basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, angles, and perimeter, along with the occasional time and distance word problem and potentially some basic probability.<br><br>Section 2: RCT (Reading Comprehension Test): Again, really straightforward stuff. You read a passage of text and are given options of sentences only one of which is totally true based on the text given above. Most will seem true but, only one can actually be derived from the provided passage.<br><br>Section 3: MCT (Mechanical Comprehension Test): The questions in this section are similar to what would find in an intro to physics class. Brush up on your knowledge of basic physics and how it relates to velocity, volume, and pressure as well as the mechanics of simple machines when it comes to gears, electricity, and weight distribution.<br><br>Section 4: ANIT (Aviation and Nautical Information Test): You guessed it!

It\u2019s a personality inventory that, in the end, will gauge ones suitability for a career in aviation based on their personal characteristics.<br><br>Section 6: PBM (Performance Based Measures Battery): Depending on your tastes this might be the most \u2018fun\u2019 part of the ASTB. You basically get to do a flight simulation. You\u2019ll be given a flight mock-up flight console with a throttle and joystick along with a headset. You\u2019ll also get a map that you\u2019ll need to study before guiding an airplane around on a screen. For a more detailed of explanation of this section check out our full-length article of the different sections of the ASTB called ASTB Test Layout.<br><br>Section 7: BI-RV (Biographical Inventory with Response Validation): This is the part of the ASTB that you can complete from any computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that you complete this section prior to writing the rest of the ASTB. All it is, is a questionnaire about your previous experiences and successes or achievements with aviation. Like section 5 you really can\u2019t prepare for this section \u2013 just answer honestly as there aren\u2019t any real right or wrong responses.<br><br>IOW, bitch you should have prepared lel.

Hence the slow support, slow donations (or non-existent donations), countries falling back on &#039;not our problem, we contribute through EU aid!&#039; and drops in the ocean of actual military support. Wow, 12,000 rounds of 155mm shels... that&#039;ll last a day! Ukraine is solely propped up by the West.

Either the West gets involved directly or supplies actual numbers of equipment in quality and quantity that matters (aka not just 12 tanks, but 1200 tanks, not just 30 IFVs but 3000 IFVs) or Russia wins simply because there are more of them, they view this as an existential war, they&#039;ve switched to a war economy to push out new tanks, trucks and vehicles and are working around the sanctions which were suppose to end this war months ago (lol it&#039;ll &#039;over over by Christmas&#039; lmao).

They&#039;re also unstable when you push them, and need large control surfaces or aggressive management. Good for slow, loitering designs with a completely disposable pilot willing to make constant micro-adjustments. Or a complete maniac. Tractor props are much more efficient and controllable at high speeds, which you absolutely need to survive in air-to-air combat. <br>Also, the safest way to land an aircraft is coming in near stall speed with the tail down. Coming in dragging ass with your slats down lets you &quot;cheat&quot; aerodynamics a little and get a much larger effective wing area. This lets you &quot;dust off&quot; if something goes wrong, while letting you hit the ground at the lowest speed possible. I&#039;ll give you a moment to consider why that might be a bad idea in a pusher prop. You&#039;ll notice that most of them have extremely long landing gear. That&#039;s practical in a design that doesn&#039;t have to take the extra load of a heavy, extremely valuable human being in the cockpit. A lightweight drone that already has a very low stall speed can afford to come in on a flatter trajectory. A faster aircraft will always have to have a higher minimum speed to not rip itself apart at top speed.<br><br>Pusher-prop fighters were basically abandoned as a concept in the 1930s, and by the time flight control systems and materials caught up enough to make them practical they were obsoleted by jets.", "filename": "Northrop_XP-56_Black_Bullet_061024-F-1234P-008", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 217, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1675592048367670, "time": 1675592048, "md5": "xqjzfnh5yroWKdD/BFzZbw==", "fsize": 20366, "resto": 57033470}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 57033297, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:43:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sup /k/ I made a thread a while back about giving some love to my black powder rifle that I hadn&#039;t really shot in like 14 years.

Therefore every extension of barrel past that is an equal amount less pressure. Double the barrel length to 20, you double the volume, you cut the pressure in half.

Having the option to then instantly &quot;upgrade&quot; in a pinch to ~1300 ft lbf with supers for just a single round or mag means doing a lot with subs isn&#039;t unreasonable in many environments (like in dense eastern forest 99% of hunting is &lt;200yd, you almost never have a good safe longer shot, obviously this is completely different in much of the west).

I know about the heat build up, that&#039;s why I&#039;ve got a cover around the can, but at least with 30cal I just don&#039;t tend to be mag dumping so it&#039;s never been an issue. The cleaning isn&#039;t an issue with a quality can too, they have an antistick coating in there and it mostly self cleans. I can &quot;see&quot; this directly, because I weighed it when I first got it. Recommendation is to do a cleaning (basically drop the thing in a bucket of Ti-safe solvent for a day with the cap off, drain, then shoot a mag through it) once it&#039;s 1oz heavier. Few thousand rounds later and it still isn&#039;t. Not to say 300bo supers probably don&#039;t suppress better than 308 in turn, IIRC complete burn for typical 308 is 17.3-18.5&quot;?

Poking holes where it matters is fine for hunting (or self defense). You can hunt with an airgun or bow and arrow as well for smaller game. OBVIOUSLY it doesn&#039;t exceed elastic limit because, duh, it&#039;s subsonic! A canon ball going at 1k fps would do the same. But a couple hundred ft lbf is still plenty to kill an animal, or human. The round that has probably taken more game than anything else in history is still good old 22lr, which maxes out at like 60gr (and that&#039;s very rare and expensive by 22 standards) and even fast 30gr stuff is still only 1700fps or so at the muzzle.

The T-72 is a product of the T-34 myth of numbers=quality, but in its intended use and time it wasnt that bad, it was a mass combined warfare tank designed to rush the Fulda Gap and meet the soviet need for tank numbers, not the durable high value multi-role infantry support/skirmish/sniper tank of modern warfare. Russia is poor but wants a large military. They physically have a lot of T-72s, so they want to use them. More importantly they also physically already have the factory for T-72s (UVZ). Most of T-80 production was in what is now Ukraine, Russia had some production but much less, in fact Russia only has the capacity to upgrade T-80 B models, T-80U models from storage cant be upgraded because those needs parts exclusively from ukraine. So its more feasible for them to just continue with the T-72 line (T-90). <br>T-80s are much better but are more logistically intensive due to the gas turbine engine, and Russia doesnt actually have the factory facilities in place for them like it does for the T-72 line. It prioritises T-80s for the 4th Guard Tank Division, and for its arctic brigades+brigades attached to naval commands which might operate in arctic or cold conditions, as the gas turbine works much better in the cold than the T-72s engine does.

They still have some 1,500 B+BV in storage and they only manage 25 a year to BVM because they dont have the production set up for it. Numbers in storage arent a problem for a long while, but they outright cannot recondition the 1,500 T-80Us in storage, they can only keep the ones already in operation running. Theoretically they could invest in making the machinery needed to produce the needed T-80U parts from new, but thats a large investment and theyre already spending the equivalent of a T-90 in order to refit+upgrade each T-72B3M, as well as producing T-90s. They probably should have abandoned the T-72 design a while ago and set up new T-80 facilities, but that&#039;d probably have cost more money than they really have. In any case they really want to be fielding their new meme-tank instead of making factories to produce even more upgraded soviet tanks in large numbers.

You&#039;re entirely relying on fragmentation or tumbling to occur to get a bigger wound channel than a .22 hole. If you know your ballistic shit, you know all the planets have to align for tumbling and fragmentation to happen. I&#039;d say those are unreliable wounding mechanisms too.

It still is, because modern powder advancements improved .40 loads too. 9mm now consistently makes the minimum penetration requirements, but the one thing .40 still has a leg up on is light barrier penetration. It will go through something like a windshield or car door with less deflection than 9mm. The police agencies may not have made the right decision to drop it, but I wouldn&#039;t invest in it because it won&#039;t be a common round in the future. Just get a 10mm if you want something that blows 9 the fuck out of the water. There&#039;s a lot of badass versatile loads you can get in 10mm that you can&#039;t get with boring cope rounds like .40 or .357. 9mm is just a good all around, very common round.

At about 8-10 yards it will make a hole in your target about twice the size of 12 gauge, especially if you&#039;re using a modified choke. At ~20 yards that hole will be more like fist-sized. A cylinder or improved cylinder choke will spread slightly, but not much at those ranges. If you&#039;re shooting at 30 or more yards you should be using something else, like a slug or a handgun.<br><br>tl;dr - #4 or 00 doesn&#039;t matter at home defense ranges, the weight &amp; velocity is more important.

Each tank or IFV could conceivably have one up at all times using cameras and other sensors, feeding the data back for analysis for constant threat detection and target spotting.

It was supposed to replace infantry for protecting tanks in restrictive urban environments while supporting armored assaults directly in open combat. <br><br>In reality, this dual feed auto loader mechanism was a bit beyond orkish pockets to afford and orkish engineers to make reliable, so they went with a double cannon setup. The theory was they could load one cannon with anti-infantry ammo types and the other with anti-armor ammo types.

The entire terminator concept was created to be a sort of &quot;armored vehicle support vehicle&quot; instead of an IFV because in order for proper combined arms assault you need well equipped, well trained, well disciplined, well motivated infantry to support the armored assault. Again, a bit beyond orkish training, funding, and doctrinal abilities. Atleast on any scale that matters.
