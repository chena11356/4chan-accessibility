Even further, the Japanese Empire already had Korea and Taiwan, and had been able to grind down China without direct foreign interference. When it went up against European colonial forces, it was superior, but against a technogical peer in the U.S. navy it lost its advantage in the pacific fairly quickly (this was basically just having a functioning carrier battle group and the know-how to use it).

To quote the Russian opposition publication Verstka:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Senators received a message about the scheduling of an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Federation on the evening of February 14 via an intraparliamentary mailing list, two of its recipients told Verstka. The message did not say why the event was postponed from March 1 to February 22. &quot;Now it&#039;s going to start... Are we going to declare war? - One of the newspaper&#039;s sources smiled.</span><br>Things are heating up, /k/. For Russia, it&#039;s the last opportunity to prove itself somewhat victorious, if they manage to conquer Bakhmut, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, they will claim it as a victory. For Ukraine, it&#039;s the matter of life and death, if they deter Russians and manage to take initiative in their own hands, it will get them into much better positions before peace talks start, if they lose, it will be extremely hard for them to ever liberate Donetsk and Luhansk, especially if the West succeeds in pushing Zelensky to sign a peace treaty with Putin.", "filename": "1676537707645", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 891, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 174, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676538711513950, "time": 1676538711, "md5": "/++fdEvxcSw3dwXE5AHWyw==", "fsize": 199137, "resto": 0, "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "russia-is-ready-to-launch-a-gigantic-offensive-in", "replies": 115, "images": 22, "unique_ips": 66, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 57173551, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)04:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57173547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57173547</a>", "filename": "1651286115089", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 332, "h": 365, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676538795687367, "time": 1676538795, "md5": "rQd9un/twZyIEKKQv6Zm/Q==", "fsize": 15335, "resto": 57173547}, {"no": 57173559, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)04:15:03", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1673427355624723", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 839, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676538903430728, "time": 1676538903, "md5": "EAlhoitd/n36Yyml5WvbdA==", "fsize": 416856, "resto": 57173547}, {"no": 57173560, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)04:15:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wait is that implying they&#039;re going to do do an Odessa landing?

As you cannot be sent to fight as it isn&#039;t a war. Obviously the vast majority are bullied and tricked into fighting but some don&#039;t and escape. The Russian military then put up &#039;shame walls&#039; of those that do this. Again, bullying. Furthermore, conscripts cannot be sent to fight because they aren&#039;t legally at war. The reason Russia announced it had &#039;annexed&#039; those Ukrainian areas was because it gave them the legal ability to put conscripts there for &#039;garrison and defence duties&#039;. The fact they were being sent to fight on the front of a piece of Russia that they didn&#039;t even control 50% of is irrelevant. Legally it allowed Russia to do this. This shored up the lines from Ukrainian counter-attacks.<br><br>So what does changing it to a war do? Legally Russia can then send conscripts anywhere and no longer have them be defensive units. Technically, legally, if Russia pushed outside of the &#039;annexed&#039; regions the conscripts would, technically, legally, stay put. Declaring it a war would allow them to be legally sent to wherever the front was (outside of the annexed areas). Furthermore, declaring it a war allows internal law changes, such as martial law and economic effects to get more money. On top of that, it would change the public&#039;s perception of the &#039;war&#039; to be that of a proper war and therefore something they can&#039;t ignore or pretend isn&#039;t happening.

I had just about found out that it was an ME-109 but too late. Another one came from behind me and laid in several nice close 20mm.

Indeed, since the fall of 2019, \u201cexplosions\u201d in the headlines of the Russian media have begun to be replaced by \u201ccotton\u201d. When describing the same events, the frequency of mentioning &quot;cotton&quot; grew - while the frequency of &quot;explosion&quot; was declining. In January 2020, a record 1,300 mentions of \u201ccotton\u201d were mentioned in the Russian media, which is more than four times more than in September (for comparison: at the beginning of 2017, the Medialogy database, which includes about 53 thousand sources, found only 58 &quot;pops of gas&quot; in the headlines).That is, it didn\u2019t seem to you: the Russian media really purposefully and simultaneously switched from \u201cexplosions\u201d to \u201cpops\u201d.</span>", "time": 1676536033, "resto": 57171217}, {"no": 57173343, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)03:27:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57171217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57171217</a>", "filename": "writing", "ext": ".png", "w": 729, "h": 339, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1676536035877483, "time": 1676536035, "md5": "PaPPpwn3QErQyVwUVZ9yPA==", "fsize": 37688, "resto": 57171217}, {"no": 57173346, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)03:28:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57173322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57173322</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cotton is a real-life technical term that has been around in official documents, professional literature, and job descriptions for many years, meaning it didn\u2019t appear in 2019.

You&#039;ve covered everything from the advent of Samuel Pepys (my specialty is English history, so I have no clue what the French and Spanish were doing at the time). Prior to Samuel Pepys reorganizing the navy, there was a mix of professional sailing ships and then the merchant marine. Prior to that, it was almost entirely just the merchant marine and whatever could be purchased by &quot;ship money,&quot; which was a tax the king could levy on parishes without consent. Ship money is often cited as one of the root causes of the English Civil War, but there are plenty of other reasons for the war which was predominantly split along religious lines, so take that with a grain of salt. Privateers also factored into early-modern naval warfare as essentially an offshoot of the merchant marine. These would have been ships armed much better than typical merchant ships and were thus paid to retain their services. Basically they were mercenaries in times of peace and war and they behaved as mercenaries are wont to do.<br>The Spanish had a similar reliance on the merchant marine, but it was managed by the state. Galleons were not ships of war, but trade ships that had been designed to thwart rieving privateers. It worked way better for a long time than tales about Francis Drake would have you believe. Spain pulled an inordinate amount of gold out of the New World in the 16th and early 17th centuries while the English piddled about in Virginia. <br>The French navy looked much like the English.

Good luck trying to make them last. I&#039;d suggest an e-bike, not motorcycle but actually electric bicycle. Get one with a common battery or build one off an e-bike conversion kit. Learn how the battery works and what kind of cells it can operate off, so if your cells go bad you know what to replace them with. That shouldn&#039;t be for a few years, and always get something you can pedal if it runs out. This is why an e-bike conversion is best because you can just take off the heavy battery if it dies and have a regular bike. Get a mountain bike and you basically have a quiet, lightweight dirtbike.

The USSR couldn&#039;t keep up with the amount of resources we were throwing at it. If they continued, they&#039;d get embarrassed by losing everything from that point onward. Their scientists may have been better (arguable in 1969, but not for much longer (arguably were better for longer, just hindered by central planning&#039;s inherent inefficiencies, but that&#039;s a topic for another time)), but they couldn&#039;t afford the projects. <br>-Modern risk tolerance is much lower. We used to account for accepted losses in projects, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. We&#039;ve been becoming much more risk averse since then, with 1970 being really the tipping point (OSHA formed in 1970 and MSHA in 1977).

It didn&#039;t. &quot;something resembling mainstream appeal&quot; could only be true if you&#039;re living in a bubble of 4chan users and/or techies. mpv has very little penetration into the mainstream. Walk into the classroom of any basic bitch public school teacher and there is a reasonably high chance they have VLC installed on their computer, and approximately a zero percent chance that they have mpv.<br><br>2. In the tech-inclined sphere of users, mpv has become popular because mpv fits that culture better than VLC. Compare the manpage of mpv and VLC, there is no contest. Mpv has a comprehensive manpage that lists every single little option. A 100 thousand word manpage, vs VLC&#039;s manpage which is less than 500 words and basically amounts to &quot;lol go read our website&quot;. The comprehensive manpage is not the entire reason mpv is popular with the techie crowd, it is only one illustrative example. Across the board, mpv suits the subjective design preferences of programmers and hackers better than VLC. That doesn&#039;t mean mpv is objectively better, or that VLC is objectively better. Objectively, they are different. One is only better than the other subjectively, depending on what you the user choose to value.", "time": 1676493215, "resto": 57158981}, {"no": 57167067, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:37:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57158981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57158981</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Val Kilmer\u2019s gunbattle scene where he runs out of bullets is regularly shown to Marine recruits as an example of how to perform the action properly</span><br>This is not true.", "time": 1676493478, "resto": 57158981}, {"no": 57167077, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:38:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57167067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57167067</a><br>but reddit told me...", "time": 1676493534, "resto": 57158981}, {"no": 57167094, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:40:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57166760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57166760</a><br>I mean, it takes about two minutes to get used to but you don&#039;t even notice it after that.

Mythology becomes a lot more informing than you\u2019d think when you clear away all the obvious bullshit with the knowledge we have now. For instance, the blue people in Indian mythology likely ingested or experienced extreme exposure to silver, turning blue in the process. Animalistic figures like Sun Wukong likely had extreme werewolf syndrome (not werewolves it\u2019s a medical condition look it up).

I know classic has done some shady stuff in the past, but I\u2019ve ordered quite a bit from them in the last few years and had a fine time with all of it. I bought one surplus steel magazine that was beat up and I had to take a mallet to in order to disassemble but it feeds fine, that was the worst experience I had with them. Contrary to RTI who sent me a B grade enfield that was advertised along the lines of \u201cscuffed wood and worn finish, slight pitting, and possible missing sling swivel screws but in working order\u201d but in actuality had its hand guard falling off and the stock\u2019s flat head bolt was broken. They included a replacement in the box but the stock was completely loose from the rifle. It was barely functional and I had to do work to get it serviceable. I\u2019ve heard a two or three dozen exact stories like this, along with watching negative reviews disappear off their site. RTI\u2019s reputation is pretty well known if you name search them. However Ian McCollum still happily works with RTI and half way advertises them in videos. But as you can see in his videos, during the Covid lockdowns RTI did him a big favor by shipping him guns for free to do videos on so he wouldn\u2019t have to travel. I\u2019d imagine Classic hasn\u2019t ever done the same. Ian has probably made quite a bit of money off those videos of the rifles RTI provided as well.

A gun that&#039;s decently-well built and maintained will easily function for longer than the lifetime of its original purchaser. There&#039;s also little practical incentive to upgrade or buy more once you have one that still works just fine. There&#039;s no model that comes out every few years that&#039;s 50% faster and has 40% more battery life.

In Canada we have this thing called case law in which a court case sets precedent and since the FRT is not law there is a 99% chance the judge would rule in favor of the person getting charged. It would force the RCMP to admit criminal responsibility in changing the FRT past the 1 year mark, force them to change all the FRT&#039;s back, as well as likely force the government to define a bunch of terms they created during the May 1st 2020 OIC such as &quot;Variant&quot;, &quot;nullification&quot;, as well as &quot;assault style weapon&quot;.

Time to post some actual fucking CONTENT.<br>-----------------------------------<wbr>---------------------<br>The mountains here are cold, harsh. The only thing keeping us going is\u2026was the constant line of supply between our main encampment and our positions in the rocky outcroppings. We; our motley crew of Neo-Yugoslavs, Americans, and a few East Asians, had been contracted out by the local Dai-Clan of Oni to fend off incursions of High Elven border troops. The conditions brought to mind the stories my grandpa told me of his time in Korea. How ironic, then, that my battle Buddy was a Korean himself. Yee Sun Park was his name, he\u2019d served in the ROKA before and during /k/-day, and now a few years hence he\u2019d managed to get portalside.<br><br>Now the two of us were huddled in a freezing foxhole; with little more than old hand warmers, those ones in the pouches you fondled and squeezed to activate, to keep our extremities from getting frost bitten. At the very least we had proper camo for the time of day\u2026night. Blue. Blue and purple lizard. Almost everything we wore was lizard, the Yugo guys had brought a metric crap ton with them when we all met up in this little dwarven hold almost two months away from where we were now. By cart anyways. This stuff had been police, and I guess we were sort of fulfilling that role in enforcing the borders. The elves, unfortunately, had the advantage of knowing the terrain. We\u2019d only been here a week so far while they\u2019d been probing this section for months. They were, though, easy enough to pick out at night. If your vision was good enough, you would be able to make out the ones in Multicam. Even the \u201clucky\u201d ones in Multicam black weren\u2019t nearly impossible to pick out because unlike us, the elves apparently didn\u2019t realize that a lightless night had a sort of blue coloring to it; not pitch black.", "time": 1676421300, "resto": 57146026}, {"no": 57157733, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:36:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57157723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57157723</a><br>Every so often, an illumination flare would arc up into the sky; either one of our mortars or theirs. Whenever one of theirs would pop off, there would be a brief rush of activity on the radios attempting to pinpoint locations, and then silence. The nights were just like this. Every night, some areas were lit up with the flares, nothing would happen. There\u2019d be gunshots, either the rapid bark of elven guns or the steady bark of our rifles. Ours were mostly HK lineage, G3s, HK33s, HK21s and the like. Theirs were surplus M16s, FAMAS, L86s, and other STANAG rifles. Apparently, earthside, the myriad governments loved the knife ears. The bulk thermal goggles we\u2019d managed to pick up some weeks back were really helping; the inexpensive commercial Multicam uniforms the elves wore lighting up like Christmas trees in the IR. It\u2019s the reason they don\u2019t attempt to push at night. They have more \u201cmodern\u201d kits, but they\u2019re still mostly inexperienced. <br><br>Their gear is new, clean; we know because any of the bodies we come across look the part.

GET YOUR MASKS ON!\u201d, we know it\u2019s going to hit those knife ears something hard. Quickly, Park and I don M17 gas masks with chemical hoods. It\u2019s almost never likely that the gas will come back at us; but our COs don\u2019t want to risk a misfire. In the pale moonlight, I can see the arc of the mortar shells soaring through the air. My eyes track them as they smack into the range below us. They don\u2019t detonate like the usual ones; guess this time it wasn\u2019t a psyop. The shells are too far out to actually see the gas spreading, but the effect is felt a few minutes later. The formerly prevalent sound of illumination mortar fire cut out after ours hit.

It\u2019s everywhere, and demands one to watch their step. We\u2019re relieved of our position, and hauling our asses out of the hole, I sling my G3 around to my back. Walking back to the operating area, there\u2019s the mess tent. It\u2019s not yet packed with people, so I make my way over as soon as my eyes laid upon it. I\u2019m in luck, they\u2019re making pancakes and hash-browns. The good kind of hash-browns, not that loose potato shavings crap that always felt rubbery to chew on.

I had been meaning to ask him about a few US bucks he owed me when I felt the bench on my right side dip a bit. Turning my head slightly, more shifting my eyes than anything, it was an Oni. She was one of the locals who\u2019d decided to sign up with us, and I recognized her both by how one of her horns was chipped in half, and that she spoke very good English. The Oni language itself really didn\u2019t sound like anything I\u2019d heard before. Someone had described it as \u201csounding Indo-European\u201d, but I wasn\u2019t any linguist. Apparently the further east you went, they started sounding more Japanese; though not any Japanese we would understand. She was clad in native armor, Lamellar if memory serves correct. It wouldn\u2019t be very good against gunfire but if memory serves, having custom uniforms tailored for Oni wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to have done.

Over 100 stitches to get all that put back together after it was cleaned very thoroughly in an emergency room. It was an accident. His cat panicked over getting picked up in an encounter with a dog and just went apeshit on him, probably confused as to who or what was attacking him. A really sweet cat that never hurt anyone, including me, before or after. But, that one incident was insane. He lost so much blood the hospital considered giving him a transfusion.<br><br>I was carrying a young kitten one day, calm &amp; cozy &amp; half asleep in my arms. A dog ran into the room and jumped at him. He turned into a 2 pound demon, clawed his way out of my arms, up my chest, across my face and set all his claws into my scalp when he got on top of my head. I am here to witness that hurt like fucking hell, and took a couple days of cleaning &amp; disinfecting all he wounds to make sure they could heal instead of turning infected.<br><br>I used to do feline rescue.

If I still didn&#039;t acknowledge her, she&#039;d then slowly sink the claws on both of her front paws into my thigh. She would straight up escalate until I finally paid attention to her. She usually did this if she ran out of food/water or wanted the litter box cleaned.<br><br>Funny story: when this female cat was still a kitten, she had a bouncy ball she&#039;d bat around the kitchen. One time it went under the oven, so I got it out using a wire coat hanger. I got the ball out, left the coat hanger on the floor next to the over, and went back to whatever I was doing. A few minutes later, I hear something metallic moving around the kitchen floor. Turned out that the ball had gone under the oven again, and the cat was pushing the coat hanger under the oven to get the ball out. She only needed to see me do it once to try it herself.

And, some cats are not taught from a young age the difference between playing and playing for keeps. That&#039;s really all I was trying to say.

Cats figure it out quickly and temper their behavior. If they draw blood, even a small amount, touch their nose with a drop. Just a single small drop.

They then sequenced DNA samples from 25 Tsimshian living near Prince Rupert today. Comparing the two sets of genes, the team discovered several immune-related gene variants that were rare among the living. For example, a variant of a gene known as a HLA-DQA1, which codes for proteins that sort healthy cells from invading viruses and bacteria, was found in nearly 100% of ancient individuals, but in only 36% of modern ones.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That finding suggests that the immune-related genes of the ancient Tsimshian were well-adapted to local diseases but not to novel infections like smallpox and measles, the team reports today in Nature Communications. Because European-borne epidemics altered the disease landscape, survivors were less likely to carry variants like HLA-DQA1, which were less able to cope with the new diseases (precisely how is still a mystery). &quot;Those ancient genetic variants that were once adaptive were no longer adaptive after European contact,&quot; Malhi says.</span><br>You can literally engineer a virus to cause mild flu in a general population but cause lethal symptoms to a specific individual.

It was much less maneuverable than even old mig-19 not to mention mig-21. F111 failed to shot down even one fighter. When used as bomber, results were disappointing, with 3 shot down (out of 6 present) in first deployment. The terrain-following radar was a failure, and was not used in combat since. Flying superfast super low was meant to make planes &quot;practically&quot; invincible (like stealth now), but combat verified that the only way to stay alive is to be maneuvering constantly. Wing-sweeping was not used at all as these were needed only for carrier landings, and there was no carriers in Vietnam. Plane carried a lot of bombs, but that was of no use as a cost of even a dumb bomb was much higher than cost of a vietnamese. The more bombs you dropped, the more money was lost.

They&#039;ve even lost expensive assets like their Black Seas Flagship. Each of those vehicles is millions if not ten&#039;s of millions (for planes, ships, and missiles). For armoured vehicles, Russia needs thousands of them. Russia&#039;s military was falling apart in many ways despite spending 60+ billion a year they already get. We&#039;ve all seen the pictures of the state of repair of their &quot;ships&quot;, their planes, their military facilities, and so on. The USA spends more maintaining nuclear weapons than Russia spends on their entire military and the Russians have more nuclear weapons to maintain. Russia was barely able to maintain the military stockpile the Soviets spent two decades to build. They built it mostly using oil money from the 1970&#039;s and 1980s. Keep in mind, it isn&#039;t just the cost of replacements of destroyed equipment they need to fix. They also have to estimate another decade of attrition on their existing equipment which is going to be getting older and older. If they want a force rebuilt piece for piece with more modern stuff the cost will probably be 150 Billion+ over a decade if you include munitions. Maybe more, I&#039;d have to take a deeper look. The last time Russia tried such a military build-up they shit canned their economy and that was when their economy was bigger than today and the vehicles were a lot cheaper and less complex. <br><br>If the war ended today, it would probably a decade to get their numbers back up. They can only produce around 200 tanks a year, only so many missiles, so many planes, etc.. As the war drags on, it will get worse.

LTs are forced to do all the officer shit, and since its in the beginning of their career and they are on the low end of the totem pole trying to garner favor or at least get adequate bullets and network with higher, they still have some driving incentive to do the job right. For SFC, they have been in so long that the ones who made it at least know a thing or too, and their motivation comes from not trying to fuck it all up so close to the 20 year mark, or they are aiming for e8/e9 for the higher pay to support their family, which means they cant fuck up.

If there was merit to the B/II, it may have still been more expensive to make than what everyone else was already using.

It also frees up space for a dedicated secondline belt that you couldn&#039;t have with LBE.<br>The pro of carrying gear off the carrier is that if you are doing something requiring protection but not all your mags such as being a turret gunner you have the modularity, and that when carrying gear you can get lower and more prone. Also full up LBE can distribute weight better and allows for carrying way more weight than a PC or a PC+gunbelt would practically allow. <br>For some of the modular issues chest panels have become a more modern solution, combining the ability to take rifle gear off for turret gunning but allowing the gear of PC style setup when needed. But not everybody has access to everything, so sometimes you make due with what you got. <br>There&#039;s also this &quot;fight light&quot; idea of wearing the chest rig without the armor, but for 99.99% of people that&#039;s just fantasy LARP shit. Majority of soldiers will never intentionally go into combat with chest rig but no armor if they have access to armor. Very, very small legit exceptions. <br>Last thing, I haven&#039;t seen any IBAs in Ukraine, but if somebody is wearing an IBA those things suck to put weight on the armor with because the weight of pouches pulls the vest open.

Putting weightalong properly distributed hip carry is way better. The reason good packs meant for heavy hauling have kidney pads. Stacking a lot of heavy (and bulky) shit on front of your torso isn&#039;t great. A few rifle mags on the torso is fine, especially for doorkickin&#039; sexy CQB, but if you&#039;re rocking sustainment gear and lots of ammo heavy distance, the LBE is superior.<br>My military days I went through various setups depending on the context.
