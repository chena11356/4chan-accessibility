For the Romans not only made a jest of those who fought with the edge of that weapon, but always found them an easy conquest. A stroke with the edges, though made with ever so much force, seldom kills, as the vital parts of the body are defended both by the bones and armor. On the contrary, a stab, though it penetrates but two inches, is generally fatal. Besides in the attitude of striking, it is impossible to avoid exposing the right arm and side; but on the other hand, the body is covered while a thrust is given, and the adversary receives the point before he sees the sword. This was the method of fighting principally used by the Romans, and their reason for exercising recruits with arms of such a weight at first was, that when they came to carry the common ones so much lighter, the greater difference might enable them to act with greater security and alacrity in time of action.</span>", "time": 1675761699, "resto": 57059045}, {"no": 57060106, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:23:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57060099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57060099</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; THE POST EXERCISE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We are informed by the writings of the ancients that, among their other exercises, they had that of the post.

Every soldier, therefore, fixed a post firmly in the ground, about the height of six feet.

I could easily see the elements in the South Korean government/establishment (or power hungry political outsiders) scapegoat Japan or the US, especially if Chinese glowies back them. In many cases, modern South Korea has taken the worst aspects of modern Japan and turned them up to 11 - they have a higher suicide rate, have an even worse work/life balance, and their birthrate has cratered (their birth rate is 0.75 per woman compared to Japan&#039;s 1.34).

This is the paradox: he is out of nature and hopelessly in it; he is dual, up in the stars and yet housed in a heart-pumping, breath-gasping body that once belonged to a fish and still carries the gill-marks to prove it. His body is a material fleshy casing that is alien to him in many ways\u2014the strangest and most repugnant way being that it aches and bleeds and will decay and die. Man is literally split in two: he has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order to blindly and dumbly rot and disappear forever. It is a terrifying dilemma to be in and to have to live with. The lower animals are, of course, spared this painful contradiction, as they lack a symbolic identity and the self-consciousness that goes with it. They merely act and move reflexively as they are driven by their instincts. If they pause at all, it is only a physical pause; inside they are anonymous, and even their faces have no name. They live in a world without time, pulsating, as it were, in a state of dumb being. This is what has made it so simple to shoot down whole herds of buffalo or elephants. The animals don&#039;t know that death is happening and continue grazing placidly while others drop alongside them. The knowledge of death is reflective and conceptual, and animals are spared it. They live and they disappear with the same thoughtlessness: a few minutes of fear, a few seconds of anguish, and it is over.

This particular incident was the last straw in a long string of incidents on the way to the Promised Land, and after they all try to kill the man who freed them from brutal slavery, God finally tells them &quot;ok fuck you all then, you don&#039;t get to have this land anymore, go wander in the desert for a generation and your kids can have it&quot;. This isn&#039;t to diminish the role of the prophets or those who came before, on the contrary the fact that they were mostly able to rise above the bullheaded people they came from is commendable (and most of them go on long diatribes about the immorality or stubbornness of the Israelites from time to time, further driving the point home).<br>In the end, you probably can just do as Jesus and the Apostles say and disregard the context for it.

This invasion already stretched the rational-actor assumption to a breaking point. <br><br>The scenario in which a Russian nuclear strike do not result in nuclear retaliation is if they can muddy the waters enough to provide some semblance of a geopolitical excuse for it. Like nuking the first Ukrainian to step foot on russian soil, or hold on to occupied territory for long enough that the rest of the world accepts it as &quot;russian home soil&quot; (bout&#039; 5-10 years I reckon&#039;) why do you think they import russian teachers? Shoehorn their national currency into a nonexistent local economy? Make up decelerations of annexation that a child would consider worth less than a crayon sketch?

The total radioactivity of the fission products is extremely large at first, but it falls off at a fairly rapid rate as a result of radioactive decay. Seven hours after a nuclear explosion, residual radioactivity will have decreased to about 10 percent of its amount at 1 hour, and after another 48 hours it will have decreased to 1 percent. (The rule of thumb is that for every sevenfold increase in time after the explosion, the radiation dose rate decreases by a factor of 10.)</span><br>Additionally no nuke club member makes dirty bombs as they are a suicide weapon since the world winds would carry that shit everywhere and make EVERYONE mad. Additionally if you ever bothered to read up on nukes, they were developed to help solve bomb energy yield issues and modern conventional bombs have caught up quite a bit. Nukes still form major pieces of defense doctrine but the primary focus of nuke strategy has been early warning and in air neutralization for well over your lifespan.

Furthermore, you are shooting metric fucktons of neutrons EVERYWHERE which converts other materials into isotopes. When an atom is converted to an isotope it may become unstable and radioactive and not just alpha or beta radioactive, it might start emitting x-rays or gamma rays when it splits.

The phrase &quot;end him rightly&quot; should trigger some memory of it if you remember it. If not, it was some guidebook written during the middle ages, maybe the Renaissance, can&#039;t remember exactly. At the time it was written, the standard equipment allocated to duelists in a judicial duel was a sword, spear, and buckler. The author says that you could unscrew your sword&#039;s pommel and throw it at your opponent&#039;s face to stun and daze him, and then while he&#039;s still recoiling from having a solid chunk of steel thrown at his face, you charge in and quickly run him through with a spear.

Most of my argument is that instead of being a visor, these future helmets should have remained one piece, but like the same shape if that makes sense. Like weld the visor to the rest of the helmet. I can sort of see why you wouldn&#039;t with that shape, because it wouldn&#039;t be as easy to remove and carry around under your arm like a greathelm or similar due to the size and shape, but I could think of a fix for that. Say, a small metal loop at the top or back of the helm, where you could use a clip to affix it to your belt when not in use so as not to lose it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not all men at arms were knights but all knights were men at arms</span><br>Alright fair enough, mainly I&#039;m discussing the flaw of the enemy being able to flip open your helmet and stab you in the face.

But they&#039;re honestly a lot like people. Big, strong, furry people. Just like all higher mammals, bears have egos. That is, they respond badly to perceived challenges or incursions on their personal space.<br>An example: Once I was walking down a tundra hillside and a big brown was walking sideways to me. I just kept talking to my buddy in a normal tone and he showed no interest in us.<br>Another time I was walking along another tundra hillside with 3 others. We saw a black bear in the valley below us. They immediately start yelling, to try and deter it. But the bear immediately showed interest in us when we did so. He followed us around for the rest of the day.<br>It showed me that you just want to be relaxed around bears until they start showing signs of aggression. Walking towards you while staring intently, snapping the jaws, bluff charges, and circling you are all signs of aggression.

The &quot;wage gap&quot; nonsense has been so thoroughly ass fucked by basic statistics you won&#039;t hear it outside twitter and college campuses. It&#039;s not perfect but it&#039;s improving in that regard.<br><br>However, what is imploding is the prospect of owning a home and raising a family. Most of the property across the planet is owned by a handful of fucking trillion dollar investment groups that by homes for twice the asking price, flip them with grey and white furnishing and lease them for fucking 3k a month. Homes are for fucking living in, not for some billionaire&#039;s fucking speculation market. <br><br>The cost of raising a kid?Lol. Or sending them to the dystopian nightmare that is school by county board of never ending boomers.

I would like to start small and work my way up. Perhaps start with hunting some squirrels. Any anons here willing to provide some knowledge on how to get into hunting? Permits? Guns? Useful supplies when out in the bush? Type of game for beginners? How to locate the animal? How to navigate around the woods without getting lost? Things to look out for in order to stay safe?<br><br>Any information that can benefit inexperienced newbies and even experienced hunters alike would be greatly appreciated.", "filename": "rpr", "ext": ".png", "w": 1472, "h": 489, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675632833872364, "time": 1675632833, "md5": "DXb4KTiqfTCe/MIMbreNoQ==", "fsize": 1266954, "resto": 0, "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hunting", "replies": 58, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 57040867, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:38:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do you have a valid reason for wanting to murder helpless animals?

Squish the bag around to distribute the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Close, squish all the air out you can without letting any olive oil out the top. There should be a thin layer of olive oil all around the squirrel meat. Put in fridge for 3-4 days. Take out of bag, pan fry in butter. You can cut through the ribs on one side of the sternum with a knife (carefully) and break them near the spine and even cut through the pelvis to have the whole animal flat. The pelvis has a joint somewhere in the middle and with enough fiddling, opens right up with a knife. If your pan is big enough you can cook the whole thing. Comes out like good chicken. Just remember to remove the lymph nodes. Two on the lower back. One under each armpit (front) with tan tissue surrounding them. The two on the back might come up with the skin so don&#039;t be concerned if you don&#039;t find them immediately.

This guy had set up some bean bags, had a 10.5\u201d AR with a fuck off muzzle brake in the lane next to me shooting at a target he set up at maybe 15-20 yards. The thing is he was resting the barrel/brake on the bags and the muzzle brake shredded the bags after only a few rounds and started blasting sand everywhere to the lanes either side. Luckily It happened while I was back from the firing line chatting with a buddy. The guy on the lane to his right let out a big \u201cWTF!?\u201d As sand sprayed him. Two ROs came over and eventually told this guy to leave.

I was born from the first record of gunpowder created in china (1044). I dont know much about history, from the minute I was born I was just chilling. But I am a youkai. Now unlike most other youkai, I dont need human fear to exist, I sorta just am. I grew up in a chinese village, dodging premature death with my seriously good regenerative powers. They basically keep me alive from any illness or disease, and can heal major wounds including even a severed head. Did I mention I was an isekaijin?Not important. I also have shapeshifting powers, but they are kinda bad, I can only change my face or body features. Essentially I can only shape shift into different humans. I was chopping up riceniggas with muh dao, and many times I got sliced or mortally wounded. I just play dead, wait for the enemy to leave and just come back as a different guy. Most of the armor I wore was stolen since I was dirt fucking poor in china even with my cheat powers. Fighting is my hobby, since I can do it safely for the most part. Anyways time felt like ages at the start, I experimented with a lot of weapons but none stuck, so I went with the first chinese traders on a trip to europe. It was difficult, and although I switched caravans many times, I made it. Actually I went back and forth many times to study small arms gunpowder technology, since time back then was ages. I took a bit of the lawrencepill, became a trader really just so I could get some hard cash, and set up some shit in europe. Anyways I liked european melee weapons too, and started taking the polearm pill. I love russian shit so I got a bardiche which went well with my matchlock musket. Big pain to reload so I got into pistols at this time as well. I usually carried my musket slung across the chest with a modern adjustable sling, but the pistol and dagger is a great cc choice for innatown.

Also a lot of trannys, and you cant really tell since they can mimic a female down to the internals. Kinda gross. I usually kept to myself anyways. Ok im just gonna skip to the 1800s. I moved to america but split my time between it and europe. The percussion cap is so cool. I got a cap rifle, a cap revolver, very cool very tactical. But muzzleloaders are not heckin valid bros. So I got a needle gun. It was really popular at the time. This and the first mauser though, were really innovative but had weak ejection or no ejection on some models. Still though, very cool. I fought in a few of the mid 19th century wars, very cool. Its like vacation for me, and then im back to the office, back to the neet study room. Anyways I got a vetterli, cool. There were a few other tube loaders that came out, but I dragged my feet until I got the new italian vetterli with magazine. Very beautiful rifle.

I got myself an SVD off the factory before the factory fiting test. She was a beautiful girl, half st petersburg noble and half udmurt girl. She was very pretty, had rosy skin and a round forehead, a nicely defined nose. She had beautiful honey colored waist length blonde hair cut with straight bangs, dark eyebrows and brown eyes. She was tall, 10cm above my height (177 vs 167) and skinny like a model. She had no breasts like the most beautiful women do, and a small bony ass, thin legs and slightly large hands, just enough to be off putting. She had fox ears and a big fluffy tail. She wore a russian school uniform for many years. I immediately asked her to marry me, but she said no. This marked the end of my attempts at romance with her for a long time. She rejected me 38 times before she agreed go hang out with me. I never once flirted with her for many months knowing her, in fear. She hated me. I dont think guns have an obligation to serve or even like their masters. I dont like the term owner, I prefer to see myself as a caretaker. Even still I shot her a lot and travelled the world with her over the years, showing her many places and treating her with many things. I was her best friend, or so was my ambition. Finally at age 983 I lost my virginity to her.

It was originally supposed to be the naval gunfire replacement for the Iowa class which up to that point the Navy still retained enough unique battleship components to reactivate. At the same time function as the next generation of mainline cruiser/destroyer. Problem is the program got very expensive and Congress kept slashing the number of total hulls to build. Originally 32 were to be procured, by the time Congress was done monkey fucking it only three would end up being completed. Which in itself isn\u2019t entirely the worst thing because you get three very advanced destroyers and their unique gun systems, however the advanced gun system used a unique round that was guided. With only three ships in the fleet each individual round would cost $1 million which was infeasible when you can buy missiles for that much. This was made worse by the delays in the rail gun program, The zulmwalt was originally designed to incorporate a railgun once development was done but the program is experiencing metallurgical issues. The rails don\u2019t have nearly the longevity and suffered significant damage during testing. The weapon works, problem is it would require swapping out barrels too often. This means the Zumwalt was built in too few numbers for its unique ammunition to be cost-effective to purchase, and its future railgun refit keeps getting pushed farther and farther back. So now they are just going to remove the guns or at least one of them and replace it with a hypersonic missile pack. <br><br>I wish the Navy would just bite the bullet and develop a new battleship class instead of attempting and fucking up the old battleships replacements.", "time": 1675633974, "resto": 57039407}, {"no": 57041022, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:57:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57039407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57039407</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is it shit?</span><br>Its not shit.

Most will seem true but, only one can actually be derived from the provided passage.<br><br>Section 3: MCT (Mechanical Comprehension Test): The questions in this section are similar to what would find in an intro to physics class. Brush up on your knowledge of basic physics and how it relates to velocity, volume, and pressure as well as the mechanics of simple machines when it comes to gears, electricity, and weight distribution.<br><br>Section 4: ANIT (Aviation and Nautical Information Test): You guessed it! On this section of the ASTB you\u2019re going to need to know some nautical terminology, a little bit of aviation history as well as some principles of aviation like aerodynamic principles, basic aircraft components, and flight rules", "time": 1675570783, "resto": 57030831}, {"no": 57033094, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:21:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p57033076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57033076</a><br><br>Section 5: NATFI (Naval Aviation Trait Facet Inventory): You sort of get off easy here as there\u2019s no real way to prepare for this section. It\u2019s a personality inventory that, in the end, will gauge ones suitability for a career in aviation based on their personal characteristics.<br><br>Section 6: PBM (Performance Based Measures Battery): Depending on your tastes this might be the most \u2018fun\u2019 part of the ASTB. You basically get to do a flight simulation. You\u2019ll be given a flight mock-up flight console with a throttle and joystick along with a headset. You\u2019ll also get a map that you\u2019ll need to study before guiding an airplane around on a screen. For a more detailed of explanation of this section check out our full-length article of the different sections of the ASTB called ASTB Test Layout.<br><br>Section 7: BI-RV (Biographical Inventory with Response Validation): This is the part of the ASTB that you can complete from any computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that you complete this section prior to writing the rest of the ASTB. All it is, is a questionnaire about your previous experiences and successes or achievements with aviation. Like section 5 you really can\u2019t prepare for this section \u2013 just answer honestly as there aren\u2019t any real right or wrong responses.<br><br>IOW, bitch you should have prepared lel.

Its not the metal or gun technology that was the problem for China. It was the society itself that was fucked. Guns/cannons/grenades/hand canons were all used during the Mongol invasion. It was in mass usage in China in before the western european states capitalized on them. The problem was when mongols ruled over China, the society was traumazed as a result of this conquest. Something like half of Chinese lost their livelihood to the resulting chaos. Ming dynasty after the fall of the Mongols greatly utilized the gunpowder weapons across the entire military lineup. It wasn&#039;t a deciding factor at the time because the gun powders were still not advanced enough. The problem was how the government was setup by the Ming and the politics revolving around it. The same problem was with Qing as well (as well as many other Chinese dynasties). <br>The old state politics revolved around confucian politicians from various parts of China forming majority of the rules and emperors taking a more imperial role. But with the Ming, they centralized the power into an absolute monarch system. The confucian politicians were put aside and the imperial enuchs were the ones making the laws. This corrupted the system greatly (although the old system was almost as corrupt). Leading to monarch dissatisfactions and eventual political betrayals by local politicians in favor of Qing dynasty. The disheavel was worse in Qing because they weren&#039;t &quot;Chinese&quot; proper either. Like the Mongols of the past, they were viewed as outsiders and needed to be overthrown/etc. Qing had to wrestle with countless insurgencies throughout the empire as political instability led to their collapse. But even as the political system was on the brink of collapse, their tech/mettalurgy industries never wavered. In fact, more and more guns were used in all walks of life in Chinese military.

Look up Sea Control Ship, and the eternal debate (over 50 years old now) between supercarriers and light carriers. In terms of cosst-effectiveness, supercarriers are the clear winner by a large margin.<br>2) Somebody has to maintain it. F-35s require more maintainers than Seahawks. And a lot more fuel.<br>3) We&#039;ve been over this dozens of times in previous threads. Direct-thrust craft are lousy at VTO. That&#039;s why nobody does VTO outside of demonstrations; everybody uses them in STOVL mode, because the amount of fuel and weapons you can carry goes from almost nothing to (especially with a ramp) a fair percentage of what a CATOBAR can carry. VL is fine, because by that point you&#039;ve burned off most of your fuel, and probably expended some of your weapons, thus lightening the load.<br><br>Now, does that mean you&#039;d never, ever land a F-35 on an DDG, or even a LCS? No. It&#039;s a crazy idea that just might be needed someday (especially in the event of an emergency).
