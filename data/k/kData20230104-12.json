I have a rifle that with good stance and control i can send 147gr slugs with rapidity into the brush close up and if need be I also can shoot over a valley 600-800m away and have decent success with heavy winds. Besides just being a cool configuration bullpups do have advantages and disadvantages. Nothing is ever for free. Laying prone with extended mags, reloading from prone, reloading in general is a tad slower but that isn&#039;t so much a disadvantage as everyone highlights. I guess if you plan on 1v6 ing a bunch of people you may want to reconsider another platform.<br><br>Overall i would say that a lot of bullpups suffer from adequate forends. I&#039;ve seen some sweet AUGs with nice forends that allow good control and attachment space. Another thing a good forend allows is space to brace. The Tavors generally have a cutlass grip and shorter rails which is nice for stabilizing in some ways but also now you have a single pivot point and when you&#039;re trying to keep steady for a 400m+ shot, you get a lot of vertical play. I wish the Tavor7 had just 2-3 more inches and i would be super happy with that as i have long arms and it feels more comfortable with longer shots.

Suppressors help a ton, going from 160-175dB down to 120-140dB is a huge help particularly since it doubles up perfectly and works even in an emergency. But that&#039;s still LOUD. Don&#039;t believe industry horseshit about how &lt;140dB is &quot;hearing safe&quot;, that&#039;s merely the level at which you don&#039;t suffer significant instantaneous permanent hearing loss.

Pic related, NIOSH guidelines for actual real work.<br><br>Advantage of suppression is that plain earpro maxes out at ~40dB reduction, and that&#039;s if you do everything perfectly. Suppressor means you can get away with cheaper, easier 20-30dB earpro and still be fine, and you&#039;ve got safety margin in case of bad fit or marginal conditions (like indoor range or next to cliffs or something) etc. It should be a basic cheap OTC safety option like in a lot of the EU even.

Games often run larger but the simulation accuracy degrades for a variety of reasons. Where it shines is creating real-time situations against other commanders for you to respond to and challenge your knowledge. Many incidents caught on camera in Ukraine attest to Wargame&#039;s overall accuracy, though it&#039;s important to consider what it omits like minefields/combat engineering.

I advise learning the basic mechanics in the solo campaigns. Don&#039;t stick with it too long, they&#039;re fun but the ai plays nothing like a human and is exploitable, it competes via cheating so you&#039;ll learn bad habits. Next, spend an hour comparing units you liked/hated/feared from the campaign and build a basic deck with some of them. Don&#039;t worry about filling every slot or following a meta, you won&#039;t have the skill to succeed with it yet. I advise starting with specialty decks in 5000pt 10v10 &quot;tactical&quot; servers. Give yourself a mission, like &quot;I will prevent a bridge crossing&quot;, &quot;I will sneak special forces into this backline capture zone to identify and ambush opportunity targets&quot; or &quot;I will provide artillery support in this sector&quot;, and just focus on controlling and succeeding with the small cluster of units needed to accomplish it. Expect to lose badly or feel like you didn&#039;t help the team win, everyone starts that way. After a few games you&#039;ll get the flow of battle better and can more effectively command the various units you&#039;ll need to succeed.

Hold up a sign with a penis on it<br>stating, &quot;The uncircumcised have rights too.&quot; It&#039;s best to insult something<br>that is very dear to someone, like something they have wasted (and &#039;wasted&#039; is<br>the key word), their lives plugging away. A t-shirt that says &quot;Breast cancer<br>is good. More breathing room on the train&quot; will definitely do the trick.<br>Getting people angry with you will waste time, and you might actually get<br>people to join your moronic cause. Then you can get money out of them. Look<br>what it did for Scientology. Racism is also very important when you are<br>offending people. There is nothing that offends people more than racism. You<br>don&#039;t have to be a racist to practice racism at all. Buy a dirty joke book and<br>make it your bible.

No bells and whistles so no recording your hunts, fancy reticles, color palettes (White/Black hot only) or phone connectivity but it will get the job done. Funnily enough that simplicity helps you dodge the worst parts of ATN digital/thermal devices which are their buggy firmware and apps. It mounts in standard scope rings and since its thermal so you don&#039;t need any extra equipment beyond batteries. You&#039;ll be able to spot animals through light brush and in areas you can&#039;t easily illuminate, but you are going to have to get used to shooting at low res animal shaped blobs.

With an illuminator at rimfire ranges you will have a very good high res display almost like you would have through a traditional daytime scope, just black and white. You also get a built in recorder and daytime color image.

Little buddy isn&#039;t doing well. For a brief day or two, the increased meds seemed to be working, his liver swelling has gone down more and his eyes were clear and he could see me. Now he&#039;s not playing, not eating, not drinking. He lays under the dining room table, his eyesight seems to be bad again. All we could get him to eat was some tuna-flavored tapioca paste that the vet would give him (it&#039;s only like 6 calories per tube, so not much), and he drank a small amount of water, but that was on the morning of the 2nd. He&#039;s just returned to laying under the table and taking nothing, he feels cold to the touch.<br>By all accounts, it seems like his liver is failing, and he&#039;s probably going to die. We&#039;re now looking at an in-home euthanasia service so he doesn&#039;t need to leave his home or his family. If the weather in the morning permits, I&#039;m going to bring him outside to the back yard. It&#039;s only fair, he&#039;s wanted to go out there for the whole of his short little life, and we kept saying he could when he was a little bigger in the spring, lest an owl or hawk grab him. I think now is the time to grant that wish, he won&#039;t last that long unless a miracle happens. I don&#039;t think he would run if he wanted to anyway.<br>Thanks for the sympathy and support that you guys have given through this ordeal. I may try to post some videos I have of him later if it&#039;s alright. I&#039;m currently posting from work, so when I finally post again it will probably be after he&#039;s gone.

They arguably put their budget to better use too, opting against torsion bars that didn&#039;t offer real advantages over leaf springs yet to give the Pz.IV&#039;s turret an electric drive, which is a massive advantage in reaction time and gunnery over the Pz.III&#039;s hand crank.<br>That&#039;s however not to say that anyone could&#039;ve had the foresight to cancel Pz.III.

There constantly were new innovations in mechanical engineering that had to be integrated into a design in progress, which gets exponentially more difficult without CAD or any computers at all, unless slide rules count.<br>The army itself often couldn&#039;t accurately predict what it needed in the upcoming war.

Due to driving distance and not wanting to spend long periods of time away from my kids I likely won\u2019t be shooting anywhere else for a while. I\u2019m comfortable with spending up to 1k usd. Been really looking at an M&amp;P 2.0 in 10mm (realistically probably ordered off gunbroker) but there\u2019s also a local gun store with a new judge with the 6.5 inch barrel that takes the 3 inch 410 shells\u2026.

I have a couple 22\u2019s a revolver and 2 pistols, and a 1911 in 45 (kinda want some variety so this pushed me away from the 10mm in a 1911 form).

This will help determine how much thought &amp; research needs to go into each weapon &amp; character wielding it.<br><br>When did the guns originate from? Will they be mostly WWI surplus? Will they be largely civilian models from the era? Will they be new (manufactured ~1920) or older, used? Because, you might be looking at what was commonly available during the 1890s. In 1920 Mexico, there may be surplus guns (and ammo) from several wars (around the world) conducted during the 1890s and up to about WWI.<br><br>Did the hero bring his own gun(s) to Mexico? Or did he make do with what he found when he got there? This will determine likely availability both for the hero and other characters. The question will also apply to long guns that may make appearances.<br><br>For one example of many possibilities, a fairly &quot;modern&quot; cartridge designed for revolvers in 1907 is the .44 Special (by Smith &amp; Wesson). It&#039;s an ideal dick-swinging cartridge for 1920, like a .44 mag or a .454 today. It would have been a powerful, designed specifically for smokeless powder:<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.44_S<wbr>pecial<br><br>Other legacy cartridges prior to the turn of the century either still used black powder or used smokeless powder poorly. Note that by 1920, there would still be people using black powder firearms, so other characters in the movie might be shooting those, especially in Mexico, which can lead to some impressive cinematography when 4 or 5 people light of six or ten rounds each.", "time": 1672811201, "resto": 56621824}, {"no": 56623427, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:25:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56621824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56621824</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the us</span><br>Colt 1903/1908 pocket hammerless<br>1908 baby browning .25s<br>colt and S&amp;W .22LR 32 and 38 da revolvers (model 10, new service, pocket positive, pocket positive)<br>larger semi auto pistols like the fn 1900 or 1911s werent the most common handgun, they werent that ubiquitous until post ww2, european handguns arent common until post war too, even then revolvers were more popular, exact actual numbers of civillian gun ownership prior to gun registration is a mystery, but gun companies sold a shit load of fucking guns, in the millions, gun models that &quot;only&quot; sold 60,000 units between 1865 and 1935 were considered abysmal commercial failures, today that would be making a killing", "time": 1672813547, "resto": 56621824}, {"no": 56623452, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:32:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56622578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56622578</a><br>A real Life gun fighter, Frank Pape, was involved in 25 gunfights, carried &quot;shitty&quot; 38 colt positives, not tryhard bullshit some boomer likes", "time": 1672813933, "resto": 56621824}, {"no": 56623464, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:36:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56622460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56622460</a><br>not true at all for the US<br>especially when most of the country had firearms<br>people purchased new firearms back then as tech progressed", "time": 1672814192, "resto": 56621824}, {"no": 56623514, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:45:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56621824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56621824</a><br>Model 10 in the Americas.

When that commandment was written, God was unknowable to men, it being said that gazing upon his true form would kill a man, or make him burst into flames.

However, Jesus, the Apostles, and the author of Revelations also referred to Christ as the lamb of God, being the everlasting sacrifice for our sins, and in Revelations the visions of Christ that were written down had him depicted as a lamb at times, so it&#039;s not totally erroneous and we aren&#039;t worshipping golden idols of a lamb either way so I think it&#039;s fine.", "time": 1672648530, "resto": 56567726}, {"no": 56601725, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:21:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56599460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56599460</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yet those are the acts of corrupted individuals </span><br>Wrong.

Especially in .357 mag, which really only starts to shine when the barrel is 3&quot; minimum or (much better) 4&quot; &amp; up to about 6-ish. That&#039;s a full-size weapon, you want 6 shots (or 7 or 8) in a revolver. Now you have a home defense weapon plus a great plinker &amp; target shooter &amp; hunting weapon. You can plink .38 out of it all day and keep .357 in reserve for defense/hunting.<br><br>If you want a target shooter that can also do &quot;other things,&quot; try to find something in a 4&quot; or 4 1/2&quot; barrel to get .357-worthy performance out of it. If you drop down to 3 1/2&quot; or under, you&#039;re getting a lot of flash &amp; bang out of it but actual ballistics are marginally better than 9mm out of a semi-auto (9mm out of a revolver will be gimped by the cylinder gap, thus the P+ capability if you need self-defense).<br><br>My personal preference is solid stainless steel for a .357 mag. It will last forever. So, for durability &amp; corrosion resistance, give that some thought. Blued carbon steel needs care &amp; maintenance to retain aesthetics &amp; value, brushed nickel has a nice aesthetic, but might as well go for stainless at that point since it&#039;s nearly the same and more durable.<br><br>You can also look to guns that you can swap barrels, which gives you a 2&quot; snubby w/ .38 option for SD, but you can configure a 5&quot; on there and kill beer cans w/ .357 at 50 meters. Or deer. Now we&#039;re talking &quot;a good do-everything gun.&quot;<br><br>Why do you want a revolver? Just curious.

I don&#039;t regret it at all, it&#039;s a great layout, and in fact there are reasonable arguments that doing it as a first is better not worse. A lot of the complaints you see about modern ones (early ones did have bad triggers and such, took time to refine them, but same can be said about traditional layout guns too) come down to people having tons of muscle memory/practice/comfort with ARs. But if you&#039;re new you&#039;ve got none of that. Good bullpups won&#039;t have issues with reloads or whatever if you&#039;ve actually equivalently trained with them. And you will be able to move between bullpups relatively easily too, so not like you&#039;ve got no variety if you want something else.<br><br>The downsides as people have said are that there is a much higher price floor (not that you can&#039;t spend even more on ARs, but you can get decent ones for much less), there is a smaller aftermarket (which may or may not matter to you), more limited servicing (so make sure there is a decent warranty) etc. They are on average all heavier, albeit with weight farther back towards your body which can make that weight feel better and be easier to control in use. But weight is weight if you plan to do outdoors trips.<br><br>If you can afford it though go for it. Make sure to test it thoroughly right away. And then practice.

A .357 mag is a much longer cartridge and builds much higher pressure. If a revolver is designed to take 9mm from the ground up, you&#039;d need some way to stretch the cylinder and the entire frame to accomodate ... plus, it would have to have been designed to handle at least the equivalent of 9mm +P+ before any conversion attempt.<br><br>So, I&#039;m going to say &quot;Qualified: No.&quot;<br><br>However, Chiappa may have already considered all this from the beginning and they might have at least some sort of solution for some models. It&#039;s possible that any 9mm Chiappas they sell are already based on the .357, just configured for 9mm awaiting the day it can be converted.<br><br>While I might look into that if I wanted to try it myself, I&#039;d probably just buy the .357 mag from the beginning and down-convert it to 9mm when I had funds available to acquire all the parts to do so. Instead of fucking around trying to jury-rig an abortion that will probably blow up in my hand, I&#039;d invest in a .357/.38 with a couple barrel options &amp; keep 9mm as a &quot;maybe for the future&quot; option.

The point is that all parts have some kind of tolerance. For an easy to explain example, take the length of the barrel. Let&#039;s say it&#039;s supposed to be 5 inches. None of the barrels will be exactly 5.0000000 inches on the dot. some will be 4.95, some will be 5.01, and so on. The same thing applies to how straight the bore of the barrel is machined relative to the rest of it. It&#039;s supposed to be perfectly straight, but again in real life nothing is ever perfect, and one barrel might be .001 degrees to the left, the next might be .01 degrees up and .005 right, the next might be .01 left and .1 down, and so on. That&#039;s why guns have adjustable sights, so you can adjust them to account for all those production imperfections. You know the two barrels you have are different from each other, but nothing you wrote so far suggests that one of them is &quot;not seated right&quot;. It is normal and expected for the POI to change if you swap barrels in a pistol.

Use a small rubber mallet to smack one side of the trigger guard gently; do it too hard and you&#039;ll probably split the wood. Repeat on other (left and right side of trigger guard).

While spam, eggs and sausages sounds like solid breakfast, by mid fifties lot of people were fed up with spam and rather lived rest of their life without spam. Fast forward a decade. This is when the sketch was made. Roll on decade and half and new thing called internet is spreading and infecting academic institutions and tech companies, plebs weren&#039;t allowed to participate until about decade later. The early 80&#039;s is the point when someone who probably did not get the original joke of the Monty Python sketch saw it. That guy probably also ended up receiving some of the original spam e-mails and connected the two things. Spam that he didn&#039;t know why island niggers aren&#039;t particularly fond of it for reasons he didn&#039;t understand and not exactly called for offer for new computer hardware on his e-mail. Someone saw a joke about being really fed up with something for reasons he didn&#039;t really get on a funny tv-show.

The USA/UK had a huge merchant marine to begin with, high quality and numerous escorts, broken codes, better detection through centimetric radar (even in planes!), air cover, convoys, specialized and studied ASW tactics, specialized ASW weapons, experienced/high quality crews, etc.. Ship types had little to do with success, Germany&#039;s biggest successes came from breaking UK Naval codes and early ineptitude, not fancy technology or ships. The Battle of the Atlantic is the same as the Battle of Britain, the result was never really in doubt when we have 20/20 hindsight. <br><br> All Japan had going for it were defective USA torpedoes. Not only did they not have enough escorts, the destroyers they did have were used retardedly, like as troop transports. Japan&#039;s ASW was utterly hopeless and they lacked every element from production to a large merchant marine to air cover to proper RADAR detection, etc... There was even a study done that, had the USA had good torpedoes and focused entirely on anti-shipping, Japan would likely have collapsed militarily within a year (might have been even shorter, I don&#039;t remember the exact timeline).", "time": 1672637948, "resto": 56598074}, {"no": 56600248, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)00:48:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "they should have taken the resources that went into building U boats and used them to build Zeppelins instead to bomb the eastern seaboard and the panama canal. it worked really well in the last war", "time": 1672638485, "resto": 56598074}, {"no": 56600415, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)01:12:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p56600180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56600180</a><br>Drop them off covertly using U-boats.
