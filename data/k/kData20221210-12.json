It never made sense to buy one when you could invest $1k into mags, ammo, and a whole ass sidearm.

A thinner sword blade can flex further without stressing the material much, but it&#039;ll also take less force to bend to far and it&#039;ll be floppy in general. A thicker blade will be stiffer (so in a test like that it simply won&#039;t bend as far if an equal force is applied), which is a good thing, and take much more force to break but in return it can&#039;t bend as far before it&#039;s over-stressed. In this respect the thicker blade is basically better, it&#039;s just that thickness means weight and we don&#039;t want all too much of that.<br>If we take two pieces of identical shape and look at the material on the other hand we want something that can deform a good amount before it can&#039;t spring back to its original shape any more. This also means it can take a lot of force before that happens, since the relationship between force applied and deformation up to that point is largely linear and basically the same for all steels regardless of alloying and tempering. Then once it does start deforming permanently it&#039;s nice to have a bit of a safety margin before it snaps completely.<br>Combining the two we find that in the thicker blade a certain degree of bend demands a greater deformation of the steel at the inside and outside of the curve, making it resist bending more. So it&#039;ll break at less bend, but it takes an insane amount of force for that. A very thin blade instead can be rolled up without damage, but is too floppy for use and any force it can&#039;t bend out f the way of will ruin it. As for the test shown the difference in thickness could be used to imply a material quality difference that isn&#039;t actually there, if (big if) it was done fairly.<br><br><a href=\"#p56345560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56345560</a><br>The easier it (temporarily) bends the further you must bend it to break it.<br>The harder it is to bend the more force you need to break it.", "filename": "sg088", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 894, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670668746448923, "time": 1670668746, "md5": "P9Bh8ou3t/zd97VOYRbo2w==", "fsize": 187706, "resto": 56334256, "m_img": 1, "trip": "!hgcMxFhLmk"}, {"no": 56348578, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)05:47:25", "name": "KM", "com": "<a href=\"#p56346598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56346598</a><br>Wood.<br><br><a href=\"#p56346485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;56346485</a><br>I&#039;m not sure the &quot;my way&#039;s the only way&quot; troll is going to take any lessons to heart.", "filename": "157_hilt-v", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 699, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 43, "tim": 1670669245353308, "time": 1670669245, "md5": "mQEqj+P2EP8m/aN+LF3Kbg==", "fsize": 366510, "resto": 56334256, "m_img": 1, "trip": "!hgcMxFhLmk"}], "last_modified": 1670669245}, {"no": 56346284, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)22:59:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is a Sig, right?

With PVS-14s you can just shoulder to shoot and resume scooting. Make sure the boys get as much ammo down range as they can to ensure they have a decent idea for how much they need to rely on body index, since they have no lasers. You might want to try having the -7s cammed part way up so you can peek under them to do white light transitions without having to flip them up. Keep in mind that if you need to scoot through a mixed light area under -7s, that you will fail to identify how well you are concealed. Keeping the -7 cammed up will help with this too.
