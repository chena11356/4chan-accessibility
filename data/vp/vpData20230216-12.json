Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3&quot;03&#039; tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they&#039;re large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there&#039;s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it&#039;d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick.

Especially since each champion essentially has friendly nukes anyways (especially in regions like Kalos and Galar), I&#039;m guessing there are hundreds of checks and balances to prevent stuff like the old Kalosian War from ever happening again in the present day. Every Champion probably swears an oath to do no harm and focuses more on regional affairs than foreign incidents, especially with Interpol about to handle that instead.<br>Neighbors probably influence each other somewhat. Johto and Kanto are known to share a league, which means they&#039;re definitely intertwined at the very minimum. It&#039;s also been noted that Unova is the capital of movie-making with Kalos supplying its biggest stars, so I think if there&#039;s any influence from other regions it usually comes in the form of entertainment- either in the form of movies or championship tournaments broadcast on TV. I doubt most regions are affected much by others&#039; foreign policies. <br>In my head, in terms of power, Unova has always ranked pretty high due to the high evolution levels and the billions of battle facilities (PWT, White Tree Hollow, Black City, Battle Subway, etc), with Galar and Sinnoh coming soon after for similar reasons (though Galar is mostly just there due to the Masters 8 and Dynamax). Kalos and the tropical regions probably take things pretty slow, while Johto is weaker than Kanto but still probably stronger than Kalos or Alola (even if it&#039;s the weakest of the Japanese regions in my head). Paldea is definitely in the middle of the bell curve, it just seems like it should be there.

Mostly a collection of warehouses and large one-story homes. The most notable building to its name was the church on a hill in the north, and maybe the mines even further north than that. <br><br>Regardless of its plain qualities, Pillow was... relieved. Relieved to be here. She&#039;d accomplished something, and this city was quaint- much unlike the hustle and bustle of the last few they&#039;d visited.

The tactic seemed to be working, as the small crowd of mon that&#039;d gathered around the mysterious trio seemed rather loud and excited. <br><br>So excited, in fact, that a Herdier in the crowd quickly took notice of the newcomers I&#039;ve been documenting and rushed to hold up Hannah specifically as an example.", "filename": "8img", "ext": ".png", "w": 1247, "h": 1315, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676076096810069, "time": 1676076096, "md5": "9silvTQ/aXSTf8lu+ydQDQ==", "fsize": 391282, "resto": 53193370}, {"no": 53204769, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)19:51:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53204714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53204714</a><br>&quot;Look, look!&quot; the Herdier exclaimed, holding up a claw to the Bolt badge shining on Hannah&#039;s shoulder. &quot;You&#039;re right, Mr Ghetsis sir!

Eventually, the crowding got so bad that Sylvia attempted to Slash her way through, only to be instantly bombarded by a crowd of already-riled-up attendees. <br>Pillow quickly came to her aid, as did Hannah, though the crowd proved hard to beat back.

He tried to goad the medic into admitting solidarity, describing exactly how abusive humans could be.<br><br>The Audino seemed to stop for a moment, almost giving a reply, before simply shaking his head and backing up, his heart pounding as his eyes returned to the deep red pair in the back.<br>Snorkel followed Potpourri&#039;s line of sight, only to laugh for a moment and continue his rant- for just a brief moment.<br><br>Right then and there he declared that, finally, Potpourri&#039;s answer didn&#039;t matter. Whether Pillow&#039;s team was there to get in his way or not, Snorkel finally had the means to prove Pokemon shouldn&#039;t be around humans once and for all. <br><br>The Patrat scurried up Zekrom&#039;s right arm on all fours, coming to rest like a cat atop its shoulder, sneering at the group below before whispering something in the dragon&#039;s earhole.<br><br>Only a few moments after, the top of the tower had crumbled away, and the mysterious pair was gone.<br><br>As for the team? If not for Dolores, the entire team would have drowned right then and there- either out of shock, or due to the 40-foot fall.<br><br>(I was gonna draw for this, but it&#039;s way too late now.

And I love it. I think that, in my ideal world, it would have still been the GSC that we got but there would have been some modern style integration of the betamons back into the fold either in Crystal or something like Stadium 2. Not all of them, but the more interesting ones. I would have loved to see whatever that original canine legendary was as well as the tigers, wolfman and a few others. Some of those designs are actually really cool and I think they would have completely changed the trajectory of the franchise. Maybe I&#039;ll get some disagreement and even hate for saying this, but I remember when RS came out and the dex was leaking because I&#039;m that fucking old. A lot of those Pok\u00e9mon did not look like Pok\u00e9mon and I remember at the time the internet community was sort of divided on whether they were really cool or the series had jumped the shark. And I wonder if they stuck to their guns with the beta Pok\u00e9mon from GSC if that would not have happened. A lot of those designs definitely had more of a goofy, generic RPG monster and sort of fun feel to them.

Then you get random tough looking monsters like the scorpion or Viking boat, which seem honestly out of place next to everything else. And we also have what appears to be a line with four stages with that dryad looking Pokemon. Ultimately I&#039;m ok with what we really got bc it had a more healthy mix that leaned into having monsters that looked more tough and I think it helped develop more of that essence that modern Pok\u00e9mon have, which sets them apart from the other &#039;90s JRPGs.

They were at a point where they knew what Pok\u00e9mon was and how they wanted to change it, so everything was pretty much documented instead of just bullshitted. I get the impression that the first two generations were very similar to how the original Mega Man games on the NES were created -- everyone on the development team just kind of shot ideas into the dark and everybody voted on their favorites, refining each other&#039;s concepts until they got something they all agreed upon as pretty cool. Whereas I think RSE sort of began the idea that the Pok\u00e9mon were going to be created by a select few members of the team who were like the experts and then everybody else had specific jobs. This is all speculation, I don&#039;t know for a fact. But it seems like in all the generations going forward there are a few people that design the Pok\u00e9mon and have that creative input, and then there&#039;s also the TPCI input that probably deletes Pok\u00e9mon they don&#039;t like as well.

People forget that there were a handful of Generation 3 Pok\u00e9mon who were appearing during Generation 2&#039;s time, and similar to how GSC Pok\u00e9mon popped up during the RBY cycle we had slow reveals and integration of RSE Pok\u00e9mon into the GSC cycle. That game was in development for a pretty long time, so there definitely had to be a lot of scraps that were saved somewhere. Generation 4 and 5 would also have this, maybe 6. But that&#039;s definitely something we don&#039;t get anymore with the super fast development cycle they&#039;ve created for themselves. Now we get Pok\u00e9mon revealed an instantly can play as them within the year, whereas I distinctly recall being in middle school/high school knowing that at some point in the future, I didn&#039;t know when, I would be using something like Kecleon or Blaziken And there was a ton of speculation for all that time.

I imagine Penny\u2019s pussy is pretty unkempt, hairy, has a bit of a smell, etc but honestly i wouldn&#039;t care and eat it out for hours. Holy shit Penny is just peak sexual attractiveness for me, gonna go jack off to her now, later tards.", "filename": "529dd3fe847084fd94cf823931c84105", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1292, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676543335997357, "time": 1676543335, "md5": "JSA1QbIOVZyzUebz4KLUTA==", "fsize": 979511, "resto": 53237383}, {"no": 53239466, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:35:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53237383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53237383</a><br>Is she really a fujo?", "time": 1676543727, "resto": 53237383}, {"no": 53239773, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:08:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53239439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53239439</a><br>Extremely based Anon.

Sure, she had ridden the updrafts high above various areas of Johto before, but had never touched down nor had reason to until the past ten days she&#039;d spent shacked up with Ash.<br><br>The sky darkened considerably as the smoky gray, nearly charcoal black clouds sealed the hole the sun had snuck its rays through. A small swarm of Murkrow noisily squabbled overhead, causing the disguised dragon debutante to look up and watch them fly toward their nests early that day. She caught sight of one large building with a giant mechanical Castform on top. It began to glow blue and shift its pistons and parts into a semblance of one in rainy form just as she began to feel raindrops lightly pelting her arms and neck. <br><br>While Latias still didn&#039;t quite understand the reasoning behind how humans lived, she admired their technological ingenuity nonetheless. Her reflected image of a human hand clutched an umbrella more tightly to her side as she hurried along.<br><br>To better understand human ways for Ash, she had spent much of her time in Goldenrod reading about culture at a place called a library. There she had learned about the romantic concept of &quot;aiaigasa&quot; and was eager to show up for Ash at his &quot;interview building&quot; with the umbrella when he wasn&#039;t expecting her. <br><br>On her way, she passed another familiar building with a large display window that had caught her attention and caused her to linger for much of the past week. She was dismayed to find the object shown off behind the glass now missing.", "filename": "Latias Ash Cuteness", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 600, "tn_w": 104, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676385638065835, "time": 1676385638, "md5": "P06qJiQ6OaVlOlxOgHXcfg==", "fsize": 113054, "resto": 53202396}, {"no": 53227338, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)11:11:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I just want to hug the plane.. a lot.", "filename": "90373557_p0", "ext": ".png", "w": 2894, "h": 4093, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676391082989404, "time": 1676391082, "md5": "fpCTQcR3EwLhaNgYqc1KXg==", "fsize": 2402568, "resto": 53202396}, {"no": 53228143, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)13:01:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53226938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53226938</a><br>Nice, can&#039;t wait to see the other parts.<br><br><a href=\"#p53227338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53227338</a><br>Same, imagine the feathers upon one&#039;s skin.", "time": 1676397703, "resto": 53202396}, {"no": 53228499, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:12:26", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674292307714519", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676401946111056, "time": 1676401946, "md5": "Rvwe1eCwcMaaj0YsEHuO/g==", "fsize": 317183, "resto": 53202396}, {"no": 53228752, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)15:01:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53226938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53226938</a><br>Finally gotten around to seeing True Love Never Fades, it&#039;s pretty neat so far but is there only five chapters?

After a rigorous 10 day interview process, he was given the job of traveling to the most remote places on the planet to research Pokemon in an official capacity. Despite similar experiences way back when he was 10, this time he&#039;d be paid and his work would be published in peer reviewed journals of the likes that Professor Oak revered. <br><br>Ash noticed the unusual darkness looming and was met with a light steady rain once outside. It didn&#039;t stop him from taking a jumping leap into the air and whooping out in joy, not caring who would see him. <br><br>Just when he started worrying about how he&#039;d get back to his hotel in Azalea Town without being completely drenched, he noticed a familiar girl with sparkling eyes and a big smile leaning against a post and holding an umbrella. Ash grinned, rushing over to her and giving her a big hug. She wrapped the arm not holding an umbrella around him. <br><br>Latias no longer took the form of Bianca and had instead chosen a new form with features seemingly plucked out of Ash&#039;s brain as being most attractive. Truth be told, he preferred being with her in her true form. It felt unique, special, and she was just the most radiant and ravishing that way. But that was best enjoyed in private. <br><br>&quot;I got it! I got the job!&quot; Ash shouted excitedly to his sweetheart. A slight worried look flashed over Latias&#039; features, but was quickly replaced by an open mouth exclamation of glee, and a very unnhumanlike nuzzle of her head into Ash&#039;s chest. <br><br>The birdplane leaned her head on Ash&#039;s shoulder as they shared the umbrella and traveled down Route 34, the other people out and about smiling at their closeness.
