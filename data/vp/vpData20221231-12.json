Anyone that isn&#039;t blind and understands the basic blocks of fiction can easily see that because the way Pok\u00e9mon goes about it is hitting you in the face with it, there&#039;s hardly any subtle approach to it. Even stripping away everything aside from the core concept one can easily see that it&#039;s still true, a trainer owns their Pok\u00e9mon and has agency over it while the Pok\u00e9mon lacks it. Being able to store them in PCs, breeding Pok\u00e9mon in general, and people referring to them as their trainer&#039;s Pok\u00e9mon indicate ownership. A Pok\u00e9mon is subordinate to their trainers and the way the series follows this is by constructing Pok\u00e9mon to mirror cats and dogs in the real world, from the way people treat them in universe to their behaviors in the games like barking and chewing on shoes as an example.<br><br>The fact that they&#039;re still doing that to this gen shows it&#039;s still very much alive.

This is why in the games you play with your Pok\u00e9mon by playing fetch, or taking them to pet contests, or feeding them treats and petting them. Pok\u00e9mon toys even mirror real life pet toys.

The major storylines can be played and replayed at any time, the difficulty of the reoccurring battles is never adjusted, and the last new permanent battle challenge was the Moltres boss fight over a year ago. <a href=\"#p52821235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52821235</a> is right in that so long as you get a couple of the newest power-crept toys you&#039;ll quickly have a huge leg up in winning the battles, then that much more once you get a couple more, and so on. BUT since the most important game modes are almost never updated you can spin for who you want and make the reoccurring challenges as easy or difficult as you want (more restrictions to the Elite 4 fights, how many rounds you want to squeeze out of the legendary gauntlet, etc.)<br><br>For getting the characters you want, you need to throw 36,600 free gems into a banner to get an extra free pick from that banner (at which point you pick the rare character). You get nearly that much the first time you clear the Champion Stadium tutorial, and subsequently get about 30~32,000 a month if you do every little thing. So in practice you skip every 3 or so characters until you have the gems to assure 1, so spin for who you really want and you&#039;ll have no problem getting them.<br><br><a href=\"#p52826603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52826603</a><br>Or this.

It just REALLY REALLY hard, and exhausting. We don&#039;t know exactly how long it took Meowth to learn how to do it (It could have been a whole year or a few months), we do know however he wasn&#039;t born with that, nor was he born with a special or heightened aptitude for it, he was born completely typical for a Meowth/a Pokemon. So I would say its totally doable for nearly any mon to learn this skill the same way he did - the big part about this isn&#039;t if they could learn it, its why should they?<br>Meowth established that it took not only a crazy amount of effort (and most importantly a honestly desire and drive) to learn how to speak, but it also cost him pretty much all of his move slots which makes this really costly for some pokemon who may want them for battling or support or even just living their day to day lives. Anime Pokemon already seem to understand humans (though this is very inconsistent within the anime itself) and Humans seem to just understand Pokemon at least through miming so it might not be necessary for many of them to go through the effort to get a skill that doesn&#039;t help them but hurts them, also Rotom Pokedex/Phones exist and they should be able to translate. NOW I do think its unlikely that this applies to every single Pokemon within a human community or settlement, there will be Pokemon who have jobs that involve interacting with humans or desire jobs that involve interacting with humans or have goals that are very human orientated, and for those Pokemon...yeah they should probably learn how to speak human (or for those pokemon with it Telepathy). Its likely well worth the move slot(s) (Or literally nothing if Telepathic) to be able to actively complexly communicate with those you are working with or those who can help you reach your goal.", "filename": "EZaMU5tU8AA5iEW", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 730, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672447628931732, "time": 1672447628, "md5": "pc7BMAno4z8Il6pHz5z2uw==", "fsize": 96689, "resto": 52835341}, {"no": 52845213, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)20:00:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52841709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52841709</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;give it 44 Rare Candies</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;personally re-enact the xxzero&#039;s Lana\u00d7Walrein doujin but with my bussy and without Poplio getting NOM&#039;d</span><br>The hell is wrong with your brain, freak.", "filename": "1672448294109", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 628, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1672448420022560, "time": 1672448420, "md5": "Dteu6gJBpWUJs5Vavd4oFA==", "fsize": 40591, "resto": 52835341}, {"no": 52845294, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)20:08:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52835586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52835586</a><br>Team Rocket&#039;s Meowth has appeared in Yellow and LGPE at least, and never spoke a word, making basic Pokemon noises instead.

further</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The gack-y feeling of sluggish, sticky lips touching her own by itself is enough to make her gag</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dawn&#039;s mind drifts away in some vain attempt to dissociate from the horrible, sloppy make-out</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But each time she almost numbs herself to it, she&#039;s pulled back into the sensation full force by another mouthful of warm, gooey spit that she has to gulp down into to keep conscious</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She can feel the heat of it slowly, reluctantly slide down her throat with each unwilling gulp</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s just one more inch on the mental scars she&#039;ll have from this unending nightmare of sluggy makeouts</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But eventually, the second, much sloppier smooch comes to an end, and she can&#039;t help but gasp in all the air she wasn&#039;t quite getting because of the sheer weight of the slug on top of her crushing her lungs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She pants, tears beading at the corners of her eyes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Gastrodon looks down at her with its simple, friendly smile</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There&#039;s a few more strands of spit linking their mouths this time</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Merely thinking about the implications, the reality that&#039;s yet to fully set in, makes her gag some more</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then, despite the desperate flailing of her head, and her lips closing tight as humanly possible to make sure she wouldn&#039;t get another heaping helping or twelve of slug sputum, her assaulter&#039;s little nubby arms (which would be cute in any other circumstance) grab her cheeks with surprising power and dexterity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They press her lips open in a pucker</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She screams internally as the inevitable approach of the slug&#039;s soft, plush lips begins again</span>", "filename": "dawn gastrodon todamoto 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 550, "h": 542, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1672405613765498,

Sounds kinda dumb from the perspective of today, but when you&#039;re a kid in the &#039;90s or so in a country where anime isn&#039;t really mainstream yet, that kind of thing really helped make Pokemon stand out from other stuff on TV. I think eventually some of that kind of thing got toned down as the Pokemon universe became more of a generic fantasy world, and also as the crew became more concerned with how the show would be viewed internationally.<br><br>Like after a certain point early on they literally stopped showing Japanese text in the show, like even in Japan, for ease of translating/dubbing in other countries, or how they were concerned Brock would be viewed as a racist Asian stereotype somehow and considered taking him out of the show permanently, etc. Like once it started getting dubbed worldwide, it&#039;s like even in Japan they began trying to make it more generic/homogenized and it lost a lot of the original identity the Kanto episodes had.<br><br>Hope this doesn&#039;t sound like complete bullshit.

He never had help from anyone ever since he was a small child because his parent neglected him so much. Then he had to face a problem he couldn&#039;t take care of alone so he had to ask someone else - something he probably never did before. So yeah he comes over as a little bit pushy, but I think that&#039;s what makes it interesting. Dunno about you, but I didn&#039;t trust him at first at all exactly because he was so mean and pushy at the start. If he was just generic friendly like most characters in Pokemon have been I wouldn&#039;t have cared at all, though. But I was intrigued about why he wants my help so bad, there was clearly something he was hiding. Then he warms up to you really quickly, and my distrust vanished quickly. It&#039;s obviously pivotal to his character development because that&#039;s when he shows us his soft spot after being so abrasive. It&#039;s pretty clear that it&#039;s a defensive mechanism trying to hide his own vulnerability.<br><br>Him being so awful to Raidon also makes sense when you consider their history. First of all, the prof forced Arven to take care of Raidon when he was still a kid. His parent, who didn&#039;t even take care of their own flesh and blood, made him take care of something the professor brought home as part of their work. I&#039;d be fucking pissed as well. And then the Raidon attacked a local Pokemon, which made the professor retreat back to Area Zero - NEVER to be seen ever again by their own son. And this was BEFORE he found out that ultimately, his parent died because they loved Raidon so much that they gave their own live to protect it. So yeah, he has good reasons so hate Raidon, but even then he admits that seeing it all scared and traumatised doesn&#039;t do him any good either. So he admits both that his hatred was misplaced and that he still feels empathetic towards it despite of what happened.<br><br>Cont", "filename": "89ea6f791bb8a77c69b763805551ec8c", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2359, "h": 3161, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672411473695295, "time": 1672411473, "md5": "F6zl5ilzNYwjPT10644GWg==", "fsize": 609959, "resto": 52822349}, {"no": 52839087, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)09:48:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52838737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52838737</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(You) is peak)</span><br>Oh!

Considering how different their parental backgrounds are, I think it&#039;s just not easy for them to relate to each other, so it&#039;s only natural that they clash in that aspect.

Area Zero is also covered in crystal, which would make sense for an impact spot. Geeta became trapped in Area Zero after the weapon impacted, slowly being warped and mutated by the disc mon, giving her an unusual appearance. AZ received a similar effect after firing the weapon, becoming immortal and gaining abnormal height. Geeta and AZ, both affected by the great weapon in some direct capacity. With Geeta trapped in Area Zero, she made contact with the disc and eventually escaping, was groomed into working to achieve the discs desires, taking over the region and establishing the Pok\u00e9mon league. <br><br>Cmon, tell me what ya think.

The fact that the game goes out of its way to say that her ace looks like it comes from the crater is super sus.<br><br>We know that Nemona&#039;s parents are in the game data without any text addressing them yet, and my crackpot theory without evidence is that they wished for wealth in the crater and helped bankroll the professor.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Glaceon is 2 feet and 7 inches tall in height, giving it the perfect composure to fuck. It weighs approximately 57.1 pounds, giving it a small enough weight to move around during fucking, but also enough to not feel too light or too heavy when you&#039;re using your dick on it. Glaceon&#039;s stat spread is also incredibly versatile for sex, with incredible Defense and Special Defense. It has lackluster Attack, but the best part is its Special Attack. You&#039;ll see why later. As an ice type, having such good defenses is incredibly rare. You also might be thinking, &quot;but Ophelia! Your dick would freeze inside of its puss-puss!&quot; This is not true! Here is its Pok\u00e9dex entry from Pok\u00e9mon Sun, circa 2016. *&quot;It can control its body temperature at will. This enables it to freeze the moisture in the atmosphere, creating flurries of diamond dust.&quot;* Glaceon can control its body temp at will, so if you don&#039;t want your dick to be frozen, you can create the perfect environment for dicking it down by telling it to change its temperature! This way, you can fuck it in so many different ways, temperatures, and more! Now onto its moves, which are also incredibly useful for sex. By level up, it learns Helping Hand. This allows it to increase your fucking power by double, increasing your pleasure times two! It also learns Bite, meaning it can get freaky and tune to whatever shit you like in the bed. Best of all, it can use MIRROR COAT. This means whenever you cum, it can double back the pleasure like a special attack, meaning you&#039;ll feel all the pleasure IT had during sex times TWO!

It can also use Hail. Now, if you use it outside, it will Hail outside. Go back inside and the Hail won&#039;t affect you! Best of all, combine the Hail with Glaceon&#039;s ability Ice Body, and it will gradually replenish it&#039;s Health Points during a hailstorm! This means it will NEVER fucking stop enduring all your &quot;hits,&quot; so you can fuck it over and over and over, combining this with Barrier, and you could probably fuck it for 24 hours straight, if not more! It also learns Baby Doll Eyes, Charm, Captivate, and Yawn, allowing it to get itself right in the mood, along with you too! It even learns Fake Tears, Covet, and Tickle, allowing you to roleplay with it if you&#039;re in the mood. It even learns Stored Power, meaning if it uses enough Barriers, it can release all of the Defensive energy it has into, you guessed it, fucking SPECIAL ATTACK!!! And with its absolutely GODLY special attack stat, you&#039;ll be drowning in waves of pleasure due to this attack! And it doesn&#039;t get rid of the Barrier boosts, so as long as you have enough ethers, it can do this over and over WHILE you&#039;re fucking it! Hell, it even learns attract, which makes you fall so deeply in love with it that you&#039;ll be in a trance of fucking! It can take charge with that as well and use your love to make it fuck it how IT wants! Which means it&#039;s not just pleasurable for you, it&#039;s also pleasurable for your Glaceon! It even learns Aurora Veil, which in the Hail, protects it even fucking MORE from taking too much damage!

Given the fact that she spent the entire series not giving a shit about Ash, coupled with her appearing bored during the Leon battle whereas Dawn was hyped to the moon, led to memes that she suddenly wanted Ash for herself since he was now famous and probably rich. These memes stated that Dawn had unintentionally cucked herself by making Chloe interested in Ash, and how Chloe&#039;s education made her more able to manipulate the situation to her benefit, and how she would &quot;protect&quot; Ash from being preyed upon by girls from his past, all while proceeding to milk him for all he was worth as a 100% gold digger. After a while, this was expanded upon by people who suddenly found bloomboltshipping unironically cute, largely due to Ash and Chloe&#039;s contrasting personalities (and the apparent &quot;realistic&quot; nature of the gold digger swooping in with minimal effort and stealing the nice guy that other girls had spent time trying to court), by having Chloe, in the midst of her gold-digging, slowly develop genuine feelings and then finally fall head over heels for Ash.

They grow up so fast, just like they say. Her sunny smile and cherry hair are just so fair, her mother&#039;s eyes ever present in a loving stare. She&#039;s the spitting image of the one who broke my heart, the girl I never should have forced to take part. The stadium was loud and I had felt so proud, but a disinterested expression is all her face allowed. Their unexpected love burns us all, but not in the same way, not at all. Him with passion, her with desire and I with a need so dire. The baby cries and I remember that time flies. She fell for the first time, her first steps were to her a treacherous climb.

I don&#039;t mean muh watercolors here it&#039;s just gen 3 is the gen where 90% of the Pokemon were just static shots. Each gen it got worse and worse.

I don&#039;t like doing remote raids with people outside Discord, and I certainly don&#039;t like all the hassle of hosting a remote raid party. Being able to solo mega Pok\u00e9mon, and maybe even tier 5 Pok\u00e9mon every once in a while, is genuinely more exciting than anything other games I could be playing.

It was about the anime, the movies, the clothing, the stickers, the merchandise. The Pokemon company has never made most of its money through the games. When pokemania first hit, arguably with the first episodes of the anime, the amount of merchandising you could see absolutely everywhere was absurd. Everything looked like a Pokemon giftshop from Japan, it was in pencils, pens, backpacks, socks, stickers, notebooks. People had plushies, toys, pogs, went to the movies, and religiously followed the anime. Most people did not, however, play the games. In fact, a great portion of the kids were unaware that the games in fact came first and were the core of the franchise. But it all revolved around Kanto Pokemon. Always. By the time Johto pokemon started to roll out, the fad was already on its last legs. The novelty was lost and the kids who grew up with the original series were now edgy teens desperately trying to move away from all the &quot;baby&quot; shit. The only two Johto pokemon that had any semblance of impact outside of its games were Ho-Oh, because it showcased in the first episode of the anime, and Lugia, because it had its own movie in Pokemon 2000 (that in hindsight is far less remembered than the Mewtwo movie, and it heavily featured the Kanto legendary birds). When pokemania first started you could see even shitmons like Odish and Jynx fucking everywhere. When it was ending, even some of the most beloved Johto pokemon were ignored, only riding in the coattails of Gen 1 like an unmemorable parasitic tumor.<br><br>People didn&#039;t suddenly wake up and decided they didn&#039;t like Hoenn. It wasn&#039;t a one day-night shift. It was a process and it involved the absolutely bland as fuck Johto dex that has always lived in the shadows of Kanto.

We can talk early meta if you&#039;d like, even though my whole point is I don&#039;t like what dmax&#039;s metas across the seasons had to offer over tera. I can tell you how annoying serene grace flinchkiss was and then how annoying that critkiss stemming from it was too. You did NOT see Coal/Pult really until after Ciderance and Rilla got HAs, Players Cup eras were the peak of its popularity, which ironically PC 1 is where the Cinderace meta I mentioned was, remember when everyone ran a Livero Cinderace?<br>One thing I do miss is that early Grimmsnarl werent just Prankster supporters, they actually were built to try and attack and do damage. The idea of yawning either one of the enemy with a big hit like Gmax Snooze was very threatening for a time. And fair, you did see Justibeats, although you really didn&#039;t see it regularly before the DLC gave us Terrakion and Coballion. <br>But if we really want to get into early meta speculation, I find this format way less rigid. People are learning different ways to deal with Krow leads, sure dedicating Gholdengo and Dozo counters are a must but in the same vein preparing for Hatterene TR was; once you let that Snorlax get a Belly Drum off and gmax it was over. I can at least send a Rotom to eat Make it Rains or Fake Out the krow from getting Tailwind up. You may not think much of my defensive tera choices but something cool I have noticed is there will often be times in matches where I win without even having used a terastilize at all. Maybe I didn&#039;t need the damage or type conversion so I didnt pop, maybe I was saving it, but the fact that it&#039;s not so centralizing that I need to use it or die shows how much of a supplimentary tool it is as opposed to an overbearing centralizing mechanic that completley shapes the meta. At this time terastilizing doesnt seem to change the way I play Pokemon too much in comparison.", "time": 1672428696, "resto": 52815428}, {"no": 52841986, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)14:34:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52841960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52841960</a><br>That&#039;s not great, but it&#039;s not unwinnable.
