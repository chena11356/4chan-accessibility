Given that the series constructs domesticated Pok\u00e9mon to be like dogs and cats, both in the way they&#039;re treated and how the act, and given that they also want people to view Pok\u00e9mon as cute little critters and not monsters no one should act shocked when there&#039;s a push back against sexualization of what are essentially innocent creatures that occupy the sphere of being a pet and also being natural creatures. That perception lies in the way the series has chosen to construct Pok\u00e9mon.", "filename": "imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-Rd9StMb4H1hnPd6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 4544, "tn_w": 52, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674640186015255, "time": 1674640186, "md5": "/pd7vz4QzXi7BxOd9I7txg==", "fsize": 1839401, "resto": 53066430}, {"no": 53082419, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)05:22:51", "name": "Lycanroc", "com": "<a href=\"#p53082276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53082276</a><br> Some clearly hasn&#039;t been paying attention these days<br> You know there is more than 1 lycanroc, right?", "time": 1674642171, "resto": 53066430}, {"no": 53082469, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)05:38:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53075362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53075362</a><br>MaCHAD strikes again", "time": 1674643108, "resto": 53066430}, {"no": 53082484, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)05:45:15", "name": "Ivyposter", "com": "<a href=\"#p53080332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53080332</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I provided genwun sauce</span><br>Tajiri stopped giving a fuck about Pokemon after Gen2 and you posted a pic from few years ago, dumbass.<br><br>Pokemon was never about coomer shit until Gardevoir and Lugayrio became a thing.", "time": 1674643515, "resto": 53066430, "trip": "!aq2fyDPJW."}, {"no": 53082513, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)05:57:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53080332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53080332</a><br>Based", "filename": "1637548499722", "ext": ".png", "w": 680, "h": 718, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674644230557571, "time": 1674644230, "md5": "WbAaJNCnBXzF0x+otz+VgQ==", "fsize": 625169, "resto": 53066430}, {"no": 53082541, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)06:04:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53082513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53082513</a><br>One day we will get our Pokemon dating sim.<br><s>Officially or unofficially</s>", "filename": "Lu VN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 557, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1674644669908088, "time": 1674644669, "md5": "SGWVdzE7YluhbyFpMUvbZg==", "fsize": 47900, "resto": 53066430}, {"no": 53082578, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)06:15:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53081315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53081315</a><br>Furry = zoophile<br>since normalfags accepted fucking and identifying as animals as normal now.<br>thanks to LGBTPedos validating every mental illness out there", "time": 1674645302, "resto": 53066430}, {"no": 53082597, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)06:20:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53082308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53082308</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N-None of t-that implies anything.

Gengar for example isn&#039;t depicted as a lonely entity that&#039;s going to harms you or kill you as the pokedex implies.

It&#039;s not like in Digimon where that sort of thing is pretty open, both in context and design, which Pok\u00e9mon doesn&#039;t do either. You&#039;re trying to paint Tajiri as a deviant when evidence suggests that you&#039;re wrong on all counts. First because his biography is pretty open of how he thinks of Pok\u00e9mon. This panel here shows that he thinks of them as being like cats and dogs which is a viewpoint that is reinforced in the following panels as he imagines Pok\u00e9mon battles as two dog owners in the real world allowing their dogs to fight, according to him the angles Pok\u00e9mon fights are drawn in are inspired by this. In short it clearly cements his statement. And this isn&#039;t something that materialized out of the blue, the 1996 Pokedex guide written by GameFreak has this in one of their sections:<br><br>More fearsome than a cat, more kind than kaiju, those are pokemon<br>People quickly think of Pokemon to be like Kaiju. There&#039;s a strong image of Kaiju being evil, but in this world there isn&#039;t such a thing. They&#039;re friends to humans like dogs and cats.<br><br>Tajiri even wrote something similar in 1995 in a book recovered by Dr. Lava. Takeshi Shudo talks about some of these things in his blog as well, for example how they decided Pok\u00e9mon would eat berries and Pok\u00e9mon food, basically what visually looks exactly like dry dog food, among other things during the planning stages of the anime.", "filename": "TajiriPets", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 6040, "h": 1760, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 36, "tim": 1674725995919485, "time": 1674725995, "md5": "kVLEJVrppeaxv/LnTiethA==", "fsize": 3170298, "resto": 53066430}, {"no": 53090641, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53090632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53090632</a><br>I also don&#039;t need to remind people that HGSS, and I think BDSP, has all Pok\u00e9mon barking and even chewing on grass and shoes which is an activity real dogs perform in the real world, on top of all the real pet activities the player does with their Pok\u00e9mon, and in this gen they even gave Pok\u00e9mon zoomies which is a familiar action dog owners are familiar with.

Doing all this would make simply spamming offensive moves less OP as a lot of 1hkos become 2hkos and a lot of 2hkos become 3hkos.

Donphan is really good; it crushes the game with a moveset you can have locked in by Goldenrod (with only one STAB move). It\u2019s essentially a weaker Geodude line, but seeing how they\u2019re top tier, that\u2019s not really bad. Stop obsessing over STAB because it\u2019s often bad in GSC due to Game Freak\u2019s retardation (see: Sneasel kek). Physical attackers are good because normal attacks are good (TM Headbutt, TM Return). Special attackers are a little harder to work with unless they are water type and/or have fists (for elemental punch TMs). Status moves are really good in GSC. The game loves to give you moves like Sand Attack and even the first gym TM is Mud Slap. Why not use them? Off the top of my head, it\u2019s an easy way to stop a Scyther sweep in the second gym.<br><br><a href=\"#p53089128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53089128</a><br>You\u2019re not wrong, but you\u2019re taking a bad approach to playing GSC.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1-4 strong mon </span><br>This is effectively \u201ceasy mode\u201d.

A lot of examples for Ash happen during his battles, like his Rock Tomb climb against Grant, Pikachu using a wood chip against Sawyer&#039;s Aegislash, and using Greninja&#039;s knives as ice skates against Wulfric. Outside of battles, there&#039;s also examples like Serena telling Ash that his Pok\u00e9mon think just like he does in XY059, which leads to him thinking about his love for food, and he gathers berries as a result. There&#039;s also Ash using his bond phenomenon with Greninja in XY139 to sense its location. There&#039;s some examples for Serena as well. When Clemont tries to figure out where his Shinx is in XY048, Serena suggests that it could have evolved into Luxio, which Clemont says that Serena may have a point. Sere also improvises and fixes her skirt in XY060, showing that she has quick thinking under pressure and enough talent to fix her problem efficiently. In XY083, Serena makes a connection between the Mamoswine Ash is riding and her Rhyhorn Racing experience, and offers to take over on piloting the Mamoswine, to great success. Serena also crafted an extra space in Bonnie&#039;s bag just for Squishy in XY094.

Ash then teaches Serena how to fish. Another example is in XY090, when Serena looks down and clenches her fist during the tag battle, which Ash notices and says Serena&#039;s name in worry. In XY103, Serena tucks Bonnie to bed after Bonnie got worried about losing Squishy. This leads to Serena understanding why Bonnie got upset, and showing empathy towards Bonnie&#039;s fears of losing Squishy. In XY109, Serena notices that her Sylveon is upset, understanding it&#039;s frustration due to Serena&#039;s previous mistakes in her performances, and comforts it by saying to enjoy its dance and have fun on stage. In XY118, Serena gives Ash a water bottle after Ash trained with his Greninja, with Serena being considerate of how exhausted Ash got from the training. There&#039;s also XY138, where Ash can sense Serena&#039;s uneasiness, and offers to battle her to help clear her head, then gives her advice to cheer her up.

Both Ash and Serena want to keep improving themselves to make their world a better place, and one way of going about that is impacting the people in their lives. For Ash, one of the first people that really looked up to him was Ritchie. Despite Ritchie defeating Ash in the Indigo League, Ritchie really came to respect Ash as a person, and they both shared their dreams of becoming Pok\u00e9mon Masters. As Ash becomes more successful over time, we see that he inspires more and more people. Paul, Trip, Sawyer, Alain, Gladion, Kiawe, and even trainers like Cynthia and Leon all eventually gain respect for him, and become inspired by him to do better themselves. At the same time, while Ash bragged about his Kanto badges early into his journey, he became very humble over time, never bragging about his accomplishments too much. He didn&#039;t even tell Goh immediately that he defeated Leon when Goh called him the next morning. As for Serena, we see that as she learns what it takes to become Kalos Queen, she starts to have an impact on the people around her. She cheers up Lumiose City from the aftermath of the Team Flare arc, she gains respect from characters like Palermo and Aria, and she inspires others like Mairin and Chloe. While Serena would eventually become successful by JN105, it&#039;s clear that she doesn&#039;t lose sight of who she is, and also doesn&#039;t brag about her accomplishments.

Ash and Serena have different ways of expressing themselves and climbing to the top, but their motivations for doing what they do are not so dissimilar after all. Amourshipping teaches us that it&#039;s okay if a couple has different hobbies and interests, because Ash and Serena can still get along just fine if they are happy to share their interests and goals with each other. In fact, it may even be better if their hobbies aren&#039;t exactly the same, as it would let Ash and Serena appreciate things that they may have not given much attention to otherwise, expanding both of their world views in the process. Overall, despite Serena not primarily being a battler, and Ash only doing a handful of contests himself, they can still enjoy each other&#039;s company and be happy with participating in each other&#039;s hobbies. Because, at the end of the day, Ash and Serena have a very similar outlook on life. They are both positive people with high energy, and have a lot to offer to the people around them.

Meanwhile outside of Shadow Ball (which is but it doesn&#039;t really help cover Typhlosion&#039;s Weakness) it just got physical moves it can&#039;t properly use because game freak can&#039;t be bothered to give it boosting moves to go along with them.", "filename": "fed2323381222dcff247a931cd484819[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 675, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1674629534218646, "time": 1674629534, "md5": "UOBPM9pH0UPc1icKT68mvw==", "fsize": 78860, "resto": 53079202}, {"no": 53081636, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)01:52:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I love typhlosion but you&#039;ll catch me dead before I use one in a 3d game", "time": 1674629571, "resto": 53079202}, {"no": 53081675, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)02:02:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53081636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53081636</a><br>it looks great in sv though", "time": 1674630145, "resto": 53079202}, {"no": 53081763, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)02:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53081675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53081675</a><br>HOW THE FUCK DO I GET CYNDAQUIL IN SV????", "filename": "sample_1e5c8c6b7f25c55fa7b7f6c088046d51", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 850, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674631323294819, "time": 1674631323, "md5": "DANnm92bALZGqsA/geQBMg==", "fsize": 37478, "resto": 53079202}, {"no": 53081806, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)02:30:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53081763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53081763</a> #<br>NTA, but I don\u2019t think you can without hacking since it\u2019s only supposed to be available via home transfer. <br>Though I guess if they do a Typhlosion raid you could get it that way, but I doubt they would do one since they\u2019ve only done raids for Shillmon Starters.

Some of that stuff is in this game, but it&#039;s so half-assed it doesn&#039;t feel as rewarding. HGSS and Generation 5 really were the peak of the series, and I know I&#039;ll get hate for saying that but they were. Generation 6 was the last time they even bothered to implement a lot of stuff. I think once generation 7 came around, they realized that they could just focus on the main campaign and that&#039;s all they had to worry about. There wasn&#039;t anything left to entice you to keep playing beyond like a post game story. It sucks. That whole sense of wonder is really missing from these games now.", "time": 1674694259, "resto": 53086829}, {"no": 53087728, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:04:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53087649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53087649</a><br>No one cares Kalosperm, don&#039;t you have better things to do than shit on Unova and Alola?

They&#039;re not referring to whether or not Pok\u00e9mon are present on the overworld. They&#039;re talking about the fact that on any given route in the 2D games, especially of the DS era, there was that hard to define SOUL present. When you entered a forest, there were branching paths and you couldn&#039;t see everything at once so it really felt like a mystery. You didn&#039;t know what was going to jump out at you from the tall grass or whether a trainer would spot you. You also had to wonder where the hidden pokeballs were and if there was a legendary tucked away that you couldn&#039;t quite get to yet because you didn&#039;t have the correct HM or missed a certain path. In SV, especially this game, but also other 3D games, you can kind of go anywhere and you can kind of see anything so there&#039;s no real mystery. Yes you can still explore, but there&#039;s no real detail in the environments And because it&#039;s a 3D game it&#039;s pretty easy to tell where the hidden caves are or what&#039;s important to come back to.
