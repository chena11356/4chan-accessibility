I think that, in my ideal world, it would have still been the GSC that we got but there would have been some modern style integration of the betamons back into the fold either in Crystal or something like Stadium 2. Not all of them, but the more interesting ones. I would have loved to see whatever that original canine legendary was as well as the tigers, wolfman and a few others. Some of those designs are actually really cool and I think they would have completely changed the trajectory of the franchise. Maybe I&#039;ll get some disagreement and even hate for saying this, but I remember when RS came out and the dex was leaking because I&#039;m that fucking old. A lot of those Pok\u00e9mon did not look like Pok\u00e9mon and I remember at the time the internet community was sort of divided on whether they were really cool or the series had jumped the shark. And I wonder if they stuck to their guns with the beta Pok\u00e9mon from GSC if that would not have happened. A lot of those designs definitely had more of a goofy, generic RPG monster and sort of fun feel to them.

Then you get random tough looking monsters like the scorpion or Viking boat, which seem honestly out of place next to everything else. And we also have what appears to be a line with four stages with that dryad looking Pokemon. Ultimately I&#039;m ok with what we really got bc it had a more healthy mix that leaned into having monsters that looked more tough and I think it helped develop more of that essence that modern Pok\u00e9mon have, which sets them apart from the other &#039;90s JRPGs.

Even better if Machop is holding Power Band. Do NOT forget Low Kick. It is especially useful against bosses.<br>4. Smokescreen in the PMD will give the opponent whiffer status so they will miss every move for a certain amount of turns. So you have no fear of getting hit by a flying type move.<br>5. You will have defeated the boss in 5-6 turns after a barrage of linked moves.<br>6. Carry 2-3 revival seeds in case you get unlucky, but you probably won&#039;t.

On one hand, grading can increase the perceived value of a card, making it more appealing to buyers and collectors. On the other hand, grading can be expensive, time-consuming, and does not guarantee a higher value for the card. Additionally, the grading process can lead to damage or alteration of the card, which can decrease its value. Grading companies have been criticized for inconsistencies in grading standards and for conflicts of interest. Ultimately, whether or not to get a trading card graded is a personal decision that should be based on a thorough understanding of the potential risks and rewards.", "filename": "Untitled", "ext": ".png", "w": 481, "h": 283, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 73, "tim": 1676320809646699, "time": 1676320809, "md5": "hXT7wq3L+B7VFyDaa6ubBA==", "fsize": 13871, "resto": 53221597}, {"no": 53222522, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hey guys what&#039;s going on in this thr-</span><br>Welp.

One could argue that Cyrus is also chasing after a certain aesthetic, sure, fine, whatever, but the poise with which he presents his true aspirations makes him seem more level-headed and less like a raving lunatic. Like this is something he actually thought through, whereas with Lysandre it\u2019s just, for lack of a better term, melodramatic schizobabble capsizing into a pity party.

I would say to work in the library field you have to love reading and knowledge in general. It really depends on the library you work in. Special libraries and academic libraries are more research focused and public libraries are more focused on programs (arts &amp; crafts, author talks, computer classes etc). Some of my coworkers get burnt out from reading because they have to read a whole bunch of kids books all the time for kids programs. I&#039;m an assistant currently, so my work is more focused on shelving, finding books and organizing the library. I went to school to be a library technician which is more similar to a librarian in most cases.

As for power differences, some regions are definitely stronger than others depending on how much money the region has and how popular battling is in said region, just like sports teams irl.

After Gen 2 Pok\u00e9mania was officially dead and Gamefreak had to work especially hard to supplement the backbone provided from the first 2 gens which for their time were very soulful. This lead to polished and flourishing games that aimed to copy that soul hallmark of the first 2 gens while also trying to best them. The games weren&#039;t overwhelmingly catering to normies at this time either in a last ditch effort to stay relevant (see X/Y). They had enough momentum from previous success to base their games off of small Japanese regions. It wasn&#039;t until BW that Pokemon began to globalize, and during X/Y is when shit really hit the fan with simultaneous international releases and normie catering. Of course you also had the fact these newer games were competing with smart phones at the time, which also killed the soul.<br><br>I think Pokemon soul has returned somewhat as seen in S/V and other titles.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3&quot;03&#039; tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they&#039;re large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there&#039;s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it&#039;d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick.

DVs are generated for Attack, Defense, Special, and Speed (this is the order by the way), and the HP DV is the first bit of each.

If he&#039;s emulating, there are layers to how willing people are to altering their games. Like for me playing Red in Japanese about 6 years ago, I was perfectly fine with using super speed for grinding. In fact, I grinded every Pok\u00e9mon line I had up to whatever the next highest level benchmark was, culminating in having Beedrill, Buttefree, Chansey, etc. at level 70 in the post-game with Mewtwo, no glitches for Rare Candies. For obtaining specific Pok\u00e9mon like the other starter lines, I just changed a single byte in the ROM to replace the level 5 Pikachu in Viridian Forest with the species of the Pok\u00e9mon, caught it, and then changed the encounter byte back. If I ever wanted to grind stat experience, I would just do that thing with Pidgey and Rattata and change them back once I was done. It almost feels easier to learn how to do RNG manipulation to handle stuff like breeding and shiny hunting.

This started in Gen II, and it extends to practically every character in the game in Japanese, rarely is a name just a name. From characters like Schoolboy Manabu (\u5b66\u3076 is the verb to learn) and Bird Keeper Tsubasa (\u7ffc means wing) to Pok\u00e9 Fan Megumi named after Megumi Hayashibara and practically every staff member on the credits being referenced as a character somewhere in the game. There are even some really obscure ones, like Atsuko (after Atsuko Nishida) only appearing as a wrong name when you get misdialed by Picnicker Liz, same with Tsunekazu (Tsunekazu Ishihara) with someone from the lighthouse. It&#039;s impossible to tell practically any of references outside of the Japanese games. But what&#039;s even crazier is that 4Kids actually used Nintendo&#039;s localized English names if the corresponding Japanese name appeared in the Johto anime. In The Legend of Thunder, there&#039;s Jimmy (Kenta) and Vincent (Jun&#039;ichi), whose names 4Kids decided on because of the NPCs Youngster Kenta (Jimmy) and Guitarist Jun&#039;ichi (Vincent), who also happened to be Gen II&#039;s Masuda reference (Guitarist Masuda in Crystal&#039;s Battle Tower isn&#039;t in the Japanese game because of how the Battle Tower was altered).

But not our Tinkaton! Couldn&#039;t be precious Tinkaton! Killing them blind! And she gets to be popular!? What a sick joke! I should&#039;ve stopped her when I had the chance! And you \u2013 you have to stop her!
