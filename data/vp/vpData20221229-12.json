People that license the music for shows earn residuals from when &amp; where they&#039;re played. Thus, rather than allowing the original music licensees to have that, 4Kids (and later TCPi) decided to fill localized episodes with their own music-that way, they could still make money even if Pokemon aired in other parts of the world with different voice actors speaking other languages; their dubbed music still plays, and thus they still make money.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From a business standpoint, I have to admit I don&#039;t see the flaw in their plan. It&#039;s a smart way to make even more money. It also explains why Yu-Gi-Oh (who Stuart also worked on) and Digimon also changed a majority, if not all, of their musical scores too; it&#039;s a practice they kept, I guess.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, you have anime like Bleach, One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, etc. whose music wasn&#039;t changed for the sake of money. I greatly appreciate this as I&#039;ve come to love a lot music from these series. It&#039;s a shame because there&#039;s such amazing music and renditions that dub watchers wouldn&#039;t ordinarily get to hear, due to this practice. This also confirms for me that TCPi is fully capable of keeping every track within an episode; they just choose not to. However, there&#039;s probably an agreement where a percentage of tracks are kept-which is what we sparsely hear.</span><br><br>https://youtu.be/nKL6W8ctQ5w", "time": 1672275042, "resto": 52819149}, {"no": 52821650, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:52:52", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "PSYCHOak2", "ext": ".png", "w": 612, "h": 612, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672275172498315, "time": 1672275172, "md5": "8bm06ry6D7POaHW6bRaS6g==", "fsize": 263247, "resto": 52819149, "spoiler": 1}, {"no": 52821725, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:59:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So did Ash ever get together with Misty or what?", "time": 1672275594, "resto": 52819149}, {"no": 52821737, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:01:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52821573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52821573</a><br>Anon I had thought.

There is a cut mutant lioncat enemy in the code of stalker, and all though it is no longer in the game, a taxidermied one can be found in one or two places in the game, and the sounds of a cat meowing can be heard in the ambience sometimes.", "filename": "joltdoorbell1", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 800, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672299679928431, "time": 1672299679, "md5": "KkzySoiR5kUIGra3uUs0OQ==", "fsize": 584025, "resto": 52823911}, {"no": 52824976, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:42:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52824433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52824433</a><br>t. underage zoomer who thinks early code was done in unity", "time": 1672299766, "resto": 52823911}, {"no": 52825051, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:58:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52824957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52824957</a><br>Like for context here&#039;s just general map stuff for capsule mon era; the closest we have to definite town C stuff.<br>Its obvious that it got split from Celadon(hence the water under beta Celadon) super early but the only concept art maps clearly match them to the same area.", "filename": "Capsule Mon Maps", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1068, "h": 1298, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300732038773, "time": 1672300732, "md5": "Jt2K9qLyw+/h4nRBL1XrhQ==", "fsize": 318583, "resto": 52823911}, {"no": 52825074, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52824976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52824976</a><br>not him, but it would have been fine to remove the tiles in the sense of simply not using them in that area (e.g. cleaning up a half-baked scene), trying to remove them from the game memory entirely could conceivably lead to issues", "time": 1672300895, "resto": 52823911}, {"no": 52825150, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:14:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52823911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52823911</a><br>It&#039;s possible they just threw it in there like &quot;if you can manage to legit get to this area most players will never see during normal gameplay, here&#039;s somehing weird that&#039;s nowhere else in the game.&quot; That&#039;s still not much of a reward and feels like there&#039;s no reason for doing it other than fucking with player&#039;s minds by making them think it&#039;s important, but I guess Game Freak has done similar shit in later games too.", "time": 1672301667, "resto": 52823911}, {"no": 52825549, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:51:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52824139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52824139</a><br>what the hell is this?", "time": 1672307497, "resto": 52823911}, {"no": 52825867, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)06:20:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52825549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52825549</a><br>I think its from what would turn out to be the gigaleak", "time": 1672312851, "resto": 52823911}, {"no": 52825903, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)06:29:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52825867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52825867</a><br>Yeah they&#039;re archive maps that match a pretty old tileset; however RGB had a stupidly long development cycle so its not like its some definitive version of &quot;capsule mon&quot;.<br>Honestly the shit you can spot in random bits of code are kinda more interesting, the map even by this point is pretty there.

There are a bunch of food shops but you don&#039;t actually go inside, it functions more like a fancy vending machine. It makes the world feel less meaningful. I&#039;m enjoying the open world aspect but it feels like they cut some serious corners with interior design. This is the only aspect of the game I&#039;m genuinely disappointed with so far.<br>2. All the gyms I&#039;ve come across so far have the same design. Not a big deal but worth noting. I understand the fights are unique but I&#039;m talking about the building design.<br>3. Is this region supposed to be in Mexico or some other latin country? Are sandwiches really that big of a deal in Mexico? I would have assumed the cooking element would be tacos or something. <br>4. What the fuck is wrong with the NPCs? There is a large influx of the following: obese fucks, gender ambiguous fucks, brown fucks, and just downright weird/ugly looking fucks. It&#039;s like someone in charge got a memo to do some checklist tier diversity but went about it like a Japanese robot.

Nothing suggests it&#039;s a meme, you don&#039;t see &quot;meme&quot; picks scoring high. The mentioned Ninetales placing and those around it indicate a deliberate picking. Verily so given how Vaporeon has entered the public consciousness in the meme sphere in places like reddit and Twitter we shouldn&#039;t act surprise when these results start to show up. As far as I know there&#039;s no mention of people manipulating the poll like the Twitter poll that ran in Japan and indeed the results pretty much reflect what you see in other sources and helps paint a clearer picture here.<br><br>I&#039;ve said it before but results like this reflect the attitudes seen in the series itself. The series itself often makes no distinction between Pok\u00e9mon and their place in the world so should we really act too surprised by these results? Any stigma related to shape is greatly diminished because the series itself doesn&#039;t care about shape, it cares about the construction and perception of Pok\u00e9mon as cute little critters and pets. This, I believe, is what allowed Pok\u00e9mon like Vaporeon to reach great memetic status that no other Pok\u00e9mon has and thi manifests itself in these results, in NSFW material and reception in social media. With this data, while not perfect, is enough where a coherent picture starts to emerge. For example how demographics can hard carry, and hinder, certain Pok\u00e9mon as is the case with Lykanroc and Tsareena. Tsareena, despite scoring high, lacks sexualizition so it never entered the public consciousness unlike other Pok\u00e9mon because in this context perception and sexualizition is key.

Given the fact that she spent the entire series not giving a shit about Ash, coupled with her appearing bored during the Leon battle whereas Dawn was hyped to the moon, led to memes that she suddenly wanted Ash for herself since he was now famous and probably rich. These memes stated that Dawn had unintentionally cucked herself by making Chloe interested in Ash, and how Chloe&#039;s education made her more able to manipulate the situation to her benefit, and how she would &quot;protect&quot; Ash from being preyed upon by girls from his past, all while proceeding to milk him for all he was worth as a 100% gold digger. After a while, this was expanded upon by people who suddenly found bloomboltshipping unironically cute, largely due to Ash and Chloe&#039;s contrasting personalities (and the apparent &quot;realistic&quot; nature of the gold digger swooping in with minimal effort and stealing the nice guy that other girls had spent time trying to court), by having Chloe, in the midst of her gold-digging, slowly develop genuine feelings and then finally fall head over heels for Ash.

They grow up so fast, just like they say. Her sunny smile and cherry hair are just so fair, her mother&#039;s eyes ever present in a loving stare. She&#039;s the spitting image of the one who broke my heart, the girl I never should have forced to take part. The stadium was loud and I had felt so proud, but a disinterested expression is all her face allowed. Their unexpected love burns us all, but not in the same way, not at all. Him with passion, her with desire and I with a need so dire. The baby cries and I remember that time flies. She fell for the first time, her first steps were to her a treacherous climb.

The problem stems here that you can&#039;t separate the subculture out of the label, it&#039;s not like other labels which exist as ideas rather than labels being tied to a specific group of people.", "time": 1672250042, "resto": 52815489}, {"no": 52818073, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:49:42", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "103975438_p1 (1)", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672253382439500, "time": 1672253382, "md5": "gsc1EGWVTtlB6/I5xuZ0RA==", "fsize": 1016438, "resto": 52815489}, {"no": 52818097, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:52:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "They look like they fuck human women", "filename": "FfFvXSBacAEZg_R", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1126, "h": 1087, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1672253532962439, "time": 1672253532, "md5": "McjAZazYQqw838qVOQ/7PQ==", "fsize": 120875, "resto": 52815489}, {"no": 52818171, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:59:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52815879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52815879</a><br>Eeveelutions are made for sex with human males<br>I don&#039;t want to fuck other &quot;dog-shaped&quot; pokemon, it&#039;s just Eeveelutions and it&#039;s for a reason, they are made to receive the cum of human males", "time": 1672253955, "resto": 52815489}, {"no": 52818185, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:00:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52815852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52815852</a><br>Holy based", "filename": "102745661_p0", "ext": ".png", "w": 1364, "h": 2114, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672254056179415, "time": 1672254056, "md5": "Y3bh4ElYL+sdXUSykTqQuQ==", "fsize": 1449509, "resto": 52815489}, {"no": 52818195, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52815668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52815668</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She will go down as pokemon&#039;s Renamon.

As such, players&#039; freedom is quite limited because school uniforms are such an overbearing part of the whole outfit that it&#039;s hard to make anything else pop, especially considering that their colors cannot be changed. However, this is far from the worst issue that character customization entails in Gen 9, as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet completely remove the ability to wear skirts in Paldea.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Often considered a symbol of female empowerment, skirts and dresses have been part of Pokemon games for almost a decade now, as they were introduced with Pokemon X and Y. As such, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet removing both skirts and dresses entirely not only makes no sense, but it breaks a major tradition that had only helped the franchise grow thanks to trainers across the world being able to choose what their in-game avatars looked like.

Allowing players to wear skirts and dresses would have continued a 10-year trend that had no reason to be stopped in its tracks, to begin with. This makes even less sense when one considers how Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl ended up including more clothing customization than Gen 9 does, accessories aside.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still, LGBTQIA+ representation in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is better than it&#039;s ever been. For instance, Rika from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&#039;s Elite Four seems to be introduced as a non-binary character, and allowing all characters to wear skirts would have taken this further. While Gen 9 also features some prominent characters wearing a dress, with them being the sisters Ryme and Tyme, as well as Poppy from the Elite Four, and Tulip from the Alfornada Gym, skirts seem to be completely absent from Paldea.

Since generation 4, the process of transferring pokemon from one game to another have always been reserved for the end of the game. To send pokemon from ruby/sapphire/emerald to diamond/pearl/platinum, you needed to beat the elite 4 in sinnoh and obtain the national pokedex to unlock Pal Park, which made transfer possible. In gen 5, you had to beat the game and obtain the national dex afterwards to unlock poke transfer. And in gen 6 &amp; 7 there was pokemon bank and transporter. While the last was not restricted to endgame, you wouldnt be able to use your old teams in the new games right from the start. It was never about using only old pokemon, but being able to play with them and not losing them to time. You still played the new game with the new pokemon, and when you had your fun with the new guys you&#039;d bring over your old guys too. But now with Dexit, you either transfer up and never play with your older pokemon, or you keep them in the same game until the internal batteries run out or something happens to the original cartridge. It is incredibly disappointing that corners were cut with absolutely nothing to show for it.

I&#039;m not asking for 4k frame perfect nonsense on a pocket sized NVIDA atleast 10 years out of date, but the games demand a kind of timelessness graphics wise. Galar, Hisui, and Paldea are notoriously ugly compared to other titles on the Switch, especially the first&#039;s wild area gimmick. The performance on the latest title is a joke that writes itself and looks even worse when other games have a similar scope (BOTW, Xenoblade Chronicles). The animations have had minimal improvements and are mostly the same as previous titles, or outright worse in the case of certain moves from PLA to SV.
