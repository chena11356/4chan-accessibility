the game. The idea behind this set is that not many Pokemon carry more than one attack powerful enough to break Heatran&#039;s Substitutes. With that in mind, Torment allows Heatran to stay safe by using Protect to prevent its opponent from breaking its Substitute with their STAB or super effective attack. That means that every other turn, Heatran can attack with Lava Plume for free without having to worry about being damaged. This set slowly chips away at Heatran&#039;s opponent while maintaining Heatran&#039;s Substitute at the end of the duel when they faint.<br><br>Lava Plume is the move of choice on this set, due to its high PP and 30% burn rate. Many Heatran switch-ins (such as Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Swampert) do not like getting burned. The chance to burn also helps slowly drain the opponent&#039;s HP, meaning Heatran does not even have to attack. Instead, it can alternate between Substitute and Protect to rack up residual damage. Taunt is an interesting option over Lava Plume for dealing indirect damage. It prevents Pokemon from healing and forces them to attack Heatran&#039;s Substitutes in vain. When combined with Torment, Pokemon such as mono-attacking Blissey and Suicune will struggle every other turn, allowing Heatran to beat certain Pokemon that would otherwise completely counter it; however, Taunt also makes Heatran lose to other Pokemon which Heatran would normally be able to beat. In fact, any Pokemon with more than one attack, or a faster Pokemon with Taunt will be able to beat this set unless they are afflicted with a status condition.", "time": 1676068401, "resto":

There are so many kinds of pokemon that it makes sense that some simply don&#039;t inhabit places or exhibit behaviors that put it in the kinds of places where interesting fiction happens. The other side of this is that when a rarely featured pokemon appears, it needs to hit a home run and demonstrate what it uniquely has to offer a narrative while also showing that we should be happy not to see it too often.

It\u2019s a long story with a big world, so I have a lot in mind to showcase some underloved Pokemon without feeling like they\u2019re being forced into relevance. That\u2019s what I always loved about playing the Mystery Dungeon series and it\u2019s something I\u2019m strongly trying to carry over into my own take on the concept. For example, Diglett or Bidoof or Loudred are not Pokemon I ever would\u2019ve thought could make for entertaining/interesting characters until I saw them in action in Mystery Dungeon.

I agree with your note on specific feedback, but think an equally valid way forward (that you could totally do in conjunction) would be to always keep your stories fresh and diverse in terms of emotion, word choice, structure, plot, character, etc; feeling like I\u2019m reading the same chapter twice in a row is my worst feeling as a reader, so it\u2019s my worst fear as an author, I don\u2019t think you should ever let a story stagnate.

As is the continuation stating that he&#039;s &quot;clearly offended&quot; and &quot;making [Nathan] feel unsafe&quot;. This is simply a weak way to demonstrate something that was already given to the reader if only based on what Zangoose had already said. It&#039;s pretty clear that he&#039;s offended already, and that the Natu is in a precarious position to be pissing people off, but I understand that you wanted to express the change of tone and Nathan&#039;s fear.

As originally written\u2014some sort of dialog tag with present tense narration that&#039;s jumping out of POV (I presume this is narrator-as-protagonist and doing kind of a stream of consciousness thing to justify present tense) awkwardly for the sake of presuming something\u2014it&#039;s closer to a script, which isn&#039;t disallowed, but it&#039;s easy to get into a habit of just writing the spoken lines and tagging, forgetting that when we shift attention we must refresh the portrayal.<br><br>Ex.<br><br>(MC says something stupid.)<br><br>Zangoose&#039;s ears twitched and his eyes narrowed.

My final bit of previous thread context I\u2019ll give is that the Quiz has been very controversial, but it has a plot purpose. Even when writing YA, I don\u2019t write scenes without a larger purpose, even if it doesn\u2019t seem that way in the moment.

The protag interaction with his pokemon would create interesting interaction and dilemma. The protag could treats some with fatherly care while other with a stern commander type attitude while the pokemon in turn could help protag learn to live in the pokemon world. It could also be a good way to show what kind person Protag was during and after the war and how it effect him to this day. Also Protag paranoia and pre isekai life would also impact the story as it push him to teach his pokemon how to fight.

It&#039;s not easy to discern what would be to one&#039;s taste *and* of decent quality. For a medium like fanfiction, there&#039;s no cost in testing the waters of a work and skipping around real quick to discern if it is something worth your time or not. <br><br>With dead paper tree format, digital works only offer so many pages as a demo, often the best sliver of it while leaving out the rest that may as well be dumpster trash. As for going to the actual bookstore, the only indication you have of any interest is the back cover and trying to peruse books real quick one at the time. This wouldn&#039;t be a problem, save for the fact that I don&#039;t go out often these days due to various IRL issues, meaning the opportunity to scan a book&#039;s contents in depth is limited. Even if I were to get the opportunity, it takes time to discern for more traditional fare to be dissected in depth before knowing if it&#039;s worth my time or not. One way I have gotten passed this is by photographing the book&#039;s front cover and checking out a... Find in the great sea as it were, which helps alleviates this somewhat. But it isn&#039;t as convenient as just plucking a hyperlink and perusing at will. <br><br>Still, online platforms where semi traditional prose such as Royal Roads has a nice selection, provided the author doesn&#039;t pull a shit move by skubbing the work and taking it to Amazon only. Calibre/fanficfare has been helpful in this regard in preserving the works when I find them, but it&#039;s annoying when it happens. <br><br>Not to mention, quite of the few writers I have read from often have recommendations to other works that might be of interest to me. Still, there&#039;s such a volume online that it&#039;s hard to know where to start sometimes.", "time": 1675967849, "resto": 53154813}, {"no": 53194651, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:39:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53194635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53194635</a><br><br><a href=\"#p53189253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53189253</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One of my biggest pet peeves is how many writer treat pokemon as nothing more then props instead of their own character. The protag interaction with his pokemon would create interesting interaction and dilemma.</span><br><br>That may be a symptom of one just playing the games only, or perhaps just as how the anime sometimes treat their Pokemon characters. Unlike Digimon, Pokemon are, or at least were as far as my knowledge of the anime up to the Hoenn region is concerned, treated as less of a focused narrative importance. That isn&#039;t to say they don&#039;t always do so, such as with legendaries, Ash&#039;s starter and other mons, and the like, but it probably reflects on how a writer illustrates their own mons going forward. <br><br>Aside from that, there&#039;s also the matter of how a writer interprets their mons based on their own head canon, the anime, games, and so on. Some writers just don&#039;t give a damn, often caring more for the human characters as a focus and the mons being more or less vehicles to get from Point A to Point B. For those that don&#039;t, their mons tend to trend towards a more humanistic interpretation, if not outright humans in fursuits. Not that isn&#039;t a bad thing necessarily, but it&#039;s a fine balance that some just don&#039;t want to tightrope on. <br><br>That, and the more focus you give to the mons as actual characters, the more characters you have to juggle in your head to keep track of. Focusing strictly on the trainer means you have less moving pieces to worry about. Even if you were to stick with just six mons in total, that&#039;s *still* six characters and the dynamics you have between them and the trainer you have to keep track of at all times. It can get messy *real* quick if you don&#039;t keep a careful track of it all and devolve into an incoherent, unholy mess of threads that never get resolved and other stuff.

I know it is bad practice to attempt to correct and repair while in the middle of your first draft, but I am of the belief it would be better to nip such bad habits and errors in the bud early, rather than make more work for myself. come the second and third draft revisions. <br><br>Woith that in mind, what set of practices would be optimal to mitigate any corrections that need to be made come the 2nd and 3rd draft?", "time": 1675968120, "resto": 53154813}, {"no": 53194752, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:53:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53193819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53193819</a><br><br>I gotcha Anon.", "filename": "1506221979420", "ext": ".png", "w": 1376, "h": 1468, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675968821237004, "time": 1675968821, "md5": "O+jwrf8v8ibjrbRmduHOsA==", "fsize": 347118, "resto": 53154813}, {"no": 53194761, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:54:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53194752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53194752</a>", "filename": "1455138662722", "ext": ".png", "w": 2698, "h": 3378, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675968882857905, "time": 1675968882, "md5": "aVS1z15T759Ya8M9UDvS1g==", "fsize": 1683467, "resto": 53154813}, {"no": 53194919, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)14:14:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53194670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53194670</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you visualize and construct a scene? </span><br>I have a director\u2019s brain so I see the whole stage, I start by visualizing the start and end of the scene, then I find the most natural and satisfying way to bridge the two.

Mostly actual first-party music, but anything that paint the picture will do and it doesn&#039;t pay to be picky if it conjures up a scene regardless. Often times this means that the general tone, cadence, and even structure of a scene, chapter, or story may be dictated by the sound design and lyrical gravity of the song I felt would inspired the most. There are songs which provide narrative texture and inform me of directions I would like a story to go, and songs which I take the structure of and translate more or less literally into the choreography of a scene as if it were already scoring it. Many aspects of my stories have been enriched where they wouldn&#039;t have been because of an idea/feeling that a song gave. This also helps in that you can dip back into a certain artist or album whenever you lack drive and want to put yourself back into the headspace of the story.<br><br>The second question is more nebulous. Scenes should start by establishing everything they need to allow the reader to put themselves where they need to be. Though there are many approaches and it&#039;s not necessarily a science for me, I try to establish the narrator&#039;s PoV first (I usually only write in Third Person Limited). If not that, then usually a piece of scenery or imagery that I want to focus on first to set the scene. It&#039;s just a matter of cinematography. Where is the camera pointing first when it all switches over? Are there characters speaking, and is what they&#039;re saying more important than the immediate surroundings? Chapters end when they end, and they begin the next time there is important information for the reader to know.<br><br>Troubleshooting is easier because I have spent years and years comparing my work to my peers, have had them comparing to mine, reading different works and being read by more well-read individuals.

I am exhausted with explaining the same concepts over and over. To any retards who think getting masters or reaching 1600 is difficult you need to understand something. You can climb the ladder in this game with a negative win rate. You can not do that in other games. You can pretty much climb all the way up to maybe 1600, last I checked, with a negative win rate. You win more rating than you lose up to 1600 so you can reach 1600 even if you are losing.<br><br>Same shit with reaching masters due to performance points.

NO, this doesnt mean you&#039;ll be able to win every match. It just means you&#039;ll win more of them more of the time to make climbing somewhat easier.

Lillie &amp; Lunala (it&#039;s not Nebby, she says she received it as a Cosmog from the Gen VII MC), N &amp; Reshiram (he already had Zekrom, and he just vaguely alludes that he met and befriended Reshiram after traveling with Zekrom following the ending of BW), and Steven &amp; Rayquaza. The last one is pure fanservice since Zinnia already pairs up with Rayquaza in the game, but his is shiny and can Mega Evolve (unfortunately it&#039;s pretty shit due to awful stats). They tie it into his fascination with rocks extending to meteors. Then when they did the Hoenn chapter of the Villain arc, they released Sygna Suit Steven &amp; Deoxys which actually flowed really well with what they had already written. They try to redo the Delta Emerald plot of going to stop a meteor that&#039;s going to hit the island and is causing Kyogre and Groudon to go nuts, and only Steven&#039;s Rayquaza can Mega Evolve to do it. However, a meteor piece broke off and Deoxys came from it, and it kept going after them and impeding their progress because Deoxys and Rayquaza are rivals in media. Eventually he manages to subdue and catch it while Zinnia manages to finally get her Rayquaza to Mega Evolve and take out the meteor.<br><br>They&#039;re finally upgrading Leon so his Charizard can Gigantamax, so it&#039;s likely we&#039;ll see similar upgrades for Maxie and Archie in the future. Lusamine has Pheromosa because she resembles it.

The tactic seemed to be working, as the small crowd of mon that&#039;d gathered around the mysterious trio seemed rather loud and excited. <br><br>So excited, in fact, that a Herdier in the crowd quickly took notice of the newcomers I&#039;ve been documenting and rushed to hold up Hannah specifically as an example.", "filename": "8img", "ext": ".png", "w": 1247, "h": 1315, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676076096810069, "time": 1676076096, "md5": "9silvTQ/aXSTf8lu+ydQDQ==", "fsize": 391282, "resto": 53193370}, {"no": 53204769, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)19:51:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53204714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53204714</a><br>&quot;Look, look!&quot; the Herdier exclaimed, holding up a claw to the Bolt badge shining on Hannah&#039;s shoulder. &quot;You&#039;re right, Mr Ghetsis sir!

Eventually, the crowding got so bad that Sylvia attempted to Slash her way through, only to be instantly bombarded by a crowd of already-riled-up attendees. <br>Pillow quickly came to her aid, as did Hannah, though the crowd proved hard to beat back.

I went through all the Trainer names in Japanese GS. People usually know this, but there are Trainers whose names are references to people, like Trainers who are named Ikue from game to game using Pikachu. This started in Gen II, and it extends to practically every character in the game in Japanese, rarely is a name just a name. From characters like Schoolboy Manabu (\u5b66\u3076 is the verb to learn) and Bird Keeper Tsubasa (\u7ffc means wing) to Pok\u00e9 Fan Megumi named after Megumi Hayashibara and practically every staff member on the credits being referenced as a character somewhere in the game. There are even some really obscure ones, like Atsuko (after Atsuko Nishida) only appearing as a wrong name when you get misdialed by Picnicker Liz, same with Tsunekazu (Tsunekazu Ishihara) with someone from the lighthouse. It&#039;s impossible to tell practically any of references outside of the Japanese games. But what&#039;s even crazier is that 4Kids actually used Nintendo&#039;s localized English names if the corresponding Japanese name appeared in the Johto anime. In The Legend of Thunder, there&#039;s Jimmy (Kenta) and Vincent (Jun&#039;ichi), whose names 4Kids decided on because of the NPCs Youngster Kenta (Jimmy) and Guitarist Jun&#039;ichi (Vincent), who also happened to be Gen II&#039;s Masuda reference (Guitarist Masuda in Crystal&#039;s Battle Tower isn&#039;t in the Japanese game because of how the Battle Tower was altered). You can find more examples in random filler episodes of the Johto anime.<br><br>In the Gen III games, even though a number of names were reused, they were given different translated names. And because Gen I NPCs were getting names in FRLG, a lot of those Hoenn names carry over to them. Eventually the localization ended up having to integrate the older Gen II names to maintain consistency.", "time": 1676052464, "resto": 53190076}, {"no": 53204617, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)19:28:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53202368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53202368</a><br>wowzee", "time": 1676075328, "resto": 53190076}, {"no": 53205876, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)22:53:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53192724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53192724</a><br>there are versions of this for some of the other gens, right?
