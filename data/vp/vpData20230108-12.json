I&#039;ve always been wary of introducing moves that can more easily cause status effects early on in the game since statuses can be quite the effective boon, but dividing it into several tiers or stages can help off-set stroke of lucks and make room for strategic play, or moves that inflict tier 2 straight away. If nothing else it&#039;s an area that can make your game different from the mainlines, just gotta be careful not to make it more cancerous.<br><br>And unless I missed it, Confusion status can be less RNG reliant by making all offensive moves deal recoil damage. Unsure how to treat status move side-effects though, maybe just add a 1/16 damage deduction at the end.<br><br><br><a href=\"#p52919338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52919338</a><br>One thing that I can relate to in terms of getting info beforehand is whether or not some items can be &quot;missed&quot; during a run.

Stories are meant to be played once, and trying to make them replayable carries a lot of pressure. What do you think people would want to try multiple times? Do you lock some of your proudest stuff behind one potential path? How do you cultivate an experience that makes people want to play again, or one that can be played again but was satisfying the first time around?<br>Really interesting section of design theory, but it does lead to what you said - if you leave a bunch of neat stuff for people to discover, they&#039;re gonna want to discover it on the FIRST time around. And locking certain things to a specific path means unless you give the opportunity to come back later, you&#039;ve effectively deleted a portion of your game from the player&#039;s save.<br>This is particularly exacerbated in the romhacking scene, where there has really been no online multiplayer, so the story has even MORE weight on it to be engaging and interesting in a series that doesn&#039;t have enough gametime to show off 500+ Pokemon&#039;s unique strengths.<br>I personally am trying my hand at getting as much information rammed into the game as possible - one of these is an Evolutions Guide in the Pokemon Lab.

Most mammals do. Yes it has a pattern of diamond spots COMPLETELY UNLIKE A SNOW LEAOPARD BY THE WAY because it&#039;s a fucking ice type snow themed fucking pokemon. Yes it makes a &quot;cat roar&quot; WHATEVER THAT FUCKING MEANS, because it&#039;s a generic monstery animal noise. Does it have some cat-like elements to it?

Bitch I literally brought up the difference between decimal currency and no decimal currency.<br><br>2. as for yen to dollar ratio i was using the one back from a year ago before the yen crashed, which was basically like 98 yen to the dollar, which i was rounding to an even hundred. It&#039;d been hovering there both in the 90s when pokemon&#039;s prices were first set, and since about 2016 steady until march of this year. Figured that&#039;s more representative yardstick than the current wonky exchange rate.<br>$2.00 for a pokeball.<br>$2.00 for a bottle of mineral water.<br>$3.50-4.00 for a can of spray repellant.<br><br>at the same exchange rate, that means 1,000,000 = $10,000.00. look, see? very easy, same number of zeros. simple math, even for dummies.<br>So to have at least a million PokeYen stolen from the League, we only need to find $10,000 in sudden high-cost purchases.<br>Follow yet?<br><br>3. your objection still doesn&#039;t explain all the high dollar nerd stuff in her room and the piles of online order boxes.

If it helps, I use Elvive shampoo and conditioner, though sometimes (like twice a month because it&#039;s expensive and I need it to last) for the latter I use Tio Nacho instead. I also don&#039;t brush very often actually so I&#039;m not constantly pulling at it, and when I do it&#039;s very gentle (start from the bottom/tips, with your other hand grab just a bit above it so you don&#039;t pull, once that&#039;s done grab a bit higher and brush again, continue until you&#039;re brushing all of it).<br>It does become a bit bothersome at times, like getting it stuck in handles without me noticing and having my head pulled back, accidentally sitting on it, bending over and the tips touching the floor (awful if it&#039;s wet... ), but other than that it&#039;s really nice and I want to see how long it can get tbqh. I can wrap it like a scarf during winter, or feel like some forest fairy when I&#039;m naked at home and it falls all over my body, idk it&#039;s just really nice and soft, I can also do a lot of hair dos which is fun.", "time": 1672961226, "resto": 52890254}, {"no": 52903936, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)18:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I always enjoy these threads, they\u2019re the best.

Men are even scarier because most of them are more powerful than women. If they want to harm a woman, most men can very easily do so. <br>Why do you think there&#039;s always more men on dating websites/apps than women? Insecure betas who listen to too many misogynistic ecelebs will blabber something about how women are superficial whores who only pick the top 10% of men or other nonsense like that. The truth is that, while the average male user is completely harmless of course, there&#039;s a small portion of men who are malicious, only want sex or are just downright dangerous. Eventually, a lot of women stop using such services because the risk of running into such men is just not worth it.

The reason Eevee became a fan favorite at all was because of its evolutions.

I&#039;m sure plenty of people loved Eevee itself, but for most people it was what it represented. GF saw this popularity, assumed it was because of Eevee and Eevee alone, and made it THE number 2 shillmon behind Pikachu. They got it completely backwards, which is hilarious and also sad since we&#039;re probably never getting a new Eeveelution again because TPC have put way too much marketing into the ones we already have as being a &quot;complete&quot; set.

There have been so many things they have said we&#039;re final that ended up not being final. Beyond that, the only reason that Eevee is being treated as a second mascot is not because of its or its evolutions&#039; popularity but because when they were making LGPE they wanted to have another Pok\u00e9mon alongside Pikachu that could work as the secondary mascot. And they felt that Eevee was the best choice because it had that broad appeal baked in. If they picked another popular Gen 1 Pok\u00e9mon like Jigglypuff or Meowth, I don&#039;t think it would have had the same effect.
