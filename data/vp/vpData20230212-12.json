Again, if the two of them were no where near each other or just happened to be next to each other, it wouldn&#039;t mean anything, but the animator made sure the boy is looking at the woman to make it clear they are related in some way.<br><br>Claiming they&#039;re fans of Ash and Misty also doesn&#039;t work as the very same episode showed us a swarm of Ash fans and not a single one of them was this boy or the woman.

If he&#039;s emulating, there are layers to how willing people are to altering their games. Like for me playing Red in Japanese about 6 years ago, I was perfectly fine with using super speed for grinding. In fact, I grinded every Pok\u00e9mon line I had up to whatever the next highest level benchmark was, culminating in having Beedrill, Buttefree, Chansey, etc. at level 70 in the post-game with Mewtwo, no glitches for Rare Candies. For obtaining specific Pok\u00e9mon like the other starter lines, I just changed a single byte in the ROM to replace the level 5 Pikachu in Viridian Forest with the species of the Pok\u00e9mon, caught it, and then changed the encounter byte back. If I ever wanted to grind stat experience, I would just do that thing with Pidgey and Rattata and change them back once I was done. It almost feels easier to learn how to do RNG manipulation to handle stuff like breeding and shiny hunting.

This started in Gen II, and it extends to practically every character in the game in Japanese, rarely is a name just a name. From characters like Schoolboy Manabu (\u5b66\u3076 is the verb to learn) and Bird Keeper Tsubasa (\u7ffc means wing) to Pok\u00e9 Fan Megumi named after Megumi Hayashibara and practically every staff member on the credits being referenced as a character somewhere in the game.

It&#039;s impossible to tell practically any of references outside of the Japanese games. But what&#039;s even crazier is that 4Kids actually used Nintendo&#039;s localized English names if the corresponding Japanese name appeared in the Johto anime. In The Legend of Thunder, there&#039;s Jimmy (Kenta) and Vincent (Jun&#039;ichi), whose names 4Kids decided on because of the NPCs Youngster Kenta (Jimmy) and Guitarist Jun&#039;ichi (Vincent), who also happened to be Gen II&#039;s Masuda reference (Guitarist Masuda in Crystal&#039;s Battle Tower isn&#039;t in the Japanese game because of how the Battle Tower was altered).

The games have plenty of issues I could criticise. I did criticise them in my post, and lamented that it didn&#039;t execute on them properly.<br><br>I disagree with your contention that the previous games executed on their ideas successfully. They sold well, admittedly declining since gen 1. (Indeed the franchise has only started to reach gen 1 levels of sales on the Switch.)

It was expected to be the last game.) could get by with its more primitive story given the limits of the platform, the fact that it was the first one and there was no established formula and Team Rocket&#039;s ambitions did not go beyond crime for profit. Giovanni hinted at world domination, but that may have been blustering or hyperbole on his part. We only had a few lines on dialogue to go off and the actions of the team as a whole rarely went beyond petty crime, verging on terrorism at times.<br><br>RSE tried to give the teams a grander, ethical and planetspanning goal, but I already spoke on the flaws with that.<br><br>Gen 4 arrived when the franchise was in something of a slump. Not selling poorly, usually topping charts and selling in the millions. But compared to previous heights, a low point. DPPt followed the same formula and morality as previous games. Team bad, you good, get gym badges, defeat team, become champion, credits. Nowhere did it suggest that Galactic were in the right or there might be moral questions. And again, what did the grunts get out of Cyrus&#039; plan that he quickly told you at the end of the game? Did they even know it?<br><br>I feel Team Flare are Team Galactic again.

Maybe she sees something in him?<br>It is probably not the M05 Latias, both due to her not recognizing Ash and being much more evasive and angry. <br>Latias is still very cute and would be a wonderful companion and wife!<br><br>What we don&#039;t know:<br>Latias has so far been in every episode and it will definitely lead to something. Exactly what something is unknown, but one can hope she gets a major role in the final season with Ash. <br><br>Discuss any altoshipping, M05, or Latias related things, preferably with cute images attached! <br><br>Previous thread<br><a href=\"/vp/thread/53121646#p53121646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53121646</a>", "filename": "handholding", "ext": ".png", "w": 2000, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 250,

way.<br><br>I been mulling over that fire squad theater scene for awhile.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is no flowers present.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is interestingly the &quot;Milfsty&quot; character, along with a slightly older looking boy who looks like Ash with &quot;Milfsty&quot;.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then on stage there was three young kids who resemble our current trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty when getting a photo taken. When I mean young, I mean around Max&#039;s age.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of these characters show up later when they want autographs and photos at the end of the episode.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the end of the epsiode we do have other fans who do call him &quot;Champion Satoshi&quot;, and they do recognize Misty and Brock. And they want to cuddle with Pikachu.</span><br>So I have a simple theory on the lookalikes, they are fans who dress like people they look up to. In this case said people to look up to would be Ash, Misty, and Brock. I think the &quot;Milftsty&quot; one is the most evident of this as her outfit is similar but more modest than Misty&#039;s (full length pants, t-shirt that covers the middriff). The two Ash lookalikes are interesting in that they are both black haired, the older one has Ash&#039;s shirt, while the younger one has a red and white cap with no logo. The Brock one I will say looks like a mini brock, the only difference is an emphasis on yellow with an accent of green instead of the vice versa.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However I wouldn&#039;t say this is simply just fans and nothing more. As the writers and animators like to sneak in things that can have multiple meanings. For all we can merely speculate at the moment without more sufficient evidence from later episode, there might be a deeper meaning there might not be.</span><br><br>This episode also provided an interesting insight into how our trio view team rocket in their disguises. They give them the benefit of the doubt because they have encountered enough Jennys and Joys where people who look like others just exist. As there is always a slim chance that one day they could encounter those who look like Jesse &amp; James but are not them.", "filename": "7LbliTU", "ext": ".webm", "w": 500, "h": 280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676165721836233, "time": 1676165721, "md5": "mlNhDjTiWste4ZZoWp7AKg==", "fsize": 157926, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53211948, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:38:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53211616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53211616</a><br>misty going with Ash was a reference to the OS series", "time": 1676165881, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53211956, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:38:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53211925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53211925</a><br>i like it", "time": 1676165928, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53211985, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:45:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The OG schizos are trying to reclaim the throne from the 2.0</span><br>Like pottery, you all deserve the rope.", "time": 1676166308, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53211995, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "shipping or not its funny that a pokemon misty hyped up as being &quot;the one&quot; for her ends up attached to ash&#039;s team", "time": 1676166398, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212008, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:49:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I guess this almost confirms that the bike was just a flimsy excuse in the first place", "filename": "1421142421", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 762, "h": 481, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1676166552454071, "time": 1676166552, "md5": "iDrF9LQgZylgpPJRzoxswA==", "fsize": 75363, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212024, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:51:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Guys can you defend the Squirtle ep on serebii.", "time": 1676166711, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212035, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:54:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212024</a><br>What did that Power Up and that AuraChris retard think, Scott?", "time": 1676166854, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212043, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:56:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212035</a><br>They didn&#039;t really post about the ep yet.

To borrow from Brockschizo for a moment with flower meaning:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yellow Hibiscus flowers mean happiness, sunshine, and good luck.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Red Hibiscus flowers mean passion and deep romantic love.</span><br>Hibiscus flowers are considered very feminine, are often given to girls.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Polynesians and Hawaiians, depending on what side they of the head they are worn, this can also be a sign if a girl is single or not. With Misty&#039;s flowers, if you are standing in front of her , it means she is single and available. If you are standing with her, she is attached, aka already taken.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Japan the flowers also have a meaning of gentleness and hospitality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Malyasia the flowers also are known as celebration flowers.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In China they take on also a meaning of the afterlife and of immortality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Egypt, the flowers were associated with romantic fervor and lust. They believed you could make the petals of a hibiscus flower into a tea and it would act as an aphrodisiac. Turning a hibiscus flower into a tea is still a popular thing to do as it has a tart flavor like cranberries and it helps with a variety of things to help the body be healthy.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Victorian England, the flower gained a meaning of &quot;delicate beauty&quot;.</span>", "filename": "BWS01", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 450, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676171249505289, "time": 1676171249, "md5": "i73vVhvrTct+RlkjzEjIXA==", "fsize": 508753, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212419, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212409</a><br>I would&#039;ve ended it with DP, and if not, XY.", "time": 1676171286, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212421, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:09:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212410</a><br>To be fair Digimon are data so good and evil don&#039;t count for them", "time": 1676171342, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212425, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:09:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "funny that misty beat ash with a frog", "time": 1676171365, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212427, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:09:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212409</a><br><a href=\"#p53212419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212419</a><br>I would&#039;ve ended it with Battle Frontier, DESU.", "time": 1676171376, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212433, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:10:37", "name": "iklit", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212379</a><br>Media literacy is on all time low tp the point context is missed", "time": 1676171437, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212439, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:11:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212409</a><br>johto, easy. 140 episodes are enough to close ash&#039;s character", "time": 1676171500, "resto": 53211554}, {"no": 53212441, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:11:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53212410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53212410</a><br>I thought the premise of that current series is that digimon, like animals, don&#039;t consider the moral implications of what they&#039;re doing. <br>Like if a Crocodile kills 20 people he didn&#039;t do it out of malice because he cannot comprehend malice.<br>That sort of thing<br><br>I wonder if Pokemon are the same.

At least in Explorers of Time/Darkness. The player character has a complex history, relationships that feel substantial, and a goal they were chasing prior to the beginning of the story.

The last one is pure fanservice since Zinnia already pairs up with Rayquaza in the game, but his is shiny and can Mega Evolve (unfortunately it&#039;s pretty shit due to awful stats). They tie it into his fascination with rocks extending to meteors. Then when they did the Hoenn chapter of the Villain arc, they released Sygna Suit Steven &amp; Deoxys which actually flowed really well with what they had already written. They try to redo the Delta Emerald plot of going to stop a meteor that&#039;s going to hit the island and is causing Kyogre and Groudon to go nuts, and only Steven&#039;s Rayquaza can Mega Evolve to do it. However, a meteor piece broke off and Deoxys came from it, and it kept going after them and impeding their progress because Deoxys and Rayquaza are rivals in media.

You can climb the ladder in this game with a negative win rate. You can not do that in other games. You can pretty much climb all the way up to maybe 1600, last I checked, with a negative win rate. You win more rating than you lose up to 1600 so you can reach 1600 even if you are losing.<br><br>Same shit with reaching masters due to performance points.
