Don&#039;t bid until the last second. The app lags a few seconds behind the desktop site. You can even bid on 0 seconds in the app.<br>2. Keep track of what you buy. Some people claim to get nearly 100% of their cards but I had plenty of people who don&#039;t send the cards. Ebay always refunds me but it&#039;s hard to tell when you buy a lot of cards if you got them. It takes a few days so as soon as the expected delivery day arrives and you don&#039;t get the card report it as the item never arriving. Ebay gives the seller a few days to respond then you get your money.<br>3. Look at the images. You can gamble on poor images if you want but make sure you know what is being sold.<br>4A. Look at the seller rating and negative feedback. Again, you can gamble if you want but for me it&#039;s not worth it to try and save a few dollars from a new or low rating seller.<br>4B. Look at the seller&#039;s other items. You can see what they sell, what they have sold, and if you are interested in their other cards. If you buy multiple cards from the same seller send them a message to combine shipping.<br>5. I search &quot;Pokemon&quot;, &quot;Auctions only&quot;, sort by &quot;ending soonest&quot;, item location &quot;US&quot; (I avoid international sellers if I have an option), and set number of bids from 1-100 (weeds out things nobody is interested in).

I don&#039;t see it. Placing bets on there actually being no shipfaggotry in the remaining episodes, not with Misty, Dawn, or Serena, and Liko being 10 while Ash is also 10.

What makes Snorlax so good with Heavy Slam is that it can close the gap between itself and the backline, as well as dive its own backline to help them. Trev is a brawler, and extremely strong at that. It dishes out a ton of damage, has a ton of sustain, and has a lot of displacement and cc, but only so long as it can stay in the fight. So long as it can be kited, or there isn&#039;t a front line to fight, it isn&#039;t nearly as strong as it might be against say a Defender and an All Rounder, because without its sustain, it doesn&#039;t last all that long. It&#039;s also skill dependent, if someone ejects away you&#039;re basically out of luck, if you miss your Horn Leech you&#039;re in a shit ton of trouble, etc. It&#039;s also really easy to get away from it, as the slow on Curse is very minute. I think a nice buff would be a slightly bigger slow debuff on Curse, and a speed buff on itself. A Unite cd decrease might also help, as that can help it close gaps as well. I can see Trev being a good pick in draft when you can see what your opponents have, but when the players get a bit better than dumb as nails and teams are 80% ranged with ways to escape, it becomes harder to excel with it.", "time": 1671567327, "resto": 52729344}, {"no": 52730012, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52729961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52729961</a><br>what do you mean?<br>people shill his channel here all the time", "time": 1671567397, "resto": 52729344}, {"no": 52730016, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:17:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52729987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52729987</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes a streamer who gets paid to play video games from multiple revenue streams, is taking the time out of his day to recruit all, (checks notes), 10 posters here.</span><br><br>You are a schizo", "filename": "Screenshot_20221220-151626_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1439, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671567429596237, "time": 1671567429, "md5": "zNae6LYa0f08wJVck6Nt1Q==", "fsize": 795900, "resto": 52729344}, {"no": 52730046, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:20:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52729646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52729646</a><br>kek this guy swore he didn&#039;t ping too much then people found the video. spammed like a monkey..", "time": 1671567608, "resto": 52729344}, {"no": 52730054, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:20:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52729999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52729999</a><br>AHEM!<br><br>I said my WIFE has posted a video with the balance updates.", "filename": "Screenshot_20221220-151943_YouTube", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1931, "h": 562, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 36, "tim": 1671567648190831, "time": 1671567648, "md5": "gqyM3pmj2pdnezt1HB2xbQ==", "fsize": 642326, "resto": 52729344}, {"no": 52730069, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:22:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52730002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52730002</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bigger slow debuff on Curse</span><br>I&#039;d rather see Pain split being buffed so it can be actually picked together with Curse.", "time": 1671567743, "resto": 52729344}, {"no": 52730074, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:23:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52729646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52729646</a><br>Was the guy intentionally trying to fuck with him?", "time": 1671567785, "resto": 52729344}, {"no": 52730082, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:23:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52730016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52730016</a><br>you made 200 dollars in the last 90 days off YouTube.

If you want to distribute a file with 100% chance of no one being able to do anything, create a webserver and host it exclusively via Tor or I2P. This will, however, limit who has access to your file because most people don&#039;t want to deal with this shit. You can alternatively use anonymous file hosts, uploading to them via a VPN, and reuploading whenever they get a takedown request. If you use several file hosts, you may make it cease to be worth Nintendo&#039;s time to keep playing whack a mole.<br><br>Finally, file sharing is always an option. Be aware that any time you are hosting a file off of your own PC, you leak your IP address to all of your peers. This is the case both with bittorrent and with IPFS. However, with a sufficient number of peers, it is again very fucking annoying for Nintendo to play whack a mole. They can send you a C&amp;D order, but then everyone else with the same torrent file is capable of seeding. Once a large enough quantity of people have the file, there is nothing they can do to prevent further distribution.<br><br>Ultimately, the two keys to being successful at evading copyright law are OPSEC and persistence. Reveal as little as possible about yourself wherever possible. If you must use a name, use a pseudonym that is not in any way connected to your real name. Don&#039;t even make it one they can find through three or four hops from a google search because you used it once when you were 8, and that was on an account that you use your current email with.
