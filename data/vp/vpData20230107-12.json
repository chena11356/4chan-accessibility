I would&#039;ve greatly preferred to see Goh use his Pokemon outside the lab. There were a few instances where he called upon them to help overcome an obstacle he and Ash faced. I would&#039;ve loved more of this. I wanted to see Goh occasionally challenge gyms and enter contests to get stronger and strengthen his bond with his Pokemon. I love the idea of Goh having a variety of Pokemon from every region, but I&#039;m not thrilled with the execution of the idea. I only take exception with the claim that Goh is an evil or selfish person when his Pokemon are well-cared for by him and others, and although we only see it every now and again, we do know that he spends time with them when he&#039;s at the lab, so we can assume it also happens off-screen. Ash has never been around someone with Goh&#039;s goal, so comparing Goh to his other friends and their catching habits isn&#039;t really fair. Goh does keep his Pokemon at the lab outside of their balls all the time, which is something Ash&#039;s companions couldn&#039;t do, but I wouldn&#039;t criticize them for that because their situations aren&#039;t comparable.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What the hell did he even catch Kingdra and Regieleki for if he was never going to use them in Project Mew, or in general?</span><br>He caught them because that was the mission objective.", "time": 1673067822, "resto": 52914326}, {"no": 52917200, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)00:04:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52917180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917180</a><br>She&#039;s also on serebii named Bendicion.", "time": 1673067841, "resto": 52914326}, {"no": 52917211, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)00:07:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://twitter.com/pikachu_pcn/st<wbr>atus/1611568953918386176</span><br>Duplica x Everyone<br>see you in pokespain", "filename": "Fl1xaSoaUAEACvT", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 950, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 115, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673068034800611, "time": 1673068034, "md5": "GF7RCgATXYdMCgj7e2upPQ==", "fsize": 502553, "resto": 52914326}, {"no": 52917217, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)00:08:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://twitter.com/anipoke_PR/sta<wbr>tus/1611558239442972673</span><br>Ash x Dawn<br>see you in pokespain", "filename": "Flw6OXoagAAC3JU", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 450, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673068128568762, "time": 1673068128, "md5": "zLffKeKBf1s5O5AFOOg+Qw==", "fsize": 223493, "resto": 52914326}, {"no": 52917221, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)00:09:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52917200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917200</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bendicion</span><br>Annoying", "time": 1673068190, "resto": 52914326}, {"no": 52917226, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)00:11:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52917221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917221</a><br>You refering to my post or her?

The only ones that will go by their \u2018real\u2019 names in the dex/species listing for this game are the 10 ace ones that don\u2019t have codenames to begin with. Can\u2019t speak to the DLC\u2019s creative process but I heard the base game\u2019s paradoxes referred to by their real names before launch, I\u2019m almost certain the codenames came second.<br><br><a href=\"#p52915023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52915023</a><br>Your price point is way off. The pass will cost $30 once again, with an option to pay $10 per individual chapter, and eventually an $80 definitive edition. So basically, $90 for the average player, $100 for idiots, and $80 for patient people (or those who just buy every title). Pretty standard fare, the powers that be rarely shake up their pricing schemes. And the DLC Chapters will not be the only mainline Pokemon content releasing in that timeframe.

I&#039;d keep her in a cell and what&#039;s more is that I would actually place the key inside with her but put it in a high place. Not extremely high but just ever so slightly out of reach. It would drive her mad. I would dress her like a baby and force feed her 99 cent store baby food. I&#039;d also pick her up like a child and toss her from one corner to the next. I&#039;d grab her by one leg and swing her as hard and as fast as I could then hurl her to see how far she goes. I&#039;d rent one of those giant inflatable bounce houses and body slam her all day until my arms got tired. I&#039;d hold her down with 1 hand and slowly stick things up her butt just to see her squirm. I would stick her in dryers and turn them on and leave her in there for long periods of time.

There&#039;s only a couple nsfw chapters sprinkled throughout a much larger story; it takes place during Ash&#039;s Hoenn journey, and Ash finds himself missing Latias so much that he decides to go back and visit her in Alto Mare. He and Latias reconnect, <s>have sex</s>, have two shiny Lati babies, and eventually get married. And I LOVED all of it.

From there, freeform tags (user submitted) are corrected/Linked by Tag wranglers to a standard form if they exist. If you tag something &quot;[Character]&#039;s Daddy Issues&quot;, your local tag wrangler will have that become a subtag to &quot;Daddy Issues&quot; and &quot;Parental Issues&quot;, so if you search those tags, you&#039;ll still find the original fic. Mistagged fics are flagged by wranglers/standard users and the authors will be asked to fix them in egregious cases. If these things haven&#039;t happened, it&#039;s either because of the fic hasn&#039;t been gotten to, or the fandom isn&#039;t popular enough to have wranglers (who are just local fandom volunteers). Fandoms from there with very popular tropes or AUs will then gain fandom-specific tags. For the Pokemon anime &quot; Ash Ketchum Has Aura Powers&quot; is a popular tag, with a subtag &quot;Aura Guardian Ash Ketchum&quot; (since not every fic with Ash having Aura powers is him as an Aura Guardian). It also has a whole legion of synonyms that wranglers have tagged, such as <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aura User Ash</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;aura user!ash</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aura!Ash</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AuraAsh</span><br>All of these were user-submitted tags that were made synonyms of the overarching tag for you to search.

It&#039;s currently at 103cm more or less, last year it had a sudden growth spurt out of nowhere (was at like 96 before), don&#039;t know why. If it helps, I use Elvive shampoo and conditioner, though sometimes (like twice a month because it&#039;s expensive and I need it to last) for the latter I use Tio Nacho instead. I also don&#039;t brush very often actually so I&#039;m not constantly pulling at it, and when I do it&#039;s very gentle (start from the bottom/tips, with your other hand grab just a bit above it so you don&#039;t pull, once that&#039;s done grab a bit higher and brush again, continue until you&#039;re brushing all of it).<br>It does become a bit bothersome at times, like getting it stuck in handles without me noticing and having my head pulled back, accidentally sitting on it, bending over and the tips touching the floor (awful if it&#039;s wet... ), but other than that it&#039;s really nice and I want to see how long it can get tbqh. I can wrap it like a scarf during winter, or feel like some forest fairy when I&#039;m naked at home and it falls all over my body, idk it&#039;s just really nice and soft, I can also do a lot of hair dos which is fun.", "time": 1672961226, "resto": 52890254}, {"no": 52903936, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)18:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I always enjoy these threads, they\u2019re the best.
