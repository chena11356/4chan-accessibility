He&#039;s one of the key founders of the Pok\u00e9mon series and he&#039;s basically right. Look at the video posted, the girl speaks of Pok\u00e9mon as if she was talking about dogs and the scenes shown in the video show how Pok\u00e9mon even act like obedient dogs. Why would Gengar wait 3 years for it&#039;s owner instead of acting like it states on the dex? Why did it act like an obedient dog rather than the scary monster it&#039;s described in the pokedex? The anime even shows Gengar eating dry food like a dog, clearly not a scary monster as in the dex but a creature that&#039;s closer to a dog more than anything. The dex can serve as a cool backstory and play a role but depiction takes precedent over it and depicting Pok\u00e9mon as cute and innocent critters is foremost more important than anything else hence why the Pok\u00e9mon company is very anal about depiction of Pokemon and very meticulous in the way they&#039;re depicted. <br><br>And what you mention is common in all media.<br>https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.<wbr>php/Main/TalkingAnimal<br>https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.<wbr>php/Main/IntellectualAnimal<br>None of the characters listed stop being animals/pets just because of their abilities, they&#039;re still constructed to be pets/animals. Snoopy may be able to write a novel but he&#039;s still very much Charlie Brown&#039;s dog in the way he&#039;s treated and acts. Likewise we know the same with Pok\u00e9mon because of Tajiri&#039;s statements and even statements from The Pok\u00e9mon Company. This is why Pok\u00e9mon share universal pet behaviors like zoomies or chewing on shoes like in HGSS or as why the player bathes and cleans them like one does their pet, this implies Pok\u00e9mon can&#039;t clean themselves, or as to why we see things like pet beds in Scarlet and Violet.

You live in a world where apparently these things dislodge Pok\u00e9mon from their intended space which they don&#039;t. Not only do you chose to ignore actual words from the people who run the series but also the many ways in which the series chooses to contextualize Pok\u00e9mon. Nothing in Pok\u00e9mon Snap ending suggest the girl is naive, verily so the point of Pok\u00e9mon being attuned to the feelings of people and showing trust and love when shown love by people was a major point in Legends of Arceus such as NPCs remarking on the love the MC has for their Pok\u00e9mon and even the lady at the pasture proclaiming Pok\u00e9mon must want to be friendly with people since they&#039;re not running away from the pastures. Also it&#039;s never implied that the gengar bonded with it&#039;s trainer, instead it&#039;s revealed the trainer started to detest the gengar nevertheless it chose to be a good boy and await for it&#039;s owner. Likewise many abandoned Pok\u00e9mon, like Ash charmender chose to wait for their owner and in Charmander case even if it meant death and enduring more abuse. The reception to the Gengar episode among children was one of sadness, many proclaimed to have cried at it&#039;s backstory because it has an element of pet innocence to it, indeed one reddit post called it the jurassic bark of Pok\u00e9mon. <br><br>With all that in mind this construction is very powerful to the point that it greatly influences reception to Pok\u00e9mon even in the NSFW sphere and as to why so many people have issues with sexualization of any Pok\u00e9mon, they act cute and innocent and many people perceive Pok\u00e9mon as occupying the space of critters in universe, and not just any critter but also the space of cats and dogs.<br><br>Of course I&#039;m not alone here, as I mentioned you see this perception every on mass media.

Card collecting was losing popularity during neo, and really lost popularity during e-series onward. Reflecting the lower sales, Pokemon lowered their print numbers to reflect lower demand. Low print numbers really start during Neo Destiny, and continued all the way through e-series, ex-series, and gen4 cards. The final set of gen4 was Call of Legends. A special set already, full of semi-reprints (new artwork but same attacks). It wasn&#039;t a failure, but it was just released as a small print run during a time when print runs were already tiny. I think Call of Legends may be one of the lowest printed around (along with things like ex doexys and skyridge). As a result, those Shiny Legend cards are among the rarest ultra rares around.

That are my 2 cents.<br>If you don&#039;t know how many times you have to put a certain card into your deck, just remember:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3 times = card you want in your starting hand</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;twice = important, but not necessary to start with, or cards you can easily search for</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;once = it&#039;s a card you can easily search for or isn&#039;t that important for your engine</span><br>I&#039;m currently playing a Kashtira deck and it&#039;s so much fun running that deck, unfortunately Fenrir and Unicorn will most likely become limited next year.<br>Have fun!", "time": 1671703836, "resto": 52748517}, {"no": 52750551, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)05:49:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52749549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52749549</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nostalgia and hype for those cards in the future</span><br>I&#039;m 22 and already feel nostalgia lol. just have no money to bid up ebay lol<br><br>But thank you for the insight. immensely appreciated.<br><br>Might pick up a few shiny legends in a few years time then.<br>The CG art is okay, not the best though imo.<br>The art of the commons is more nostalgic for obvious reasons", "time": 1671706167, "resto": 52748517}, {"no": 52750560, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)05:51:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52750551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52750551</a><br>Speaking of which I do have this card.

Everyone at Clover is doing their absolute best for the game. But no. Because it&#039;s not Sage, the GameFreak wannabes, we&#039;re completely disregarded. <br><br>So what if we use memes? Who cares? We work the meme-age into a solid design. They aren&#039;t based on any animals or objects? They&#039;re just colourful shapes? You could say the same for your mons. Some of them are great, some of them are GF-clones and some are absolute horseshit.<br><br>We aren&#039;t just a hack. Sure, the hack is buggy and is a copy-paste (almost) of Kanto, but Camerupt and the others are working so hard, SO hard to fix these bugs and make the best game they can. Me, Dexanon, and other anons are working on DubsClover, the sequel. We try our absolute best too.<br><br>Why are you so elitist? Sage might be visually appealing, but what if the characters are bland and blank? What if the story is edgy or boring? There are so many problems that may occur. And I know any of this won&#039;t happen, because once again, you&#039;ll have about fifteen surveys to decide every ounce of the game.<br><br>And that&#039;s another thing that bothers people. Sage as a project is extremely slow. You might say, &quot;We&#039;re nearly done!&quot;, but you&#039;re not. You have a million surveys to decide everything and none of you are independent. When Sage is finally finished, due to the speed you work at, it will either be 2020 and very outdated, or be bare-bones and lack any actual heart.<br><br>You people need to look at Sage from the outsider&#039;s perspective. You are a very good project as a whole, but you have flaws, and one of those flaws is that this isn&#039;t actually /vp/&#039;s game.

Sin embargo, con la llegada de Diamante, Perla y Platino se vio un aumento de profundidad en sus temas, tornando as\u00ed los juegos un poco mas oscuros, d\u00e1ndole entonces un aire relativamente fresco y siendo un cambio positivo, el tiempo pasa, y el publico que creci\u00f3 con los juegos va creciendo con nuevos intereses.<br><br>X e Y volvieron al tono infantilizado de la franquicia con un arte en pokemones ya no tan grotesco como los originales de la 5ta Generaci\u00f3n.
