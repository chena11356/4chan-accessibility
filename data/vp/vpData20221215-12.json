Blue being the guy whos stalking you through the whole game. Lance helping you beat up Team Rocket. Cynthia going into the distortion world with you. More than like two fucking cutscenes.<br><br>I want a cool design that looks like clothes/hair/etc that a human being might actually wear. Steven and Geeta are wearing basically a suit, Alder is basically wearing a poncho and trousers. They&#039;re good. Iris&#039;s hair is insanely long and complicated and her dress is so big and poofy, she should be tripping and getting snagged on stuff constantly. I don&#039;t even know where to start with Wallace. I have a hard time suspending my disbelief.<br><br>I don&#039;t want the game to tell me how powerful they are or how impossible it is to defeat them, because I know that as a video game every obstacle inside it is intended to be overcome by the player. Tell me they&#039;re the strongest trainer in the region, sure, but don&#039;t act like I&#039;m supposed to be in awe over their power when they&#039;re just a video game boss.<br><br>I also like to see some amount of them acting like an authority figure, maybe bossing around a gym leader or elite four member, something like that. Like, when the elder in the dragon den threatened to Clair that he would get Lance involved if she didn&#039;t hand out the gym badge? I like the game to treat the champion like an authority figure.<br><br>Also gotta have good music. Controversial opinion but Cynthia&#039;s theme doesn&#039;t do it for me.

She apologizes for getting you drunk and technically date-raping you, which isn&#039;t quite how it happened but that&#039;s the way she sees it. I wrote the scene that way because I was worried the reader might think, &quot;Hey, it&#039;s really not cool that we got Cynthia drunk and then had sex - that&#039;s RAPE.&quot; I figured the best way to diffuse an objection like that was to have Cynthia point out that BOTH of you were drunk and SHE propositioned YOU, and both of you are fine with it the morning afterward, so nobody raped anyone.</s>", "filename": "lying_wearing_top", "ext": ".png", "w": 1400, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 116, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671097971185399, "time": 1671097971, "md5": "YAr0iytnqlQT+r1w5HxY0w==", "fsize": 1182605, "resto": 52604867}, {"no": 52647924, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:57:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52647702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52647702</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;saving the sample</span><br>...oh wait the original is over the 4chan filesize limit.

Here is what I came up with.<br>It was the morning of his 16th birthday. Kai was hopeful that his parents would finally let him have a Pok\u00e9mon and go off on his own to challenge gyms. Ever since he was 10 he loved watching trainers battle on TV, and in his spare time he would head out into the forest to observe the Pok\u00e9mon. <br><br>\u201cGood morning\u201d He said to his parents, who were preoccupied with making breakfast. Still groggy from just rolling out of bed, and a little annoyed he was woken by the banging of pots and pans. He didn\u2019t let it show, he was thankful for his parents for going out of the way to make a meal. <br><br>His parents were never thrilled with the idea of their son being a trainer. They had thought it would be a passing phase he would eventually grow out of.

Still groggy from just rolling out of bed, and a little annoyed he was woken by the banging of pots and pans. He didn\u2019t let it show, he was thankful for his parents for going out of the way to make a meal. <br><br>His parents were never thrilled with the idea of their son being a trainer. They had thought it would be a passing phase he would eventually grow out of. It\u2019s been 6 years since he first said \u201cI want to be a trainer!\u201d His desire never waned. He only grew more and more eager to battle, as he saw kids his age on TV battling and even defeating some of Sinnoh\u2019s strongest gym leaders. Kai yearned for the adventure and fame, and also to get away from the stale monotony of Sandgem town. His parents were the opposite. They didn\u2019t see the glamor in being a trainer, and wanted their son to focus his energy on trying to get a regular job the same way they did.<br><br>Mom and Dad were in the kitchen getting breakfast ready.

He knew that his parents had capitulated in their struggle to get him to give up on being a trainer. He knew because Maya was involved. Maya was his next door neighbor, she moved here from Unova 8 years ago with her Father. She was outgoing, and ambitious, but sometimes overbearing. Most importantly, Maya was a very talented trainer, and already had her first badge from Oreburgh City. That\u2019s how Kai new his parents had changed their mind - if Maya was involved Pok\u00e9mon were involved. <br><br>Kai and Maya were friends of circumstance, despite Kai being put off buy her general disagreeableness, their close proximity to one another essentially forced them to get along. It wasn\u2019t all bad though, Maya would often take him along to watch her battle, other trainers or just wild Pok\u00e9mon, which he absolutely loved doing. Watching Maya battle was a sight to behold, she was always totally in control of the field. Her battle vs Roark even made it into the highlight reel on T.V<br><br>Kai hurriedly got ready, he knew breakfast was almost ready and he didn\u2019t want to keep his parents waiting since they made an extra effort to make him breakfast. He headed back downstairs as his parents were setting three places at the table. <br><br>\u201cThanks for doing this guys, It means a lot to me\u201d Kai said.<br><br>\u201cNo problem sweetie\u201d replied mom<br><br>\u201cIs there anything you need me to do?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNope!

Known for their vibrant luminescence and their ability to produce spores and lights that induce sleep on travelers. In the region of Valkha, I&#039;ve noticed a peculiarity that has formed in this region&#039;s variant of them. Nocturnal in nature, they live primarily in thick and dense forests, hiding until sunset where they come out. <br><br>These type of Shiinotic are much more dimly luminescent than their Alolan relatives, difficult to make out with the naked eye, but it seems to be an evolutionary adaptation to their environment. Despite this, they still glow under ultraviolet light, more florescent than bio-luminescence. They have a distinct red coloration to their caps, resembling witches hats and their bodies are a light brown. They seem to react to hostile threats by radiating a sort of aura that seems to affect the minds of their enemies. It drains them of their energy, they become lethargic and depressed the longer they stay within the area of influence of these Shiinotic. Almost like it&#039;s sapping away all the positive energy they have, and the Shiinotic become much more active after such encounters. They even gather and dance with each other in clearings, a strange dance that I can&#039;t seem to describe with words alone.<br><br>I must admit that being here leaves me feeling rather hesitant and fearful. I&#039;ve heard from locals in a neighboring town about these woods being home to dark spirits and curses because of their history. I can&#039;t confirm that these are anything more than superstitious rumors, but the presence of ghost Pokemon and other creatures that seem to frequent such locations are prevalent here as well.

I wouldn&#039;t have expected to see Shroomish up here, but they&#039;ve seemed to develop a sort of adaptation even in the freezing temperatures high up in Valkha. <br><br>You would think Pokemon like Shroomish would be ill-fit to endure the snow and frost. The adaptation seems to stem from them eating a certain type of lichen that thrives up here. It is in their regular consumption of this fauna that they begin to undergo an evolutionary change. They develop thick lichenous growths, it covers their mantle and most of their body like a hair of sorts. Arms are much stronger than their Breloom counterparts, A single claw on each arm, thick and short with a hooked end. <br><br>They seem to be much more prone to initiating combat against a threat than their tropical brethren. Lost a lot of their capacity to use spores in combat, instead they relentlessly barrage their opponents with terrible slashes and piercing strikes with their fists. It is amazing just how fast they seem to move, a strange elegance it&#039;s almost like they dance around their opponent. Not a lot of stamina in them though, it might be because of the fact that they burn through energy faster than they can produce it. If they can&#039;t defeat their opponent quickly, they seem to use their tails as a scoop to gather up a large amount of snow to blind their opponent before fleeing. <br><br>Due to the vast change in appearance and temperament between them and Breloom, it would be wise to assume they are a distinct divergent evolution. I&#039;ve taken to calling them &quot;Lavloom&quot;, but the name is more for my own personal recording purposes and fully open to change if need be. I managed to catch one in battle, a miracle if anything else.

It is in one of these areas that I&#039;ve discovered a strange variant of Kantoian Sandshrew/Sandslash. Their hide takes on the qualities of their environment, coated and tinted from the algae and bog debris. This seems to be a defensive adaptation that lets them avoid predation in return. Due to limited options, they seem to have evolved piscivorious traits along with the insectivore traits of their Kantoian relatives. Sharp harpoon-like tail, specialized hands that end with three fingers that end with long claws with grooves that easily pierce into the slippery hide of their aquatic. Webbing between their fingers gives them great locomotion in the water, and also lets them dig easily into the marshland mud. <br><br>The back of the Valkhan Sandslash has rather impressive sharpened scales; thick, but they have extraordinary flexibility to move around their territory. From what I&#039;ve seen, they are normally adverse to interacting with others, they are much more inclined to hiding if the option to run is provided. Otherwise, they will react aggressively, their serrated claws can shred flesh and the tip of their tail seems perfectly suited for piercing thick hides and scales. From what I&#039;ve seen, when they are pressured into combat, they will not stop until their aggressor is rendered incapacitated or dead.<br><br>That said, I have acquired samples along with a Valkhan Sandslash. They will be sent to you for further examination. Fighting one was difficult enough, especially with the difficult terrain. You try to engage in battle with one in mud that goes up to your hips.<br><br>((I had to shift the idea of how their hands and feet looked because for the sake of locomotion in water, they really should have webbed hands and feet.

The first game is about you trying to be the best on your school, making friends and enemies, and the second game will be about you finally going to said tournament and tying loose ends of the first game.<br><br>You can see some progress here: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFsSG1U6/", "time": 1671059388, "resto": 52641883}, {"no": 52642343, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)18:27:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52642147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52642147</a><br>Looks solid so far. <br>A good amount of custom sprite work, correct?", "time": 1671060463, "resto": 52641883}, {"no": 52643287, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:45:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Making an open world Pok\u00e9mon game about you being a bounty hunter hired by some mysterious organization to infiltrate an island belonging to another mysterious organization and retrieve a person with an ancient artifact. The game is open world like cockslayer\u2019s crystal clear. You start in one tutorial dungeon, which then opens up to the rest of the game. The enemy commanders (this game\u2019s equivalent to gym leaders) are all bastardizations of figures of the Pok\u00e9mon community. Example Pulfrick is based off of wolvey glick, or Cockslayer being shockslayer. Even some other figures based off of people like Jaiden and SHF will be in the game as mid bosses, but didn\u2019t make the cut for commander status. The enemies don\u2019t exactly scale to your level, although they level up based on the amount of commanders defeated. Defeating commanders and doing other stuff can even get you items and access to either shortcuts, or access to secret areas, which either have static levels, or have a minimum level, and level up with defeated commanders. I have a lot of the groundwork set up, although I am waiting for gen 9 stuff to come out because it will overwrite a lot of the stuff I am doing, and I really want a lot of that stuff. EV\u2019s and IV\u2019s will be removed, not to mention level grinding will not take too long even without debug. I\u2019ll also try to limit over leveling. Especially with how the island works, I probably won\u2019t be able to cram in all 1010 Pok\u00e9mon, but I can try to get in as many as I can. I will also not include any megas, z moves, dynamax, or terestrializing.
