Regardless of what waifufags think, Ash and Pikachu are the most recognizable faces in the entire IP. While I don&#039;t think Pikachu is getting shunted from the merch anytime soon, it&#039;s still a pretty big shakeup. It&#039;s been 25 fucking years with the same 2 characters, why now? Why not earlier? It&#039;d be like hearing the Simpsons is ending. Sure, it&#039;s been decades since it&#039;s been good, but people just got used to it always being there in the background. So when it finally gets retired it comes across as a shock.<br><br>On the point of Nostalgia, I think the news is hitting people harder than you might think because for many people, they simply aged out of the games/anime. They left on their own volition with the knowledge that this character would continue on without them in some ethereal sense. But now that Ash is finally retiring &quot;for realzies&quot; this time, those people have to confront the fact that something they were familiar with now unmistakably gone. Like growing apart from a childhood friend you were on good terms with, then learning years later that they died or became a drug addict or what have you.

It&#039;s stupid easy to win once you have enough cards to do the Haymaker. Other archetypes like Energy Tans and Rainmaker really just weren&#039;t as successful.<br>2.

However, it is still terrible at being a pizza, as it is a &quot;sandy&quot; forme, so it will taste worse than the bitter feeling of defeat that you get after losing when you use this Pokemon.

Just try to live life and be happy, but try to figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life. Not constantly, but dwell on it every few days, put down your phone and go into a room without electronics and really think on it, you know? (thats a good practice in general by the way, unplug for an hour a day and youll get pretty productive).<br><br>Oh, and unless your parents are abusive assholes or something, tell them how much they mean to you. Let them know you love them. They are getting up there in age and you dont know know how much time you have left with them.

My mother used to have to wash the vest when I was sleep cause sometimes i wouldnt take it off if you told me. I remember using that kiosk at my local mall to get the promotional Mew for my Yellow cart when they used to hold the Mall Tours events during pokemania and battling other kids in line with the link cable swapping missingo theories. I remember the first movie pokeballs with the Gold bars of the different pokemon and trading them for actual pokemon cards I wanted from my friends. I remember my mom taking me to those Pokemon League tournaments at ZainyBrainy. Those shitty but soulful Japanese stickers that would be sold at gumball machines.

I can&#039;t wait for my kid to be excited for whatever new phenomenon I wont be able to understand like my mother did but supported anyways.

But by playing the games and consuming Pok\u00e9mon media you&#039;re already treating it that way. In the games you interact with your Pok\u00e9mon as pets, not as people. The world also treats them in a similar manner and constantly It&#039;s said that Pok\u00e9mon and people exist as two separate concepts. A Pok\u00e9mon as a cute little critter is fundamental to the Pok\u00e9mon franchise so much that Tajiri was already penning Pok\u00e9mon as pets as early as 1995. His biography just pretty much sealed the book on that front because he&#039;s very open about it there. <br><br>When I first set out to prove a point I used what is visible from the source material which people here readily denied. It&#039;s not until further looking behind the scenes that I uncovered how open the series is about it to the point one can&#039;t deny it.<br><br>Because this is the only way one interacts and sees Pok\u00e9mon that is the way people&#039;s views are shaped. When it comes to the sexual aspect the NSFW sphere is embedded within a group that probably cares very little about a Pok\u00e9mon construction and standing but for normal folks it&#039;s something they are keen to pick on. For example The Chlakeaters receiving backlash on TikTok and accusations of bestiality. No matter how much people here want to divorce Pok\u00e9mon from it&#039;s context it&#039;s near impossible to do so especially since this construction is a foundation of the series.<br><br><a href=\"#p52670520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52670520</a><br>Not unusual at all by fictional standards.", "filename": "20221216_1410", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1817, "tn_w": 74, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671222670942876, "time": 1671222670, "md5": "xy/lM0c4VTiwjuPNNpATPQ==", "fsize": 435949, "resto": 52669712}, {"no": 52673303, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:43:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52670669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52670669</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coomshit </span><br>Why do you have less integrity than a literal turdmuncher dear Anon?", "filename": "g4T_o-MZHaGl49eHQ_klAftF4p8fLn6op1z-l7TZ2iI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 490, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1671223387448065, "time": 1671223387, "md5": "HARwOCGqRfbH5/y9TAzFCw==", "fsize": 41772, "resto": 52669712}, {"no": 52673327, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:44:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52671291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52671291</a><br><a href=\"#p52671624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52671624</a><br><a href=\"#p52671641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52671641</a><br>Digimon once again proving to be civilized and intelligent creatures", "filename": "civilized beings", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671223473941032, "time": 1671223473, "md5": "e/KWExSDTgjhGnINYtOj7Q==", "fsize": 39317, "resto": 52669712}, {"no": 52673357, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:45:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52671641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52671641</a><br>G<br>I<br>W<br>T<br>W<br>M", "time": 1671223554, "resto": 52669712}, {"no": 52673406, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:47:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52673102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52673102</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;animating a rape scene as a joke </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NO WE&#039;RE NOT DERANGED, YOU ARE! </span><br>As if having a groomer hebe on board wouldn&#039;t make it even more obvious what they&#039;re trying to do there...", "time": 1671223658, "resto": 52669712}, {"no": 52673462, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:50:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52669763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52669763</a><br><a href=\"#p52669712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52669712</a><br>Mr Mime eating with a knife and fork at the table that one episode was mega cringe.

Pok\u00e9mon as a series draws heavily from Satoshi Tajiri childhood which was spent exploring a creek and collecting all manners of creatures, his biography makes it clear he collected more than bugs, and once that connection to nature was lost when he attended middle school it left a big impression on him. Reading his biography he makes it very clear his childhood was one of the inspirations, and would later become the biggest influence, for Pok\u00e9mon. <br><br>Pok\u00e9mon are not conceptualized to be human-adjacent creatures like dwarves or elves, Tajiri makes it very clear that he sees Pok\u00e9mon as pets, he sees them as the animals he collected, took care and interacted with from his childhood. The pet aspect has been there from the get go, a book released in 1995 has Tajiri calling Pok\u00e9mon kaiju-like pets, the 1996 pokedec mentions how Pok\u00e9mon make better pets than cats and dogs. Further reading such as Shudo saying it was decided that they, and they most likely refers to the people working on the anime possibly including Tajiri, would see the relation between humans and Pok\u00e9mon in the same way as non-human creatures and humans in the real world, that is creatures that are part of the natural world.

The series doesn&#039;t make these sorts of distinctions you are suggesting because that&#039;s not part of Pok\u00e9mon vision. Pok\u00e9mon conceptualizes the fantastical into the natural, it sees fantasty fictional beings conceptualized as being closer to cute little critters more than anything else. This is why Pok\u00e9mon eat dog food, or as in HGSS bark and chew on shoes, or exhibit zoomies just like real cats and dogs do. Because that is Tajiri&#039;s vision of Pok\u00e9mon and a vision the series continues to uphold to this very day. Even Takeshi Shudo didn&#039;t make those distinctions, he very much saw all the original 151 Pok\u00e9mon as critters, in his blog he describes Pok\u00e9mon as a group of animals arranged from familiar *objects* and creatures.
