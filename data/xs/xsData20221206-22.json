According to ESPN, &quot;In the former contest, he weighed in at 175 pounds; for Sakuraba, he was 188. One may not need to be nutritionist to observe that a muscle gain of 13 pounds in one year at the age of 40 is a strikingly accomplished feat.

The dirt won&#039;t give you much trouble, although you should think about picking up a fender to avoid mud spattering all over you.<br>I also agree that Schwalbe Marathon is the way to go for tires. You can use whatever stock tires come with the bike until they wear out and then replace them with Marathons if you want, just to save a little cash, but they will ultimately save you money in the long run. My friend buys cheap tires because he thinks it saves him cash, but he gets a flat every three months or so (~$7-10 each time, plus the time to do the changing, plus the inconvenience risk of discovering a flat in the morning), whereas I get a flat about every year and a half (and usually from something that no tire could possibly resist).<br><br>I am curious about belt drives though, what makes them a meme?

Then it&#039;s fairly easy (easier said than done though). The key skills are the double leg takedown, the armbar and some ground control. You&#039;ll have to let him go at you first, just so you can learn his rythm. Then when he&#039;s throwing a one two, you drop on your knees to shoot the takedown and keep a hold of his leg until he is down. From now on, it&#039;s Khabib time, you can basically move on top and control his legs with a leg triangle (that shit Khabib does when he wraps his legs around his opponent&#039;s and lock it by putting an ankle behind his opposite knee). From now on you&#039;re on top of him: lay as much weight as possible on him, smash his face and when he&#039;s giving you an arm throw the armbar. Of course if you already know an other submission from top mount (Anaconda, Kimura, Armbar) you can also use it.<br><br>Now, maybe you&#039;re the smaller man? Ok, it&#039;s not gonna be as easy but it&#039;s doable. Against bigger opponents, double leg takedowns are harder to land, as is gaining in maintaining top control. So we&#039;re gonna have you go to a place where your opponent has no strength: his back. The key skills here will be moving from the clinch to the back, the broomstick takedown and the rear naked choke, otherwise known as RNC. So here&#039;s the plan: get to feel him a little bit at first. When you feel like you got him, slip on the side when he throws a straight punch (if he throws with his right, you move to you left) and catch him. Best is wrapping up your arms against his torso or abdomen. From there you will need to move as fast as possible to his back to avoid getting into a strength opposition with a bigger opponent. Basically when you get in, step with your inner leg (the one closer to him) behind his foot, keep a tight grip around him and pivot on your leg to get his back. Then you use a simple broomstick takedown to get him on the ground and then move to the RNC. He sleeps.
