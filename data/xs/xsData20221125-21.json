On track you can practice performance riding (higher speeds, sharper turns, hard acceleration, maximum breaking). I only ride motocross. I have known several street only riders and I ask them how they practice to use the full breaking potential of their bikes - they dont. If on the street faced with a real emergency and you need to brake at full stop asap, you will never have practiced that and will likely be going to fast to stop, or not know how to brake at maximum potential to avoid a collision or reduce as much speed as possible to avoid a collision. Want to go fast? Do it on a track. don&#039;t be a retard on the street. Find local offroad tracks and riding areas.

Using existing manuscripts from the Nuremberg Group as his reference, his workshop produced the extensive \u039f\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 sive Armorvm Tractandorvm Meditatio Alberti Dvreri (&quot;Weapon Training, or Albrecht D\u00fcrer&#039;s Meditation on the Handling of Weapons&quot;, MS 26-232). Another manuscript based on the Nuremberg texts as well as one of Hans Talhoffer&#039;s works, the untitled Berlin Picture Book (Libr.Pict.A.83), is also thought to have originated in his workshop around this time. These sketches and watercolors show the same careful attention to detail and human proportion as D\u00fcrer&#039;s other work, and his illustrations of grappling, long sword, dagger, and messer are among the highest-quality in any fencing manual.</span><br><br>Fuuuck I want this so bad.", "filename": "41sSjB4tLIS._AC_SY580_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 331, "h": 500, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669209475306241, "time": 1669209475, "md5": "my1ytgLCrI959XF1O/imJw==", "fsize": 25542, "resto": 117089}, {"no": 125981, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)08:19:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p125980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;125980</a>", "filename": "images (20)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 459, "h": 669, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669209564009362, "time": 1669209564, "md5": "NAcddt79DCHt1iBZIHUK8Q==", "fsize": 26609, "resto": 117089}], "last_modified": 1669209564}, {"no": 115936, "now": "09/12/22(Mon)22:51:20", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Ski Thread", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Midwest skiier, even the casual skis here are cut like ice skates for good reason</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to keystone for the weekend, go off a few &quot;cliffs&quot; with someone I knew from csgo who lives there</span><br>(also the secret is that all the good tree skiing is actually hidden on the frontside)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get used to western natural mountain snow</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go home</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go down my local cliff-like slope like I usually do for s&amp;g</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t catch an edge</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CAN&#039;T CATCH AN EDGE</span><br>keep in mind that while it&#039;s still a &quot;slope&quot; and has some &quot;hill&quot; sections, it&#039;s icy and mogulled and really more of a 300ft tall snow-based cliff...

Then it&#039;s fairly easy (easier said than done though). The key skills are the double leg takedown, the armbar and some ground control. You&#039;ll have to let him go at you first, just so you can learn his rythm. Then when he&#039;s throwing a one two, you drop on your knees to shoot the takedown and keep a hold of his leg until he is down. From now on, it&#039;s Khabib time, you can basically move on top and control his legs with a leg triangle (that shit Khabib does when he wraps his legs around his opponent&#039;s and lock it by putting an ankle behind his opposite knee). From now on you&#039;re on top of him: lay as much weight as possible on him, smash his face and when he&#039;s giving you an arm throw the armbar. Of course if you already know an other submission from top mount (Anaconda, Kimura, Armbar) you can also use it.<br><br>Now, maybe you&#039;re the smaller man? Ok, it&#039;s not gonna be as easy but it&#039;s doable. Against bigger opponents, double leg takedowns are harder to land, as is gaining in maintaining top control. So we&#039;re gonna have you go to a place where your opponent has no strength: his back. The key skills here will be moving from the clinch to the back, the broomstick takedown and the rear naked choke, otherwise known as RNC. So here&#039;s the plan: get to feel him a little bit at first. When you feel like you got him, slip on the side when he throws a straight punch (if he throws with his right, you move to you left) and catch him. Best is wrapping up your arms against his torso or abdomen. From there you will need to move as fast as possible to his back to avoid getting into a strength opposition with a bigger opponent. Basically when you get in, step with your inner leg (the one closer to him) behind his foot, keep a tight grip around him and pivot on your leg to get his back. Then you use a simple broomstick takedown to get him on the ground and then move to the RNC. He sleeps.

Every year, teams of five marbles compete in Qualifiers and the top 12 teams, along with 4 automatically qualified teams, advance to the main tournament. After an exquisite opening ceremony, the 16 teams perform in a series of events that are inspired by real-world Olympic events, earning medals and scoring points towards an overall total. The team with the most points at the end of the tournament is the team that wins the Marble League, standing at the top of the podium during the closing ceremony and having the honor of extinguishing the torch at the end of each year.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Channel Link</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY<wbr>JdpnjuSWVOLgGT9fIzL0g/videos<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Official Website</span><br>https://www.marble-sports.com<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fandom Wiki</span><br>https://jellesmarbleruns.fandom.com<wbr>/wiki/Marble_League_Wiki", "filename": "Es_2R8dXIAAbvhP", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1407, "h": 828, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 147, "tim": 1613748713222, "time": 1613748713, "md5": "yzLN/jWGrT2LX5isoBsdxQ==", "fsize": 138722, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "marble-marble-league-general", "replies": 312, "images": 29, "omitted_posts": 307, "omitted_images": 28, "last_replies": [{"no": 124314, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)01:32:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p124268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124268</a><br>This.<br>Also that Mandarinigger straight up rammed into Blue Eye, likely injuring him in the process, and yet wasn&#039;t DQed.

But since OP is European, I recommend a Canyon Roadlite.<br><br>now, OP, I know what your next question is, you&#039;re going to ask me if you should get one with a chain or belt drive. Belt drives are almost no maintenance so if you really don&#039;t want to deal with chain maintenance and wear, and you can afford the belt drive, then get that. However, it is from my experience that mechanical failures that happen when commuting are always tire punctures, never something in the drivetrain unless you&#039;re an /n/fag who is riding around on a 40 year old shitbike he pulled out of the trash that&#039;s been fixed up with garbage aliexpress components(yes, they really do this). I recommend going tubeless if there are a lot of tiny thorns in your area like there are in mine. Schwalbe Marathon tires come highly recommended for commuting since they&#039;ve been tested and perfected by the Germans. In the US, they&#039;re all you&#039;ll find on rideshare bikes because the companies don&#039;t want to waste money on replacing tires or having bikes out of commission with flats so they use them because they&#039;re indestructible.<br>Yes, I know you think you need a mountain bike and knobby tires because you&#039;ll be riding on baby dirt paths.
