Gracie paid the fine.[62]<br><br>Royce Gracie decided to dispute the allegations during an online video interview in May 2009, saying that his weight in the first UFC event was 178lb and claiming his weight during his Sakuraba fight was 180lb, thus only gaining 2 pounds.[63] This was widely disputed by experts. According to ESPN, &quot;In the former contest, he weighed in at 175 pounds; for Sakuraba, he was 188. One may not need to be nutritionist to observe that a muscle gain of 13 pounds in one year at the age of 40 is a strikingly accomplished feat. Athletes nearing the half-century mark are often happy to maintain functional mass, let alone pack it on&quot;.[64] <br><br><br>dude is a complete bitch made faggot just like the rest of his dogshit family", "time": 1670114977, "resto": 126061}, {"no": 128457, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)18:59:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p126061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;126061</a>", "filename": "Jon-Jones-mma-tetov\u00e1n\u00ed-1024x576", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 576, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670543996495066, "time": 1670543996, "md5": "JEQny52FzwcN1tmBg5km/g==", "fsize": 79771, "resto": 126061}], "last_modified": 1670543996}, {"no": 128141, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)09:39:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The average skater would beat the shit out of the average /heem/er", "filename": "0EFDE6D8-589C-4CBF-B227-0F8BD9017742", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1670337548799884, "time": 1670337548, "md5": "cBkSM+VMtA/CWcDI6umknA==", "fsize": 85343, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-average-skater-would-beat-the-shit-out-of-the", "replies": 7, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 2, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 128218, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:34:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128217</a><br>forgot pic", "filename": "Skateboard", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2165, "h": 2877, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670384067111887, "time": 1670384067, "md5": "xuOCsuDzIxycUj+F+QnIhQ==", "fsize": 1817350, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128422, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)13:17:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128203</a><br>lol, maybe 15 years ago old man.", "time": 1670523469, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128430, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)15:46:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128141</a><br>why skip the knee pads?", "filename": "esg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1330, "h": 693, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1670532385914912, "time": 1670532385, "md5": "FONXV6DoZjbpEKze/IrBeA==", "fsize": 43398, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128451, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)18:41:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128422</a><br>my bad *vape* smoker", "time": 1670542901, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128455, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)18:57:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128141</a><br>https://youtu.be/NnS1TvX8kgM", "filename": "5828191847", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 473, "h": 649, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670543825614686, "time": 1670543825, "md5": "XXf5zxnQvSD/RCsC2L8Dkw==", "fsize": 68069, "resto": 128141}], "last_modified": 1670543825}, {"no": 128182, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:20:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there any chance ground kicks be legal in UFC again?

You can use whatever stock tires come with the bike until they wear out and then replace them with Marathons if you want, just to save a little cash, but they will ultimately save you money in the long run. My friend buys cheap tires because he thinks it saves him cash, but he gets a flat every three months or so (~$7-10 each time, plus the time to do the changing, plus the inconvenience risk of discovering a flat in the morning), whereas I get a flat about every year and a half (and usually from something that no tire could possibly resist).<br><br>I am curious about belt drives though, what makes them a meme?
