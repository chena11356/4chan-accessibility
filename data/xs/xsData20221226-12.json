So far there has been very little online about them except for two very good NSMB articles. <br><br>I would say that they are probably the best brakes that I am going to use. I would say that stopping power similar to a code RSC, with a smoother lever feel. They definitely have more modulation than anything Shimano makes. The one issue with them is knowing that I will never be able to get pads for them in any bike shop. Getting pads for a 2 piston formula brake was already unreasonably difficult, but this is going to be the darksouls of finding brakepads. They have tons of modulation and the bite point is consistent every time. I have not taken these down any proper steep decents yet, but I would bet these would cook my rotors with ease. The speed-lock system is similar to any other hydraulic speed connection. Initially I thought they were an additional option but it seems they come standard. The fitting is no larger than the diameter of the hose and is made of steel. I believe that being able to use a magnet to guide your brake housing through your frame and then not have to bleed once you get it to the caliper makes these the easiest to install brakes on anything that has internal cable routing. And definitely a must have on any bike with headset cable routing.<br>The calipers are two piece and forged, while the levers are unidirectional, meaning that a front and rear in the european market will bolt right to your american bike and vice versa. When installing them for the first time you will most likely have to bleed them after you cut the hoses anyways.

But they tend to participate and have a decent win rate up until the last couple of elimination rounds. The final 2/4/8 in most large tournies all tend to be populated exclusively with men, but when you&#039;re down in the lower elims, women absolutely can and do beat &quot;normal&quot; fighters, and it&#039;s nothing particularly special about it.<br><br>When we did the last large Steel City Open pre-coof, we had a little over 150 participants in open longsword. Maybe 35 of them were women. If the memes were correct, there&#039;d be none left after the first round of elims, and definitely none left after the second.

Men will take 3 months of lessons and jump into an open tournament, knowing that they&#039;re likely to get smoked in round 1, and they&#039;re fine with that. Women don&#039;t have the same confidence, so they train a *lot* longer before they&#039;re willing to even try a tournament, which means that you end up with 2-3 year women competing, and winning, against &lt;1 year men. Once they start running into men of equivalent experience, their win rate drops dramatically, but the women don&#039;t get TOTALLY eliminated from tournaments until they face the top ~10% of men, who are good enough that they&#039;d eliminate any other men they fought against as well.</span>", "time": 1631566157, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68572, "now": "09/23/21(Thu)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Got humbled by a girl when I was a no stripe BJJ white belt<br>She was 3 stripes, fairly strong to be fair to her too.<br>Not coping but I didn&#039;t want to use strength on her so I let her creep up instead of just throwing her off me with strength, not that I was ever going to win mind you.", "time": 1632430993, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68611, "now": "09/23/21(Thu)23:14:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p63495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;63495</a><br>This lol, never lost to a girl even doing ju-jutsu (non-monkey) before puberty<br><br>The closest I&#039;ve ever gotten is beating a girl and ppl getting mad at it, and having trouble doing pushing hands against chicks because I don&#039;t want to grope their chests due to sperg level 1000", "time": 1632453262, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68612, "now": "09/23/21(Thu)23:56:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p64735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;64735</a><br>You heard wrong, I don&#039;t think a grill has ever won an open, or if they did it was in burgerland against a bunch of blowfish.<br><br>The other guy is right, though, the best of them can get up pretty high in the rankings.", "time": 1632455780, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68629, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)02:48:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;63214</span><br>Thanks for making my tourist trip to this board worth while.", "time": 1632466105, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68645, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)06:20:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p67076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;67076</a><br>Not in America, but in civilized countries there are actually a lot of them", "time": 1632478858, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68658, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)09:10:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p63188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;63188</a><br>In my old Muay Thai gym, if you came in to your first lesson with an attitude, they made you go against one of our female fighters (that I think won nationals later) to humble you <br>Pretty based if you ask me", "filename": "90F2632A-D5B4-4841-B8AE-88DE5B373AE0", "ext": ".png", "w": 200, "h": 184, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1632489045127, "time": 1632489045, "md5": "IzYeB2TsHM2R5vRuHMs8RQ==", "fsize": 27637, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68663, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)09:41:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p68658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;68658</a><br>Your gym is shit if a femoid can shit on a full grown man.

Once I turned 11, the competitions started to separate Men from Women, and the girls my age seemed to be at a lower level now. The only tournaments that weren&#039;t already splitting us up by gender were IBJJF, UAEJJF, and other more prestigious competitions. In the gym, I would only lose to higher belt adult women. There was this one girl who was my rank but a few years older who would kick my ass because of her pure strength. Despite my technique being better and my more impressive accolades, this Gabby Garcia looking-bitch would shit on me. Finally, my balls dropped, and I started hitting weights more seriously. I won IBJJF Pans and started pursuing BJJ almost full-time. The girls who beat me as a 10-year-old were no match against me. Overall, I stopped training with kids and most women at about 14 and started training with strictly grown men.

Then it&#039;s fairly easy (easier said than done though). The key skills are the double leg takedown, the armbar and some ground control. You&#039;ll have to let him go at you first, just so you can learn his rythm. Then when he&#039;s throwing a one two, you drop on your knees to shoot the takedown and keep a hold of his leg until he is down. From now on, it&#039;s Khabib time, you can basically move on top and control his legs with a leg triangle (that shit Khabib does when he wraps his legs around his opponent&#039;s and lock it by putting an ankle behind his opposite knee). From now on you&#039;re on top of him: lay as much weight as possible on him, smash his face and when he&#039;s giving you an arm throw the armbar. Of course if you already know an other submission from top mount (Anaconda, Kimura, Armbar) you can also use it.<br><br>Now, maybe you&#039;re the smaller man? Ok, it&#039;s not gonna be as easy but it&#039;s doable. Against bigger opponents, double leg takedowns are harder to land, as is gaining in maintaining top control. So we&#039;re gonna have you go to a place where your opponent has no strength: his back. The key skills here will be moving from the clinch to the back, the broomstick takedown and the rear naked choke, otherwise known as RNC. So here&#039;s the plan: get to feel him a little bit at first. When you feel like you got him, slip on the side when he throws a straight punch (if he throws with his right, you move to you left) and catch him. Best is wrapping up your arms against his torso or abdomen. From there you will need to move as fast as possible to his back to avoid getting into a strength opposition with a bigger opponent. Basically when you get in, step with your inner leg (the one closer to him) behind his foot, keep a tight grip around him and pivot on your leg to get his back. Then you use a simple broomstick takedown to get him on the ground and then move to the RNC. He sleeps.

The team with the most points at the end of the tournament is the team that wins the Marble League, standing at the top of the podium during the closing ceremony and having the honor of extinguishing the torch at the end of each year.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is Marbula One?</span><br>Marbula One is a marble racing tournament.

He kept saying things like &quot;thats right bitch, am I gonna make you nut?&quot; and &quot;fucking fag I bet you can&#039;t wait to bust in my fat hairy man ass hahaha faggot&quot;. I just ignored him and kept railing. He continued unironically calling me his bitch and a fag as he had several hands free prostate orgasms spilling seminal fluids onto the train tracks, getting more angry and dominant after each one. &quot;Yea i bet you like dudes. You look like a pussy&quot; he&#039;d say &quot;I cant even feel your limpdick bitch.&quot; I just kept clapping, wondering wtf is up with him. After about 20 minutes of railing Mike&#039;s boypussy, drenched in sweat and his cream, I finally got a nut off despite his constant berating and degrading comments. He immediately hopped off, laid flat on his back and bent his legs over his head so the cum dripped out of his asshole directly into his mouth. &quot;The fuck you looking at? You like this gay boy?&quot; He kept saying. After he got every last drop. He cackled like a rooster and punched me in the face as hard as he could. He nearly broke his hand, but I was fine. &quot;Fucking fag&quot; he said as he limped off into the sunset, shaking his wrist.

It&#039;s not an ironclad organisation like IKO, and has various associations with Shinkyokushin (WKO), KyokushinKan, the IFK, and the KWF etc. Senshi is their &quot;pro-karate&quot; organisation, it&#039;s mainly a kickboxing/K1 clone but it has multiple rulesets that allow for &quot;prokyokushin&quot; (kyokushin in a ring with rounds but still full gi no gloves etc) and despite being extremely low on the kickboxing ladder (nowhere near Glory, K1, Rizin, ONE, etc etc) it has managed to attract official appearances from every major K1 star, even those with no association with Kyokushin or karate.

The foil was, historically, the training weapon for the smallsword. It was common that it was practiced without fencing masks to protect your head which is why the rules of foil only allow touches to the body, though fencing masters like L\u2019abbot noted, to no one\u2019s surprise, that in a real duel you should just stab whatever is available. Moreover, while they were used in both France and Italy, smallsword took a significant precedence in France compared to Italy. Italy still often used sabers to settle their duels, seeing significant resurgence during the fascist era. France on the other hand loved their small swords so much that their saber mabuals were often \u201csmallsword technique applied to saber\u201d. The spadroon, on the other hand, was a compromise weapon. It usually had a guard similar to a<br>Smallsword but also and edged blade. Whether this was good or bad depends on who you ask. During the same time period though there was also a trend of smallsword blades being attached to saber grips though since foil was such a popular military exercise many officers felt more comfortable fighting with a smallsword blade than a saber blade. Personally I think this configuration is dumb though since the saber grip is designed to facilitate cutting which the smallsword cannot do, but many people fought with these anyways.<br><br>I have no real point to end this post on.

Modern fencing is a sport through and through now. If you want to study smallsword as more of a martial pursuit, maybe some classical schools still exist, I know Nadi and other proeminent fencers still tried to kept some lineages of old form of fencing, but the old sources of the 18th and 19th centuries still have lots to say.

It was part of a new training methodology that focused on thrusting the chest and the upper chest, using... foils and a fencing jacket. That&#039;s one of the reason why smallsword fencing was so lethal. In &quot;Croiser le Fer&quot; (really great book if you read french), they noticed that about 75% of given blows were thrusts to the upper chest, you can imagine how bad they were to treat in 18th century France...<br><br><a href=\"#p123651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123651</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;L\u2019abbot</span><br>You freakin&#039; roastbeefs are driving me crazy, it&#039;s Labat...", "time": 1667639195, "resto": 117089}, {"no": 124191, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)19:55:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123468</a><br>People who like smallswords just do Olympic fencing.

Using existing manuscripts from the Nuremberg Group as his reference, his workshop produced the extensive \u039f\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 sive Armorvm Tractandorvm Meditatio Alberti Dvreri (&quot;Weapon Training, or Albrecht D\u00fcrer&#039;s Meditation on the Handling of Weapons&quot;, MS 26-232). Another manuscript based on the Nuremberg texts as well as one of Hans Talhoffer&#039;s works, the untitled Berlin Picture Book (Libr.Pict.A.83), is also thought to have originated in his workshop around this time.

In my opinion fencing has some of the easiest fundamentals to pick up of any martial art, which to me are: advance, retreat, lunge, recover, jump back, parry, riposte, disengage. You can learn all that in a week or two at a basic level and then spend the entire rest of your life getting &quot;good&quot; at fencing, depending on what you mean by &quot;good.&quot; I don&#039;t think your genetics matter at all except maybe at the absolute highest levels but your general athleticism will make a huge difference. Personally I&#039;m very footwork focused - I think having a good lunge is probably the single most important thing that improves your fencing - imagine suddenly driving off your rear leg and taking one giant leap/step forward - faster you can do that and the more ground you cover the better your lunge is and it&#039;s going to be tough if you&#039;re super unathletic or out of shape.<br>It&#039;s fun though!

People who are not comfortable skiing, or who are on terrain beyond their abilities, tend to ski very backset which means having less control. Skiing aggressively and weight forward can be intimidating at first, but it will make you a better skier and once you get used to skiing that way it will be comfortable. Practice on terrain you are comfortable with then try skiing more aggressively on harder terrain.<br>Keep your skis parallel pretty much all the time, and when you want to turn, use your weight and edges. Don&#039;t try to steer or point your skis where you want to go. If you want to turn left, tilt skis onto left edges and put most of your weight on your right foot.

It&#039;s not clear whether he spars anyone beyond his students either, but he does have pretty cool sparring footage, so it&#039;s at least somewhat practical.

I just know what I&#039;ve learned and what I&#039;ve seen second hand. My school is a wudang school, but Sifu was an instructor through Chin Woo as well. My Sifu&#039;s Sifu was the late Lu Zijian. While Sifu studied under other masters in China in the 70s and 80s, most of the instructors he studied under were from wudang mountain, shan dong region, or hong kong. I got a few turtle forms and some of my fellow students have some as well. I was told it works well against chicken, duck, crab, and rat since they all attack the tops of the feet. There are also turtle techniques specifically geared towards eagle techniques that remind me a lot of ground kung fu you see in snake. My Sifu passed away in January of this year at the ripe old age of 67 because of a sudden illness. I wish I could ask him where the he learned the system that my few forms are from, but I can&#039;t. All I know is the two systems of turtle I learned were Little Green Turtle and Blue Turtle. The guy asked a question about mid tier styles that &quot;may work&quot;. In my opinion compared to other styles I know, and how turtle applications match up against them, it&#039;s mid. But some niche applications have their place. My Sifu would only go into how he learned the form if it had an interesting story or a specific application he really liked.

Commander named Marshall, who kept a martial artist around him who was a Western boxing champion by the name of Tom John. In the past, every Chinese Nationalist military division had their own martial arts instructors, with the pay getting better as one rose up the ranks, up to 200 silver dollars. At that time, (John) would summon one of these Chinese instructors to spar with daily, knocking their teeth out or rendering them unconscious. He laughed, &quot;So this is the extent of your Chinese Kung Fu!&quot; Feng Yuxiang had a bodyguard by the name of Li Weihan, who didn&#039;t stand for this, and decided to fight him for good. They fought four rounds, until (John) broke his jaw with a punch, causing it to swell up.&#039; </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Journalist: &#039;His bodyguard?&#039;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lu Zijian: &#039;Yes.&#039; (unintelligible)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;Reluctantly, Feng Yuxiang summoned me, and told me, &quot;Brother, you take care of him for us.&quot; I said, &quot;That&#039;s our guest, it matters not whether we live or die. As entertainment, for fun, as martial exchange,&quot; I said, &quot;I want to sign a waiver, I won&#039;t be held responsible if he dies.&quot; Marshall upon hearing this said, &quot;You, Lu Zijian, fighting my bodyguard?&quot; I was around 170 cm in my youth, and he was around 190 cm, his arms were thicker than my calves. Tom thought: &quot;You&#039;re a martial arts instructor, I was just thinking of sparring with you!&quot; and signed the waiver promptly. I gave Marshall my signed waiver and we went to the peak of Nanshan, in Chongqing, for our match.&#039; </span><br><br>(cont.)", "filename": "wouldthisfacelietoyou", "ext": ".png", "w": 230, "h": 315, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1666606769544755, "time": 1666606769, "md5": "yGPm0ryjrhryURGw/ZW0mQ==", "fsize": 105076, "resto": 104352}, {"no": 122084, "now": "10/24/22(Mon)06:37:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p122036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122036</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;We fought for an hour without a victor emerging; he did have some skill after all.

Yang Chengfu&#039;s teachers taught in military academies, while Chengfu taught the public more broadly and simplified the form. That isn&#039;t to say he disregarded the martial side, as Beijing was apparently a hotspot for tough fighters at that time, though his simplification did make it more accessible to people, and he did make it a bit softer. Then Cheng Man Ching came along and simplified it even more. In his lineage some people focus on fighting e.g. Mario Napoli, but there is a special appeal to those more focused on the philosophical, spiritual, and meditative aspects of the art. Visualization, softness, and slowness are integral components of that and are attractive to those who are not interested in fighting application at all; the fighting application is treated as a kind of cool trick or goodie, or a way to highlight what are apparently flawed ways of thinking or fighting.<br><br>As for the Chen Village line, because of the political situation in China during the 40s, Taiji practically died in the village - while people like Chen Fake were teaching in Beijing and his son Chen Zhaokui was on the way. In the 50s and 60s villagers like Chen Xiaowang learned what&#039;s called &quot;Laojia&quot;, but the emphasis was on choreography for the sake of maintaining the art to at least a minimal degree, not application. It wasn&#039;t until Chen Zhaokui came to teach later (what the villagers called &quot;Xinjia&quot;) that the villagers had learned more about application as well as new body mechanics. <br><br>Basically this is to say that knowledge of application depends a lot on who taught and why, who learned and why, as well as what was happening.

I got into BMX and skateboarding around the same time, 2010 ish when I was 12. BMX was thriving at the time, kids were crazy for Aaron Ross shit, skateparks were full of bikes, it dwindled fast over a few years. Skateboarding had a resurgence thanks to Tumblr in my opinion somewhere around the early 2010s, and as BMX has become more dead, skateboarding has won out because it&#039;s &#039;cooler&#039; and the clothing is far trendier than a BMX rider. Skateboards are also less cumbersome and you can just carry it, skate around and do other shit all day.

Then start conditioning your hands, start this by wrapping your hands and hitting the bag (dont go for the heaviest hardest one in the gym, if you can. If you don&#039;t have any other option, you need to gauge the power even more than with a softer bag).<br><br>Start punching, from lighter punches to harder punches until you develop a feeling of what is too light and whats too hard. Don&#039;t forget to, at the same time, punch with clean technique. That way we&#039;re killing two bird with one punch.<br><br>Dont punch until you feel like your hand will fall off. You need less than you think, at least when starting conditioning your fists. I&#039;d say 3 rounds of 2 minutes each. <br><br>If you feel like you can do more, please wait until the next days and observe how your knuckles feel. Even if you feel the slightest amount of discomfort/pain/tingle, it means your bones are healing. Dont go at it again, wait until those are practically gone. Then again, with wraps, at the bag.<br><br>Of course, you can box while they heal, that&#039;s why you train with boxing gloves.<br><br>You can do knuckle push ups, they are great accessory exercises, but nothing compares to hitting the bag without gloves.<br><br>Once you feel strong enough, you can start hitting the bag without wraps.<br><br>Extra advice:<br>Please, this should already be ingrained in your brain, but without gloves it&#039;s even more important: Hit your target with your fist closed as hard as you can. If you don&#039;t, your wrist is limp, that means you will hurt your wrist. This is specially true when hitting hooks and uppercuts, because your fist strikes the bag in a weird angle.<br>Some trainers don&#039;t want you to hit the bag withotu gloves, which is understandable. Hitting the bag without gloves put a lot of strain on them, eventually ripping the material. Time to buy your own bag, or ask if they have an old one laying around to hit or even buy.

First you find your temporary nock point on the string. Bow squares are extremely handy for this and I recommend you buy one (they&#039;re cheap). Starting nock point is going to be right on center with the square just barely touching your arrow rest or a teensy bit upwards from that (no more than 1/4&quot;). Tie on temporary nock point but don&#039;t put any glue on it or melt it too much. This can easily be cut off for adjustment later if desired.

Admittedly, BD probably deserved more control points, but idk I guess the judges give more weight to drive damage than wedge damage? Which is dumb imo. MC was able overcome the drive damage with good skill, always staying aggressive and never really becoming vulnerable. Whereas BD&#039;s missing wedges opened it up for at least one good hit late in the fight.

If what you are referring to is the HEMA approach of looking at manuals and trying to reconstruct it: there is going to be some difficulty. As previously mentioned, the manuals were written later on, and during the Tokugawa peace period. During this time, there were schools of Kenjutsu that sprouted up with shaky claims of legitimacy. These schools taught kata that was not pressure tested either with sparring or through combat, and were backed with esoteric doctrine. These schools were referred to as &quot;kaho-kenpo&quot;, or &quot;flowery swordsmanship&quot; because of their romanticized view of the sword.<br><br>There&#039;s been enough time in japanese sword martial arts for the bullshit to be weeded out. One of the driving factors of this was the introduction of gekken, or sparring with armor and bamboo swords. A lot of the Kenjutsu schools adopted this method of training and this eventually became Kendo.

One: what you are actually trying to do (A simulation of an actual fight, or a compitition), and subsequently two: how you go about doing it. If you make rules so as to better illustrate combat in a safe way, you inevitably get people playing towards the rules rather than what they are attempting to simulate. But paradoxically, you need rules and an actual competitive situation to pressure test and actually create a simulation rather than route memorization. And then eventually what you try to do at its very center drifts from a simulation to a competition, which is nebulous (The letter of the law taking precedence from the spirit). Then you start changing the rules towards this nebulous vague idea of competition which is then informed by people playing to those very rules and creating a different stipulations (which might not actually even elevate itself in terms of fun/engagement, just effectiveness letter of the law style)<br><br>Like, in Olympic fencing, having a bendy wippy point it good to actually bend around and hit your opponent at weird angles, but thats not illustrative at all of an effective sword thrust. Then more blades actually developed to be even MORE wippy as the bendiness that was allowed by the rules influenced the idea which then compounded back to effect the rules. Doesn&#039;t even necessarily make it more engaging, its just an edifice of circumstantial development of playing to the rules.

Gracie paid the fine.[62]<br><br>Royce Gracie decided to dispute the allegations during an online video interview in May 2009, saying that his weight in the first UFC event was 178lb and claiming his weight during his Sakuraba fight was 180lb, thus only gaining 2 pounds.[63] This was widely disputed by experts. According to ESPN, &quot;In the former contest, he weighed in at 175 pounds; for Sakuraba, he was 188. One may not need to be nutritionist to observe that a muscle gain of 13 pounds in one year at the age of 40 is a strikingly accomplished feat. Athletes nearing the half-century mark are often happy to maintain functional mass, let alone pack it on&quot;.[64] <br><br><br>dude is a complete bitch made faggot just like the rest of his dogshit family", "time": 1670114977, "resto": 126061}, {"no": 128457, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)18:59:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p126061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;126061</a>", "filename": "Jon-Jones-mma-tetov\u00e1n\u00ed-1024x576", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 576, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670543996495066, "time": 1670543996, "md5": "JEQny52FzwcN1tmBg5km/g==", "fsize": 79771, "resto": 126061}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 128141, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)09:39:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The average skater would beat the shit out of the average /heem/er", "filename": "0EFDE6D8-589C-4CBF-B227-0F8BD9017742", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1670337548799884, "time": 1670337548, "md5": "cBkSM+VMtA/CWcDI6umknA==", "fsize": 85343, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-average-skater-would-beat-the-shit-out-of-the", "replies": 7, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 128203, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:41:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128141</a><br>The average skater is a 17 year old cig smoker from the suburbs", "time": 1670373683, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128217, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:33:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128141</a><br>This is how I watch UFC cards at my desk.", "time": 1670384003, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128218, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:34:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128217</a><br>forgot pic", "filename": "Skateboard", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2165, "h": 2877, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670384067111887, "time": 1670384067, "md5": "xuOCsuDzIxycUj+F+QnIhQ==", "fsize": 1817350, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128422, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)13:17:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128203</a><br>lol, maybe 15 years ago old man.", "time": 1670523469, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128430, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)15:46:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128141</a><br>why skip the knee pads?", "filename": "esg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1330, "h": 693, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1670532385914912, "time": 1670532385, "md5": "FONXV6DoZjbpEKze/IrBeA==", "fsize": 43398, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128451, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)18:41:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128422</a><br>my bad *vape* smoker", "time": 1670542901, "resto": 128141}, {"no": 128455, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)18:57:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p128141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;128141</a><br>https://youtu.be/NnS1TvX8kgM", "filename": "5828191847", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 473, "h": 649, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670543825614686, "time": 1670543825, "md5": "XXf5zxnQvSD/RCsC2L8Dkw==", "fsize": 68069, "resto": 128141}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 128182, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:20:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there any chance ground kicks be legal in UFC again?

You know how to defend yourself against someone trying to rain down strikes on you while grappling on the ground to secure a submission, you&#039;re already a league ahead in the survival game.

I think as a judoka, you could try as many &quot;climbing&quot; exercises as possible, and yourself be the best judge of whether it&#039;s a movement or exercise you think translates into strength for judo techniques.", "time": 1667236692, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123089, "now": "10/31/22(Mon)13:28:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123086</a><br>Can skip to 25:00 on the first vid, it&#039;s just wall climbing until then.", "time": 1667237315, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123094, "now": "10/31/22(Mon)13:48:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I saw one youtube video, think it may have been Lattice Training, but it described an exercise for explosive pullups and chinups where you should do just two or three, but get up as quickly and explosively as possible, using as much strength you can in as few pulls as possible.", "time": 1667238500, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123168, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)00:43:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p122784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122784</a><br>It&#039;s probably technique but 10 seconds on a 15mm edge is about what someone that climbs around V7 is typically at", "time": 1667277816, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123176, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)03:30:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p122784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122784</a><br>Same question but how do I escape V4 hell?", "time": 1667287831, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123179, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)04:25:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Should I hangboard at the beginning or end of my bouldering sessions?", "time": 1667291154, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123182, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)05:34:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179</a><br>Yes", "time": 1667295254, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123189, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)08:05:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123176</a><br>enter V5 hell", "time": 1667304329, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123197, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)10:26:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123176</a><br>do some pull ups", "time": 1667312776, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123198, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)10:45:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123176</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how do I escape V4 hell?</span><br>adopt the font grading system<br>V grades are far too broad from V0 to V6 makes progression feel impossible", "time": 1667313905, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123199, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)11:05:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123094</a><br>i think sports science has pretty much settled that this &quot;explosive&quot; tagged shit from crossfit is all stupid dogshit<br>there are predefined methods to increase power and responsiveness of muscles, and that is with a strictly regimented weights routine<br>instead of doing 2-3 pullups as quickly as possible, you should load 90lbs on your body and do 3 instead.", "time": 1667315102, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123203, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)12:12:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;123202</span><br>tree trunks are not synonymous with strength training<br>the best way to build &quot;explosive strength&quot; is to simply develop the muscle through traditional strength training<br>https://coachesinsider.com/track-x-<wbr>country/the-high-jumper-strength-an<wbr>d-conditioning/<br>and wow look at it, yes it turns out athletes do strength training and not just arbitrary &quot;do 3 pull ups really quick like&quot;", "time": 1667319121, "resto": 122759}, {"no": 123214, "now": "11/01/22(Tue)16:22:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123199</a><br><a href=\"#p123203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123203</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bro just get better at sprinting by...by running at a constant, slow pace with 90lbs strapped to you!
