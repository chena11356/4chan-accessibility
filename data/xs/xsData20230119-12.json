The foil was, historically, the training weapon for the smallsword. It was common that it was practiced without fencing masks to protect your head which is why the rules of foil only allow touches to the body, though fencing masters like L\u2019abbot noted, to no one\u2019s surprise, that in a real duel you should just stab whatever is available. Moreover, while they were used in both France and Italy, smallsword took a significant precedence in France compared to Italy. Italy still often used sabers to settle their duels, seeing significant resurgence during the fascist era. France on the other hand loved their small swords so much that their saber mabuals were often \u201csmallsword technique applied to saber\u201d. The spadroon, on the other hand, was a compromise weapon. It usually had a guard similar to a<br>Smallsword but also and edged blade. Whether this was good or bad depends on who you ask. During the same time period though there was also a trend of smallsword blades being attached to saber grips though since foil was such a popular military exercise many officers felt more comfortable fighting with a smallsword blade than a saber blade. Personally I think this configuration is dumb though since the saber grip is designed to facilitate cutting which the smallsword cannot do, but many people fought with these anyways.<br><br>I have no real point to end this post on.

Modern fencing is a sport through and through now. If you want to study smallsword as more of a martial pursuit, maybe some classical schools still exist, I know Nadi and other proeminent fencers still tried to kept some lineages of old form of fencing, but the old sources of the 18th and 19th centuries still have lots to say.

It was part of a new training methodology that focused on thrusting the chest and the upper chest, using... foils and a fencing jacket. That&#039;s one of the reason why smallsword fencing was so lethal. In &quot;Croiser le Fer&quot; (really great book if you read french), they noticed that about 75% of given blows were thrusts to the upper chest, you can imagine how bad they were to treat in 18th century France...<br><br><a href=\"#p123651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123651</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;L\u2019abbot</span><br>You freakin&#039; roastbeefs are driving me crazy, it&#039;s Labat...", "time": 1667639195, "resto": 117089}, {"no": 124191, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)19:55:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p123468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123468</a><br>People who like smallswords just do Olympic fencing.

These sketches and watercolors show the same careful attention to detail and human proportion as D\u00fcrer&#039;s other work, and his illustrations of grappling, long sword, dagger, and messer are among the highest-quality in any fencing manual.</span><br><br>Fuuuck I want this so bad.", "filename": "41sSjB4tLIS._AC_SY580_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 331, "h": 500, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669209475306241, "time": 1669209475, "md5": "my1ytgLCrI959XF1O/imJw==", "fsize": 25542, "resto": 117089}, {"no": 125981, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)08:19:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p125980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;125980</a>", "filename": "images (20)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 459, "h": 669, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669209564009362, "time": 1669209564, "md5": "NAcddt79DCHt1iBZIHUK8Q==", "fsize": 26609, "resto": 117089}, {"no": 127292, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)00:29:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p117098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117098</a><br>What is the best weapon category, abs why is it saber?", "filename": "FA90E046-FF75-4FD8-BC8F-8849194191C6", "ext": ".png", "w": 302, "h": 167, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1669872589128197, "time": 1669872589, "md5": "1XGLxV6Wz6k4Ejz+nXW/rg==", "fsize": 114155, "resto": 117089}, {"no": 127584, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)19:17:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p122477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122477</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Local HEMA group is pretty cool</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are also good at the sport</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fully cucked</span><br>They&#039;re still cool, and plenty of fun to hang out with, but man I just wished they didn&#039;t drink the cool-aid, luckily there&#039;s only one or two troons, but I don&#039;t often seen them.", "time": 1670026641, "resto": 117089}, {"no": 127849, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)19:51:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What do you guys know about Fabris&#039; style of rapier (and other arms)?

In my opinion fencing has some of the easiest fundamentals to pick up of any martial art, which to me are: advance, retreat, lunge, recover, jump back, parry, riposte, disengage. You can learn all that in a week or two at a basic level and then spend the entire rest of your life getting &quot;good&quot; at fencing, depending on what you mean by &quot;good.&quot; I don&#039;t think your genetics matter at all except maybe at the absolute highest levels but your general athleticism will make a huge difference. Personally I&#039;m very footwork focused - I think having a good lunge is probably the single most important thing that improves your fencing - imagine suddenly driving off your rear leg and taking one giant leap/step forward - faster you can do that and the more ground you cover the better your lunge is and it&#039;s going to be tough if you&#039;re super unathletic or out of shape.<br>It&#039;s fun though!

The philosophy of modern Kendo is based off of Budo concepts and aims to develop the self through practice. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What are the rules of Kendo?</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb1<wbr>3DKpDd_k<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Am I too old to practice Kendo?</span><br>No. Westerns start later and many people practice Kendo until they\u2019re dead.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm3<wbr>CmNE72Bw<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is Kendo a martial art or a sport?</span><br>Yes.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Where can I find a Kendo/Iaido club or dojo?</span><br>https://www.kendo-fik.org/organizat<wbr>ion/affiliate<br><br>Start with the International Kendo Federation (FIK) and navigate to your country or region.

If what you are referring to is the HEMA approach of looking at manuals and trying to reconstruct it: there is going to be some difficulty. As previously mentioned, the manuals were written later on, and during the Tokugawa peace period. During this time, there were schools of Kenjutsu that sprouted up with shaky claims of legitimacy. These schools taught kata that was not pressure tested either with sparring or through combat, and were backed with esoteric doctrine. These schools were referred to as &quot;kaho-kenpo&quot;, or &quot;flowery swordsmanship&quot; because of their romanticized view of the sword.<br><br>There&#039;s been enough time in japanese sword martial arts for the bullshit to be weeded out. One of the driving factors of this was the introduction of gekken, or sparring with armor and bamboo swords. A lot of the Kenjutsu schools adopted this method of training and this eventually became Kendo. Some schools refused to adopt this method of training due to legitimate reasons (tradition, preserving the nuance in various kata, etc) which remain to this day as practiced lineages.

One: what you are actually trying to do (A simulation of an actual fight, or a compitition), and subsequently two: how you go about doing it. If you make rules so as to better illustrate combat in a safe way, you inevitably get people playing towards the rules rather than what they are attempting to simulate. But paradoxically, you need rules and an actual competitive situation to pressure test and actually create a simulation rather than route memorization. And then eventually what you try to do at its very center drifts from a simulation to a competition, which is nebulous (The letter of the law taking precedence from the spirit). Then you start changing the rules towards this nebulous vague idea of competition which is then informed by people playing to those very rules and creating a different stipulations (which might not actually even elevate itself in terms of fun/engagement, just effectiveness letter of the law style)<br><br>Like, in Olympic fencing, having a bendy wippy point it good to actually bend around and hit your opponent at weird angles, but thats not illustrative at all of an effective sword thrust.

Doesn&#039;t even necessarily make it more engaging, its just an edifice of circumstantial development of playing to the rules.

It was only relatively recently that the term &quot;Budo&quot; was reintroduced to describe Kendo and the other systematized martial arts from Japan. The term was originally used back at the turn of the century in 1900, but due to its ties to Bushido and militaristic ties to wartime Japan, it was temporarily set aside while a more sporting attitude sprouted up.

First you find your temporary nock point on the string. Bow squares are extremely handy for this and I recommend you buy one (they&#039;re cheap). Starting nock point is going to be right on center with the square just barely touching your arrow rest or a teensy bit upwards from that (no more than 1/4&quot;). Tie on temporary nock point but don&#039;t put any glue on it or melt it too much. This can easily be cut off for adjustment later if desired.

But they tend to participate and have a decent win rate up until the last couple of elimination rounds. The final 2/4/8 in most large tournies all tend to be populated exclusively with men, but when you&#039;re down in the lower elims, women absolutely can and do beat &quot;normal&quot; fighters, and it&#039;s nothing particularly special about it.<br><br>When we did the last large Steel City Open pre-coof, we had a little over 150 participants in open longsword.

Women don&#039;t have the same confidence, so they train a *lot* longer before they&#039;re willing to even try a tournament, which means that you end up with 2-3 year women competing, and winning, against &lt;1 year men. Once they start running into men of equivalent experience, their win rate drops dramatically, but the women don&#039;t get TOTALLY eliminated from tournaments until they face the top ~10% of men, who are good enough that they&#039;d eliminate any other men they fought against as well.</span>", "time": 1631566157, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68572, "now": "09/23/21(Thu)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Got humbled by a girl when I was a no stripe BJJ white belt<br>She was 3 stripes, fairly strong to be fair to her too.<br>Not coping but I didn&#039;t want to use strength on her so I let her creep up instead of just throwing her off me with strength, not that I was ever going to win mind you.", "time": 1632430993, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68611, "now": "09/23/21(Thu)23:14:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p63495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;63495</a><br>This lol, never lost to a girl even doing ju-jutsu (non-monkey) before puberty<br><br>The closest I&#039;ve ever gotten is beating a girl and ppl getting mad at it, and having trouble doing pushing hands against chicks because I don&#039;t want to grope their chests due to sperg level 1000", "time": 1632453262, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68612, "now": "09/23/21(Thu)23:56:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p64735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;64735</a><br>You heard wrong, I don&#039;t think a grill has ever won an open, or if they did it was in burgerland against a bunch of blowfish.<br><br>The other guy is right, though, the best of them can get up pretty high in the rankings.", "time": 1632455780, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68629, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)02:48:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;63214</span><br>Thanks for making my tourist trip to this board worth while.", "time": 1632466105, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68645, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)06:20:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p67076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;67076</a><br>Not in America, but in civilized countries there are actually a lot of them", "time": 1632478858, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68658, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)09:10:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p63188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;63188</a><br>In my old Muay Thai gym, if you came in to your first lesson with an attitude, they made you go against one of our female fighters (that I think won nationals later) to humble you <br>Pretty based if you ask me", "filename": "90F2632A-D5B4-4841-B8AE-88DE5B373AE0", "ext": ".png", "w": 200, "h": 184, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1632489045127, "time": 1632489045, "md5": "IzYeB2TsHM2R5vRuHMs8RQ==", "fsize": 27637, "resto": 63188}, {"no": 68663, "now": "09/24/21(Fri)09:41:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p68658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;68658</a><br>Your gym is shit if a femoid can shit on a full grown man.

I believe that it was an ego-based thing to go 100% and kick their ass. My team at the time was also extremely conservative and would bully the shit out of me if I lost to a chick. Once I turned 11, the competitions started to separate Men from Women, and the girls my age seemed to be at a lower level now. The only tournaments that weren&#039;t already splitting us up by gender were IBJJF, UAEJJF, and other more prestigious competitions. In the gym, I would only lose to higher belt adult women. There was this one girl who was my rank but a few years older who would kick my ass because of her pure strength. Despite my technique being better and my more impressive accolades, this Gabby Garcia looking-bitch would shit on me. Finally, my balls dropped, and I started hitting weights more seriously. I won IBJJF Pans and started pursuing BJJ almost full-time. The girls who beat me as a 10-year-old were no match against me. Overall, I stopped training with kids and most women at about 14 and started training with strictly grown men.

People who are not comfortable skiing, or who are on terrain beyond their abilities, tend to ski very backset which means having less control. Skiing aggressively and weight forward can be intimidating at first, but it will make you a better skier and once you get used to skiing that way it will be comfortable. Practice on terrain you are comfortable with then try skiing more aggressively on harder terrain.<br>Keep your skis parallel pretty much all the time, and when you want to turn, use your weight and edges. Don&#039;t try to steer or point your skis where you want to go. If you want to turn left, tilt skis onto left edges and put most of your weight on your right foot.

It&#039;s not an ironclad organisation like IKO, and has various associations with Shinkyokushin (WKO), KyokushinKan, the IFK, and the KWF etc. Senshi is their &quot;pro-karate&quot; organisation, it&#039;s mainly a kickboxing/K1 clone but it has multiple rulesets that allow for &quot;prokyokushin&quot; (kyokushin in a ring with rounds but still full gi no gloves etc) and despite being extremely low on the kickboxing ladder (nowhere near Glory, K1, Rizin, ONE, etc etc) it has managed to attract official appearances from every major K1 star, even those with no association with Kyokushin or karate.

Secondly, they&#039;re also testing your determination, your ability to endure constant punishment, as opposed to just getting knocked out by one lucky punch. Of course there are lucky kicks and head kick KOs are quite frequent but the idea is that there is a much higher level of control and skill that goes into a head kick KO, a body blow KO, and a low kick KO than punches to the head.

He&#039;s honestly a retard desu and just believes in walking forwards and tanking hits without delivering any real techniques. However, (here it comes, the caveat etc) Karate Combat has a very unfavorable ruleset for Kyokushin, no low kicks, no striking in the clinch (I believe) means that anyone seriously good at Kyokushin would have to train completely differently to do well on KC, and since Kyokushin is so big (it&#039;s probably the biggest style of karate, there are tournaments and dojos everywhere, of various qualities, there&#039;s a lot of bullshit kyokushin of course) there&#039;s not that much incentive for a Russian or Japanese or Brazilian Kyokushin competitor to enter karate combat if they want that full contact experience, it&#039;s easier for them to enter kickboxing/MT than something specific like KC.

My suggestion to him is also based on him saying that he wants to get into off-piste, drops (which I take to mean cliffs), steep (which I take to mean very steep off-piste terrain).

Skateboarding is infintely more difficult and complex than roller blading in every conceivable way. Give a 6 year old 2 hours and he&#039;ll grind down a rail on blades. It&#039;d take a week or two to learn how to Ollie. Even longer to start hitting rails or doing flip tricks. There are probably like 100 tricks you can learn on a skateboard whereas on blades you... like... grab your heel? Grind cross legged?

I never got much love coming from a poor family living on the outskirts of a big city but sure got lots of hate, anger, and spite. Some might say it&#039;s because of that.

I won&#039;t go into details but I come from a very violent area where getting beat up to a pulp was a frequency since I was 13 (because of my height, width, and constantly beat up face people thought I was older and never cared to ask before beating lol). Dealing with 3 drunk guys in their early 20s wasn&#039;t really that challenging but it sure was dirty. Never done any martial arts, everything I know about fighting comes from getting beat up by many different people, some of them having experience in boxing, muay thai I think if that&#039;s the leg one (or it&#039;s kickboxing I don&#039;t really know). The point is that sand, rocks to the face, spitting in the eyes, poking, and using everything around was the general way I didn&#039;t wake up in a hospital. Neither did any of them, since they got each other up and ran off the moment one of them started bleeding (bashed his face into a pole). One of them was limping and the other vomited a lot after I hit his stomach several times but otherwise no severe injuries. I got a nosebleed and my hands and one elbow are kind of messed up but it&#039;s ok (didn&#039;t secure the protection properly on that side). The girl cried a little bit, then thanked me, told me they were following her in the club, and then out. We agreed that calling a taxi is a better option than saving money via public transport and she went home. The point is - I felt. After all, if it was over I felt.

So far there has been very little online about them except for two very good NSMB articles. <br><br>I would say that they are probably the best brakes that I am going to use. I would say that stopping power similar to a code RSC, with a smoother lever feel. They definitely have more modulation than anything Shimano makes. The one issue with them is knowing that I will never be able to get pads for them in any bike shop. Getting pads for a 2 piston formula brake was already unreasonably difficult, but this is going to be the darksouls of finding brakepads. They have tons of modulation and the bite point is consistent every time. I have not taken these down any proper steep decents yet, but I would bet these would cook my rotors with ease. The speed-lock system is similar to any other hydraulic speed connection. Initially I thought they were an additional option but it seems they come standard. The fitting is no larger than the diameter of the hose and is made of steel. I believe that being able to use a magnet to guide your brake housing through your frame and then not have to bleed once you get it to the caliper makes these the easiest to install brakes on anything that has internal cable routing. And definitely a must have on any bike with headset cable routing.<br>The calipers are two piece and forged, while the levers are unidirectional, meaning that a front and rear in the european market will bolt right to your american bike and vice versa. When installing them for the first time you will most likely have to bleed them after you cut the hoses anyways.

The real deal breakers for me are the bleed screw is incredibly easy to strip because they made it out of a &quot;&quot;&quot;composite&quot;&quot;&quot; to shave weight, they include a tiny torque wrench just so you don&#039;t strip it. They&#039;re all easy to strip, but the MT7s are easier to strip. They have a pain in the ass bleeding process so they have to be bled like 3 times to really get the spongy feeling out.

And Shimano brakes use servo wave to vary their leverage ratio meaning that their power delivery is not linear and their performance is an average of their max leverage ratio and actual leverage ratio with the average being weighted more on a stronger pull of the lever (eg Shimano have a higher leverage ratio and less &quot;modulation&quot; in their beginning stroke)This chart does not take brake rotor and pad material into account.

All wheels have this and use it, but for tubeless tires, it has to be a different material that is air tight and liquid tight, I just use gorilla tape for my mtb wheels and a special tubeless tape on my other wheels. This is because when you go tubeless, you have a sealant inside the tires that plugs up any punctures that may happen. If you have regular cloth rim tape, it won&#039;t hold the air or the sealant in place.<br>Most tires now are tubeless compatible since it&#039;s the industry standard. I haven&#039;t done any research on your tires, but you may have to get new tubeless compatible tires.

For a really bad puncture that won&#039;t seal with either, you just stick a tube into it. I&#039;ve seen some really stupid takes on facebook where people refuse to go tubeless and think running tubes is better because if you get a really bad puncture with tubeless, you still have to stick a tube into it, but it doesn&#039;t cross their minds that if you run tubes, you have to replace the tube for any puncture no matter the size", "time": 1672945324, "resto": 125052}, {"no": 131591, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)14:12:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "holy fuck, Michelin Wild Enduro tires are finally in stock in the US at worldwide cyclery.

With tubeless, you can run lower pressures for more grip and comfort, but you can still have them at 30-40 psi with no issues.

There aren&#039;t sharp rocks or debris on groomed tracks and parks, and really hard impacts from a hard landing can burp a tubeless tire(burping is when the pressure gets too great and some air is released from the tire) with the pressure too high so BMX and DJ riders will have tubed tires with higher pressures.<br>You won&#039;t notice a big difference in the pressure just by squeezing the tires with your hands.

Then start conditioning your hands, start this by wrapping your hands and hitting the bag (dont go for the heaviest hardest one in the gym, if you can. If you don&#039;t have any other option, you need to gauge the power even more than with a softer bag).<br><br>Start punching, from lighter punches to harder punches until you develop a feeling of what is too light and whats too hard. Don&#039;t forget to, at the same time, punch with clean technique. That way we&#039;re killing two bird with one punch.<br><br>Dont punch until you feel like your hand will fall off. You need less than you think, at least when starting conditioning your fists. I&#039;d say 3 rounds of 2 minutes each. <br><br>If you feel like you can do more, please wait until the next days and observe how your knuckles feel. Even if you feel the slightest amount of discomfort/pain/tingle, it means your bones are healing. Dont go at it again, wait until those are practically gone. Then again, with wraps, at the bag.<br><br>Of course, you can box while they heal, that&#039;s why you train with boxing gloves.<br><br>You can do knuckle push ups, they are great accessory exercises, but nothing compares to hitting the bag without gloves.<br><br>Once you feel strong enough, you can start hitting the bag without wraps.<br><br>Extra advice:<br>Please, this should already be ingrained in your brain, but without gloves it&#039;s even more important: Hit your target with your fist closed as hard as you can. If you don&#039;t, your wrist is limp, that means you will hurt your wrist. This is specially true when hitting hooks and uppercuts, because your fist strikes the bag in a weird angle.<br>Some trainers don&#039;t want you to hit the bag withotu gloves, which is understandable. Hitting the bag without gloves put a lot of strain on them, eventually ripping the material. Time to buy your own bag, or ask if they have an old one laying around to hit or even buy.

I spaz out an panic in the 1st round and put my glove above my head to guard?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i throw shots from the chest instead of from any kind of stance which leaves me open whenever i do.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i dont use the jab enough at all</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i dont return my punches to my stance, my gloves end up lower than the already low hand position in my stance. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;putting a groin guard on makes you look 30lbs heavier. </span><br><br>My strategy was basically, get lead foot dominance, win exchanges with straight lefts and then tie him up with a clinch, rinse and repeat.

We, wrestlers, are the happiest people because from early age we have a professional opportunity to hug and cuddle with our sparring mates, feel their bodies, sweat, breath. It&#039;s a dream come true activity for any boy or girl. We need to popularize wrestling more, because it&#039;s extremely underground, so mamy kids miss one and only opportunity to become a real sporty male confident with woman&#039;s body. Some very unique wrestling technics in these episodes need a thorough discussion, shall we? In the first one the wrestler in blue used a very rare (second minute) Davidson grappling system, but I couldn&#039;t find training documentation on it, so maybe you know? I train 3 times a week and participate in uni championships. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9K<wbr>iShXl2ow&amp;t=5s&amp;ab_channel=ScottBirth<wbr><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdu<wbr>WiSRkMuo&amp;t=45s&amp;ab_channel=MidwestWr<wbr>estle", "time": 1673297282, "resto": 99006}, {"no": 132003, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)15:54:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p131968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;131968</a><br>I mean, there\u2019s various people that teach weapon retention skills if that\u2019s what you mean.

The character of Wu Song as a folk hero is being a good enough fighter to wrestle a tiger drunk, but that doesn&#039;t mean he does drunken BOXING, and that&#039;s purely on a literary standpoint. By your logic, there would be a long spiritual succession of drunken boxing at the local Irish pub every Friday evening. He&#039;s also consistently portrayed as a Buddhist, why the fuck would he use a system based on a different religion. Yes, there was a lot of exchange between Taoism and Buddhism, but not to the point of sharing deities. And before you bring up the Tang dynasty Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup, those guys were poets, scholars and politicians, largely removed from religion. Would be strange for a fighting style used by &#039;beggars, thieves, farmers and monks&#039; to hold a bunch of posh scholars in such high regard, wouldn&#039;t it? I&#039;d ridicule the idea of a beggar&#039;s/thieves&#039; style further, but it does a pretty good job on its own, assuming channers can tell Jin Yong novels from reality.<br><br>You know what my theory is? All religious labels attached to Chinese martial arts are products of largely illiterate martial artists trying to legitimise their style, by laying claim to whichever folk hero/religious figure happened to be more locally revered. It&#039;s possible that martial artists happened to be religious, but claiming that the biggest grounds of religious practice they came from were also historical training grounds (ie Wudang and Laoshan) is just Wuxia fantasy, narratively pushed by the commies to undermine their religious significance.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you barely provide any information</span><br>It&#039;s not my job to inform you, nor yours to inform me; but I think it&#039;s a shared responsibility to not spread utter bullshit.", "filename": "low-quality-bait", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1658225885224606, "time": 1658225885, "md5": "vE4jQELjCdc6agE6TibR0w==", "fsize": 18224, "resto": 104352}, {"no": 106885, "now": "07/20/22(Wed)13:00:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can some explain the differences in the different types of karate?

The point styles are stop and go like fencing and usually are not full contact although there are some which are and use armor and such. Knockdown karate styles are also heavily tighed to Japanese and Dutch kickboxing and in Japan certain fighters like Andy Hug were adopted culturally by Japan because of his knockdown karate background.

All of them are mid on their own, besides a small few. All styles have their advantages and their weaknesses. You shouldn&#039;t just adhere to one, but learn as many as you can. Hung Gar is a good style and not bad by itself. But you practice hung gar with longfist and a northern style and suddenly you have a very well rounded punching, kicking, and limb locking combination. Add some shiau jiao or wrestling in the mix and you have a pretty well rounded set up.

Turtle would be a good example. 99% of turtle is basic strikes, blocks, and kicks you&#039;ll learn in other styles of kung fu. But there are a handful of really brutal turtle techniques and some ground work that make the whole thing worth learning in the first place. It&#039;s a kind of rock paper scissors. Turtle is particularly geared towards defending against chicken kung fu and it&#039;s constant fucking attacks at your feet, knees, and dick. You can take those turtle applications which work particularly well against those kinds of attacks, and whip them out should the opportunity come up.

At that time, (John) would summon one of these Chinese instructors to spar with daily, knocking their teeth out or rendering them unconscious. He laughed, &quot;So this is the extent of your Chinese Kung Fu!&quot; Feng Yuxiang had a bodyguard by the name of Li Weihan, who didn&#039;t stand for this, and decided to fight him for good.

Tom thought: &quot;You&#039;re a martial arts instructor, I was just thinking of sparring with you!&quot; and signed the waiver promptly.

I sincerely believe that kung fu would benefit from a more HEMA-esque approach to its practice, instead of following what some self-purported master says with little question. There is a wealth of historical texts that paints a different picture of Chinese martial arts than what it presents itself now, which gets overlooked in favour of aesthetically emulating a Shaw brothers production.

I&#039;m not the anon heckling him about his tourneys, frankly I couldn&#039;t give less of a shit about his skill, or ability, or achievements. What I am addressing is the fact that his information comes from a lineage of charlatans, who he is more than enthusiastic to embrace without question. I don&#039;t blame him so much as the line of thinking he seems to embody; if anything he is less willing to mislead others as much as he is to be misled himself. And even if anything of what he&#039;s said has been reliable, referring to an untraceable lineage which offers no frame of reference in response to someone asking for a &#039;mid-tier kung fu style&#039; is hardly helpful. <br><br>I would attack the idea of modern &#039;Wudang&#039; lineages further, but at this point it&#039;d be irrelevant. Historical legitimacy is dead, long live whatever the fuck people want to believe I guess. Yeah, esoteric styles definitely take decades to master when average life expectancy was lower than 40 at their time of conception. The most badass martial artists were monks of vegetarian religions subsisting off of donations.

The starting position for tui shou (probably misspelled that) is representative of two opponents having their shields pressed against each other in a battlefield situation.

Yang Chengfu&#039;s teachers taught in military academies, while Chengfu taught the public more broadly and simplified the form. That isn&#039;t to say he disregarded the martial side, as Beijing was apparently a hotspot for tough fighters at that time, though his simplification did make it more accessible to people, and he did make it a bit softer. Then Cheng Man Ching came along and simplified it even more. In his lineage some people focus on fighting e.g. Mario Napoli, but there is a special appeal to those more focused on the philosophical, spiritual, and meditative aspects of the art. Visualization, softness, and slowness are integral components of that and are attractive to those who are not interested in fighting application at all; the fighting application is treated as a kind of cool trick or goodie, or a way to highlight what are apparently flawed ways of thinking or fighting.<br><br>As for the Chen Village line, because of the political situation in China during the 40s, Taiji practically died in the village - while people like Chen Fake were teaching in Beijing and his son Chen Zhaokui was on the way. In the 50s and 60s villagers like Chen Xiaowang learned what&#039;s called &quot;Laojia&quot;, but the emphasis was on choreography for the sake of maintaining the art to at least a minimal degree, not application. It wasn&#039;t until Chen Zhaokui came to teach later (what the villagers called &quot;Xinjia&quot;) that the villagers had learned more about application as well as new body mechanics. <br><br>Basically this is to say that knowledge of application depends a lot on who taught and why, who learned and why, as well as what was happening.

The fork is a great choice for best peasant uprising weapon (pitchfork jesus how could I forget the classic pitchfork). The hoe is one of the most common hand tools in asia. The hoe is an axe, a battering ram, a cudgel, it can reach 5-8 inches past a block or a shield to deliver a blow. When you use a hoe in a field you swing it hard and with a lot of force and have to rip it back out of the ground. If you&#039;re working hard and getting into a rhythm you&#039;re really hacking away at the ground as you&#039;re advancing or retreating. Your muscle memory with a hoe is already similar to what you&#039;re gonna do with it when the peasant uprising comes. You don&#039;t have to teach anybody how to hoe someone in the top of their knee. Also peasants that hoe will have some gains from all the hoeing. The hoe&#039;s designed for impact against medium targets like dirt, and even handles some hard targets like rocks. Against the armor of old china, mostly leather and fabric or interlinking armors like cord and plaque, the hoe does good. It&#039;s length also allows for the possibility of formation fighting. The hoe also is capable of hacking at a horse&#039;s leg something only the shovel and the axe can also claim, but only the axe and the hoe actually do any good at. The axe has the better chop at the leg, the hoe can attack the horse&#039;s legs but with a longer reach.

Still, I don&#039;t find it plausible for hoes to be great in small-scale war. Improvised weapon? Sure. Better than just a staff? If balanced well, why not. But a core part of effective weapons for ground troops is the ability to thrust. There&#039;s a reason dane axes had sharp horns capable of thrusting. The range afforded by hoes just isn&#039;t as meaningful when you can&#039;t thrust, and trying to defend thrusts from spears while consistently attacking seems nigh impossible, especially not when your peasants likely have inferior armour. I can see them being useful maybe as part of a formation, but hardly the bulk of it.

If your uprising gains enough traction to attract the army, you&#039;re going to be dealing with horses again. The inability to thrust is a dramatic drawback for the hoe, I totally agree. But I think it still works in formation. Have you ever seen how halberds are used in battle of the nations and other hema full contact sports? I know it&#039;s european but the idea is still the same. The men just behind the line on both sides chop their polearms down on the poor unsuspecting heads of the men directly involved in the center struggle. The hoe works great in this capacity, even if it&#039;s unable to penetrate armor the head will have serious concussive force. A normal one eye hoe head is at least 4 pounds on the end of a 6 foot stick. Which leads me to the biggest reason I chose the hoe. Hoes have forged heads. Even historically, a hoe head is expensive and something built to last. Hoe heads have to withstand years of repeated impact and striking things like rocks and roots without breaking. Go on any amazon review of a truper hoe, they aren&#039;t forged they&#039;re cast, and boy do people break the shit out of them and post pictures about it pissed online. Whereas if you&#039;re a real mexican landscaper you&#039;re gonna save the money and buy a serymour hoe head. One that&#039;s actually forged and tempered. It&#039;s a hoe head your grandkids will be using. The peasant then would have the right hoe for the job, just like the peasant now. The blacksmith will forge a hoe head, but he will cast the tiger fork. Things like rakes and forks weren&#039;t made of the same quality of metal as something like a hoe, an axe blade, a shovel, or a machete would. Those tools are intended for impact and higher stress. All a fork has to do is lift ~15 pounds of hay.

Most of the sources I found said cast iron, but then some of them called it &quot;forged cast iron&quot; which is a misnomer but I think they mean it was cast and then &quot;forged&quot; (manipulated) into shape. The crux of my point being, the hoe was made of a stronger metal. Which I think is a fair assumption to make.

I don&#039;t do hema or consider it representative on real life melee warfare. I just used it as an example of how long polearms can be used in combat. You can draw the same example out of any historical depiction of a glaive or voulje formation. You get some lads together and take turns chopping up the steppe people. Also earlier I did mention that these are peasants. They don&#039;t have access to Tang Ba&#039;s which would be treated as weapons just the same way a Spear or a Guan Dao would. The three strand fork was by far the most common agricultural fork in old china. There were tiger forks and fishing tridents in civilian hands. They were usually tolerated and not treated as a weapon by the government. But they were not widely available to the population like a hay fork. I&#039;m talking about the quality of metal between the civilian farmer&#039;s hay fork, and the civilian farmer&#039;s field hoe. There are techniques for hoe fighting in several different systems north and south. It was obviously never adopted into any dynastic military because there are real weapons that do the job much better. I didn&#039;t bring up training techniques because the peasants aren&#039;t practicing kung fu they&#039;re farming. The peasant hoe formation eats the peasant fork formation for decisive tang victory in my head canon. In the hands of an untrained idiot the hoe is more immediately dangerous and effective. But you did make a lot of good points. Also, hoes lose to a real polearm in a heartbeat. A formation of tiger fork men with real tiger forks, who have been trained to use them? They win every single time. Even against a formation of trained hoemen? I still give it to the tiger fork platoon because it&#039;s inherently a more dynamic weapon. You can trap block and stab all at the same time if you wanted, and historically will have at least a foot of reach on the hoe.

I got into BMX and skateboarding around the same time, 2010 ish when I was 12. BMX was thriving at the time, kids were crazy for Aaron Ross shit, skateparks were full of bikes, it dwindled fast over a few years. Skateboarding had a resurgence thanks to Tumblr in my opinion somewhere around the early 2010s, and as BMX has become more dead, skateboarding has won out because it&#039;s &#039;cooler&#039; and the clothing is far trendier than a BMX rider. Skateboards are also less cumbersome and you can just carry it, skate around and do other shit all day.

Because I started out at 62kg training as a teenager in the adults class, the style I fell towards was one of using speed and hardly ever strength, which is something I carried over now that I&#039;m 110kg. Because of this, I have a way easier time against the 160kg, as he&#039;s always been big and has a style developed to fight other big and strong guys, where he&#039;ll usually win out as most other big guys train as if they&#039;re the biggest and strongest, so will fight strength with strength, whereas I won&#039;t every try to outstrength him, and would rather use my energy to move around. Against the 60kg guy though, I feel like I&#039;m in quicksand with how fast he moves, and because I&#039;m so used to winning based on speed against other heavyweights, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever taken him down in Judo (wrestling is a different story but he&#039;s still more of a pain that just ankle picking the 160kg guy).<br><br>With styles that develop on weight classes, a lot of their techniques (especially as they&#039;re taught in modern days) will assume you&#039;re fighting someone of a similar size, so they might not be as applicable to everyone, though I&#039;m sure if you asked your coach &quot;if I was fighting a bigger guy, what should I do?&quot; they&#039;ll be able to show you more specialised stuff.<br><br>That being said, don&#039;t bother with combat sports if you just want to defend yourself in the street.

Standardization was perhaps the great miracle of Modernism. Across all endeavors, not just war. Minimum standards for soldiers, doctors, teachers, engineers, food safety, and so on, that all practitioners must meet to be legally allowed to practice, has saved more lives and increased living standards more than perhaps anything else in all of history.

To further reduce the influence of military leaders, they were routinely reassigned at the end of a campaign, so that no lasting bond occurred between commander and soldier. The policy of appointing civil officials as ad hoc military leaders was maintained by both the Ming and Qing dynasties after the initial phase of conquest. ...Although it negatively impacted the military&#039;s performance at times, the new relationship between the civil and military sectors of the government avoided the endemic military coups of preceding dynasties for the rest of imperial Chinese history.</span><br><br>Thus, there was no gentleman warrior class of China past Song dynasty (900s AD).

Which are: clinch fighting, kicks, wrestling and subs. So your go-to disciplines are Muay-Thai, Wrestling, BJJ and Sambo. The best combination of these IMO is Muay Thai and Sambo.<br><br>You need to learn low kicks the Muay Thai way. Find a bag or a friend who can hold a shield and practice blasting thighs with you legs. During the fight, try to stay away and shoot his leg when he try to get closer. Also if you get into the clinch, you can get weapon that he doesn&#039;t have by using elbows and knees, or even trips.<br><br>For wrestling, well you just need to know how to get him on the ground, thus you need takedowns. If it goes on to the ground and you&#039;re on top, you don&#039;t really need much strategy. Smesh his face and body with punches and elbows.<br><br>And if you have the opportunity, try to sub him. Rear naked choke is the easiest way, but if youre on top you can also have an armbar. That you learn by doing BJJ, Grappling or Sambo. Also knowing how to get full guard and doing a triangle when youre on your back can save you.<br><br>Ill also give you a more detailed blue print, but keep in mind that things almost never go as planned, so be ready for any situation. Whatever strat/martial art you choose, the key will always be consistency in training.

Then it&#039;s fairly easy (easier said than done though). The key skills are the double leg takedown, the armbar and some ground control. You&#039;ll have to let him go at you first, just so you can learn his rythm. Then when he&#039;s throwing a one two, you drop on your knees to shoot the takedown and keep a hold of his leg until he is down. From now on, it&#039;s Khabib time, you can basically move on top and control his legs with a leg triangle (that shit Khabib does when he wraps his legs around his opponent&#039;s and lock it by putting an ankle behind his opposite knee). From now on you&#039;re on top of him: lay as much weight as possible on him, smash his face and when he&#039;s giving you an arm throw the armbar. Of course if you already know an other submission from top mount (Anaconda, Kimura, Armbar) you can also use it.<br><br>Now, maybe you&#039;re the smaller man? Ok, it&#039;s not gonna be as easy but it&#039;s doable. Against bigger opponents, double leg takedowns are harder to land, as is gaining in maintaining top control. So we&#039;re gonna have you go to a place where your opponent has no strength: his back. The key skills here will be moving from the clinch to the back, the broomstick takedown and the rear naked choke, otherwise known as RNC. So here&#039;s the plan: get to feel him a little bit at first. When you feel like you got him, slip on the side when he throws a straight punch (if he throws with his right, you move to you left) and catch him. Best is wrapping up your arms against his torso or abdomen. From there you will need to move as fast as possible to his back to avoid getting into a strength opposition with a bigger opponent. Basically when you get in, step with your inner leg (the one closer to him) behind his foot, keep a tight grip around him and pivot on your leg to get his back. Then you use a simple broomstick takedown to get him on the ground and then move to the RNC. He sleeps.

You look like a pussy&quot; he&#039;d say &quot;I cant even feel your limpdick bitch.&quot; I just kept clapping, wondering wtf is up with him. After about 20 minutes of railing Mike&#039;s boypussy, drenched in sweat and his cream, I finally got a nut off despite his constant berating and degrading comments. He immediately hopped off, laid flat on his back and bent his legs over his head so the cum dripped out of his asshole directly into his mouth. &quot;The fuck you looking at? You like this gay boy?&quot; He kept saying. After he got every last drop. He cackled like a rooster and punched me in the face as hard as he could. He nearly broke his hand, but I was fine. &quot;Fucking fag&quot; he said as he limped off into the sunset, shaking his wrist.
