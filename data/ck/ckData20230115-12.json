Salad dressings and some sandwich spreads are also a common trap when it comes to this, adding too much sugar or cream to coffee can be this too.<br><br>Replace unhealthy food you eat with a healthier alternative. If you have a sweet tooth, eat fruit instead of chocolate. If you like to snack, think of a healthier snack to munch on. Fruits and vegetables are good for this because they\u2019re light on calories. Unsalted nuts are decent too so long as you pay attention to portion sizes. Honey may seem \u201chealthier\u201d but it really isn\u2019t that much better. Consider baking food you may normally fry since you won\u2019t need to use as much oil. Breakfasts are some of the least healthy foods people often eat, many of them are like desserts<br><br>Eat food with a lot of fiber, because that will fill you up more. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains are all good for this.<br><br>Drink plenty of water<br><br>Minimize eating out, be very careful about prepackaged meals. When you eat food prepared by someone else you have no control over the ingredients being used.

The first step is to train the stomach to accept less food and shrink to a smaller size. What worked for me in the past is to do 16 hour fasts and only eat within an 8 hour window in the day. So only eat at lunch, then dinner at 6, maybe a snack at 7:45 if you want. And since you&#039;re 470lb, you can eat big portions and still lose weight. You still have to give up binging on fast food if you&#039;re doing that, your meal will have to be actually healthy foods. <br><br>The simplest go-to is protein (chicken, pork, beef that you&#039;ve cooked) and vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, etc). But you can eat as big a portion as you want since you&#039;re 470lb, you&#039;ll lose a ton of weight within a couple of months. For snacks just eat more protein, maybe cured meats like salami and jerkey, cheese. Just don&#039;t eat potato chips or anything sweet. A 470lber needs to cut out starches and sugars to start building back insulin function, and it will keep you less hungry. No need to go full keto though, like you can have something like mashed potato within reason (not every day).<br><br>If you follow this for just a few days, you&#039;ll find that it becomes easy after maybe 4-5 days as your stomach shrinks. Only the first 2-3 days are hard, it&#039;s literally effortless from there. <br>This is a cheat/cope type of weight loss, but it&#039;s a very good place to start.

Food nutrition is split up between macro nutrients (fat/protein/carbs) that give you your energy and building blocks, and micro nutrients (vitamins/minerals) which supply your body with a host of important matter it will *need* to function correctly, if not optimally. <br><br>:::Part 2 (Micros):<br><br>Please look into getting an account on Cronometer. Just google it. It&#039;s free and you don&#039;t need the membership. You can use it to track your total calories intake and your vitamin and mineral intake, but it&#039;s mostly there for now so you can see which foods will supply you with what. This is for the long-term picture so you get to understand what&#039;s good and what isn&#039;t and, hopefully one day, learn to cook for yourself beyond the absolute basics.<br><br>Additionally, I highly recommend you look into getting a quality multi-vitamin. It will make the process easier and potentially fix some other problems you may have. If you&#039;re in the US or Canada you should try and find Vitamin Code for Men supplements, they are raw ingredients only and of the highest quality. Pic related is what I use.

It&#039;s time-restricted eating, which is a lot healthier and more natural than gorging yourself on food every 2-3 hours. You have an eating window you eat food in, and the the rest of the time you only drink water or things that do not contain any macros (fat/protein/carbs), like tea. I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I legitimately never feel hungry outside the eating window or even think about food (unless I&#039;m looking up a recipe intentionally) and I&#039;m barely hungry even when it&#039;s time to eat, but I still enjoy the food of course.<br><br>I recommend starting out with 16:8, meaning you do not eat for 16 hours and eat for 8. 10 AM to 6 PM is generally the accepted starting point. You break your fast with your first bite of breakfast at 10 AM and take your last bite of dinner by 6PM at the latest.<br><br>:::Part 5 (The rough diet):<br><br>You said you&#039;re 470 lbs.

(Freakonomics Radio did a paid (secondary) episode about how much the coauthor liked his Cadillac, also without any clear warning anywhere that it was a paid promotion, for example.

The main feature was during the (edited) cooking there were two voice-only commentators giving &quot;live&quot; sports-talk-like commentary, and they actually were really talented (way more so than the chef) -- in addition to having good comedy they had good natural chemistry. So despite the chef being the same in the first episodes and being pretty mediocre, the production quality was good, and of course the commentary was solid, so I actually really liked it. I imagine though, since the commentary track would have to be scripted, that it was a shitload of work to produce and if it wasn&#039;t an early hit the comedians probably would have just moved to other projects.<br><br>The final cute gimmick they had was their closing scene was the chef saying goodbye while at the sink scrubbing all the pots and pans he used.", "time": 1673750276, "resto": 18807527}, {"no": 18812146, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:39:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18807527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18807527</a><br>out of that list I&#039;ve only ever made Chef John and Kenji recipes and they turned out good.

Lacking or even off-putting flavors got covered up by sauce. Even mistakes like overcooked or burned food would be hidden by a sauce slathered all over on top of the food.<br>This is why fancy restaurants today mostly tend to put sauce on the plate, below the food, with the food like the steak or whatever sitting on top of the sauce. Because today\u2019s kitchens don\u2019t have to worry about covering up their mistakes so much while back in Escoffier\u2019s day covering up mistakes or making up for lacking food was the mindset of the restaurant kitchen industry.<br>According to Wolfgang Puck.", "time": 1673757624, "resto": 18808355}, {"no": 18812610, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:45:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18812584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18812584</a><br>Maybe I suck at cooking or have bad taste because I like the espagnole based sauces.
