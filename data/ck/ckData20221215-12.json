I remember getting some &quot;Jump&quot; branded snuff in Austria several years ago, that was made by Poschl (I think it was an Austrian-market specific product). If you go to MrSnuff, you&#039;ll find they have a pretty wide variety of tinned snuffs. Unfortunately, I cannot order from them anymore (customs issues), and getting tobacco shipped from a continental online shop is an exercise in frustration and/or extreme patience. <br><br>I haven&#039;t tried many of their tinned snuffs, but I really liked Ozona President (which they apparently do not produce anymore, for some reason). Lowenprise is too cloying for my taste (too much anise). Gletscher Prise used to be good, but I think they changed the recipe, for the worse, a few years ago. Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess. However, Poschl schmalzlers are packed in sachets, and they tend to lose aroma if stored too long before use. You might occasionally get a dud.

I typically am a very moderate user however, keeping it mostly to 2-4 sniffs per day and don&#039;t have much of a problem with it. Also just to put it out there I blow and clean my nose grug style. Its a pretty private habit anyway since there aren&#039;t many users out there and I don&#039;t worry about it what people might think of it. Fact is its one of the healthiest and enjoyable ways to use tobacco, and last I checked the majority of our taste receptors are in the nasal cavity.<br><br>As one can imagine this is a dirt cheap habit.

If you&#039;re mixing you might as well get a $5 Trader Joes or M&amp;R sweet vermouth at first and see what kind of manhattans (or the equivalent using your best base liquor) and the like that gives you, then get a Dolin and see how that elevates it.<br>Bitters: If you&#039;re near a Wegman&#039;s they have Angostura for super cheap (like $8). Otherwise get Peychauds at the liquor store for $6-8. (In general check your grocery store for liquor price comparisons, especially on the low-mid range. Costco in particular apparently carries some value gems.)<br><br>Again, maybe only focus on exploring one type of liquor at a time, to upgrade to something of higher value or more diversity. The way to do it is this: say I want a starter bar and I&#039;m interested in exploring rum. I still get everything listed above, plus go to rum tastings or talk to a bartender and try out something I like, and get something dark and mid-range based on that. Now I take a basic cocktail like the Old Fashioned -- it&#039;s be re-spun a million times, and wouldn&#039;t you know, you can re-spin it with dark rum instead of whiskey (or anejo tequila, or rye, or brandy, or mezcal combo, and it just goes on and on).

Yes you should toss out the fores and much of the heads, but that&#039;s because they taste bad because of the acetone and other lighter/more volatile chemicals. Acetone itself is not dangerous to ingest in reasonable quantities, the Ld50 equivalent for an adult would be drinking half a liter of pure acetone (5g/kg for acetone compared to 7g/kg for ethanol). There aren&#039;t other low dose healrh issues with acetone either, but again it tastes and smells terrible so it should be removed.<br>Methanol is dangerous if ingested in its pure form even in small quantities. Distilling though, does not make a pure form of methanol at any point in the run and the percentage of methanol is small, like 1% if you&#039;re purposely trying to push the methanol content with pectin rich must, and is negligible for non fruit based mashes. A antidote for methanol poisoning is ingesting ethanol in a large enough quantity to saturate/out compete the liver enzymes that would be turning methanol into formaldehyde, which will surely happen since the methanol to ethanol ratio is so low. And as one last thing, methanol concentration is highest in the tails, not the heads as commonly thought- which goes against the common practice of using and redistilling tails. https://doi.org/10.1021/acsfoodscit<wbr>ech.1c00025 is the first accessible paper I pulled up but there are several that show the same thing.<br>There&#039;s also this misconception that each chemical boils off at a certain temp and then is gone. Mixtures don&#039;t work like that, each of the chemicals in solutions interact and change each other&#039;s boiling points which is an ever changing process in a still as vapors are removed and heat is added. It means that everything in the still gets smeared throughout the run but can be concentrated in certain parts.

After the green tea leaves are evaporated at high temperature to soften the water, and then repeatedly fried, the leaves change from turquoise green to reddish brown. The green tea made with heavy fire is the characteristic of fried tea, and the soup is yellow and red. Jieyang Stir-Fried Tea is famous for its strong taste and a little sweetness, and it does not hurt the stomach after long-term drinking.</span><br>From another listing<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Traditional tea from Guangdong province. It has a strong characteristic aroma of green roasted tea and a bright complex taste.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is produced in the same places as the more famous Guandunskie oolongs, such as Feng Juan tribute Cong or Chaozhou cha. This tea is not known outside China. It can be said that this is a tea place in Guangdong province. Made from the same raw materials as most oolongs in this province. In the final stage of cooking tea is roasted by hand, in special boilers. Hence its strong and characteristic aroma and original taste, with a taste of fried chestnuts. Perfect for every day.</span><br>It seems like it repeatedly wok fried or otherwise roasted instead of the charcoal roast you usually see on oolongs. Im guessing the roast on the darker ones will be fairly intense which as the description says makes it easy on the stomach but the flavor isn&#039;t for everyone.

When it comes to ugly foods, there are a few different directions you could go in. Here are a few ideas to get you started:<br><br>For a savory option, you could make something like &quot;ugly&quot; meatballs. To make them, you could mix together ground meat (like beef or pork) with a variety of different diced vegetables, such as carrots, onions, and bell peppers. You could then shape the mixture into meatballs and bake them in the oven until they&#039;re cooked through. The resulting meatballs might not be the prettiest, but they&#039;re sure to be tasty!<br>Another savory option could be to make an &quot;ugly&quot; soup. To do this, you could start by saut\u00e9ing a variety of diced vegetables (such as onions, carrots, and bell peppers) in a pot until they&#039;re soft. Then, you could add in some broth and any other ingredients you like (such as beans or lentils) and let the soup simmer until everything is cooked through. The soup might not be the most beautiful, but it&#039;s sure to be delicious and hearty.<br>For a sweet option, you could make &quot;ugly&quot; cookies. To do this, you could start by making a batch of your favorite cookie dough. Then, instead of rolling the dough into balls and flattening them with a fork, you could shape the dough into a variety of different shapes, such as cylinders, spheres, and cones. You could then bake the cookies in the oven until they&#039;re cooked through, and enjoy them as is or with a drizzle of chocolate or icing on top. The resulting cookies might not be perfectly shaped, but they&#039;re sure to be tasty!<br>Overall, the key to making ugly foods is to be creative and have fun with it. Don&#039;t worry too much about making everything look perfect - the &quot;ugliness&quot; is part of the charm!
