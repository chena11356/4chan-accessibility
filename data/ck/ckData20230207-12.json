Yeah it&#039;s a low-quality-low-price chain restaurant, but you get what you pay for there like you do everywhere. Subway isn&#039;t fashionable so there&#039;s no hipster tax which actually gets you better value than average for your dollar. And frankly the food is just fine. It&#039;s not as good as Jersey Mike&#039;s obviously but it&#039;s literally half the price for the same amount of food. And you get more of a sugar/MSG hit in the cheaper ingredients which is sometimes exactly what you need. Saying subway is &quot;bad&quot; compared to upscale or mom&amp;pop sandwich restaurants is like saying porn is &quot;bad&quot; compared to fine arts.

But this seemed to be crossing the line. Nevertheless, I knew that presentation wasn&#039;t everything, so I carried on.

I chewed thrice more before &quot;flavor&quot; made itself known. It was not a welcome one. I have never had the displeasure of chewing on an old dishrag that had been dropped and forgotten behind a restaurant dishwasher, but this must have been its closest &quot;edible&quot; imitation.<br>I let the chewed mass fall from my mouth, back into the so-called &quot;wrapper&quot;, letting it dribble upon the supposed &quot;sandwich&quot;.

I usually cook the egg and meat right before but Ieftover stuff is fine too.<br><br>I use a wok on a shitty electric coil stove on high heat, season with peanut oil, start with shallot or onion, carrot, garlic (sometimes ginger) until the carrots are tender. I add in the meat component at this point to warm it up (spam most often, but I&#039;ve also done rotisserie chicken or strips of beef) then the rice goes in. I try and spread the rice around with as much direct contact with the wok as possible, leave it for a min or so to get crispy, then start tossing the rice on very high heat. After a few minutes of tossing, I make a well and add sambal chili sauce and fry it a bit. Add scallion whites and toss. At this point I taste it, add MSG, salt, pepper, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil and toss. Taste again and adjust seasoning, toss, serve with chopped green onion and sesame seeds.", "time": 1675744363, "resto": 18905894}, {"no": 18908186, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)23:41:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18908110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18908110</a><br>Just use fucking Canola oil and get fat like the rest of us.

Don&#039;t buy pre-grated cheese, ever. Add it to a bowl with some mayonnaise. Ratio depends on how much cheese you use. Add your pimentos, and some Worcestershire and cayenne. Mash it all together into a spread. Can make it more homogenous in your stand mixer with the paddle attachment.<br><br>The seasonings are a matter of taste, so put whatever you like. Try some granulated onion or garlic, hot sauce, whatever. Pimento cheese is one of those things that is infinitely better if you make it at home.
