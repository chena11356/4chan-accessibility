That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character. That said younger liubao or those that are aged somewhere drier like Kunming can be good too, they have a tendency to have more bitter and chocolate notes and maybe a sort of closer to ripe puer flavor profile. Anyway liubao is great, i think its generally better than ripe puer, at least in my experience.<br>Aged matters less with ripe puer, a couple years anywhere for the pile taste to air off some, preferably its aired loose leaf for a year or two before pressing. But after that aged makes a subtle difference unless we are talking hong kong traditional storage or some other very humid ageing environment. Older ripe (early 2000s and older) tended to be less heavily fermented and required a longer period of aging to reach a good taste profile and get out the pile notes. Modern ripes are rarely made that way and when they are they are typically fermented more carefully so they don&#039;t require the same aging period to be drinkable.", "time": 1674416876, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843658, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843631</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character.</span><br>I like this thread so I am resisting the urge to post a soyjak, you get away with it this time.", "time": 1674417390, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843661, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843459</a><br>I hate it", "time": 1674417409, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843683, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "drinking two GABA oolongs today, might as well make a brief comparison<br><br>unroasted Si Ji Chun GABA oolong:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scent: spices (cinnamon?) and maybe some honey</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taste: pears, spices, creamy, autumn leaves, some sweetness but also sourness / acidity. mild with no bitterness</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brewing: really easy to brew grandpa style. never gets bitter at all, it gets sour instead.

The most basic pasta you can make but it&#039;s really flavourful. Just oil, garlic and spicy peppers in a pan. Cook the pasta, throw in the pan, add some parsley and a spoon of breadcrumbs (parsley and breadcrumbs are optional but taste real good). Enjoy.<br><br>Ragu also can be done without tomatoes. I make a base with celery, carrots and onions, brown them with some butter and oil. Add some sausage (not what americans call &quot;italian sausage&quot;, it tastes wrong) and ground beef. Cook it till browned. Add some red wine. Once the wine evaporates, start adding vegetable broth. Cook it for a couple hours. To season you can use salt, pepper, bey leaf, rosemary, sage (all fresh and finely chopped, you can put them in a tea bag thingy and take them out). <br>Fucking delicious in lasagna, but also just on regular ass egg pasta is great<br><br>Pasta with broccoli and sausage is also fairly typical, I usually put pecorino romano on top. You can also puree the broccoli to make a sauce and then use nutritional yeast to flavor it if you want to skip dairy. Not very traditional but I&#039;ve made it like that when I had people who can&#039;t eat dairy over.<br><br>Risotto of course. Very easy but impresses everyone every time. The basic recipe is a base with onions and butter, cook till browned, add the rice (arborio or carnaroli) to toast it, add wine, once the wine evaporates cook it with broth until tender. At the end you should add butter and cheese. You can make it in a thousand ways, with fish, meat and vegetables. My favourite is pumpkin and sausage (add the sausage with the onions, and pumpkin puree with the broth), but also basic ass saffron risotto tastes amazing.<br><br>Chicken broth with tortellini.

However, they are very annoying to use and clean. Lodge seasoning is extremely tough and nonstick, but because of the bumpy texture, you do get food stains that are difficult to clean off of the seasoning. Your spatula will make a lot of noise just brushing it across the surface and if any food burns/sticks, even just a small spot, then you just know it&#039;s going to be there the whole time you&#039;re cooking and that spot won&#039;t be nonstick anymore. I do not like using them. <br>-Finex/Stargazer/Butterpat/Field do not hold their seasoning very well. It just flakes off under normal use and there&#039;s no nice way to say it. If you think it&#039;s because some amateur is doing something wrong, using too much heat, not enough oil, then take a look at their websites and see the photos of the &quot;owner of the company&#039;s collection.&quot; All their pans have splotchy seasoning. That&#039;s not to say they don&#039;t work for what they are, but it&#039;s distracting and annoying when your pan is constantly destroying itself. I do not like using these, and I&#039;ve tried most of them.<br>-OLD skillets you buy from a flea market or ebay are the best. I don&#039;t know why this is, and you should strip the old seasoning (just soak in lye for a few days and it&#039;s easy) and re-season them yourself, but all of my old skillets, doesn&#039;t matter the brand, hold onto their seasoning, are easy to clean AND are really pleasant to use.", "time": 1674399749, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18842753, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:05:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I soak beans in sugar water overnight will they be sweet enough to eat as a dessert once cooked?", "time": 1674399918, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18843643, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:50:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18842504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18842504</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people say many spices are only fat soluble and oil works for that.</span><br>Meat has fat in it", "time": 1674417021, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18844086, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:45:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy steak, same cut from the same place</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marinate it the same way, cook it the same way</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;95% of the time great and delicious</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5% of the time the steak is way too tough and tastes like a worse cut of steak</span><br>What causes this?

The religious rule of fasting exists to build character, primarily temperance and humility. Outside monastic communities it is not a strict law and more of an ideal, and for laymen it is usually considered enough to simply try your best. Not to get into the finer details, but there is also a strong tradition of vegetarian cooking which exists in order to properly celebrate religious feast days which occur during the fast. The food is meant to taste good, but it is very obviously lighter vegetarian cuisine.<br>Unlike the Catholics, fish is not licit during the fast (although it is seen as a &quot;less-bad&quot; food, in some places) and in fact in most places, the ideal fast excludes all dietary oils as well - which is by far the least-followed restriction among laymen for obvious reasons.<br>In this light, it is pretty clear where Beyond Meat and similar products belong. They are, at best, a &quot;less-bad&quot; food like fish, but fake meat products embody principles opposite to the ideal fasting food. The reason there is a &quot;debate&quot; is basically that disinterested laymen who might feel community pressure to fast will try to find loopholes in their daily life, and since the point of the fasting rule is humility, if you are another layman and not a priest it is considered counterproductive to insist and posture over the dietary rule that others are following, for the same reason that you aren&#039;t supposed to act prideful over people who don&#039;t fast.

Yeah I\u2019ve heard loads of people say it\u2019s not far off from the 15, but I\u2019ve also heard people say it ages well once the bottle has been opened and also after being poured. So just kinda curious there, as I thought that this might appeal to me since I\u2019m a slow drinker (I usually spend the first 15-30 minutes sniffing, kek).

You get a lot for your money, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s sweeter than what I\u2019m typically used to, but it\u2019s very fragrant and clinical. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any cheese or mushroom, but I\u2019ll take note of that and see what I can spot when I have my next glass later on. With my example there\u2019s a lot of green grape skin going on though. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t call it slow to open up, I can pretty much drink it immediately after pouring my glass but I like to take my time as the nose really is something. I typically buy Armagnac that\u2019s been bottled about 30 years after the date it has been distilled (kinda my sweet spot, though I do have both younger and older), and I also only buy single vintage (i.e. bottles with the year stamped on them instead of the age of the product). My current Delord is 39 years however (distilled 1982, bottled 2021) and I\u2019d happily buy it again. The only thing that annoys me about Delord is the wax they use to seal the cap is a LOT harder than literally any other Armagnac I\u2019ve ever had to open, that said it\u2019s a small price to pay for what\u2019s a very affordable product in my opinion, especially given the age.", "time": 1674106463, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829142, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18827079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18827079</a><br>Kek just because Armagnac isn\u2019t to your liking doesn\u2019t make it poor quality.

Laubade does that, there\u2019s a cloth string a few mm wide under the wax which you can just pull to get the fucker off. The problem with Delord isn\u2019t the lack of string though, it\u2019s that the wax is like fucking porcelain i.e. really hard. My older bottles of Laubade had no string but even despite that the wax was super easy to peel off. I typically don\u2019t ever leave a bottle open for more than three months so I don\u2019t have an issue with ageing becoming a problem. I typically drink one shot a day with my significant other (we do have one or two breaks a week though), sometimes we share one shot, sometimes we have a shot each; so with my rule of four open bottles at once that pretty much guarantees each bottle will finished within three months. I devised this rule mostly because for whisky it can be very unpredictable how well a bottle ages, and in my experience it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to go downhill fast once the bottle is about 50% empty with all that air mucking about inside. Funnily enough I find Armagnac holds much better than whisky; I once had a bottle open for over a year and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. But like my current Glenfiddich 15 VAT 03 that\u2019s open, I can tell I\u2019m enjoying it a wee bit less now that the bottle is down to its remainder 35%.

The sheer irony is that this basically means our alcohol tax is a poor people\u2019s tax more than anything because for cheaper shit you pay a higher percentage in tax (since the product is cheaper but the tax is fixed): thus the more expensive your liquor the more meaningless the tax becomes (you pay the same $ per litre regardless of whether you\u2019re buying a 20$ piss wine or a 1000$ or fuck it 10000$ bottle of scotch).

It&#039;s the prepping of the meat that takes lots of time. The pork belly is washed, patted dry and seasoned with chillis, garlic, 15-20 sugar : 1 salt in a basin. Then let rest under direct sunlight for a whole day. (remember to use food wrapper). Then just cook under VERY low flame in 100% quality coconut water until the water becomes deep brown like a demi-glace.<br>What to expect from this dish? It&#039;s sweet, balanced with some salt and msg. The fat is almost translucent (thanks to sugar). It should be able to hold the meat together.<br>My recipe calls for extra steps in preparing the meat: The meat is seasoned and let rest like the OG. But then it is blanched from cold water with ginger until it sets its shape, then wash it. Dock the skin with whatever tool you have, and apply generous amount of salt, rub it, then pat it VERY dry. <br>Deep fry meat: fat, skin face down in just right amount of oil (only fat is fried). Once some of the fat is rendered, remove the deep fry oil and sear the meat on all sides until lightly brown with some scorching. Then, steam the meat on medium for 3-4 hours. After that, collect all the juice and fat and reserve meat in fridge. You can even smoke the meat by putting some smoking wood into the steaming water, and letting the water evaporate and burn the wood soot on purpose. I recommend having a dedicated steaming basin for this because it will get decimated.<br>Make coconut demi-glace with chilli pepper, garlic, salt, sugar, msg, and coconut water until thickened. Mix with steamed meat juice.<br>Pour demi-glace on meat, steam and serve.<br>The result from my recipe should be: less fatty, have a nice smokey flavour like how people in the countryside have it.<br><a href=\"#p18845661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18845661</a><br>thanks lol", "time": 1674462628, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846160, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:31:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18846155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18846155</a><br>i want those fingers down my throat", "time": 1674462697, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846443, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:02:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18845835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18845835</a><br>From the look of it, it&#039;s Vietnamese LNY food.<br>Source: t.Vietfag.", "time": 1674471746, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846521, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:42:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18841744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18841744</a><br>Pew pew pew", "time": 1674474121, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846567, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)07:04:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18841744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18841744</a><br>It&#039;s Lunar New Year, you uneducated savage.<br>Half of asia celebrates that, not only china.
