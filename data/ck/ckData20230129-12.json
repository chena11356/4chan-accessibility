what it tastes like, but the pizza was gone years before i even knew it existed<br> it looks pretty similar to most pizzas<br> but actually, it&#039;s one of a kind, it&#039;s unique even though it&#039;s still just a pepperoni pizza, and between all the pizzas that people in the world have made in the last three years <br>three years after this pizza was made and eaten, i saw a picture of it, and it became more than just one pizza in the world to me<br><br> it became a pizza to the exclusion of other pizzas<br> for no real reason in particular<br>the ghost of this pepperoni pizza

think the particular waves of fate that made this pizza so special to me, also made it physically unattainable<br>but if i had had this very pizza, it would have been just another pizza<br><br> there&#039;s six pizza places near me but none of them have this pizza. this pizza was gone 3 years ago. i could take a picture of this pizza to somewhere and ask them to make me one just like it, and give them a hundred dollar bill to make it happen<br><br> and it still wouldn&#039;t be THIS pizza it&#039;d just be an imitation<br><br> it&#039;s just a pizza that once was. and it&#039;s pretty much like most any other pizza. but thats the pizza i want. i heard a story about this pizza<br><br>someone said that the pizzaman showed up and fumbled getting it out of the bag, and he tried to stop it from falling for like 10 agonizing seconds, and then kind of caught the box by slapping it against the wall, and he was quite distraught at having ruined the customers pizza but the customer isn&#039;t a wound up neurotic wreck, so he just said, well lets look at the damage. <br><br> checked it out, and it wasn&#039;t that bad. he laughed and said, i&#039;ll take it, and paid the price of the pizza to the man. so the pizza i see, the story that brought it to my attention, and the image that caught my attention, it&#039;s the product of an accident and a reaction of people far away from me. if the pizza hadn&#039;t been fucked up a bit and slammed against a wall, it wouldn&#039;t have had a story to tell about it that i&#039;d hear one day<br><br>they wouldn&#039;t have taken a picture of it when they brought it in, that i&#039;d see one day. and so without the mistake, the fumble, the damage, the story, the accidents, and three years of floating around the back of other peoples minds, i wouldn&#039;t be hungry for this pizza in the way that makes me not hungry for other pizzas.<br><br> and now, someone&#039;s told a second story about this pizza. maybe this will be

She doesn&#039;t define the peppers -- bell is assumed in other UK recipes so that&#039;s what I assume, but that&#039;s still a shitload of peppers compared to the onion. Then there&#039;s the curry powder, which is unspecified, and I don&#039;t know what &quot;mild&quot; means in the UK versus the generic single type in the US. And then the baked beans, hoo boy. She said she made homemade ones, and I had homemade Boston baked beans, and was skeptical so mixed little tastes at the end, and it did not work *at all*. Canned baked beans are quite different, but I don&#039;t see any way that would work either, and from her description of the relish it would seem most people just use regular beans, so I don&#039;t know what flavor profile she had in mind.

The religious rule of fasting exists to build character, primarily temperance and humility. Outside monastic communities it is not a strict law and more of an ideal, and for laymen it is usually considered enough to simply try your best. Not to get into the finer details, but there is also a strong tradition of vegetarian cooking which exists in order to properly celebrate religious feast days which occur during the fast. The food is meant to taste good, but it is very obviously lighter vegetarian cuisine.<br>Unlike the Catholics, fish is not licit during the fast (although it is seen as a &quot;less-bad&quot; food, in some places) and in fact in most places, the ideal fast excludes all dietary oils as well - which is by far the least-followed restriction among laymen for obvious reasons.<br>In this light, it is pretty clear where Beyond Meat and similar products belong. They are, at best, a &quot;less-bad&quot; food like fish, but fake meat products embody principles opposite to the ideal fasting food. The reason there is a &quot;debate&quot; is basically that disinterested laymen who might feel community pressure to fast will try to find loopholes in their daily life, and since the point of the fasting rule is humility, if you are another layman and not a priest it is considered counterproductive to insist and posture over the dietary rule that others are following, for the same reason that you aren&#039;t supposed to act prideful over people who don&#039;t fast.

When it gets up to a boil is when it gets cloudy. You can roast things in the oven for a different flavor. Get a good sense of what works for stock (parsnips, onions, celery) and what doesn&#039;t (cauliflower, potatoes). Look up recipes but know you can just use them as references. Make your life easier and put the peppercorns, etc. in a tea bag, the kind used for loose leaf. Also, you can save scraps in the freezer. Mushroom stems are one of my favorite things to add.<br><br>literally just boil meat and aromatics, skim the protein skuzz off the top as it cooks, and strain it with a fine mesh sieve at the end<br><br>Very lightly coat your bones and veg in a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste, roast or brown them in a pan for deeper flavor, go easy on the salt, and don&#039;t go too nuts with fennel unless you REALLY dig the anise flavor. Mushrooms also make a nice addition<br><br>Bones and veg have different peak extraction times, start with bones only and after 1-2 hours then add your veg. Roast your bones/trimmings and vegetables, separately, on two parchment-lined sheet trays - at 425F until they are as brown as you want them - especially the chicken bones. The vegetables will likely cook faster than the chicken bones so they are on a separate tray.<br><br><br>Gravy recipe:<br>Cook some flour in the pan juices. If you don&#039;t have enough pan juice and the flour isn&#039;t wet enough add some butter. Then gradually add water while whisking. Season with some salt and pepper and some soy sauce. Simple as.<br>I usually spatchcock a chicken and roast it on a bed of rosemary and garlic, and cover it in a butter rub. Then when it comes gravy time there&#039;s some rosemary leaves left in the pan and I&#039;ll leave a few cloves of garlic which break up under the whisk.", "time": 1674873202, "resto": 18863448}, {"no": 18865517, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)21:36:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18865294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18865294</a><br>Not everyone grew up the same, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty of people who grew up without homemade soups and stocks", "time": 1674873384, "resto": 18863448}, {"no": 18865537, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)21:40:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18865294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18865294</a><br>Nobody in my house made stock when I was growing up.

You will need a huge walk in fridge with rails and hooks to hang your meat and cure it before cutting.

Most farmers haven&#039;t figured out to have an internet presence, so taking a drive around the country-side or visiting local or regional farmer&#039;s markets is also an option. I lucked out and was able to join a private association to buy grass-fed beef and raw milk directly from a local farmer. We purchased half a cow that I split with my family, it worked out to be around $3.50/lb hanging weight after the processing fee for the butcher. Don&#039;t butcher it yourself, you&#039;d probably have to pick up the cow from the farm with a trailer and kill it yourself if you really wanted to do that. At that point you might as well just buy a calf and raise it yourself in your back yard or indoors. The beef we&#039;ve gotten locally is superior to anything in the grocery store. The flavor is out of this world, very buttery and earthy. My only complaint is that the cuts are fairly small compared to the grocery store, but it&#039;s still cheaper per lb buying wholesale cow. Maybe the size of the cuts were bc of how I told the butcher to process it, or because the breed they raise are smaller than other cattle, or because they don&#039;t raise them as long before they slaughter them. I don&#039;t really mind eating smaller cuts, but that&#039;s the biggest complaint I have for my local farmer. Also in general, local meat will always come frozen, even at the farmer&#039;s market, it&#039;s really not that big of a deal. If you&#039;re buying from farmer&#039;s market retail, then you&#039;ll pay more than the grocery store. We also got a quarter pig last year, worth it 100%. Deep freezer is necessary. Again, don&#039;t butcher it yourself plz.

There have been many stories of local farmers sending their high quality cows to a butcher and getting shit meat back, different animal received than the one sent in. Also buying via a private association means that the meat is not for sale to the public, and most likely, it is not USDA inspected, so there are looser restrictions on where they can process the meat. My local farmer has an open door/farm 24/7/365 policy where you&#039;re welcome to visit anytime as a club member and inspect for yourself what is going on at the farm, state and federal agents are not welcome since it is a private club. Being a private association, they are not allowed to sell to the public at farmer&#039;s markets. It saves on costs on public regulation which they pass on to the club members, and it has allowed them to stay in business and not go under as a local family farm. I&#039;ve been a member for almost 3 years and have always been satisfied with their quality, their chickens are better than any other farmer or grocery store in the region. They have raw milk butter that I don&#039;t really care for since it&#039;s very grassy and I don&#039;t like that flavor in my butter, but if you like Irish butter you&#039;d probably love it.
