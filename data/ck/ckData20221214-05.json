After the green tea leaves are evaporated at high temperature to soften the water, and then repeatedly fried, the leaves change from turquoise green to reddish brown. The green tea made with heavy fire is the characteristic of fried tea, and the soup is yellow and red. Jieyang Stir-Fried Tea is famous for its strong taste and a little sweetness, and it does not hurt the stomach after long-term drinking.</span><br>From another listing<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Traditional tea from Guangdong province. It has a strong characteristic aroma of green roasted tea and a bright complex taste.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is produced in the same places as the more famous Guandunskie oolongs, such as Feng Juan tribute Cong or Chaozhou cha. This tea is not known outside China. It can be said that this is a tea place in Guangdong province. Made from the same raw materials as most oolongs in this province. In the final stage of cooking tea is roasted by hand, in special boilers. Hence its strong and characteristic aroma and original taste, with a taste of fried chestnuts. Perfect for every day.</span><br>It seems like it repeatedly wok fried or otherwise roasted instead of the charcoal roast you usually see on oolongs. Im guessing the roast on the darker ones will be fairly intense which as the description says makes it easy on the stomach but the flavor isn&#039;t for everyone.

The pol memes in an of themselves serve as evidence, because the only evidence they need is that the herd agrees with them. It&#039;s some kind of memetic herd immunity. It&#039;s like arguing with the dumbassahedratron from aqua teen. Just disjointed memes, all as clever as a 10 year-old yelling fuck. They must all be coming from twitter, because they all do that thing where people&#039;s posts aren&#039;t a means to discussion but a means to &#039;dunk&#039; in such a way as to try to gain followers and approval. So you find hundreds of anons who both have no idea what they&#039;re talking about and no interest in the subject matter of a thread trying to dunk on OP. It&#039;s as if all they know about 4chan is the screenshots on reddit. It&#039;s so bad now that it&#039;s hard to talk around them, even with filters. <br>Seeing them in real life is 1000 times worse. It&#039;s like narwhall bacon with nazis.<br>And of course if anything is said about this, dozens of old fag pretenders rise up in chorus to say &quot;If you don&#039;t like it, just leave.&quot;", "time": 1670966075, "resto": 18685322}, {"no": 18693187, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)17:16:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18693037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18693037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;their</span><br>Evidently, your first board was /lgbt/.

I remember getting some &quot;Jump&quot; branded snuff in Austria several years ago, that was made by Poschl (I think it was an Austrian-market specific product). If you go to MrSnuff, you&#039;ll find they have a pretty wide variety of tinned snuffs. Unfortunately, I cannot order from them anymore (customs issues), and getting tobacco shipped from a continental online shop is an exercise in frustration and/or extreme patience. <br><br>I haven&#039;t tried many of their tinned snuffs, but I really liked Ozona President (which they apparently do not produce anymore, for some reason). Lowenprise is too cloying for my taste (too much anise). Gletscher Prise used to be good, but I think they changed the recipe, for the worse, a few years ago. Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess. However, Poschl schmalzlers are packed in sachets, and they tend to lose aroma if stored too long before use. You might occasionally get a dud.

I typically am a very moderate user however, keeping it mostly to 2-4 sniffs per day and don&#039;t have much of a problem with it. Also just to put it out there I blow and clean my nose grug style. Its a pretty private habit anyway since there aren&#039;t many users out there and I don&#039;t worry about it what people might think of it.

Mid tier or better pizza delivery is ~$30 where I live when you factor in all the delivery fees. The dough recipe I follow takes 5 minutes to make, plus four folds over an hour which equates to about 10 minutes of active time. It sits in the fridge overnight and then comes out to the counter the next day. My sauce recipe takes a half hour, but almost all of that is just simmering time. It takes another 5 minutes to prepare the pan and stretch the dough. 5 more for cutting toppings and assembling the pizza. Total active time is 20-30 minutes split over two days, and this scales nicely to two or three pies. I use pizza as a sink for my leftover meats and veggies from the previous few days which makes it even more convenient.

The restaurant is owned by Jorge L\u00f6derschnicht and his wife, Eva L\u00f6derschnicht. Jorge, pictured here, inherited the building from his mother 6 years ago and has adapted the restaurant to serve the needs of the burgeoning German/Puerto Rican fusion culture that has developed in the \u201cGermantown\u201d neighborhood. Once a bustling center of German immigrants, as immigration patterns changed the areas population became majority Hispanic, but the Germans of old did not neglect to pass down their cultural traditions to the newcomers. The menu at East Side reflects this blending of cultures with options such as \u201cChorizo Bratwurst\u201d, Saurkraut Empanadas, and their biggest seller, the Schnitzel with Rice and Beans Combo Meal. The restaurant frequently hosts local dance and music competitions featuring everything from Tango to Polka. The menu is listed in German, Spanish, and English, and it is customary for New Britain locals to order one item in each language.
