Far as dehydration salts are important for your body to stay hydrated.<br>In my experience pickle juice can work, but really it&#039;s best to just eat a fuck load of food b4 bed. Preferably something salty af. But it&#039;s 2 steps. The first step b4 that actually is to also have a gallon of water. It&#039;s a dollar from the grocery store do it I promise you. So eat that big meal, bed, wake up you&#039;re gonna want water like nothing else at 200 pounds 6 foot I drink about 1/3 of the gallon immediately upon waking. Then take a few guzzles about 5 to 10 minutes apart until you start pissing. By now, life doesn&#039;t feel like hell at all. However if you really want it gone, the only way I&#039;ve found is get moving start working hard as fuck sweat like hell. It&#039;ll feel like hell at first but eventually you&#039;ll forget you were even fucked up that morning in my experience by like 10 or 3 hours after waking.", "time": 1672803460, "resto": 18761287}, {"no": 18768832, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)22:41:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18761287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18761287</a>", "filename": "86588f_5655369", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 306, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 53, "tim": 1672803684779451, "time": 1672803684, "md5": "WVsO/PSQZT0+WG0C0PfmWw==", "fsize": 28991, "resto": 18761287}, {"no": 18768836, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)22:41:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18768817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18768817</a><br>Oh<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why not water from the spigget</span><br>No I&#039;m not too good for public water you can refill your gallon it&#039;s just having that quantity in a single jug that matters.

If you&#039;re talking about home cooking, the basic domestic Canadian staple aside from the obvious Kraft Dinner is scrumpy wumpy. You Americans sometimes get factory-made scrumpy, but the real thing is much simpler: you just take a slice of white bread, spread a 50/50 mixture of ketchup and margarine, roll the bread into a tube, and tie it up with edible culinary twine. After that, you can bake it, or fry it, or even grill it, although breakfast scrumpy is usually eaten cold/raw. For lunch and supper, it&#039;s dipped in the hot cheesy Kraft Dinner. For tea, sometimes you add jam, but using too much jam is considered a &quot;hoser&quot; (low-class) stereotype, avoided by most civilised people. In Quebec, scrumpy wumpy is usually available as a side dish as poutine shops; some french purists discourage it, but it&#039;s a natural companion to the leftover horse gravy. At the daily hockey matches during Canadian winter (September-April), you can also buy cold scrumpy on stick that&#039;s been freezing in the snow. What a treat! That&#039;s one of the main things that Canuck expats miss when traveling abroad. Because sure, you can often find store-bought scrumpy wumpy in areas with many Canadian immigrants, but the manufacturers usually get it wrong somehow, like using butter instead of margarine, or using the wrong kind of jam. (Proper scrumpy jam comes ONLY from the Faggleberry bush in the Northern Territories; it practically supports their whole economy.)<br><br>I hoped this helped, and please do consider supporting Canadian tourism!

Typically, berries are juicy, rounded, brightly colored, sweet, sour or tart, and do not have a stone or pit, although many pips or seeds may be present.[1] Common examples are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, red currants, white currants and blackcurrants.[2] In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits.[3][4][5]<br><br> Japanese barberries<br><br> Japanese barberries<br> Bilberry<br><br> Bilberry<br> Red currants<br><br> Red currants<br> Honeysuckle<br><br> Honeysuckle<br> Gooseberries<br><br> Gooseberries<br> Cloudberry<br><br> Cloudberry<br> Highbush blueberries<br><br> Highbush blueberries<br> Blackberries<br><br> Blackberries<br><br>In common usage, the term &quot;berry&quot; differs from the scientific or botanical definition of a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion (pericarp). The botanical definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known or referred to as berries, such as grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, bananas, and chili peppers. Fruits commonly considered berries but excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are aggregate fruits and mulberries, which are multiple fruits. Watermelons and pumpkins are giant berries that fall into the category &quot;pepos&quot;.

Mushrooms are a fungus, and so is mold, which means that in order to grow mushrooms you need to essentially prepare a perfect environment for mold to grow, but without growing mold. The only way to do this is by physically preventing a single mold spore to come in. So when you open up the mushrooms, do so by ripping them, and then use a flame -sterilized scalpel to carefully get out a piece of flesh.

They are more closely related to humans than they are to plants. Basically, the entire organism is a big fluffy network called the mycelium, which in the wild, lives normally underground or inside trees. And it eats food like animals. The mushroom itself, which you eat, is basically just a sex organ of the mycelium. It sprouts forth from the soil or out the side of a tree to release spores in very certain conditions.

When you&#039;re making your fruiting blocks, the best source for sawdust is hardwood pellets used for pellet grills and smokers. You can buy hickory pellets at Lowes for 37 cents a pound. Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold. So with these more effective substrates, you need to pressure cook them just like you did the grain jars.", "filename": "IMG_20221231_160402_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672812958863218, "time": 1672812958, "md5": "PWaoSdkvXVk110erHFxGKg==", "fsize": 406764, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769271, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18769113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18769113</a><br>There&#039;s outdoor cultivation methods which mimic the natural environment much more closely. If you grow mushrooms outside it&#039;s pretty similar to composting and you don&#039;t need to sterilize anything. However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years.

Ketchup&#039;s sweetness overpowers the flavor of the hotdog, as it does with most meats, making it pointless to consume said meat for the taste of meat.<br><br>For the older generation, you would only put ketchup on stuff you cant stand the flavor of. Before the 1990s, most people would only consume something like 60 grams of sugar a week, or even a month. Most people in the older generation grew up enjoying mostly salty or savory foods, or even fatty foods. Sweetness was a rare treat, reserved solely for deserts or maybe certain drinks. Even soda back then was sipped, not gulped. A single bottle of cola could last you all day long. The wide mouth can, and the implimentation of drinking as much soda as you could started in the 1990s.<br><br> So if you say you love hotdogs, then you obviously cant be putting ketchup on it because that would mean you dont like it. This doesnt make sense to zoomers, because zoomers consume all their food with at least 20 grams of sugar per serving. So to them, of course you are going to put more sugar on their favorite processed food.", "time": 1672969336, "resto": 18772118}, {"no": 18775723, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)21:21:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18772151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18772151</a><br>Its a fucking roll with sausage and condiments (if prefered).

Best I&#039;ve been to was probably Tooth and Nail Brewing in Ottawa. The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

His Patreon subscribers know to order it as a \u201cBig Brown Dump\u201d and Alton isn&#039;t shy about giving a little extra to people who order this way, knowing they\u2019re what\u2019s called a \u201cBrown butthole booster\u201d and thus one of his own.", "filename": "1669188005025931", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 348, "h": 348, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672990431674367, "time": 1672990431, "md5": "uYNU7yiZ64aGpIKcLmK1FQ==", "fsize": 41479, "resto": 18776295}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18771531, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:11:28", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/tea/ Vintage Edition", "com": "/tea/ - /tsg/<br>tea general<br><br>This thread is for discussing teas, tisanes, and other herbal infusions.<br>info: types of tea, where to get tea, how to brew tea<br>https://pastebin.com/80GeeXJV<br>Previous thread: <a href=\"/ck/thread/18754590#p18754590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754590</a>", "filename": "1672873871845", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 612, "h": 612, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672873888633373, "time": 1672873888, "md5": "eRfiOd1xx39qTswvuPMRgg==", "fsize": 108283, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "tea-vintage-edition", "replies": 107, "images": 21, "unique_ips": 17, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 18771546, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:14:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "pastebin anon here again<br>Im working on revamping the western brewing instructions, these are meant to be for beginners and Im assuming they will at most rebrew one time<br>If you can test any of these and give feedback or have other comments let me know<br> For black tea use 1-1.5 grams per 100ml of water, use boiling or freshly boiled water, brew for 3 minutes.<br> For green tea use 1-2 grams per 100ml of water, use 70c-75c water, brew for 3 minutes<br> For green oolongs use 1-2 grams per 100ml of water, use 80c water, brew for 3-4 minutes<br> for dark or roasted oolongs use 1.5-2.5 grams per 100ml of water, use 90c-100c water, brew for 4-5 minutes<br> for ripe puer or other fermented teas 1.5-2 grams per 100ml of water, use boiling or freshly boiled water, brew for 5-7 minutes<br> for young green puer strongly consider gongfu brewing instead, 1.5-2 grams per 100ml of water, use 90c water, brew for 2-3 minutes<br>for yellow tea? 1-1.5 grams per 100ml of water, use 80c water, brew for 2-3 minutes", "time": 1672874096, "resto": 18771531}, {"no": 18771577, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:23:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Buy Cruz De Malta<br>https://www.amazon.com/Cruz-de-Malt<wbr>a-3-Kilos/dp/B004OPAI5E", "time": 1672874591, "resto": 18771531}, {"no": 18771612, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:34:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Let me know how you like that yiwu mountain tea sampler, it looks tempting.

This is based on several papers I can link if you&#039;re curious, plus I tested with a thermapen. There&#039;s not a lot of nuance.

The hotter water is drawing out some notes of the Liu An Gua Pian that is desirable. The new method is still very light, but this is also a lighter style of green tea. If requested I may do a sencha to see how it works for a stronger japanese green. The new comes forward a lot more with the nutty chinese green notes and has a floralness that the old method lacks.

The old way draws out much more of the floral notes of the oolong, and some honeysuckle and a bit of nuttiness, but overall is a pretty weak cup. Would probably shine when eating some spicy, greasy chinese food like all oolongs do though.<br>The new method has a bit more penetrating fruitiness, but still is a bit watered down. Kinda has this hard to describe berry note with the tiniest bit of floralness. Its amazing how much the brew actually changes things in oolong. Benefit for the new method is it cooled down to drinking temperature much faster. Its very hard to pick a winner, I genuinely think the new needs a higher brewing temperature to open up the leaf and extract more flavor, and both just need more leaf to water.
