Best I&#039;ve been to was probably Tooth and Nail Brewing in Ottawa. The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

I&#039;ve certainly had better espressos, but then again, I&#039;ve often had much worse espressos at specialty coffee shops working with several thousand dollars worth of equipment. Obviously the next step is to try a better bean, and luckily, there&#039;s no shortage of specialty roasters around me. I think at this point, though, the hurdle is going to be brew temperature, which is just an inherent flaw not just with this machine, but with any manual machine that isn&#039;t powered. In fact, I feel like temperature would be an issue even with a more expensive manual machine like a Flair, simply because they tend to be made of machined aluminum, and I already know from being a PC gamer, that aluminum is a fantastic heatsink material, which makes it a terrible material for a water chamber that needs to remain at a certain temp.<br><br>So now comes the big, obvious question: can I get a decent espresso machine for under $300, ideally one with a PID, or at the very least, one that self heats the water chamber?

However, for a couple of reasons I\u2019d recommend stretching to a dual-walled, stainless-steel version if your budget allows. Primarily, I recommend these because they\u2019re unbreakable and glass most definitely is not. More expensive glass options generally have better and stronger glass, but a stainless-steel version will last a lifetime. Secondly, for those with a concern about the loss in temperature with a longer brew time, like the one I recommend, a dual-walled, stainless-steel press will retain the heat much better than glass.<br><br>Some people do say they can taste something \u2018off\u2019 or metallic with stainless-steel brewers, but in blind testing I\u2019ve never been able to detect any difference. However, it is possible some people have a particular sensitivity that I do not.<br><br>Maintenance: Soap and water should be used after every brew. If for any reason you start to get a brown patina building up on the brewer, then dissolve about 1 tablespoon (10g) of espresso-machine cleaner (I use Cafiza, but other brands also work well) per litre of very hot water and soak for a few hours before rinsing thoroughly.", "filename": "PXL_20230103_182701707", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1409, "h": 1878, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672770638269458, "time": 1672770638, "md5": "8nemhBDj6Ve54b5WpdyVHQ==", "fsize": 898736, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767029, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:34:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767022</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THIS HOW YOU DO THINGS BOOK TOLD ME SO</span><br>kys", "time": 1672770855, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767033, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:34:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18766205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18766205</a><br>I have no idea how to and probably will be too much work<br><a href=\"#p18766554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18766554</a><br>We came from such a dark age.", "time": 1672770878, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767037, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:35:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18766995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18766995</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;french press</span><br>oh i thought you meant aeropress. <br>well in this case AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHAHAHAAHA", "time": 1672770930, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767044, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:36:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767029</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THIS HOW YOU DO THINGS BOOK TOLD ME SO</span><br>guess you failed 3rd grade then.", "time": 1672770991, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767046, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:37:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767029</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My coffee tastes bad when I follow instructions</span>", "filename": "nsplash", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 657, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672771023727146, "time": 1672771023, "md5": "yeyVbeI+kgQUBAUGHN5tLg==", "fsize": 254253, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767062, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:42:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767044</a><br><a href=\"#p18767046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767046</a><br>let me guess, vaxxed?", "time": 1672771327, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767085, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:52:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How does Jimmy brew his coffee?", "time": 1672771942, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767089, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767085</a>", "filename": "180d6a4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 466, "h": 687, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672772036932907, "time": 1672772036, "md5": "aeXo3n5wNLLcGVcSdjsRog==", "fsize": 159551, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767097, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:56:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767062</a><br>Fuck no.

The only way to do this is by physically preventing a single mold spore to come in. So when you open up the mushrooms, do so by ripping them, and then use a flame -sterilized scalpel to carefully get out a piece of flesh.

When you&#039;re making your fruiting blocks, the best source for sawdust is hardwood pellets used for pellet grills and smokers. You can buy hickory pellets at Lowes for 37 cents a pound. Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold. So with these more effective substrates, you need to pressure cook them just like you did the grain jars.", "filename": "IMG_20221231_160402_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672812958863218, "time": 1672812958, "md5": "PWaoSdkvXVk110erHFxGKg==", "fsize": 406764, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769271, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18769113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18769113</a><br>There&#039;s outdoor cultivation methods which mimic the natural environment much more closely. If you grow mushrooms outside it&#039;s pretty similar to composting and you don&#039;t need to sterilize anything. However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years. But that&#039;s only worth it because you might as well do it, I wouldn&#039;t rely on that as a reliable farming method.<br><br>Another cool thing you can do is to inoculate an entire log with spores or liquid culture from a log colonizing species. I have seen it done where someone gets a whole log, then drills a few holes in it and inseminates the log with mycelium, then plugs the holes and wait for mushrooms to start popping out of the log. On Paul Stamets website he sells mushroom plugs that you can stick right into a log for this purpose.

Far as dehydration salts are important for your body to stay hydrated.<br>In my experience pickle juice can work, but really it&#039;s best to just eat a fuck load of food b4 bed. Preferably something salty af. But it&#039;s 2 steps. The first step b4 that actually is to also have a gallon of water. It&#039;s a dollar from the grocery store do it I promise you. So eat that big meal, bed, wake up you&#039;re gonna want water like nothing else at 200 pounds 6 foot I drink about 1/3 of the gallon immediately upon waking. Then take a few guzzles about 5 to 10 minutes apart until you start pissing. By now, life doesn&#039;t feel like hell at all. However if you really want it gone, the only way I&#039;ve found is get moving start working hard as fuck sweat like hell. It&#039;ll feel like hell at first but eventually you&#039;ll forget you were even fucked up that morning in my experience by like 10 or 3 hours after waking.", "time": 1672803460, "resto": 18761287}, {"no": 18768832, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)22:41:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18761287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18761287</a>", "filename": "86588f_5655369", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 306, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 53, "tim": 1672803684779451, "time": 1672803684, "md5": "WVsO/PSQZT0+WG0C0PfmWw==", "fsize": 28991, "resto": 18761287}, {"no": 18768836, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)22:41:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18768817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18768817</a><br>Oh<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why not water from the spigget</span><br>No I&#039;m not too good for public water you can refill your gallon it&#039;s just having that quantity in a single jug that matters.

PG Tips has 2.9g. ISO 3103 traditionally used 2.83g based on an old sixpence coin. This goes into a 6-10 ounce sized cup, or 140ml for ISO 3103.<br>Teabag packaging directions are typically 2-5 minutes. ISO 3103 is 6 minutes for black tea with milk, 3-5 minutes for other types depending on how chopped up it is.<br>Green tea is fine up to 80-85C and others can use off-the-boil or more precisely 86-90C is ideal. This is based on several papers I can link if you&#039;re curious, plus I tested with a thermapen. There&#039;s not a lot of nuance. Either the tea has catechins damaged by boiling water (green) or it doesn&#039;t.<br><br>Also, u guise, keep in mind it&#039;s often mixed with milk and/or sugar. Astringency is &quot;body&quot; which is desirable to an extent. Upscale stores unironically offer CTC and African tea.
