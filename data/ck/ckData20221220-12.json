If you compared them to any true gas station they&#039;d blow them out of the water.", "time": 1671498181, "resto": 18712232}, {"no": 18717736, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)20:08:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18717471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18717471</a><br>my man", "time": 1671498499, "resto": 18712232}, {"no": 18717979, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:27:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18716765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18716765</a><br>2 years ago gas station shit was overpriced because you can get it basically anywhere at anytime. now theres no difference in price because even at places like Save A Lot that carry TJ mommy&#039;s the prices are the same.", "time": 1671503245, "resto": 18712232}, {"no": 18718038, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:51:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18717687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18717687</a><br>What the fuck is wrong with your stepdad?", "time": 1671504660, "resto": 18712232}, {"no": 18718044, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:53:24", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "s-l500", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 332, "h": 500, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671504804656016, "time": 1671504804, "md5": "7VrlHNa5QS8EEVz6KuQg/A==", "fsize": 35061, "resto": 18712232}, {"no": 18718101, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:13:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18713156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18713156</a><br>I don&#039;t even think he&#039;s being a chud, 7/11 in Asia is something else, man.", "time": 1671506022, "resto": 18712232}, {"no": 18718266, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:54:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18717687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18717687</a><br>I would do the same, fuck your white trash stepdad.", "time": 1671508477, "resto": 18712232}, {"no": 18718298, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:02:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18713100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18713100</a><br>Tiujana Mama gave me the hot snakes like none other.

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea.

Puerh is probably more or less the fancy stuff with the teapots designed around it and the culture of gifting it to your boss and such. But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either). Oolong is somewhat fancy, given as gifts and growers have some pride in it, takes some technical skill to manufacture consistently.

The youtuber idiot &quot;the cowboy kent rollins&quot; or whatever the fuck he goes by is a perfect example of this kind of shill. He has videos where he takes a supposedly new pan and cooks bacon in it, then claiming that it didn&#039;t stick, even once. <br><br>Here&#039;s what happens to a new cast iron pan when you cook three slices of bacon in it. Each slice of bacon literally stripped the seasoning off the pan in the shape of each bacon slice. <br><br>That said, <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything sticks even when copious amounts of oil/butter/etc are applied</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have to &quot;season&quot; it after every single use or it will shit the bed and die</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not allowed to wash it</span><br>I have other pans that are so well seasoned that I *can* cook bacon on them without any sticking or seasoning loss. However, when you get a new one, it can be a challenge to get to that point--and, once you get to that point, it&#039;s also possible to thin the seasoning so much in cooking with proteins that food sticks again. The key is, ironically, to actually wash the pan really well after cooking. Scrape off all the food, and use a chain mail rag if you need to, and cook in oil, at a very high heat, as much as possible during this time. Frying up potatoes is a really good way to build up seasoning.<br><br>Also, these are good points: <a href=\"#p18705004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18705004</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;properly preheat the thing before cooking in it.</span><br><a href=\"#p18705502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18705502</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I start heating the pan I put a drop of oil, probably half a teaspoon or less for a 12-inch skillet, in the center and then spread it around with a crumpled sheet of paper towel.</span><br>I don&#039;t think too much oil is going to cause sticking, or at least I&#039;ve never seen that happen when I cook with a lot of oil, but you really don&#039;t need much. Spreading a thin film of oil can even help prevent bacon from sticking.

Women swoon and men shit themselves in preparation to run. But they can&#039;t. We&#039;re in an office setting and they failed to deliver. I watch in silence as they start to stutter up excuses. I simply stay silent even longer and they scrounge to come up with solutions. But I never show excessive reactions. A man who loses his temper is worthless, as is a lion who shows his claws at the slightest provocation. Let them always be aware of them, of the looming threat that may come for them if they do not perform as expected. This will maximize their fear.

Most fast food has specialized ingredients and methods of preparing their food because they don&#039;t want it to be easily replicated. Think of how distinctive the smell of certain chains are. You can&#039;t get the certain type of cheese McDonald&#039;s uses, or their buns, you can only ever approximate. Taco Bell&#039;s only &quot;signature&quot; item is their beef seasoning, which is really the lowest tier of Tex-mex spice mixture, and a few of their sauces, which thankfully have their main ingredients listed in the name (Chipotle, Creamy Jalapeno, etc.) But all their ingredients are just common grocery store items: fresh vegetables, tortillas, refried beans, cheese, potatoes, sour cream, guacamole, etc. Mexican food is incredibly simple to prepare. People don&#039;t eat it for its complexity, but for its generous portions, and high quality ingredients. That&#039;s why people love small local mexican joints and taco trucks, and why Taco bell fails so miserably.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taco bell is actually relatively fast and not massively overpriced compared to pretty much every other chain these days</span><br><br>Completely incorrect. Taco Bell is a massive ripoff when you look at the quality of the food.

If you go to MrSnuff, you&#039;ll find they have a pretty wide variety of tinned snuffs.

Lowenprise is too cloying for my taste (too much anise). Gletscher Prise used to be good, but I think they changed the recipe, for the worse, a few years ago. Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess. However, Poschl schmalzlers are packed in sachets, and they tend to lose aroma if stored too long before use. You might occasionally get a dud.

I thought wipipo knew this already, but you&#039;ll never ever see a Chinese restaurant with equal parts Whites and patrons. Sometimes there a mix, but never will there be equal parts. Every single dish and how they&#039;re prepared is totally different. Have you ever noticed how Americanized Chinese food is soaked in corn syrup and is overly sweet, and how most authentic Chinese food is parts of animals most westerners have never heard of? I&#039;m gonna give you guys a little hint, people from different cultures ear different things. <br><br>That being said, if the orange chicken fried rice combo + egg roll and soda is all you care about, then that&#039;s fine, you can enjoy whatever you want. Here&#039;s a little tip to help you distinguish if the restaurant you&#039;re about to visit caters to westerners or to the Chinese: if the restaurant has the terms: Star, Wok, Garden, Kitchen, or Palace, it&#039;s probably gonna be a Americanized Chinese place. Typically they&#039;ll throw that term behind some abjective like Golden or Lucky or just China, so you&#039;ll get places like Lucky Wok or Golden Star or China Star or China Kitchen. In fact I&#039;m pretty sure a lot of your ears just perked up because you recognize that naming convention/I&#039;ve just named your favorite Chinese spot. <br><br>A Chinese restaurant that caters to Chinese people typically has the region of the cuisine in it. It might still follow a similar naming convention: the rules aren&#039;t set in stone. But if the restaurant&#039;s name is Royal Hunan, Shandong Kitchen, or Sichuan Palace, there&#039;s a good chance it&#039;ll be more authentic, if that&#039;s what your looking for.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.
