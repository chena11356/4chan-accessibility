Some studies have found that the high levels of omega-6 fatty acids in these oils may interfere with the metabolism of fat in the body, leading to weight gain. Additionally, seed oils are often used in processed and fast foods, which are known to be high in calories and contribute to the obesity epidemic.<br><br>Overall, it is important to consume seed oils in moderation and to choose sources of healthy fats, such as olive oil, avocado oil, and coconut oil, which have a lower omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and may provide some protective health benefits.<br><br>Another potential concern with seed oils is their high linoleic acid content.

I doubt it\u2019s a problem, but I wanted to note it. <br>After brewing the new method (right) turned out a more greenish-yellow, while the old (left) turned out a more subdued color. In the picture it looks almost empty, but its a noticeable pale green tint in reality. <br>The old is very\u2026watery. Tastes like hot water with a hint of tea. The hotter water is drawing out some notes of the Liu An Gua Pian that is desirable. The new method is still very light, but this is also a lighter style of green tea. If requested I may do a sencha to see how it works for a stronger japanese green. The new comes forward a lot more with the nutty chinese green notes and has a floralness that the old method lacks. It doesn\u2019t have any bitterness despite the longer brew time.

The old way draws out much more of the floral notes of the oolong, and some honeysuckle and a bit of nuttiness, but overall is a pretty weak cup. Would probably shine when eating some spicy, greasy chinese food like all oolongs do though.<br>The new method has a bit more penetrating fruitiness, but still is a bit watered down. Kinda has this hard to describe berry note with the tiniest bit of floralness. Its amazing how much the brew actually changes things in oolong. Benefit for the new method is it cooled down to drinking temperature much faster. Its very hard to pick a winner, I genuinely think the new needs a higher brewing temperature to open up the leaf and extract more flavor, and both just need more leaf to water.

Mushrooms are a fungus, and so is mold, which means that in order to grow mushrooms you need to essentially prepare a perfect environment for mold to grow, but without growing mold. The only way to do this is by physically preventing a single mold spore to come in. So when you open up the mushrooms, do so by ripping them, and then use a flame -sterilized scalpel to carefully get out a piece of flesh.

When you&#039;re making your fruiting blocks, the best source for sawdust is hardwood pellets used for pellet grills and smokers. You can buy hickory pellets at Lowes for 37 cents a pound. Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold. So with these more effective substrates, you need to pressure cook them just like you did the grain jars.", "filename": "IMG_20221231_160402_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672812958863218, "time": 1672812958, "md5": "PWaoSdkvXVk110erHFxGKg==", "fsize": 406764, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769271, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18769113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18769113</a><br>There&#039;s outdoor cultivation methods which mimic the natural environment much more closely. If you grow mushrooms outside it&#039;s pretty similar to composting and you don&#039;t need to sterilize anything. However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years. But that&#039;s only worth it because you might as well do it, I wouldn&#039;t rely on that as a reliable farming method.<br><br>Another cool thing you can do is to inoculate an entire log with spores or liquid culture from a log colonizing species. I have seen it done where someone gets a whole log, then drills a few holes in it and inseminates the log with mycelium, then plugs the holes and wait for mushrooms to start popping out of the log. On Paul Stamets website he sells mushroom plugs that you can stick right into a log for this purpose.

If it&#039;s lumpy or uneven, or the casing layer is not the same thickness all over, you&#039;re more likely to get fewer larger mushrooms rather than an even canopy of smaller ones.

With any new liquor, look for tastings in your area and go -- even if they cost some $50 at the door, IT&#039;S ALWAYS WORTH IT (not for wine or beer where there&#039;s a ton of free tastings however). <br><br>Adding to Bon Appetit&#039;s list, there are agave spirits in general including mezcals (of which tequila is of course a subtype), but don&#039;t dive into all this right away unless you live in Mexico or near the border and can access good bottles on the cheap. There are also non-100% agave spirits (mixtos), which should always be avoided in the U.S., but can again be fair game to explore in Mexico.<br><br>Unaged is cheaper, extra aged is more expensive, just like with any other liquor. Unaged can be just as good to sip as extra aged, just like any other liquor.

My go-to method of heating up beans is to put them in a ramekin, put a piece of American cheese on top which prevents the top from getting dehydrated, and then I cook them in my toaster over for like 30-60mins at 200F. At the end, you can mix the cheese into the beans and then use if for whatever, maybe put it on toast.
