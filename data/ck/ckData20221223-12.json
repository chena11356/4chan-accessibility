It&#039;s just about doing quirky stuff for the sake of being quirky and charging a lot of money for it.<br><br><a href=\"#p18717564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18717564</a><br>Boy does this image sum up the problem with these fucking places. Dude doesn&#039;t give a shit about the food or how it&#039;s being served, he just wants to sit there filming a shitty movie of the food on his smartphone. Whoever filmed the video is doing the same thing.

This is because beer is often stored and transported at room temperature before it is sold, and it is not necessary to refrigerate it in order to preserve its quality. There are several reasons why beer is traditionally sold at room temperature in Europe. One reason is that beer is often sold in small quantities, and refrigerating it would be inefficient. In addition, many European beers are designed to be served at cellar temperature, which is slightly cooler than room temperature. It is also worth noting that refrigeration technology has not always been widely available, and in some parts of Europe, it is still not as common as it is in other parts of the world. However, this is changing as refrigeration becomes more widespread, and it is now possible to find beer that is sold chilled in many European countries.

The height of each dam varies; two dams stand about ten feet tall and the third stands about 20 feet tall. The total amount of water collected behind these dams totals about 40 acre feet; enough to fill almost 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These man-made reservoirs feature boat docks, boats, and were stocked by Harrington with trout and Bluegill for recreational fishing.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The state first identified Harrington&#039;s illegal water use more than ten years ago and initiated enforcement action to discontinue his illegal use of water. After numerous attempts by OWRD and the Watermaster to achieve voluntary compliance, the Department enlisted the assistance of the Oregon State Police in 2002. Citations were issued, and Harrington pleaded guilty to several violations. He was assessed a nominal fine and ordered to drain the three reservoirs, which he did. However, Harrington again closed the headgates in 2004 and refilled the reservoirs.

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea. But japanese green tea is stupidly harsh on the stomach anyways so maybe its for the best it&#039;s harder to drink a liter of it.", "time": 1671200821, "resto": 18703371}, {"no": 18704336, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)09:35:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704312</a><br>Not specifically asking about ground Chinese tea.

Puerh is probably more or less the fancy stuff with the teapots designed around it and the culture of gifting it to your boss and such. But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either). Oolong is somewhat fancy, given as gifts and growers have some pride in it, takes some technical skill to manufacture consistently.

Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess.

Today we will tell you how to cook tasty and healthy substitute of this very kvass without spending money on chemicals from the stores. This is an ancient Russian drink \u2014 meat kvass. There are many recipes of meat kvass, now, and in Russia, too, each hostess had her own, but we will stop on this one. Well, let&#039;s begin.<br><br>1. Prepare the meat. Any kind will do, but not poultry, although, you can try. We can also use by-products. The meat should be well washed with water and put in a jar.<br><br>2. Boil water. For 500 grams of meat about 2 liters of water. After pouring boiling water over the meat, cover the jar with a cloth and leave it for 5 hours. This way the meat must infuse and acquire color and flavor.<br><br>3. Now add sugar. In general, I add 50 grams for each liter, but here it all depends on your taste. Then you have to put the kvass in a warm place for two weeks. Every day stir it and remove the resulting thick foam. It is important to keep the place dark, and the sun away from the fermenting kvass.<br><br>4. Strain the finished drink through gauze. Kvass can be stored in the refrigerator. Meat kvass is used for various cold soups. Do not throw out the meat in the jars. Add more fresh meat to it and you can make meat kvass again.", "filename": "1671694660567", "ext": ".png", "w": 700, "h": 596, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1671694658723557, "time": 1671694658, "md5": "Xu3Y6GfHA9D5+Hm2UdiNjA==", "fsize": 623573, "resto": 18724568}, {"no": 18726063, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:38:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18724615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18724615</a><br><br>Are you equally baffled that buffaloes does have wings or are you just underage?", "time": 1671694739, "resto": 18724568}, {"no": 18726410, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)06:16:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You are supposed to chase it (drink another fluid immediately after it) for stronger spirits.<br>try real fruit juice, water, soda, etc", "time": 1671707808, "resto": 18724568}, {"no": 18726422, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)06:21:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I find alcohol easier to consume when it&#039;s hot.

Some options might include cumin, chili powder, paprika, oregano, and cayenne pepper.<br><br>Include more vegetables: Adding more vegetables to your chili can help to give it more depth and flavor. You can try adding diced bell peppers, onions, carrots, or zucchini to the pot.<br><br>Use better quality meat: Using high-quality ground beef chuck can make a big difference in the flavor and texture of your chili. Look for ground beef that is well-marbled with fat, as it will be more flavorful and tender.<br><br>Experiment with different types of beans: While kidney beans are a classic choice for chili, you could try using other types of beans as well. Black beans, pinto beans, and lentils are all good options.<br><br>Add some acidity: A little bit of acidity can help to balance out the rich, savory flavors in your chili. You can try adding a splash of vinegar or a squeeze of lime juice, or use diced tomatoes that are packed in tomato juice rather than water.<br><br>Experiment with different types of tomatoes: In addition to stewed and diced tomatoes, you can try using crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, or tomato paste to give your chili a different flavor and texture.<br><br>I hope these suggestions are helpful!

Procedural<br>Start with dried BEANS, canned ones have already been cooked at far too high a heat and will turn to shit. I recommend pressure cooking your own rehydrated beans, this is also far cheaper. <br><br>Ground beef often has too much fat to sear, don&#039;t be scared to pour that fat off then add it back in with the onions.<br><br>Use whole spice, fry the whole spice off in vegetable oil, then either blend the mixture or just use the oil. This is unfamiliar to Americans but Indians and Chinese understand you get more value and fresher spices. Again add this with the onions and you speed up the cooking time. <br><br>Add the beans after the onions are done, this avoids over cooking your beans. <br><br>Add stock rather than water. <br>I boil beef bones then ladle the stock in as the chili reduces so it&#039;s not dry. This adds nutrition and means you can use less ground beef. <br><br>B. Ingredients<br>Whole spice is always preferable.<br>Don&#039;t buy meat which was butchered 5 days ago then pumped full of water, or mince that&#039;s half fat, the fat will merely stop you getting a good sear and float to the top as an oil slick. <br><br>When it comes to tomatoes make sure you&#039;re buying sauce tomatoes to make sauce. You may find passata is a better option, only use tomato paste if you can&#039;t get sauce tomatoes or is significantly cheaper. <br><br>Cinnamon lifts a chili up, so does bay leaf. Go easy on the garlic.<br><br>Remember onions are for flavor, huge flavorless onions make a sweet, flavorless chili. All things being equal buy shallottes, there&#039;s nothing wrong with wild onions or a mix of different onions. <br><br>Don&#039;t chili corn. It&#039;s shit and if you really want corn add it when serving otherwise again you&#039;re just boiling the sugar out of it. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 buthurt about not using a single pot</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 buthurt from Texan autists</span>", "filename": "20221221_201534", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4128, "h": 3096, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671764046259381, "time": 1671764046, "md5": "9XikuqcfiWHLzYpReFRTXA==", "fsize": 3727527, "resto": 18727150}, {"no": 18729042, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:58:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18727150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18727150</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beans</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rice</span><br>That&#039;s not chili.", "time": 1671764280, "resto": 18727150}, {"no": 18729081, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)22:11:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Also the same rules for hard spice apply to chili. Use fresh chili with onions, failing that blend whole dried chillies (don&#039;t fry them off just drop them into the hot oil before blending) failing that chili flakes.

Don&#039;t add table condiments as ingredients.<br>Don&#039;t cook with cheese, cheese is best added when serving. Cheese is expensive and boiling the dairy fats out of it only adds to the oil slick. <br><br>Rice never goes in a chili, you serve rice as a side. Cooking it creates a clag of starch and makes reheating a pain and freezing a waste. <br>If you want to make chili as if it was a Spanish Paella you would have to cook the whole thing like a paella and at that point.<br><br>It&#039;s totally acceptable to cook chili in a clay pot/tangine/ Dutch oven.

Or preassure cook.<br><br>Never add salt, msg, or any other soluble mineral prior to reducing. It shits me to tears how many people don&#039;t know this and how many chefs persist in this.

Cheese can add flavor and texture to a dish, but it is also high in fat and calories. If you are trying to reduce the amount of cheese you consume, you can try using less cheese or using a lower-fat variety.

One reason is that it requires the eggs to be cooked to the right consistency, which can be difficult to achieve if you&#039;re not careful. The eggs should be just cooked, but not scrambled, so it&#039;s important to temper them properly. To do this, you can slowly drizzle in a little bit of the hot pasta water while whisking the eggs and cheese together. This will help to cook the eggs gently and create a smooth, creamy sauce.<br><br>Another reason carbonara can be difficult is that it&#039;s easy to overcook the pasta. The pasta should be cooked to al dente, which means it should still have a little bit of bite to it. Overcooking the pasta can cause it to become mushy, which can ruin the texture of the dish.<br><br>Finally, it&#039;s important to use good quality ingredients in your carbonara. The pasta should be high-quality semolina flour pasta, and the eggs and cheese should be fresh and of good quality. Using fresh ingredients will help to ensure that your carbonara turns out flavorful and delicious.<br><br>I hope these tips help!

You could also try covering the top of the cake with foil after it has been in the oven for a while to prevent it from getting too dark.<br><br>To make the cake moister and more dense, you could try increasing the amount of ricotta or adding some sour cream or yogurt to the batter. You could also try adding some extra egg yolks to the batter to make it more rich and creamy.<br><br>If you want to use regular flour instead of cornstarch, you can use all-purpose flour in place of the cornstarch. The texture of the cake may be slightly denser and less fluffy, but it should still work well.<br><br>For a glaze that is less sweet, you could try making a simple syrup by boiling equal parts sugar and water until the sugar is dissolved, and then brushing it with lemon juice or another citrus juice.
