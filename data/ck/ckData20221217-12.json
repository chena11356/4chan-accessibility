I went in the store and a very nice employee, Megan, asked if she could help me. I showed her my coupon and said this was my first time there. I asked for suggestions and she said she liked the roasted turkey sandwich. Since ham is right in the name, I said I think I would try their classic ham sandwich with a side of Bacon Broccolli. I didn&#039;t take a picture of the items, as I forgot and I was hungry. The classic ham sandwich came on a croissant and it was very, very good. The Bacon Broccolli was also very good.<br>On my receipt there was a survey. If I completed the survey I would get a code for a bogo sandwich. So of course I did the survey. Then today I went back to the store. Megan was there, as was the owner. I decided to try the turkey and got 2 of the roasted turkey sandwiches. One for me and one for my hubby. These came on a long roll and were just as good as the ham sandwich I had the day before.<br>The owner rang me up but didn&#039;t know how to enter my phone number so I would receive \u201cpiggy points\u201d for my purchase. Megan came over and showed him how to do it. I said to him \u201cYou&#039;re the owner and you don&#039;t know how to do that?\u201d To which he responded he&#039;s usually in the back and that the program was new. I asked if Megan was going to make my sandwiches and he joked about me not trusting his sandwich-making abilities. I said, well you didn&#039;t know how to give me points. He said yes, Megan would be making my sandwiches. I liked that he could take a joke.<br>If you are looking for a great ham or turkey sandwich, I suggest giving Honeybaked Ham a try. I know I will be going back there again!!", "time": 1671222924, "resto": 18703984}, {"no": 18705359, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:36:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "R A D U L A", "filename": "Gotta go fast", "ext": ".webm", "w": 460, "h": 460, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671222980877936, "time": 1671222980, "md5": "cTsv2fzg9fSY4NsABGdoUA==", "fsize": 1530686, "resto": 18703984}, {"no": 18705363, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:36:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704503</a><br>feelsgoodman", "filename": "sinfuld", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 355, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1671223003231227, "time": 1671223003, "md5": "vjneBSTBeohsfs1QR6h2Sw==", "fsize": 2094788, "resto": 18703984}, {"no": 18705374, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:39:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18705192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18705192</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

The industry 5 is the second thickest rim to rim cladding, only behind their own proline series. Their atlantis 7 series has the most even heating bottoms due to having the thickest bottom cladding of all cookware, but no rim to rim cladding. The problem, as with a lot of cookware, is their handle ergonomics kind of suck. The part of the handle closest to the pan is the thinnest, which makes it uncomfortable when you inevitably choke up on the handle to counteract the leverage on your wrist. Currently, the best overall cookware in my humble opinion is the Hestan Thomas Keller cookware. Their handles are by far the best out of all the clad cookwares, wide and thick where it counts. Their rim to rim cladding is a bit thicker than all-clad&#039;s, but not as thick as demeyere. But the rims are sealed so there no chance of the cladding separating over time. And the universal lids are far better than traditional ones. I&#039;m surprised that more companies aren&#039;t making them. They&#039;re expensive though.

My first venture to the Honeybaked Ham store was on 12/15/2022. <br>I had a coupon and thought I would give them a try. I went in the store and a very nice employee, Megan, asked if she could help me. I showed her my coupon and said this was my first time there. I asked for suggestions and she said she liked the roasted turkey sandwich. Since ham is right in the name, I said I think I would try their classic ham sandwich with a side of Bacon Broccolli. I didn&#039;t take a picture of the items, as I forgot and I was hungry. The classic ham sandwich came on a croissant and it was very, very good. The Bacon Broccolli was also very good.<br>On my receipt there was a survey. If I completed the survey I would get a code for a bogo sandwich. So of course I did the survey. Then today I went back to the store. Megan was there, as was the owner. I decided to try the turkey and got 2 of the roasted turkey sandwiches. One for me and one for my hubby. These came on a long roll and were just as good as the ham sandwich I had the day before.<br>The owner rang me up but didn&#039;t know how to enter my phone number so I would receive \u201cpiggy points\u201d for my purchase. Megan came over and showed him how to do it. I said to him \u201cYou&#039;re the owner and you don&#039;t know how to do that?\u201d To which he responded he&#039;s usually in the back and that the program was new. I asked if Megan was going to make my sandwiches and he joked about me not trusting his sandwich-making abilities. I said, well you didn&#039;t know how to give me points. He said yes, Megan would be making my sandwiches. I liked that he could take a joke.<br>If you are looking for a great ham or turkey sandwich, I suggest giving Honeybaked Ham a try.

But a big contributing factor is the enormous bread subsidies in several MENA countries.

The problem is that they set a fixed price on bread that didn&#039;t move with inflation, so at the point when Mubarak decided to initiate a gradual reduction (amidst economic crisis, longstanding pressure from domestic economists and the international everybody, and a general sense to modernize) the price of bread (this subsidy only applied specifically to a basic flatbread, btw, not grain in general) was something like 10% of market value. The problem with the gradual phase out was that the first increment was to raise the price of bread to 20% of market value. Now you math geniuses out there will realize Mubarak doubled the price of the staple food of the entire population (poor people obv, and rich people eat it as tortillas or whatnot) overnight. Mass protests threatening revolution ensued and the policy was rolled back within a week. Fast forward to the Arab Spring, and most credible analysts blame almost every revolution in large part or entirely due to bread prices. Cheap bread was a populist measure for dictators to consolidate power in these MENA countries that would later become their greatest liability.<br><br>And also it makes people fat.", "time": 1671238589, "resto": 18704351}, {"no": 18706352, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)19:59:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704351</a><br>When did they ever say they&#039;re starving?

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea.

But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either). Oolong is somewhat fancy, given as gifts and growers have some pride in it, takes some technical skill to manufacture consistently. It can get rather pricey as well, but the mid shelf stuff at like $0.20 to $0.50 a gram is really good", "time": 1671202277, "resto": 18703371}, {"no": 18704389, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)09:58:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704377</a><br>I think oolong is great for beginners in general.<br>great variety of flavors, sometimes very vivid floral, fruity or sweet creamy. you can use boiling water and it&#039;s often pretty forgiving to brew and doesn&#039;t get too bitter. and you don&#039;t have to worry about drinking it ASAP like with some green teas", "time": 1671202723, "resto": 18703371}, {"no": 18704424, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)10:24:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704358</a><br>Oh I think I had both.

Our best restaurant is Capitol Lunch, a family owned location, it has been for nearly a century, currently run by elder Gerald and younger Matthew Warchezski. The location is known to locals as \u201cCrapitol Lunch\u201d and are known to come in and ask for \u201cthe shit sauce\u201d. 2 hotdogs and an order of fries is commonly called a \u201cBig Shitter\u201d. You won\u2019t find this on any menu, but if you\u2019re a true local you\u2019ll know. The Famous Sauce is often served in small ramekins commonly called \u201cdookie drops\u201d by locals and used for dipping. The sauce is also sold for $10 for an 8 ounce container, something many New Britain locals take advantage of due to the popularity of the Famous Sauce. Locals know to order it as a \u201cBig Dump\u201d and the owners aren\u2019t shy about giving a little extra to people who order this way, knowing they\u2019re what\u2019s called a \u201ctool city townie\u201d and thus one of their own.", "filename": "new-britain-connecticut", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 470, "h": 352, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671149802790781, "time": 1671149802, "md5": "VFaDRp+KKVJor17Y1o3uOQ==", "fsize": 35669, "resto": 18701574}, {"no": 18702033, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:09:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18701574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18701574</a><br>I live in a tiny northern inland Swedish village.

I remember getting some &quot;Jump&quot; branded snuff in Austria several years ago, that was made by Poschl (I think it was an Austrian-market specific product). If you go to MrSnuff, you&#039;ll find they have a pretty wide variety of tinned snuffs. Unfortunately, I cannot order from them anymore (customs issues), and getting tobacco shipped from a continental online shop is an exercise in frustration and/or extreme patience. <br><br>I haven&#039;t tried many of their tinned snuffs, but I really liked Ozona President (which they apparently do not produce anymore, for some reason). Lowenprise is too cloying for my taste (too much anise). Gletscher Prise used to be good, but I think they changed the recipe, for the worse, a few years ago. Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess. However, Poschl schmalzlers are packed in sachets, and they tend to lose aroma if stored too long before use. You might occasionally get a dud.
