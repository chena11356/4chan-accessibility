For both theanine and caffeine, I believe it&#039;s matcha since you ingest the whole leaf. It&#039;s difficult to measure because what you actually care about is how much your body absorbs when you drink it. The most L-theanine will be in young shoots harvested in the spring that are steamed. Sencha, gyokuro, and matcha are comparable in this case, puerh seems to have a lower l-theanine content, maybe because of the kill-green. Having said that, the differences are a fraction of the total amount of L-theanine present in the leaves, it doesn&#039;t really matter. Having said THAT, we don&#039;t actually even care, because how much L-theanine is present in the leaves doesn&#039;t really tell us anything. Again, matcha wins here (gram for gram) because you eat the whole leaf. However, I drink thirty or so grams of tea a day, and I doubt you will be consuming an equivalent amount of matcha.<br><br>tl;dr too many confounding factors just take L-theanine or caffeine if you want more of either.

The biggest issue is you need to bang everything out (and if you work in a from scratch kitchen you will basically never be able to &#039;finish&#039; what you need to do in a day; it&#039;s all about triaging what is important) and ideally it comes out EXACTLY the same way every time. Plus this isn&#039;t like fucking up a lamb or bruschetta that you can refire and have in the window in a realistic time. Some of things you&#039;re making taking hours to days to make and in huge volumes. <br>Rolling into the kitchen at 5am and getting 6 hours to yourself is bliss though. Make some bomb coffee. Put on your music. No ticket machine going off or expo yelling for shit. No delivery app shit jingling. Plus you get to peace at 2-3pm and be like &quot;k bye have fun getting spitroasted during the rush&quot;. Plus if you really enjoy using a knife you&#039;ll like prep more. I genuinely love cutting 10lbs of onions or banging out a 50lb box of carrots or peeling a metric fuck ton of potatoes. <br>But it&#039;s a completely different beast than working the line. Nothing on prep is comparable to running the line during an insane service. Running a 300 cover (or whatever cover number is inane for your place) night and everything going perfect is a sublime feeling. Plus the daytime servers are usually older and not nearly as flirty and fun as the night servers and flirting with servers is one of the best perks of the job. Also, depending on the restaurant, prep can be really isolating. Even more so than working closing shifts 6 days a week. For me I&#039;m the only prep person. At most I see one other cook, the day time &#039;prep&#039; who mostly just portions and helps the line, and the single server that runs brunch/lunch service. Compare that to running with 6+ people on the line, having an expo to shit talk with, a dishie to joke around with, and a gaggle of attractive early 20s servers most of whom are definitely keen on riding the cook carousel.", "time": 1675932893, "resto": 18915601}, {"no": 18917613, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)03:58:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18915657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18915657</a><br>Yes", "time": 1675933136, "resto": 18915601}, {"no": 18917742, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:24:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18917606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18917606</a><br>see, when i read shit like this i get an urge to say &quot;fuck it,&quot; quit my middle class white collar job and make a go for the restaurant life<br><br>but i know better. i know better.", "time": 1675938287, "resto": 18915601}, {"no": 18917743, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:25:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18915601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18915601</a><br>You a dumbass OP", "time": 1675938330, "resto": 18915601}, {"no": 18917749, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:30:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18915601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18915601</a><br>the first qualification to being a prep cook is that you should be hispanic and speak very little english.

Someone who&#039;s advocating for genocide and propping up Nazi and Confederate shit is a prime candidate for going straight to Hell. Which is why I don&#039;t think you really believe in God.

Another possibility is that the water temperature may be too high which causes more efficient extraction of bitter compounds in coffee.

If acidity and bitterness are both balanced and there&#039;s a pleasant almost sweet taste from the espresso then you&#039;re right where you want to be. A general rule of thumb is to get your desired amount of coffee out in approximately 30s, which is a surprisingly long time if you&#039;re not used to it. If you want 2:1 (30g espresso out for 15g of coffee in) you may need to grind quite fine. If you find your shots are running quick, then you may need to settle for luongo shots at a 3 or 4:1 ratio until you can dial in your grind for more conventional 1.5-2.5 espresso ratios. <br><br>Temperature defects are tough to deal with because typically only really high-end machines will have custom temperature settings. Hoffman says that temp defects are typically not that severe compared to extraction defects so grind size and its effect on shot timing are more important. <br><br>Another factor a lot of lower-end machines run into is channeling because the pumps run at too high of pressure. You end up with underextracted and overextracted areas which creates the worst of both worlds. Adding a puck screen in forces even flow over the puck and if your machine is modifiable with an lower-pressure OPV spring (9 bar is considered standard) then I would recommend making that modification because it&#039;s easy and cheap to do. My Gaggia runs at 15 bar stock which is way too high, the 9 bar spring will set that as the new upper limit.", "time": 1675857056, "resto": 18904783}, {"no": 18913638, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18913624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18913624</a><br>thas a lot of words bro", "time": 1675857322, "resto": 18904783}, {"no": 18913652, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:59:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18913624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18913624</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No guarantees this will solve your issue but a broad rule of thumb is that harsh bitter flavors are from overextraction and harsh acidity is from underextraction.
