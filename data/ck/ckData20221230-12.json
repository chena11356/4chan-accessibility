A lot of the reviews I&#039;ve read recommend the J-Max over the K4, but those are all from at least a year ago, when both grinders were around the same price. Now, the K4 is less than half the price of the J-Max, at ~$88 US versus $200 USD. For a beginner, is the J-Max that much better that it&#039;s worth spending twice as much? Or would I be fine with the K4, and spending the extra money on the esoteric accessories I&#039;ll need? Ultimately, I would like to spend as little as I can to get good results, but I&#039;m willing to spend the extra if it does make a big difference.

Best I&#039;ve been to was probably Tooth and Nail Brewing in Ottawa. The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

The main reason for this is to buffer for when steam collects and drips when it&#039;s closed. It can get rusted from sitting in the sink too but it&#039;s usually only surfacelevel. As far as the oil, they don&#039;t know what oil you&#039;re using (many people use lard/grease) so they have to put a low general temp for safety reasons. I would bump up the temp higher. Oil has a tendency to bud or form pools even if it&#039;s not an excessive amount, so let it heat up and after like 20 minutes pull it out, wipe and spread the oil, then put it back in to finish polymerizing. Stickiness is a sign of too much oil or not enough fusing.<br><a href=\"#p18747941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18747941</a><br>Some have exposed metal on the rim like picrel", "filename": "castiron", "ext": ".png", "w": 604, "h": 615, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672357181294733, "time": 1672357181, "md5": "fei7PUryvQaXzmb0rrlSsw==", "fsize": 746281, "resto": 18747784}, {"no": 18750641, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:41:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18749569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18749569</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;overheating can cause it to crack</span><br>enamel is fired at 1500 degrees...", "time": 1672357289, "resto": 18747784}, {"no": 18750658, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:46:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18750641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18750641</a><br>I think he&#039;s referring to differential thermal expansion.

A few years in dry conditions will just make sheng a bit less green and &quot;fresh&quot;, mellow out some of the bright floral notes of the white tea, and clear up some of the funk on shou or liu bao (probably the most useful scenario here for only aging 3 years). Starting out I would not buy tea solely to age but if you buy more tea than you drink there is nothing wrong with aging some of it. That&#039;s what I do at least.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leave them in the pantry</span><br>Just be careful about the conditions there. You want the tea to be somewhere where it will not pick up smells. A lot of western puerh drinkers just store their tea in ziplock bags or sealed containers. The best way to store tea for aging in the west is a more complex topic and is still somewhat a mater of debate.

Naturally we eventually move to Hawai&#039;i where there is no ice or snow or biting cold and somehow live a comfortable, peaceful, pleasant life despite the high cost of living. Every day, I wear Hawaiian shirts from Costco and eat spam musubi and say &quot;aloha&quot; to my neighbors with a blissful lack of self-awareness; if I look ridiculous to my neighbors and the native kids shit on my lawn, somehow I never know it. We have weekly luaus with roasted pigs and coconuts and pineapples and I mow my FUCKING LUSH lawn (which is probably considered invasive flora but it&#039;s FUCKING LUSH bro) with a $20,000 supercharged John Deere tractor with Vance &amp; Hines straight pipes. Often I hearken back to the strange beauty of life, and the fact that I owe all this well-seasoned joy, all these rich memories and experiences, and most of all, all this love and tenderness with my beautiful island princess... I owe it all to a single simple can of Haiwaiian Sun Guava Nectar soda, and the chance conversation that it struck up with that skinny little nubile golden-brown queen of the surf and sands, so many decades ago. I eventually succumb to Spam-induced heart failure, mournfully surrounded by my dozens of mixed-race children, grandchildren--and also an official contingent of 4chan /ck/ jannies, who came to present me with an award for my many years of shitposting. They carry a scroll, a formal printout of all my shitposts, from all my IP addresses, even those on NordVPN. I don&#039;t know how they backtraced it, but I don&#039;t care, it&#039;s so beautiful.

People here are really fucking nuts about italian food but can never remotely cook anything like it. There are loads upon loads of &#039;italian&#039; restaurants here but when you go in it&#039;s always some weird fucking jap ripoff where they fuck up all of the dishes by adding jap shit like raw squid and eel and shit to it and then they try to fucking play it off as &quot;real italian food&quot;. It doesn&#039;t help that people here don&#039;t know what normal bread or cheese is. It&#039;s all fucking gross. I have not had any normal-tasting cheese in all the time I&#039;ve lived here, and good bread is about as rare as a properly paid salaryman. These people are born on this island, they will live their whole lives on this island, and they will die on this island without ever tasting real bread or cheese in their life and that&#039;s just sort of sad. The worst part is that because no japanese person actually knows what real italian food is like, nobody can call restaurants out on this bullshit, everyone eats it all up and calls it &quot;honto ni umaiiiii uwuwuwu&quot; and everyone thinks this is what real italian food is like. It&#039;s just sad. &quot;Oh rettsu addu fishu eggu andu seaweedu to pasta carbonara don&#039;t u kno this is how rearu itarian peeporu eat!&quot;.

In a proposed class action filed on Wednesday, Christopher Lazazzaro said he would not have bought or would have paid less for Hershey&#039;s Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate, Lily&#039;s Extra Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa and Lily&#039;s Extreme Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa had Hershey disclosed their metals content.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hershey did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in the federal court in Central Islip, New York. Lazazzaro, a resident of Nassau County, New York, sued two weeks after Consumer Reports unveiled the results of scientific testing of 28 dark chocolate bars for lead and cadmium. Hershey&#039;s Special Dark bar and Lily&#039;s 70% bar were high in lead, and Lily&#039;s 85% bar was high in lead and cadmium, the magazine said. Lazazzaro said reasonable consumers would be turned off by such levels because they pose a &quot;serious health risk,&quot; and that consumers rely on Hershey to be truthful about ingredients in its products.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million of damages, including at least $500 per transaction under New York law. Hershey bought Lily&#039;s for $425 million in June 2021.

The problem with milk is that if you let it sit out at room temperature for too long it will spoil, and even in the fridge for a few days it&#039;ll start to smell and taste pretty unpleasant. Plus I&#039;ve gathered that whenever you use milk to make bread you should heat the milk to at least 165\u00baF first to deactivate enzymes that could interfere with the rising of the dough and the yeast or something. Then you gotta let that milk cool back down enough so that the hot liquid doesn&#039;t kill the yeast when you mix them in.<br><br><a href=\"#p18746566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746566</a><br>Under-working your dough doesn&#039;t affect flavor, just texture.

They can do almost anything, and they do it perfectly every time. Soups, stews, curries, mashed potatoes. They cook rice even better than a dedicated rice cooker does. If you&#039;re a lazy bastard and want low effort meals that are delicious and cheap, this is the ultimate choice.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Open fire</span><br>Gas stove or gas grill, with proper cookware, has the highest ceiling for dish complexity. Everything else is a toy by comparison. It can be intimidatingly expensive to get everything you need if you don&#039;t already own one, especially when you factor in all of the high end cookware and tools to buy. They require a lot more skill to use properly, but if you love cooking and don&#039;t mind spending a lot of time and money, this is the only choice.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oven</span><br>Most baked goods require ridiculous amounts of preparation and clean up, making ovens one of the least convenient choices. However the &quot;oven baked&quot; texture they can provide is truly unique and worth the effort if you&#039;re a &quot;foodie&quot; (read: fatass). If you already have one you might as well put it to use. Also if you&#039;re thinking about getting a small countertop one, you might be disappointed, they don&#039;t tend to work quite as nicely as a real oven (Even the really expensive ones).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Microwave</span><br>Actually good for reheating leftovers, but that&#039;s about it. Even if you&#039;re a lazy retard who can&#039;t even learn to cook a pot of noodles, a pressure cooker is going to be better overall. Microwaves heat your food unevenly and can&#039;t do many types of dishes. In some cases you&#039;ll have to take out the food, stir it, and put it back in multiple times - all for a watery, rubbery, chewy meal. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Air fryers</span><br>Gimmick.

I dont like the recap movies. I think the TV series is superior in sound and music and the ending of the recaps is kind of an anti climax with the changes they made to the scene where madoka talks to homura. But rebellion story is different. It&#039;s an all new soundtrack and its addictively good and completely underrated. I wish there was a falcom style remix of one for all in the soundtrack. <br><br>IT&#039;s impossible to talk about the content of the movie, but you probably heard things about its conclusion. I&#039;ll say that whatever your feelings on it, it doesn&#039;t feel warrented to say things are unsalvagably bad for fans of madoka. Madoka has constantly been someone who cares about homura and doesn&#039;t want her to suffer alone. I guess the best thing I can say about the movie if you have mixed feelings is it left things off between them in a state of equality. They have the capacity, if they chose, to have a serious conversation about their passive agressive struggle to martyr themselves for one another. But like Madoka 1-12 was a triumphant return of the powerful girl after cleansing herself of her own conciets, naiveties, and foolish ambitions, Rebellion story is about a counterattack to that. IT&#039;s literally the &quot;strikes back&quot; in japanese from star wars iirc. Homuras story and goal through the 12 episode anime was an abject failure. It needed to be so that madoka could shine brighter in the narrative. But are we really okay with madoka suffering the ultimate painful sacrifice if it means she gets to be free and strong? Is she? Is homura? Madoka the rebellion story is fundamentally the opposite of the narrative of 12, and the entire movie sets this up with a captivating worth watching on animation and painting grounds alone, toy like world. It&#039;s also amazing how, after dehuminizing and masculinizing herself in 12, homura recaptures her feminity in this film&#039;s theme", "time": 1672137353, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742650, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)08:45:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733875</a><br>are we pretending Russia doesn&#039;t exist until the war is over or whatever?", "time": 1672148744, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742807, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)10:27:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742088</a><br>retard", "time": 1672154868, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742808, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)10:28:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742650</a><br>I&#039;ve never had russian food", "time": 1672154929, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743032, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742808</a><br>I seriously doubt that", "time": 1672162406, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743049, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:44:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733908</a><br>Nihonese, but only if folded a 1000 times.<br><br>Phineas &amp; Ferb - Across the 2nd Dimension.", "time": 1672163048, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743069, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:54:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733875</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Best Cuisines</span><br>Based on what?

Depends more on your body than anything else. Sometimes your body needs more of something or doesn&#039;t need as much of something. That need, or lack thereof, could be short-, medium-, or long-term.<br>If your body is low on an essential nutrient (protein, vitamin, acids, etc..) then eat more foods that contribute to that, preferably while keeping your avg caloric intake approximately constant.<br>If you want to lose weight you don&#039;t even have to change the balance of your diet. Just literally eat less of the same diet. Although, if your protein intake would drop too much I recommend altering the diet a bit to prevent that. That and regular exercise will help reducing your muscle loss as you lose weight.<br><br>Also for fucks sake, stop thinking of nutrition as something that has to be met every day.
