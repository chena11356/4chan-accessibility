Good recipes with ingredients that are fairly common. I&#039;d try Nikujaga, subuta (sweet and sour pork), okonomiyaki, tebasaki. These are all delicious. He&#039;s also got a good recipe for making your own curry roux. This is perfect if you want to avoid all the shit they put in supermarket curry roux.<br><br>https://sudachirecipes.com/", "filename": "20221117_195322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3995, "h": 2864, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1668682473739997, "time": 1668682473, "md5": "MWq7x636fajtjRAg1jhQaQ==", "fsize": 2125953, "resto": 18586079}], "last_modified": 1668682473}]}, {"page": 7, "threads": [{"no": 18584658, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)23:59:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "microwave or oven?", "filename": "Screenshot 2022-11-15 235815", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 701, "h": 699, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1668574747598298, "time": 1668574747, "md5": "KY/WLRQMjP9iRBVMLDtC9A==", "fsize": 91379, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "microwave-or-oven", "replies": 29, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 24, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 18588569, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)23:08:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18587095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18587095</a><br>it&#039;s photoshop", "time": 1668658093, "resto": 18584658}, {"no": 18588601, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)23:19:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18584715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18584715</a><br>I&#039;m not going to give you a view by clicking that play button, but looking at the thumbnail, I do like the Fifties-style power-blue appliances coordinated with the Hawaiian shirt, I hope you play surf licks on a matching Tele through a vintage Fender Twin with a chorus pedal.", "time": 1668658773, "resto": 18584658}, {"no": 18588809, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)00:36:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18584658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18584658</a><br>I refuse to believe these are real because I&#039;ve never seen them in any store.", "time": 1668663383, "resto": 18584658}, {"no": 18589029, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:53:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18588809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18588809</a><br>pizza rolls or this flavor?", "time": 1668668017, "resto": 18584658}, {"no": 18589456, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)05:24:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18589029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18589029</a><br>the brand or product", "time": 1668680642, "resto": 18584658}], "last_modified": 1668680642}, {"no": 18587392, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)17:29:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How much is too much for a home bar?", "filename": "33398C7B-5570-4AAA-9EB8-316798494122", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1668637792579796, "time": 1668637792, "md5": "OuscVQiWxCMxlNATKh9O5A==", "fsize": 2763913, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-much-is-too-much-for-a-home-bar", "replies": 13, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 8, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 18588443, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)22:26:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18588433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18588433</a><br>Somehow, it feels wrong to see gin in a Gran Centenario tequila bottle.", "time": 1668655575, "resto": 18587392}, {"no": 18588463, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)22:33:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18588443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18588443</a><br>yea it&#039;s such a fun bottle though. the boozes often end up in different bottles when i&#039;m infusing or bottling random experiments and need a vessel for something.", "time": 1668655994, "resto": 18587392}, {"no": 18588483, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)22:40:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18587392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18587392</a><br><a href=\"#p18587406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18587406</a><br>It really doesn&#039;t matter how much you have so long as it has variety.

We must ask ourselves, what is the nature of the Divine Goyslop that has instantiated itself in certain kinds of foods? In the most fundamental sense, goyslop is food which the goyim are fed or encouraged to eat by the tribe. If we are to deduce which types of foods most closely adhere to the Form of the Goyslop, we must look to which types of foods are most often peddled by merchants. When we do this, we see that they tend to peddle high fat, highly processed meats, beans and bean derivatives (particularly soy), and, indeed, starchy grains. So, it would seem that your friend is correct. Grains derive their goyslopness, if you will, from their characteristic proximity to the Form of the Goyslop, that transcendant divinity which is incorporeal and fundamentally Jewish in nature. <br><br>On the other hand, consider that goyslop containing rice or grains is incidental. These things would exist and be consumed without goyim to consume them or merchants to peddle them. When someone eats goyslop, therefore, we do not say that what he is eating is goyslop because of the type of food that it is, but because it fulfills the existential criterion of being peddled by one specific group to another specific group. If beef fit this criteria, it would be goyslop. If potatoes fit this criteria, they too would be goyslop. In our case, starchy grains do generally tend to be in this category. But none of these things are necessarily a part of the Form of the Goyslop, something which has its timeless origin in the domain of Forms before it could ever become instantiated in the realm of Bodies. Was the Roman poet Horace being fed goyslop when he described the precursor to lasagna, laganum, in the first century A.D.? I don&#039;t think that anyone would claim he was. Thus we see that grains can sometimes *incidentally* be called goyslop, but there is nothing inherent to their nature that makes them so.", "filename": "800px-Sanzio_01_Plato_Aristotle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1047, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668662876632485, "time": 1668662876, "md5": "e+lrtjMr6/qySPaCc8ac1g==", "fsize": 299693, "resto": 18587696}, {"no": 18589326, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)04:00:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18587744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18587744</a><br>He&#039;s dumb and gay actually", "filename": "1523170472184", "ext": ".png", "w": 616, "h": 800, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668675646333869, "time": 1668675646, "md5": "DvTXgS9uIewdggDKzN/PUA==", "fsize": 38872, "resto": 18587696}], "last_modified": 1668675646}]}]
