The classic recipe and its original ingredients \u2013 flour, butter, raisins and candied citrus among them \u2013 were intended to make the cake last for some time. It was created to transport easily and takes days to make, for the dough to prove, but can last for weeks. It is pure. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Modern technology, which enables producers to pump just about anything into panettone, has led to an ill-formed cake with an ingredients list packed with additives that are far from conducive to your health.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Secondly, the idea that everything has to be new, or reinvented with new flavours, saddens me. Of course food \u2013 and our attitude towards it \u2013 changes through the ages, but just sometimes in life we ought to just stop and enjoy something that has been around for centuries. If something still excites our senses and makes our heart sing after so long, we ought to ask the question why.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Panettone has been a Christmas tradition my whole life. We didn\u2019t have much money when I was growing up and we didn\u2019t have an oven capable of making one, but we would buy one \u2013 it was our treat, a Christmas cake only sold at Christmas time. I loved the airy texture, the generous amount of raisins and chunks of candied peel studded throughout, and would happily pick off the sugar crystals from the top to eat, to the annoyance of my mother.

Even more reason to respect the skill and specialist equipment of its traditional expert bakers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Consider panettone like you would a beautiful sourdough loaf \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want to change anything about such a brilliant bread.

Reason is there&#039;s an alcohol tax which is based around alcohol volume that would make malt liquor too expensive for people to bother buying.<br>Instead of cheep beer, in Australia we use cask wine because there&#039;s a different tax on wine that becomes much lower than beer when buying cheap cask wine. You can get a 4L box of wine with ~30 standard drinks for $9 AUD but the cheapest ratshit beers with an equivalent alcohol level would cost 5 times as much. If you don&#039;t like wine buy want cheaper options then you just go buy large bottles of gin or vodka &amp; mix it, or Mercury Cider where you can get cans with double the alcohol most beers contain without costing too much more.", "time": 1672050050, "resto": 18734156}, {"no": 18739676, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)05:29:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "in america you get called an alcoholic if you drink more than 2 light beers a day<br><br>they also want you to wage 14 hours a day so you can&#039;t get drunk", "time": 1672050541, "resto": 18734156}, {"no": 18739749, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)06:46:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18739662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18739662</a><br>I perceive Australia as being classier than other anglosphere countries because of the wine thing.", "time": 1672055194, "resto": 18734156}, {"no": 18739763, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)07:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18739676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18739676</a><br>but then you get a slap on the wrist if you run over a pedestrian while drunk speeding<br>hail freedonia", "time": 1672056129, "resto": 18734156}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18739713, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)05:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why did it become such a meme? as far as hot sauces go, its flavour is pretty fucking bland.", "filename": "824590[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672052368324839, "time": 1672052368, "md5": "uJFRHinmKOjBFOT4ZLIYBg==", "fsize": 79617, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-did-it-become-such-a-meme-as-far-as-hot", "replies": 5, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 18739717, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)06:08:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18739713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18739713</a><br>white people ruin everything", "time": 1672052890, "resto": 18739713}, {"no": 18739737, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)06:38:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18739713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18739713</a><br>Bland?

First, the human body cannot digest chitin, the main component of insect exoskeletons. Second, bugs are not a very efficient source of protein, requiring more food (in the form of insects) to convert into protein than other animals such as chickens<br><br>There are a number of reasons why the human body cannot digest chitin. Chitin is a complex polysaccharide that is not broken down by human digestive enzymes. Additionally, chitin is not a good source of nutrition for humans, as it is not a good source of essential amino acids. Finally, chitin can actually have a negative impact on human health, as it can bind to and kill beneficial gut bacteria<br><br>Bugs are also not a very efficient source of protein. In order to obtain usable protein from bugs, humans would need to eat a large number of them. This is because insects are mostly made up of exoskeleton, which is indigestible for humans. Additionally, insects have a very low conversion rate of food to protein, meaning that more insects would need to be eaten to obtain the same amount of protein as from other animals<br><br>Finally, bugs are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in the journal Science found that a diet rich in insects would result in higher emissions of methane and nitrous oxide, two of the most potent greenhouse gases. The study found that the emissions from a diet of insects were about double those of a typical livestock-based diet.<br><br>Source:<br>htps://www.scientificamerican.com/a<wbr>rticle/sorry-entomophagy-fans-eatin<wbr>g-insects-is-not-sustainable/<br>https://www.sciencedirect.com/scien<wbr>ce/article/pii/S0271531711003073<br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC3709646/", "filename": "6C44B3DA-591C-44A8-A165-0F97468C5BA6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672000110920750, "time": 1672000110, "md5": "O3vIHyA+zjjKtPQaxMheiw==", "fsize": 44802, "resto": 18737184}, {"no": 18738088, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)15:39:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18738063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18738063</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sources</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;removed</span><br>kek", "time": 1672000745, "resto": 18737184}, {"no": 18738093, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)15:43:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18737184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18737184</a><br>Who the fuck is &quot;we&quot; you faggot not out of school yet?

You can roast things in the oven for a different flavor. Get a good sense of what works for stock (parsnips, onions, celery) and what doesn&#039;t (cauliflower, potatoes).

The vegetables will likely cook faster than the chicken bones so they are on a separate tray.<br><br><br>Gravy recipe:<br>Cook some flour in the pan juices.

Cooking something on medium instead of medium-low isn&#039;t gonna incinerate whatever&#039;s in your pan, etc.<br>Plus, not following exact instruction gives you the flexibility to tweak the dish to your own tastes.
