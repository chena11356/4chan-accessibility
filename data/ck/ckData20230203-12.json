It amounts to a very small amount of water; perhaps two or three gulps worth at most, per fill, but each and every molecule of liquid water has been chilled by contact with solid water: it physically could not be any colder, and thus more quenching, without losing liquid form. <br>I like to chew on the ice cubes too.

The degassing of light roasted coffee is, in contrast to dark and medium roasts, smaller in absolute terms and less impacted by the roasting speed; no increasing trend from a slow to a fast roast profile was observed (Figure 5a, light roast).

As long as you don&#039;t snack a lot w/ preprocessed stuff like cheez its and oreos, you don&#039;t eat out at restaurants, and you don&#039;t buy dumb shit like steak every night. Whole chickens are nice since you get 2 breasts 2 thighs 2 drums and like 4 wings, so it&#039;s a solid choice for ~$7. Chicken breast whole as a meal is good but it&#039;s much better chopped or sliced and used to add to other meals i.e. topping salads, in wraps, or with spaghetti. Chicken might be rising in price due to the whole bird shortage whatever, so look for alternatives for protein like fish, pork, and turkey. keep in mind the price per pound and the calories/protein per pound to give you a cals/protein per dollar. buy generic brand as much as you can, it isn&#039;t a huge step down. Don&#039;t start buying a ton of bulk shit if you don&#039;t need it. Yes it&#039;s cheaper by the pound, but if you&#039;re strapped for cash it&#039;s wiser to buy an $5 8oz bottle of olive oil that might last you a month compared to a 128oz jug of olive oil that&#039;ll last years. When you&#039;re well off, you can buy in bulk, but the high upfront cost disincentivizes buying in bulk when you&#039;re low.
