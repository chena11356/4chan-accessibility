The Ridge Ave location is sorta still open, but on Henry Ave and under different ownership, now called d&#039;Alessandro&#039;s.

At like 3am I suddenly got delirious and stripped off all my clothes and tried to open the hotel door and go sprinting outside but in my state I couldn&#039;t figure out how to take the chain off the door and my parents eventually woke up and dragged me back into the bathroom. <br>I&#039;m almost 30 now and to this day the smell of those chicken bakes makes me gag.", "time": 1674235412, "resto": 18834602}, {"no": 18835041, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)12:48:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;get sick as a kid</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crazy asian parents make congee</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its fucking water, rice, and salted fish</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tastes absolutely as disgusting as it sounds</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get even more sick because they force me to eat it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;throw up on the floor because of the congee, not because i&#039;m sick</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;forever associate congee (and risotto) with disgusting hospital food </span><br><br>And they still wonder why I refuse to touch the stuff.", "filename": "e679759d-bbd2-4c39-8f1c-9f4188add22d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1251, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1674236880184952, "time": 1674236880, "md5": "uONmIfyhZwPTuDhgnCGX4Q==", "fsize": 202178, "resto": 18834602}, {"no": 18835043, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)12:48:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be kid</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at babysitter&#039;s house</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she has 3 kids of her own</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lunch time</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some godawful meat with mixed vegetables</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;her kids eat all of it because they don&#039;t know any better</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;struggling to eat this meat, but it&#039;s so dry I just can&#039;t do it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eat all my mixed veggies instead (which I hate, but the meat was so bad I had to eat something) to try to get out of eating the meat</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she tells me I can&#039;t leave the table until I finish eating her shit meat</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;her and her 3 kids go outside to play in the backyard after eating</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(she was a massive cunt by the way)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sitting at the table; watching all of them through the kitchen window playing outside, getting more and more pissed off by the second</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;light bulb goes off</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stuff the meat into my mouth then walk over to the window and show her my empty tray</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she tells me I can come outside now</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go outside through the front door instead of the backdoor</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;walking along the side of her house where they can&#039;t see me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spit the chewed up meat all over the side of their house as a &#039;fuck you&#039;</span><br>God that felt good.", "time": 1674236927, "resto": 18834602}, {"no": 18835047, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)12:50:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My mother&#039;s roast lamb was dry as a nun&#039;s cunt.

My gargoyle of a stepmom would occasionally make black-eyed bean exactly as you described. It was like eating a sweaty arm pit in soup form. As kids we didn&#039;t have an option about our meals. We had to eat what we were served and sit there until we&#039;re done. I gave it my best effort and suffered through plenty of times but one warm summer night, after smelling this foul garbage all afternoon, I was pushed past my limit.

So just kinda curious there, as I thought that this might appeal to me since I\u2019m a slow drinker (I usually spend the first 15-30 minutes sniffing, kek).

You get a lot for your money, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s sweeter than what I\u2019m typically used to, but it\u2019s very fragrant and clinical. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any cheese or mushroom, but I\u2019ll take note of that and see what I can spot when I have my next glass later on. With my example there\u2019s a lot of green grape skin going on though. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t call it slow to open up, I can pretty much drink it immediately after pouring my glass but I like to take my time as the nose really is something. I typically buy Armagnac that\u2019s been bottled about 30 years after the date it has been distilled (kinda my sweet spot, though I do have both younger and older), and I also only buy single vintage (i.e. bottles with the year stamped on them instead of the age of the product). My current Delord is 39 years however (distilled 1982, bottled 2021) and I\u2019d happily buy it again. The only thing that annoys me about Delord is the wax they use to seal the cap is a LOT harder than literally any other Armagnac I\u2019ve ever had to open, that said it\u2019s a small price to pay for what\u2019s a very affordable product in my opinion, especially given the age.", "time": 1674106463, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829142, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18827079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18827079</a><br>Kek just because Armagnac isn\u2019t to your liking doesn\u2019t make it poor quality.

Looking at my tasting notes though, this is what I wrote: nose: extremely grape-y, like sniffing a well packed bouquet of fruits and berries packed in a basket held together by UHU glue; palate: sweet, minty and clinical, hard to pinpoint individual flavours, there\u2019s something synthetic about the flavour but in a way I very much enjoy, it just tastes super clean; finish: the synthetic part really comes out here, plasticky but damn it\u2019s addictive (bits of the UHU glue nose come out here on your taste buds, and just like UHU glue, it\u2019s god damn addictive). This definitely won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but god damn am I always in a heightened state of zen whenever I take my shot from this bottle.", "time": 1674125430, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829703, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)06:11:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18829670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18829670</a><br>I&#039;ve heard that older Delord bottles will peak within 3 months to a year of air before you should consider gassing them or decanting into smaller bottles.<br><br>I had a feeling about the wax.

Laubade does that, there\u2019s a cloth string a few mm wide under the wax which you can just pull to get the fucker off. The problem with Delord isn\u2019t the lack of string though, it\u2019s that the wax is like fucking porcelain i.e. really hard. My older bottles of Laubade had no string but even despite that the wax was super easy to peel off. I typically don\u2019t ever leave a bottle open for more than three months so I don\u2019t have an issue with ageing becoming a problem. I typically drink one shot a day with my significant other (we do have one or two breaks a week though), sometimes we share one shot, sometimes we have a shot each; so with my rule of four open bottles at once that pretty much guarantees each bottle will finished within three months. I devised this rule mostly because for whisky it can be very unpredictable how well a bottle ages, and in my experience it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to go downhill fast once the bottle is about 50% empty with all that air mucking about inside. Funnily enough I find Armagnac holds much better than whisky; I once had a bottle open for over a year and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. But like my current Glenfiddich 15 VAT 03 that\u2019s open, I can tell I\u2019m enjoying it a wee bit less now that the bottle is down to its remainder 35%.

And no, NE style/Hazies are not the same thing, and despite being extremely popular never reached the level of &quot;craze&quot; that the West Coast style did for a few years.", "time": 1674267594, "resto": 18835713}, {"no": 18836899, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)21:24:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hops are the worst thing to ever happen to beer.", "time": 1674267861, "resto": 18835713}, {"no": 18836929, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)21:35:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18836899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18836899</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. posting from 3000 BCE Mesopotamia</span>", "filename": "sex-e1389288155331[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 998, "h": 716, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1674268517640732, "time": 1674268517, "md5": "D0VyladafSIpUzkIJrya5w==", "fsize": 184473, "resto": 18835713}, {"no": 18836940, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)21:38:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw wild ales was the Craft fad like 3 years ago</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw it\u2019s pretty much all fizzled out</span><br>I don\u2019t want fruited sours you faggot retards I was naturally tasting funky sour from WILDS", "time": 1674268715, "resto": 18835713}, {"no": 18837211, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)22:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18836269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18836269</a><br>I dunno.<br>Most people I know that don&#039;t like IPAs all like voodoo ranger.", "time": 1674273236, "resto": 18835713}, {"no": 18837236, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)23:05:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The entire craft beer market is ruined by IPAs.

Not meat slicer thin, but pretty skinny with a knife, a little bit thinner than pic related. No seasoning. For cooking, I heated up a big dictionary-sized Himalayan salt block in the oven. Once it was hot, I put it on the table, resting in a baking tray. You just need to put the thin strips on the hot salt for a little bit. Hardly a minute, depending on the thickness of the meat. Delicious hot and salty meat strips straight from the big pink brick.

I haven&#039;t worked at Starbucks in about a decade, but my dad will still go to the local stores and buy up their entire supply whenever it&#039;s available, and now it&#039;s all they drink and told me they can&#039;t really stand the shitty pre-ground supermarket stuff. If they run out of that coffee, they&#039;ll switch to tea. When I visited them yesterday, I offered to grind their coffee with my hand grinder, but my mom stopped me because she immediately knew it would make a huge difference to have fresh burr-ground coffee, and she sort of didn&#039;t want to know, because she knew the financial rabbit hole coffee snobbery can lead to.
