The first step is to train the stomach to accept less food and shrink to a smaller size. What worked for me in the past is to do 16 hour fasts and only eat within an 8 hour window in the day. So only eat at lunch, then dinner at 6, maybe a snack at 7:45 if you want. And since you&#039;re 470lb, you can eat big portions and still lose weight. You still have to give up binging on fast food if you&#039;re doing that, your meal will have to be actually healthy foods. <br><br>The simplest go-to is protein (chicken, pork, beef that you&#039;ve cooked) and vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, etc). But you can eat as big a portion as you want since you&#039;re 470lb, you&#039;ll lose a ton of weight within a couple of months. For snacks just eat more protein, maybe cured meats like salami and jerkey, cheese. Just don&#039;t eat potato chips or anything sweet. A 470lber needs to cut out starches and sugars to start building back insulin function, and it will keep you less hungry. No need to go full keto though, like you can have something like mashed potato within reason (not every day).<br><br>If you follow this for just a few days, you&#039;ll find that it becomes easy after maybe 4-5 days as your stomach shrinks. Only the first 2-3 days are hard, it&#039;s literally effortless from there. <br>This is a cheat/cope type of weight loss, but it&#039;s a very good place to start.

It takes a few weeks after that for your brain to start recovering, and your liver/biome will not recover fully for at least a month.<br><br>You will notice on your sobriety journey a few things:<br>- after about three weeks off drinking, your skin and eyes will start to glow<br>- consistently more energy and drive<br>- your work will improve (you will be shocked how long you can work and how much your mind has improved)<br>- fitness will improve<br>- you will read more and be far more productive (I started my own business while off the sauce)<br>- you will naturally make better health choices<br>- your friends will decrease, but the ones that stay will improve your life<br>- you will get control of yourself<br>- you save money<br>- it is easier to engage in genuine conversation with another person<br><br>Sure you will miss some social events and what not, but these aren&#039;t really worth it imo", "time": 1673670177, "resto": 18808235}, {"no": 18808321, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:24:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18808279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18808279</a><br>It&#039;s nearly 17:30 here in NZ and I&#039;ve had 4 bottles of wine.", "time": 1673670252, "resto": 18808235}, {"no": 18808330, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:25:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18808321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18808321</a><br>Based Anzac cuz.", "time": 1673670357, "resto": 18808235}, {"no": 18808333, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:26:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18808273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18808273</a><br><a href=\"#p18808321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18808321</a><br>How do you drink wine without getting fat?

From what I&#039;ve read the best intro reposado buy on all counts (accessibility, cost, etc) is probably Espolon, but with tequila there&#039;s a lot of great brands and a lot of personal taste involved. With any new liquor, look for tastings in your area and go -- even if they cost some $50 at the door, IT&#039;S ALWAYS WORTH IT (not for wine or beer where there&#039;s a ton of free tastings however). <br><br>Adding to Bon Appetit&#039;s list, there are agave spirits in general including mezcals (of which tequila is of course a subtype), but don&#039;t dive into all this right away unless you live in Mexico or near the border and can access good bottles on the cheap. There are also non-100% agave spirits (mixtos), which should always be avoided in the U.S., but can again be fair game to explore in Mexico.<br><br>Unaged is cheaper, extra aged is more expensive, just like with any other liquor. Unaged can be just as good to sip as extra aged, just like any other liquor.

Depending on your country, your Government likely runs on debt, and over the last few years that ratio is very high and not far half their budget. That would imply welfare is paid for via some mystical credit card.

Kraft Mac and cheese, instant ramen, and anything that came from a colorful box in the freezer were literally the most gourmet and delicious foods that I ever ate until I was older.
