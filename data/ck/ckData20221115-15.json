My ass is still aching even after several drugs, and I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s not over, I bled because of this and will likely go back into the toilet to bleed again today or tomorrow, hopefully I can hold it off longer while I regenerate (bought some vitamin c to help with that).", "filename": "tiger_nuts", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 554, "h": 554, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1668501176410672, "time": 1668501176, "md5": "aH4x8rP1wJRjCY1hd1A/DQ==", "fsize": 50830, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "tiger-nuts-yellow-nutsedge", "replies": 14, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 9, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 18582849, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:27:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18581644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18581644</a><br>I don&#039;t think that&#039;s right.

Although my mother was never religious after my father\u2019s death (he was devoutly religious (Episcopalian) as his father was a Minister) we nevertheless celebrated these holidays in a secular manner)). On holidays we would often go out to eat at a restaurant (for the sake of brevity I will not take the time to say which restaurants we patronized although there were restaurants that we patronized!), when there was sufficient money to do so (my mother, as she did not graduate college, worked a low wage job (and in fact often worked multiple jobs (although it only became necessary to do so after my sister was born))). On one such occasion (patronizing a restaurant (a local establishment called Schmuckers)) I decided to order the bacon and the eggs (for breakfast). My mother, I could sense, although she did not express it directly, as she was often a rather reserved person, particularly after the death of my father, that my mother was disappointed and upset with what I had ordered (bacon and eggs (for breakfast)). I did not, for many years (in fact not until my mother had passed away (God rest her soul)) discover the reason why she was angry and disappointed with the bacon and eggs I had ordered. The story is not, I think, of sufficiently broad interest to relay here. Nevertheless, I certainty learned my lesson!

But many of you don&#039;t really know WHAT to grow, beyond the obvious stuff like potatoes or corn. The answer is squash. Squashes can be cleaned and stored for up to a year after harvest. They are full of nutrients. They are versatile in terms of cooking and recipes. They can be canned or stored for longer periods of time. And they aren&#039;t very difficult to grow in temperate climates.<br><br>There are thousands of varieties of squash, but beginners should start with the Cucurbita maxima, AKA the &#039;blue hubbard.&#039; Blue hubbards have dense, rich flesh which is prized for its texture and taste. They grow to respectable sizes, but aren&#039;t absurdly huge like pumpkins (a late-season healthy Hubbard should be anywhere from 10 to 20lbs / 4.5-9kg, or a bit bigger if they start earlier in the season). They have a rugged outer skin which helps ward off predators and damage. And they have a good aesthetic in general. Peeled and cubed hubbard fits great in stews and soups.<br><br>If you have limited experience with squashes or gardening, this is a good way to start. You can easily grow a dozen or more mature hubbards from a small number of plants and their vines, even with relatively limited space. That&#039;s a couple hundred pounds of fresh, high-quality, nutrient-rich food.

You can make the polenta (forma de fritta) with same shredded kimchi as a stuffing. Didn&#039;t really get it with the buckwheat. Easy choice to add to the beans stew like Georgian lobio. Nice addition to savoury pie stuffing, meat, spinach+cream cheese or quark. Smoked ham soup, but instead of basic cabbage you use kimchi or a mix.
