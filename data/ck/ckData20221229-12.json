Best I&#039;ve been to was probably Tooth and Nail Brewing in Ottawa. The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson.

Naturally we eventually move to Hawai&#039;i where there is no ice or snow or biting cold and somehow live a comfortable, peaceful, pleasant life despite the high cost of living. Every day, I wear Hawaiian shirts from Costco and eat spam musubi and say &quot;aloha&quot; to my neighbors with a blissful lack of self-awareness; if I look ridiculous to my neighbors and the native kids shit on my lawn, somehow I never know it. We have weekly luaus with roasted pigs and coconuts and pineapples and I mow my FUCKING LUSH lawn (which is probably considered invasive flora but it&#039;s FUCKING LUSH bro) with a $20,000 supercharged John Deere tractor with Vance &amp; Hines straight pipes. Often I hearken back to the strange beauty of life, and the fact that I owe all this well-seasoned joy, all these rich memories and experiences, and most of all, all this love and tenderness with my beautiful island princess... I owe it all to a single simple can of Haiwaiian Sun Guava Nectar soda, and the chance conversation that it struck up with that skinny little nubile golden-brown queen of the surf and sands, so many decades ago. I eventually succumb to Spam-induced heart failure, mournfully surrounded by my dozens of mixed-race children, grandchildren--and also an official contingent of 4chan /ck/ jannies, who came to present me with an award for my many years of shitposting. They carry a scroll, a formal printout of all my shitposts, from all my IP addresses, even those on NordVPN. I don&#039;t know how they backtraced it, but I don&#039;t care, it&#039;s so beautiful. And as they read the posts one by one, they play the MLG airhorn sound effect on a bluetooth speaker to indicate every time that I got banned.

A few years in dry conditions will just make sheng a bit less green and &quot;fresh&quot;, mellow out some of the bright floral notes of the white tea, and clear up some of the funk on shou or liu bao (probably the most useful scenario here for only aging 3 years). Starting out I would not buy tea solely to age but if you buy more tea than you drink there is nothing wrong with aging some of it. That&#039;s what I do at least.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leave them in the pantry</span><br>Just be careful about the conditions there. You want the tea to be somewhere where it will not pick up smells. A lot of western puerh drinkers just store their tea in ziplock bags or sealed containers. The best way to store tea for aging in the west is a more complex topic and is still somewhat a mater of debate.

Storing glucose as glycogen requires energy. While yes, the body is perfectly capable of producing glucose from sources that are not carbs it does not store that glucose as glycogen for future use. That glucose goes straight to use as the body requires glucose to operate. It makes no sense for our bodies to spend extra energy to produce excess glugoce that is then stored when you are already missing glucose and have to first inefficiently create glucose from other sources. And when we&#039;re talking glycogen stores it&#039;s obvious that I&#039;m talking about the large scale stores. Sure small amounts might be stored as a buffer but adults have multiple kg of glycogen when their glycogen stores are full.

This isn&#039;t like other major metropolitan areas where the suburbs are pieces of shit, the suburbs here are some of the wealthiest, most affluent places in the entire country, let alone the Midwest. <br><br>Here I go with the top Asian restaurants from all major Chicago ethnicities:<br><br>Best Chinese:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Northern cuisine: Northern Tastes in Bridgeport </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sichuan: Chengdu Impressions in Chinatown </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dim sum: MingHe in Chinatown </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dumplings: Dumpling House in Bridgeport</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hot pot: Happy Lamb (multiple locations) </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;modern/white people friendly: Han 202 in Bridgeport and Chinatown </span><br><br>Thai: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Siam noodle in New Chinatown </span><br><br>Vietnamese: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hai Yen in New Chinatown </span><br><br>Korean:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cho sun ok in North center </span><br><br>Japanese:<br>not too many japs live in Chicagoland, so just pick a sushi place in the loop and you should be fine <br><br><a href=\"#p18748432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748432</a><br>My king, i kneel <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. fellow Napervillechad who refuses to leave DuPage County unless absolutely necessary</span>", "filename": "1672307947788", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4500, "h": 4334, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1672307968135605, "time": 1672307968, "md5": "qGtUjM1yEITN+4izyKIXGg==", "fsize": 673705, "resto": 18747382}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18748441, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:01:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It\u2019s impossible to make a meal entirely from scratch.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you grow the plants needed to make flour, spices, sauces</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you grow your own vegetables </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you mine the salt </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you harvest the sugarcane yourself </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you raise and then butcher animals for meat</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you milk a dairy cow yourself </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do you own hens and collect their eggs </span><br><br>And on and on\u2026", "filename": "A69B5E08-A5E8-4514-B3AB-C6DC0E642938", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 650, "h": 1367, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672293668945248, "time": 1672293668, "md5": "D8MIoegJkbhS5cjyzqPXWA==", "fsize": 280606, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "its-impossible-to-make-a-meal-entirely-from", "replies": 6, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 18748457, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:05:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you grow the plants</span><br>Stopped reading here and realized OP is retarded and does jot know what &quot;from scratch&quot; means.", "time": 1672293932, "resto": 18748441}, {"no": 18748460, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:06:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "OP is carl sagan", "time": 1672293986, "resto": 18748441}, {"no": 18748470, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:08:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748441</a><br>What a fuckin autistic thing to make a thread about.", "time": 1672294128, "resto": 18748441}, {"no": 18748474, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:14:44", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "5D499345-F24D-4BAD-8508-7225E6C595B3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 673, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672294484673194, "time": 1672294484, "md5": "CVL8vrT7Y8QJANOZgxuwWg==", "fsize": 59054, "resto": 18748441}, {"no": 18748483, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:20:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748441</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do you own hens and collect their eggs</span><br>Some people actually do.

People here are really fucking nuts about italian food but can never remotely cook anything like it. There are loads upon loads of &#039;italian&#039; restaurants here but when you go in it&#039;s always some weird fucking jap ripoff where they fuck up all of the dishes by adding jap shit like raw squid and eel and shit to it and then they try to fucking play it off as &quot;real italian food&quot;. It doesn&#039;t help that people here don&#039;t know what normal bread or cheese is. It&#039;s all fucking gross. I have not had any normal-tasting cheese in all the time I&#039;ve lived here, and good bread is about as rare as a properly paid salaryman. These people are born on this island, they will live their whole lives on this island, and they will die on this island without ever tasting real bread or cheese in their life and that&#039;s just sort of sad. The worst part is that because no japanese person actually knows what real italian food is like, nobody can call restaurants out on this bullshit, everyone eats it all up and calls it &quot;honto ni umaiiiii uwuwuwu&quot; and everyone thinks this is what real italian food is like. It&#039;s just sad. &quot;Oh rettsu addu fishu eggu andu seaweedu to pasta carbonara don&#039;t u kno this is how rearu itarian peeporu eat!&quot;. The worst part for me is that japan doesn&#039;t just massacre classic italian food like this, but they also do it with every other country&#039;s cuisine imaginable. French, spanish, mexican, turkish, you name it. They botch everything they come across as &quot;wow foreign so cool&quot; but it&#039;s never apparently fucking good enough unless they douse it in soy sauce and raw octopus to make it &quot;authentic european&quot; food. Don&#039;t get me wrong I love me some japanese food but fuck this country for ruining foreign food culture and fuck the people for being too retarded to not know what real food is like, even though they kind of can&#039;t help it, fuck em it&#039;s gross", "time": 1672276257, "resto": 18743286}, {"no": 18747608, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:15:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18747594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18747594</a><br>sounds comfy honestly, the only way people should consume foreign foods is whitewashed to the local palate<br>&quot;authentic&quot; foreign food is just a meme anyway", "time": 1672276515, "resto": 18743286}, {"no": 18747652, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:29:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18747469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18747469</a><br>kek i love mister donut<br><br><a href=\"#p18746873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746873</a><br>Sorry incel!

Plus I&#039;ve gathered that whenever you use milk to make bread you should heat the milk to at least 165\u00baF first to deactivate enzymes that could interfere with the rising of the dough and the yeast or something.

Not very much, between 1 and 1.5% will do. You&#039;ll want 1% yeast, 2% salt, and 1 - 1.5% olive oil. If you have a stand mixer, need it on a medium setting for at least 10 minutes. If kneading by hand you have to knead it until it passes the window pane test.", "time": 1672275754, "resto": 18746497}, {"no": 18747580, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:05:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18746497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746497</a><br>slow rise<br>mix roughly, set and forget for a day or two<br>no fucking about with mixers or kneading", "time": 1672275946, "resto": 18746497}, {"no": 18747643, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:27:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18747580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18747580</a><br>Dude, what?

I dont like the recap movies. I think the TV series is superior in sound and music and the ending of the recaps is kind of an anti climax with the changes they made to the scene where madoka talks to homura. But rebellion story is different. It&#039;s an all new soundtrack and its addictively good and completely underrated. I wish there was a falcom style remix of one for all in the soundtrack. <br><br>IT&#039;s impossible to talk about the content of the movie, but you probably heard things about its conclusion. I&#039;ll say that whatever your feelings on it, it doesn&#039;t feel warrented to say things are unsalvagably bad for fans of madoka. Madoka has constantly been someone who cares about homura and doesn&#039;t want her to suffer alone. I guess the best thing I can say about the movie if you have mixed feelings is it left things off between them in a state of equality. They have the capacity, if they chose, to have a serious conversation about their passive agressive struggle to martyr themselves for one another. But like Madoka 1-12 was a triumphant return of the powerful girl after cleansing herself of her own conciets, naiveties, and foolish ambitions, Rebellion story is about a counterattack to that. IT&#039;s literally the &quot;strikes back&quot; in japanese from star wars iirc. Homuras story and goal through the 12 episode anime was an abject failure. It needed to be so that madoka could shine brighter in the narrative. But are we really okay with madoka suffering the ultimate painful sacrifice if it means she gets to be free and strong? Is she? Is homura? Madoka the rebellion story is fundamentally the opposite of the narrative of 12, and the entire movie sets this up with a captivating worth watching on animation and painting grounds alone, toy like world. It&#039;s also amazing how, after dehuminizing and masculinizing herself in 12, homura recaptures her feminity in this film&#039;s theme", "time": 1672137353, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742650, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)08:45:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733875</a><br>are we pretending Russia doesn&#039;t exist until the war is over or whatever?", "time": 1672148744, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742807, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)10:27:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742088</a><br>retard", "time": 1672154868, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742808, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)10:28:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742650</a><br>I&#039;ve never had russian food", "time": 1672154929, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743032, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742808</a><br>I seriously doubt that", "time": 1672162406, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743049, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:44:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733908</a><br>Nihonese, but only if folded a 1000 times.<br><br>Phineas &amp; Ferb - Across the 2nd Dimension.", "time": 1672163048, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743069, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:54:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733875</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Best Cuisines</span><br>Based on what?
