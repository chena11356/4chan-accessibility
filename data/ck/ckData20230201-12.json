Pigs however were raised for meat even by the lower classes as you could have them find food in woods you otherwise wouldn&#039;t get any food out of anyway. Hunted meat would also be had in the rural areas. A large part of why the norman king&#039;s forest laws were so hated in England were so hated is because it prevented the common people from having access to these two types of meat which they had earlier.", "filename": "1485296194629", "ext": ".png", "w": 337, "h": 231, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1675159511592965, "time": 1675159511, "md5": "m17oMaD/kBNici0plwSK7A==", "fsize": 36449, "resto": 18879035}, {"no": 18879935, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:09:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18879035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18879035</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iU<wbr>YNVDrrSI<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=190<wbr>emwcnYJ4", "time": 1675159796, "resto": 18879035}, {"no": 18880064, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)07:13:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18879094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18879094</a><br>Jannies don&#039;t have the power to global ban.", "time": 1675167184, "resto": 18879035}, {"no": 18880068, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)07:14:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18879446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18879446</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Medieval era</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Townsend</span><br>You are retarded.", "time": 1675167262, "resto": 18879035}, {"no": 18880097, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)07:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18879144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18879144</a><br><br>Garlic grows absolutely everywhere in Europe and is a weed in most places anon.", "time": 1675168489, "resto": 18879035}, {"no": 18880200, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)08:56:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18879035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18879035</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;medieval era</span><br><br>Medieval where?

We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u201d to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u2019s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u2019s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u2019t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)", "filename": "th-1530947230", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1675048587538304, "time": 1675048587, "md5": "ZwxwSxR6KJEuUWEyJjMAjA==", "fsize": 18079, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874891, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18870257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18870257</a><br>I eat shrimps and prawns whole, with shell, tail and head", "time": 1675048842, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874893, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874891</a><br>Do you enjoy the gritty poops?", "time": 1675048875, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874899, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874893</a><br>i like it when the poops tickly my bunghole on the way out<br><br>usually from eating too much popcorn", "time": 1675048960, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874923, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:33:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874899</a><br>No, the shrimpies poopers.

Why is that important? Let&#039;s take one of the most used purposes for cast iron, pan seared steak. In pan searing a steak, surface temperature is critical to making a good sear. Once the steak is placed on the pan, the temperature will drop momentarily as the two surfaces work their way into equalizing their temperatures. A good sear requires maintaining as close temperature of the Maillard Reaction as possible, which is roughly around 357*F but requires a surface temperature greater than that since the steak is colder as both surfaces fight to equalize their temperatures. A cast iron skillet with more thermal mass than a stainless steel skillet will resist that temperature gradient longer than a stainless skillet because stainless steel is both less massive as well as less conductive.<br><br>With all that said however, I&#039;m a stainless steel guy simply because itjustwerks\u2122", "time": 1675039690, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874333, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18871964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18871964</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tomato sauce or dahl or anything with wine</span><br>just cook that shit in a stainless steel pan or dutch oven, jesus christ", "time": 1675039713, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874334, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18871634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18871634</a><br>Its fitting too, because it doesnt take any more effort but retards who havent touched them think its hard.", "time": 1675039726, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874338, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:49:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does cast iron on an electric stove even work?

Most people have only cooked eggs on teflon their whole lives and don&#039;t realize you need to learn a slightly different technique on cast iron and stainless. Teflon is really forgiving. I used to cook eggs on high heat with a tiny, tiny amount of butter, but if I try the same settings on CI, it will stick no matter what.<br><br>On cast iron, you need at least a thin film of oil, like the guy in that incessantly reposted video uses. If your eggs are swimming in oil, that&#039;s fine too, just an option. Butter tends to be very forgiving for some reason, and the flavor goes well with eggs, but you can use any suitable oil. With CI, the pan should be at least warmish before you even add oil. With stainless, the pan does need to be at least a certain temperature before adding oil, iirc, around 200F. In either case, the main way you&#039;re going to have sticking with eggs is if the pan is too hot. Keep an eye on the heat--start out low if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing--don&#039;t try to turn a part of the egg that hasn&#039;t solidified yet, it might help to use your spatula upside-down to check a corner, be persistent and you&#039;ll get it.", "time": 1675195927, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18881156, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)15:14:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18876477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18876477</a><br>meds", "time": 1675196059, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18881157, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)15:14:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets cast iron because its healthier</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;seasons it with seed oil</span><br><br>lol", "time": 1675196070, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18881169, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)15:17:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is ceramic safe, guys?

I eat raw pork and beef and eggs all the time, and I&#039;ve never washed produce, and I don&#039;t cook chicken breasts to 165, and I also make sushi and poke out of non-sushi-grade regular salmon and tuna from the grocery store.

His father, Sam Born, was a Russian immigrant who had founded Just Born Inc., a small candy company, in 1923. The family later moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where Just Born is still based. Bob Born graduated from Lehigh University with a degree in engineering physics. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as a radar specialist and a lieutenant on a destroyer in the Pacific. Later, the Navy sent him to the University of Arizona and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for graduate work in math and physics.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Born applied to medical school and was accepted, but while he was waiting for his classes to begin, he went to work at Just Born. He fell in love with the candy business and decided to stay. In 1953, Just Born acquired Rodda Candy Co., a jelly bean maker that had a side business producing shaped marshmallow candies by hand. At the time, it took about 27 hours to make the marshmallows. Bob Born saw the candies&#039; potential, so he and an engineer at the company designed and built a machine to make them in less than six minutes. The company still uses a version of that machine.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seventy years later, Peeps remain Just Born&#039;s most recognizable candy brand, the company says. Just Born makes around 2 billion Peeps each year, or enough to circle the globe twice. It sells the most at Easter, but also has versions sold for Halloween, Valentine&#039;s Day and other holidays. Bob Born also came up with the recipe for another popular Just Born candy, Hot Tamales. Just Born also makes Mike and Ike fruit chews and Goldenberg&#039;s Peanut Chews.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bob Born became Just Born&#039;s president in 1959 and held the role for more than 30 years. He spent most of his retirement in Florida, where he led a literacy program and enjoyed hobbies including photography. He was active until a few months before he died, when he had a difficult recovery after a hard fall.</span>", "filename": "T5TWQIUOYNBMTHYBDPNEZVMDCU", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1084, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 132, "tim": 1675159537039672, "time": 1675159537, "md5": "zIr0G3stm0JjooA8mjpTWw==", "fsize": 746426, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "father-of-peeps-dead-at-98", "replies": 32, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 32}, {"no": 18879941, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:16:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Team Mini here to pay respects<br>F", "filename": "6A666D9D-EB43-4B2C-9CA0-CE0B86108C42", "ext": ".png", "w": 695, "h": 900, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675160199764034, "time": 1675160199, "md5": "MC0Pi3Zl/FvBenc7c6WuNg==", "fsize": 865224, "resto": 18879930}, {"no": 18879948, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:23:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;i was working in this factory and noticed that there was some corn syrup and sugar that wasn&#039;t making it back into the mix, so I said, &quot;hey, why don&#039;t we add some gelatin and put it back through the oozer and then we could cover it with more sugar?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*here he is 70 years later, contemplating how one little idea he had as a kid made him responsible for one of the worst confectionaries in existence</span><br>You could literally replace the peep painting with a picture of Auschwitz and nothing would be lost.", "filename": "1645027067596", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675160589789184, "time": 1675160589, "md5": "mLvTovCqohz3zg22mg+3TQ==", "fsize": 39547, "resto": 18879930}, {"no": 18879967, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:43:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why do people keep buying candy that nobody likes?
