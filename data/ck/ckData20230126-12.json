However, they are very annoying to use and clean. Lodge seasoning is extremely tough and nonstick, but because of the bumpy texture, you do get food stains that are difficult to clean off of the seasoning. Your spatula will make a lot of noise just brushing it across the surface and if any food burns/sticks, even just a small spot, then you just know it&#039;s going to be there the whole time you&#039;re cooking and that spot won&#039;t be nonstick anymore. I do not like using them. <br>-Finex/Stargazer/Butterpat/Field do not hold their seasoning very well. It just flakes off under normal use and there&#039;s no nice way to say it. If you think it&#039;s because some amateur is doing something wrong, using too much heat, not enough oil, then take a look at their websites and see the photos of the &quot;owner of the company&#039;s collection.&quot; All their pans have splotchy seasoning. That&#039;s not to say they don&#039;t work for what they are, but it&#039;s distracting and annoying when your pan is constantly destroying itself. I do not like using these, and I&#039;ve tried most of them.<br>-OLD skillets you buy from a flea market or ebay are the best. I don&#039;t know why this is, and you should strip the old seasoning (just soak in lye for a few days and it&#039;s easy) and re-season them yourself, but all of my old skillets, doesn&#039;t matter the brand, hold onto their seasoning, are easy to clean AND are really pleasant to use.", "time": 1674399749, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18842753, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:05:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I soak beans in sugar water overnight will they be sweet enough to eat as a dessert once cooked?", "time": 1674399918, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18843643, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:50:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18842504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18842504</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people say many spices are only fat soluble and oil works for that.</span><br>Meat has fat in it", "time": 1674417021, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18844086, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:45:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy steak, same cut from the same place</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marinate it the same way, cook it the same way</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;95% of the time great and delicious</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5% of the time the steak is way too tough and tastes like a worse cut of steak</span><br>What causes this?

It had to be me. I get that we have a snob reputation but really it&#039;s about having standards mate. For example, on the coffee conversation, I don&#039;t even think the French have the best coffee, sure it&#039;s part of our traditions, and we invented a few techniques (french press), we really democratized it early in our spice trade history, back in early 1800s it became a commodity etc. <br>But I am honest and unbiased enough that I can admit we don&#039;t have the best coffee. The best coffee (please stop thinking culture boils down to consuming it, its more than that) comes from the place the bean is grown. All the rest, the brewing aspects are mediocre in comparison in terms of importance. It&#039;s the bean. So someone asks me which place has the best coffee, in my opinion. I will say the best coffee bean I had came from Colombia. Secondly, Ethiopia. That&#039;s it. <br><br>So take the criticism and focus on what you&#039;re good at, based on the resources you have. If you asked me, god knows...Who has the best rugby league infrastructure/federation, I will say the Australians.

Book a flight bro and go eat out somewhere in Europe, the traditional meals. What would you even compare it to here? It&#039;s an immigrant country. Like my aussie friend he was northern irish of descent. His mom made Irish stew. That was the last he knew of &#039;&#039;good food&#039;&#039;. But he ate at Maccas and would constantly suggest KFC. You had to motivate him to eat vegetable other than fries. Yeah. <br>It&#039;s scary honestly the food culture in Australia. <br>You should really go see elsewhere mate how people eat local, and good in small owner/business, not the endless chains of soulless shit.

I have been to Ireland, Scotland and England to base my discourse. <br>I feel like the British cuisine in Australia is very derivative, like they have lost their processes, their culture. It comes from a lack of respect in the savoir-faire. Of course you get kids from TAFE with no cultural training, no long lessons to cook for cheap in the pub of the hotel/motel, of course it&#039;s not going to come out with the standard of a proper British steak dinner, mash and vegetables with gravy. There is so much more complexity, I really respect that and I understand the problem with both logistics and the immigration background of the country. <br>I also concede this to you. Using the term immigrant was too broad. What I mean is that first generation immigrant food is usually outstanding here.

So of course, we share some recipes on the border. I am familiar mostly with those. I am also familiar with the desserts, the pastries. The waffle, the crepe culture, the chocolate. <br>The reason belgian chocolate is so good, a lot of people forget is because of your empire in Africa, specifically Congo, and your ability to corner the chocolate spice trade early on, and develop your chocolatier arts very early on too, like we did. <br><br>Most people fail to realize usually the countries with the highest rated cuisines are so because they are past empires who had the resource hundreds of years before some others got finally access to it.

Like flammekeuche.. <br>I think also from the monastic culture of priest running the abbeys as production mills for income generation, by brewing ales for example, gave you an edge since Medieval era in your production of spirits. <br>In the category of alcohols, I think this is a matter of fact, it takes millenia for sure to make one single positive advancement.

I drove maybe 3 leagues to a quiet area (we live in the southern hemisphere, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet area) and I got out, went around like I was going to open its door for it and let it out, and I just beat the shit out of it while it was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked it if it wanted to go back to Oceania. It started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of it again. Then I asked it what it wanted to do. It finally got smart and said it wanted to go home. So I took it home and dared it to start trouble. I even handed it my cellphone and dialed King Charles on the drive home.

isn&#039;t a wound up neurotic wreck, so he just said, well lets look at the damage. <br><br> checked it out, and it wasn&#039;t that bad. he laughed and said, i&#039;ll take it, and paid the price of the pizza to the man. so the pizza i see, the story that brought it to my attention, and the image that caught my attention, it&#039;s the product of an accident and a reaction of people far away from

That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character. That said younger liubao or those that are aged somewhere drier like Kunming can be good too, they have a tendency to have more bitter and chocolate notes and maybe a sort of closer to ripe puer flavor profile. Anyway liubao is great, i think its generally better than ripe puer, at least in my experience.<br>Aged matters less with ripe puer, a couple years anywhere for the pile taste to air off some, preferably its aired loose leaf for a year or two before pressing. But after that aged makes a subtle difference unless we are talking hong kong traditional storage or some other very humid ageing environment. Older ripe (early 2000s and older) tended to be less heavily fermented and required a longer period of aging to reach a good taste profile and get out the pile notes. Modern ripes are rarely made that way and when they are they are typically fermented more carefully so they don&#039;t require the same aging period to be drinkable.", "time": 1674416876, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843658, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843631</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character.</span><br>I like this thread so I am resisting the urge to post a soyjak, you get away with it this time.", "time": 1674417390, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843661, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843459</a><br>I hate it", "time": 1674417409, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843683, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "drinking two GABA oolongs today, might as well make a brief comparison<br><br>unroasted Si Ji Chun GABA oolong:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scent: spices (cinnamon?) and maybe some honey</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taste: pears, spices, creamy, autumn leaves, some sweetness but also sourness / acidity. mild with no bitterness</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brewing: really easy to brew grandpa style. never gets bitter at all, it gets sour instead.

These are where everything is beautiful and the people buying stuff are so privileged that they don&#039;t even know how fucking coddled they are.<br><br>Second is the &quot;eat now&quot; farmers market.

Almost forget.<br><br>Third is the somewhat scrappy farmers market. A lot of stuff looks not that great because organic farming is not that great. Obviously if you don&#039;t spray your oranges, there may be scars from bugs on the peel. If there&#039;s not an abundance of time, your leek may have a shit ton of dirt on and in it. The cherries may look a bit off, but taste insane. You&#039;ll see small niche items like pomelo and japanese chives and tables full of the craziest tomatoes you&#039;ve ever seen in the right season.<br><br>Hopefully a small meat farmer as well. Never hurts to get these guys business card. You can call them, request whatever exotic cut, and they&#039;ll bring it on whatever date they say they can. If you fuck them, though, they&#039;ll never talk to you again. So be sure to pick up special orders.<br><br>Fnally, the trademark of the local, scrappy vendor is a big sign with the location of their farm and their farming practices.

I ordered my usual: One McGriddle and one McChicken, no mayo.<br>I took my seat in the booth and began work dabbing the grease from my sausage with a napkin. Simon, the McDonalds manager, noticed and said he did the same thing. Asking where I had picked up the habit, I made some mention of having learnt the trick from my Grandfather. Simon sighed, sat himself in the booth next to me, and leaned on my arm: it appears as though I had touched upon one of Simons tender points. <br>He spoke of his sisters approaching nuptials; from whence he made several digressions upon the character of womankind, touched a little upon the tender passion, and made sundry very excellent, though rather trite, observations upon disappointments in love. It was evident that he had something on his mind which he wished to impart, but felt awkward in approaching it. Simon made a pause, pulled up a tuft of napkins from the dispenser, threw them one by one over his shoulder, and at length, turning somewhat abruptly upon me, asked me if I had ever been in love. I confess the question startled me a little, as I am not over-fond of making confessions of my amorous follies; and above all, should never dream of choosing my friend Simon the Manager for a confidant. He did not wait, however, for a reply; the inquiry was merely a prelude to a confession on his own part, and after several circumlocutions and whimsical preambles, he fairly disburthened himself of a very tolerable story of his having been crossed in love.", "time": 1674612248, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852920, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:05:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18852914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18852914</a><br>What were the particulars of this tender tale, I have already forgotten; All that I recollect is that the lady, according to his account, was certainly a little touched; for she used to accept all the music that he copied for her harp, and all the patterns that he drew for her dresses; and he began to flatter himself, after a long course of delicate attentions, that he was gradually fanning up a gentle flame in her heart, when she suddenly accepted the hand of a rich, boisterous, fox-hunting baronet, without either music or sentiment, who carried her by storm after a fortnight&#039;s courtship.<br>Simon the Manager could not help concluding by some observation about &quot;modest merit,&quot; and the power of gold over the sex. As a remembrance of his passion, he pointed out a heart carved on the bark of one of the booths; but which, in the process of time, had grown out into a large excrescence; and he showed me a lock of her hair, which he wore in a true-lover&#039;s knot, in a large gold brooch.<br>The moment that Simon the Manager had gone through his confession, and, to use the common phrase, &quot;had made a clean breast of it,&quot; he became quite himself again. He had settled the point which had been worrying his mind, and doubtless considered himself established as a man of sentiment in my opinion. Before I had finished my McChicken, he was singing as blithe as a grasshopper, whistling quaint diddies , and telling droll stories: and I recollect that he was particularly facetious that evening with his crew on the subject of matrimony, and uttered several excellent jokes, not to be found in Joe Miller, that made the female coworker blush and look down; but set all the gentlemen of the crew in a roar, and absolutely brought tears into the assistant managers eyes.", "time": 1674612321, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852947, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:14:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847322</a><br>Every kid given that meal will be unhappy about it.", "time": 1674612868, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852955, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:16:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a><br>Hamburger no patty", "time": 1674612989, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852985, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:27:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a>", "filename": "R", "ext": ".png", "w": 1082, "h": 799, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1674613635889120, "time": 1674613635, "md5": "CWhOkDXeaNh3vN8gimIW9g==", "fsize": 1217955, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853019, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:34:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847417</a><br>edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!", "time": 1674614092, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853022, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:36:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18851338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18851338</a><br>Is that you Oney or Zach?", "time": 1674614218, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853030, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:39:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What would a sad meal contain?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying it isn&#039;t already one</span><br><br>a meal I cooked at home is happy.<br>a corporate junkfood meal is unhappy.", "time": 1674614354, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853038, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:41:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Soylent and the toy would be a DVD with the open scene of Up.", "time": 1674614514, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853044, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:43:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a><br>all the classics that a picky child hated to eat as a kid, also instead of a toy, it&#039;s a booklet full of blackpills and hurtful truthes", "time": 1674614621, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18854785, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:15:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Citalopram", "time": 1674663352, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18854813, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:28:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847149</a><br>I laughed out loud.

Thanks for the heads-up on the 21. Yeah I\u2019ve heard loads of people say it\u2019s not far off from the 15, but I\u2019ve also heard people say it ages well once the bottle has been opened and also after being poured. So just kinda curious there, as I thought that this might appeal to me since I\u2019m a slow drinker (I usually spend the first 15-30 minutes sniffing, kek).

You get a lot for your money, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s sweeter than what I\u2019m typically used to, but it\u2019s very fragrant and clinical. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any cheese or mushroom, but I\u2019ll take note of that and see what I can spot when I have my next glass later on. With my example there\u2019s a lot of green grape skin going on though. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t call it slow to open up, I can pretty much drink it immediately after pouring my glass but I like to take my time as the nose really is something. I typically buy Armagnac that\u2019s been bottled about 30 years after the date it has been distilled (kinda my sweet spot, though I do have both younger and older), and I also only buy single vintage (i.e. bottles with the year stamped on them instead of the age of the product). My current Delord is 39 years however (distilled 1982, bottled 2021) and I\u2019d happily buy it again. The only thing that annoys me about Delord is the wax they use to seal the cap is a LOT harder than literally any other Armagnac I\u2019ve ever had to open, that said it\u2019s a small price to pay for what\u2019s a very affordable product in my opinion, especially given the age.", "time": 1674106463, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829142, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18827079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18827079</a><br>Kek just because Armagnac isn\u2019t to your liking doesn\u2019t make it poor quality.

Just because it\u2019s distilled once doesn\u2019t make it cheap; that\u2019s a feature by design. This kind of open generalisation though shows that you\u2019re full of shit; there\u2019s a LOT more shit-tier mass-marketed Cognac in wasteful and fancy bottles compared to Armagnac; that doesn\u2019t make all Cognac shit though, but I\u2019ve definitely had a lot more Cognac which absolutely wasn\u2019t worth the money simply because the money clearly went into the bottle, packaging, and marketing.

Laubade does that, there\u2019s a cloth string a few mm wide under the wax which you can just pull to get the fucker off. The problem with Delord isn\u2019t the lack of string though, it\u2019s that the wax is like fucking porcelain i.e. really hard. My older bottles of Laubade had no string but even despite that the wax was super easy to peel off. I typically don\u2019t ever leave a bottle open for more than three months so I don\u2019t have an issue with ageing becoming a problem. I typically drink one shot a day with my significant other (we do have one or two breaks a week though), sometimes we share one shot, sometimes we have a shot each; so with my rule of four open bottles at once that pretty much guarantees each bottle will finished within three months. I devised this rule mostly because for whisky it can be very unpredictable how well a bottle ages, and in my experience it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to go downhill fast once the bottle is about 50% empty with all that air mucking about inside. Funnily enough I find Armagnac holds much better than whisky; I once had a bottle open for over a year and I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

This is generally good practice for cooking, but for burgers it is critical to get the burger assembled as soon after the patty has finished cooking as possible. Letting them rest and collect juice on a plate while you forget where you put the pickles is the worst. It should be an assembly line. The burger juice is key for the sauce and it&#039;s important to pick a bun that is substantial enough to hold up to it. <br><br>Next is the ratio of ingredients. This is more subjective, but personally I prefer equal amounts of veggie and meat with a burger that is roughly the same width as the bun. Having a huge thick burger that sticks way out the sides of the bun is annoying to eat and tastes like a fucking meatloaf sandwich, and having a tiny disc in the center of a gigantic bun is no good either. All the toppings should be sliced thin, and if you&#039;re doing lettuce, you&#039;ll want to shred it and very lightly dress it with lemon juice and olive oil to prevent it from browning. <br><br>As long as you do these things right, toppings, meat mixture, etc. are all just up to personal taste.

The religious rule of fasting exists to build character, primarily temperance and humility. Outside monastic communities it is not a strict law and more of an ideal, and for laymen it is usually considered enough to simply try your best. Not to get into the finer details, but there is also a strong tradition of vegetarian cooking which exists in order to properly celebrate religious feast days which occur during the fast. The food is meant to taste good, but it is very obviously lighter vegetarian cuisine.<br>Unlike the Catholics, fish is not licit during the fast (although it is seen as a &quot;less-bad&quot; food, in some places) and in fact in most places, the ideal fast excludes all dietary oils as well - which is by far the least-followed restriction among laymen for obvious reasons.<br>In this light, it is pretty clear where Beyond Meat and similar products belong. They are, at best, a &quot;less-bad&quot; food like fish, but fake meat products embody principles opposite to the ideal fasting food. The reason there is a &quot;debate&quot; is basically that disinterested laymen who might feel community pressure to fast will try to find loopholes in their daily life, and since the point of the fasting rule is humility, if you are another layman and not a priest it is considered counterproductive to insist and posture over the dietary rule that others are following, for the same reason that you aren&#039;t supposed to act prideful over people who don&#039;t fast.

He&#039;s claiming that a buzzfeed video that was only a meme here is responsible for making an entire generation like Panda Express. It&#039;s an unmedicated claim because it shows that he&#039;s never been off this website or talked to real people in close to a decade.

It&#039;s literally a restraunt for black, old people, and various fat poors. The entire post is completely out of touch with reality. <br><br>2. Even in the context of being a 4chan poster, mentioning that video before it&#039;s even been brought up in an attempt to rout it is unmedicated behavior because it shows that this guy has been involved in multiple panda express threads, and has been BTFO in them, and now he&#039;s replying to people who aren&#039;t even here by saying things that are irrelevant and out of context in this thread. He thinks 4chan is one person and we&#039;re all the guy he was talking to last time. He was probably also directly replied to with mention of that video in the past, and now it takes up a comically oversized real estate in his brain.<br><br>3. Accuses a buzzfeed video of being used by &quot;shills&quot; to promote Panda Express.
