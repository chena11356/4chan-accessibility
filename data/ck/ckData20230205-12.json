The degassing of light roasted coffee is, in contrast to dark and medium roasts, smaller in absolute terms and less impacted by the roasting speed; no increasing trend from a slow to a fast roast profile was observed (Figure 5a, light roast).

But this seemed to be crossing the line. Nevertheless, I knew that presentation wasn&#039;t everything, so I carried on.

Tears welled in my eyes as I opened my mouth and took my first (and only) bite. I tasted nothing upon entry. I tasted nothing upon the first bite of the chew. I chewed thrice more before &quot;flavor&quot; made itself known. It was not a welcome one. I have never had the displeasure of chewing on an old dishrag that had been dropped and forgotten behind a restaurant dishwasher, but this must have been its closest &quot;edible&quot; imitation.<br>I let the chewed mass fall from my mouth, back into the so-called &quot;wrapper&quot;, letting it dribble upon the supposed &quot;sandwich&quot;. I went to the nearest drug store and bought mouth wash - it took 5 cycles to rinse out the taste. Unfortunately, the pungent aroma that had seated itself in my sinus would persist for hours.<br><br>It was not until I stopped at my local Arby&#039;s restaurant and ordered a Roast Beef Sandwich that I had would have a sandwich worthy of the day.

I went with layered mascarpone, chocolate mousse and ganache with crushed amaretti biscuits. I happened to have some nice heavy Old Fashioned glasses to use but anything approx that size is fine. Practice if you need to at home, and transport them in a cooler bag with some freezer blocks or ice.<br>Cook whatever you like at her home. Something simple like pasta with any one-pot sauce, aglio e olio and mushrooms, whatever. Presentation is not THAT important and in fact a home-cooked charm is more useful. If you feel flush with cash pick a more ritzy ingredient or two to highlight (steaks can work, or fancy cheeses, or the like). The dessert will be buying you the majority of the brownie points and you know it&#039;s good before you walk in the door. Pressure is off.
