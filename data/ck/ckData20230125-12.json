WKS is a combination of Wernicke&#039;s encephalopathy and Koraskoff syndrome. Wernicke&#039;s encephalopathy develops acutely while Koraskoff syndrome can be either acute or chronic. The symptoms of WKS are due to the brain damage caused by vitamin B1 deficiency, there is often permanent brain damage if it&#039;s not treated quickly.<br><br>Wernicke&#039;s encephalopathy is defined by the following three symptoms:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis or weakness in the muscles that move the eyes) or Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ataxia (abnormal gait, difficulty coordinating muscles used in walking)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Delirium (confusion, lowered state of consciousness)</span><br><br>Koraskoff syndrome is less well defined, but mainly consists of problems with memory, symptoms include:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Amnesia (memory loss)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Confabulation (making up false memories)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inability to remember memories in chronological order</span><br><br>It is important to note that there are other medical conditions which can mimic the symptoms of WKS, notably:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hepatic encephalopathy</span><br>This is brain toxicity caused by liver failure<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Delirium tremens</span><br>This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome with profound confusion and other neurological symptoms such as seizures.

However, they are very annoying to use and clean. Lodge seasoning is extremely tough and nonstick, but because of the bumpy texture, you do get food stains that are difficult to clean off of the seasoning. Your spatula will make a lot of noise just brushing it across the surface and if any food burns/sticks, even just a small spot, then you just know it&#039;s going to be there the whole time you&#039;re cooking and that spot won&#039;t be nonstick anymore. I do not like using them. <br>-Finex/Stargazer/Butterpat/Field do not hold their seasoning very well. It just flakes off under normal use and there&#039;s no nice way to say it. If you think it&#039;s because some amateur is doing something wrong, using too much heat, not enough oil, then take a look at their websites and see the photos of the &quot;owner of the company&#039;s collection.&quot; All their pans have splotchy seasoning. That&#039;s not to say they don&#039;t work for what they are, but it&#039;s distracting and annoying when your pan is constantly destroying itself. I do not like using these, and I&#039;ve tried most of them.<br>-OLD skillets you buy from a flea market or ebay are the best. I don&#039;t know why this is, and you should strip the old seasoning (just soak in lye for a few days and it&#039;s easy) and re-season them yourself, but all of my old skillets, doesn&#039;t matter the brand, hold onto their seasoning, are easy to clean AND are really pleasant to use.", "time": 1674399749, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18842753, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:05:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I soak beans in sugar water overnight will they be sweet enough to eat as a dessert once cooked?", "time": 1674399918, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18843643, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:50:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18842504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18842504</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people say many spices are only fat soluble and oil works for that.</span><br>Meat has fat in it", "time": 1674417021, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18844086, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:45:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy steak, same cut from the same place</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marinate it the same way, cook it the same way</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;95% of the time great and delicious</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5% of the time the steak is way too tough and tastes like a worse cut of steak</span><br>What causes this?

You get a lot for your money, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s sweeter than what I\u2019m typically used to, but it\u2019s very fragrant and clinical. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any cheese or mushroom, but I\u2019ll take note of that and see what I can spot when I have my next glass later on. With my example there\u2019s a lot of green grape skin going on though. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t call it slow to open up, I can pretty much drink it immediately after pouring my glass but I like to take my time as the nose really is something. I typically buy Armagnac that\u2019s been bottled about 30 years after the date it has been distilled (kinda my sweet spot, though I do have both younger and older), and I also only buy single vintage (i.e. bottles with the year stamped on them instead of the age of the product). My current Delord is 39 years however (distilled 1982, bottled 2021) and I\u2019d happily buy it again. The only thing that annoys me about Delord is the wax they use to seal the cap is a LOT harder than literally any other Armagnac I\u2019ve ever had to open, that said it\u2019s a small price to pay for what\u2019s a very affordable product in my opinion, especially given the age.", "time": 1674106463, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829142, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18827079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18827079</a><br>Kek just because Armagnac isn\u2019t to your liking doesn\u2019t make it poor quality.

Looking at my tasting notes though, this is what I wrote: nose: extremely grape-y, like sniffing a well packed bouquet of fruits and berries packed in a basket held together by UHU glue; palate: sweet, minty and clinical, hard to pinpoint individual flavours, there\u2019s something synthetic about the flavour but in a way I very much enjoy, it just tastes super clean; finish: the synthetic part really comes out here, plasticky but damn it\u2019s addictive (bits of the UHU glue nose come out here on your taste buds, and just like UHU glue, it\u2019s god damn addictive). This definitely won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but god damn am I always in a heightened state of zen whenever I take my shot from this bottle.", "time": 1674125430, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829703, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)06:11:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18829670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18829670</a><br>I&#039;ve heard that older Delord bottles will peak within 3 months to a year of air before you should consider gassing them or decanting into smaller bottles.<br><br>I had a feeling about the wax.

Laubade does that, there\u2019s a cloth string a few mm wide under the wax which you can just pull to get the fucker off. The problem with Delord isn\u2019t the lack of string though, it\u2019s that the wax is like fucking porcelain i.e. really hard. My older bottles of Laubade had no string but even despite that the wax was super easy to peel off. I typically don\u2019t ever leave a bottle open for more than three months so I don\u2019t have an issue with ageing becoming a problem. I typically drink one shot a day with my significant other (we do have one or two breaks a week though), sometimes we share one shot, sometimes we have a shot each; so with my rule of four open bottles at once that pretty much guarantees each bottle will finished within three months. I devised this rule mostly because for whisky it can be very unpredictable how well a bottle ages, and in my experience it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to go downhill fast once the bottle is about 50% empty with all that air mucking about inside. Funnily enough I find Armagnac holds much better than whisky; I once had a bottle open for over a year and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. But like my current Glenfiddich 15 VAT 03 that\u2019s open, I can tell I\u2019m enjoying it a wee bit less now that the bottle is down to its remainder 35%.

That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character. That said younger liubao or those that are aged somewhere drier like Kunming can be good too, they have a tendency to have more bitter and chocolate notes and maybe a sort of closer to ripe puer flavor profile. Anyway liubao is great, i think its generally better than ripe puer, at least in my experience.<br>Aged matters less with ripe puer, a couple years anywhere for the pile taste to air off some, preferably its aired loose leaf for a year or two before pressing. But after that aged makes a subtle difference unless we are talking hong kong traditional storage or some other very humid ageing environment. Older ripe (early 2000s and older) tended to be less heavily fermented and required a longer period of aging to reach a good taste profile and get out the pile notes. Modern ripes are rarely made that way and when they are they are typically fermented more carefully so they don&#039;t require the same aging period to be drinkable.", "time": 1674416876, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843658, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843631</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character.</span><br>I like this thread so I am resisting the urge to post a soyjak, you get away with it this time.", "time": 1674417390, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843661, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843459</a><br>I hate it", "time": 1674417409, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843683, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "drinking two GABA oolongs today, might as well make a brief comparison<br><br>unroasted Si Ji Chun GABA oolong:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scent: spices (cinnamon?) and maybe some honey</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taste: pears, spices, creamy, autumn leaves, some sweetness but also sourness / acidity. mild with no bitterness</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brewing: really easy to brew grandpa style. never gets bitter at all, it gets sour instead.

Only Ethiopians don&#039;t have this problem from what I&#039;ve seen.<br>From a Greek Orthodox perspective, as far as fasting goes, you either try to eat fast-appropriate food with greater or lesser effort, or you don&#039;t even try to fast. The religious rule of fasting exists to build character, primarily temperance and humility. Outside monastic communities it is not a strict law and more of an ideal, and for laymen it is usually considered enough to simply try your best. Not to get into the finer details, but there is also a strong tradition of vegetarian cooking which exists in order to properly celebrate religious feast days which occur during the fast. The food is meant to taste good, but it is very obviously lighter vegetarian cuisine.<br>Unlike the Catholics, fish is not licit during the fast (although it is seen as a &quot;less-bad&quot; food, in some places) and in fact in most places, the ideal fast excludes all dietary oils as well - which is by far the least-followed restriction among laymen for obvious reasons.<br>In this light, it is pretty clear where Beyond Meat and similar products belong. They are, at best, a &quot;less-bad&quot; food like fish, but fake meat products embody principles opposite to the ideal fasting food. The reason there is a &quot;debate&quot; is basically that disinterested laymen who might feel community pressure to fast will try to find loopholes in their daily life, and since the point of the fasting rule is humility, if you are another layman and not a priest it is considered counterproductive to insist and posture over the dietary rule that others are following, for the same reason that you aren&#039;t supposed to act prideful over people who don&#039;t fast.

I saw a lot of meat based recipes in the thread so I&#039;m going to give you some ideas for primo.<br><br>Pasta aglio, olio e peperoncino. The most basic pasta you can make but it&#039;s really flavourful. Just oil, garlic and spicy peppers in a pan. Cook the pasta, throw in the pan, add some parsley and a spoon of breadcrumbs (parsley and breadcrumbs are optional but taste real good). Enjoy.<br><br>Ragu also can be done without tomatoes. I make a base with celery, carrots and onions, brown them with some butter and oil. Add some sausage (not what americans call &quot;italian sausage&quot;, it tastes wrong) and ground beef. Cook it till browned. Add some red wine. Once the wine evaporates, start adding vegetable broth. Cook it for a couple hours. To season you can use salt, pepper, bey leaf, rosemary, sage (all fresh and finely chopped, you can put them in a tea bag thingy and take them out). <br>Fucking delicious in lasagna, but also just on regular ass egg pasta is great<br><br>Pasta with broccoli and sausage is also fairly typical, I usually put pecorino romano on top. You can also puree the broccoli to make a sauce and then use nutritional yeast to flavor it if you want to skip dairy. Not very traditional but I&#039;ve made it like that when I had people who can&#039;t eat dairy over.<br><br>Risotto of course. Very easy but impresses everyone every time. The basic recipe is a base with onions and butter, cook till browned, add the rice (arborio or carnaroli) to toast it, add wine, once the wine evaporates cook it with broth until tender. At the end you should add butter and cheese. You can make it in a thousand ways, with fish, meat and vegetables. My favourite is pumpkin and sausage (add the sausage with the onions, and pumpkin puree with the broth), but also basic ass saffron risotto tastes amazing.<br><br>Chicken broth with tortellini.

He&#039;s claiming that a buzzfeed video that was only a meme here is responsible for making an entire generation like Panda Express. It&#039;s an unmedicated claim because it shows that he&#039;s never been off this website or talked to real people in close to a decade. I have never seen that video mentioned outside these threads, and never met anyone IRL or in normie social media who likes Panda Express. It&#039;s literally a restraunt for black, old people, and various fat poors. The entire post is completely out of touch with reality. <br><br>2. Even in the context of being a 4chan poster, mentioning that video before it&#039;s even been brought up in an attempt to rout it is unmedicated behavior because it shows that this guy has been involved in multiple panda express threads, and has been BTFO in them, and now he&#039;s replying to people who aren&#039;t even here by saying things that are irrelevant and out of context in this thread. He thinks 4chan is one person and we&#039;re all the guy he was talking to last time. He was probably also directly replied to with mention of that video in the past, and now it takes up a comically oversized real estate in his brain.<br><br>3. Accuses a buzzfeed video of being used by &quot;shills&quot; to promote Panda Express.

I simply refuse to believe that you&#039;ve eaten Panda Express and didn&#039;t think it tasted good.<br><br>Now, what is more likely is that you&#039;re a second or third-generation Asian American, or one of their millennial or zoomer apologists, who hates Panda Express because you think it isn&#039;t &quot;authentic.&quot; You hate the implication that Panda Express has anything to do with Chinese or Asian food because it&#039;s very different from food traditionally eaten in (most of) China. And hating Panda Express as a position is attractive to you because it&#039;s a signal of being upper-class and educated about the latest cultural issues and academically prescribed tastes. American elites love pretending they don&#039;t like unsophisticated food and entertainment, even when it&#039;s actually (and obviously) good.", "time": 1674587302, "resto": 18849743}, {"no": 18851648, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)15:01:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18849743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18849743</a><br>Their fried rice/chow mein is 40% oil, just look at it closely the next time you go.

I ordered my usual: One McGriddle and one McChicken, no mayo.<br>I took my seat in the booth and began work dabbing the grease from my sausage with a napkin. Simon, the McDonalds manager, noticed and said he did the same thing. Asking where I had picked up the habit, I made some mention of having learnt the trick from my Grandfather. Simon sighed, sat himself in the booth next to me, and leaned on my arm: it appears as though I had touched upon one of Simons tender points. <br>He spoke of his sisters approaching nuptials; from whence he made several digressions upon the character of womankind, touched a little upon the tender passion, and made sundry very excellent, though rather trite, observations upon disappointments in love. It was evident that he had something on his mind which he wished to impart, but felt awkward in approaching it. Simon made a pause, pulled up a tuft of napkins from the dispenser, threw them one by one over his shoulder, and at length, turning somewhat abruptly upon me, asked me if I had ever been in love. I confess the question startled me a little, as I am not over-fond of making confessions of my amorous follies; and above all, should never dream of choosing my friend Simon the Manager for a confidant. He did not wait, however, for a reply; the inquiry was merely a prelude to a confession on his own part, and after several circumlocutions and whimsical preambles, he fairly disburthened himself of a very tolerable story of his having been crossed in love.", "time": 1674612248, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852920, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:05:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18852914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18852914</a><br>What were the particulars of this tender tale, I have already forgotten; All that I recollect is that the lady, according to his account, was certainly a little touched; for she used to accept all the music that he copied for her harp, and all the patterns that he drew for her dresses; and he began to flatter himself, after a long course of delicate attentions, that he was gradually fanning up a gentle flame in her heart, when she suddenly accepted the hand of a rich, boisterous, fox-hunting baronet, without either music or sentiment, who carried her by storm after a fortnight&#039;s courtship.<br>Simon the Manager could not help concluding by some observation about &quot;modest merit,&quot; and the power of gold over the sex. As a remembrance of his passion, he pointed out a heart carved on the bark of one of the booths; but which, in the process of time, had grown out into a large excrescence; and he showed me a lock of her hair, which he wore in a true-lover&#039;s knot, in a large gold brooch.<br>The moment that Simon the Manager had gone through his confession, and, to use the common phrase, &quot;had made a clean breast of it,&quot; he became quite himself again. He had settled the point which had been worrying his mind, and doubtless considered himself established as a man of sentiment in my opinion. Before I had finished my McChicken, he was singing as blithe as a grasshopper, whistling quaint diddies , and telling droll stories: and I recollect that he was particularly facetious that evening with his crew on the subject of matrimony, and uttered several excellent jokes, not to be found in Joe Miller, that made the female coworker blush and look down; but set all the gentlemen of the crew in a roar, and absolutely brought tears into the assistant managers eyes.", "time": 1674612321, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852947, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:14:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847322</a><br>Every kid given that meal will be unhappy about it.", "time": 1674612868, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852955, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:16:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a><br>Hamburger no patty", "time": 1674612989, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18852985, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:27:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a>", "filename": "R", "ext": ".png", "w": 1082, "h": 799, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1674613635889120, "time": 1674613635, "md5": "CWhOkDXeaNh3vN8gimIW9g==", "fsize": 1217955, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853019, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:34:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847417</a><br>edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!", "time": 1674614092, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853022, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:36:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18851338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18851338</a><br>Is that you Oney or Zach?", "time": 1674614218, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853030, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:39:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What would a sad meal contain?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying it isn&#039;t already one</span><br><br>a meal I cooked at home is happy.<br>a corporate junkfood meal is unhappy.", "time": 1674614354, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853038, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:41:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Soylent and the toy would be a DVD with the open scene of Up.", "time": 1674614514, "resto": 18847147}, {"no": 18853044, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:43:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18847147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18847147</a><br>all the classics that a picky child hated to eat as a kid, also instead of a toy, it&#039;s a booklet full of blackpills and hurtful truthes", "time": 1674614621, "resto": 18847147}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18848366, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:05:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are crispy/fried potatoes so popular and delicious?", "filename": "inCollage_20230123_170304936", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 2400, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674515116911779, "time": 1674515116, "md5": "g8i9Aj/6l/T62k2SEa5Mbw==", "fsize": 2810089, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-are-crispyfried-potatoes-so-popular-and", "replies": 39, "images": 8, "unique_ips": 20}, {"no": 18848371, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:06:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;why is [tasty thing] so popular </span><br>idk man that\u2019s fuckin rocket surgery", "time": 1674515178, "resto": 18848366}, {"no": 18848391, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:09:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18848366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18848366</a><br>Potatoes, fat to fry them in, and salt to sprinkle on them are all cheap; carbohydrates, fat, and salt are all things that humans instinctively crave, so the combination of these two factors mean they are extremely common.", "time": 1674515368, "resto": 18848366}, {"no": 18848418, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:16:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;potatoes taste good</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fried stuff tastes good</span><br>I dunno OP it&#039;s a complete mystery", "time": 1674515806, "resto": 18848366}, {"no": 18848494, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:35:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18848371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18848371</a><br><a href=\"#p18848418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18848418</a><br>Ok I get it", "filename": "download (89)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674516919885334, "time": 1674516919, "md5": "hnAQX9OJ5+8vsI87nOzU2A==", "fsize": 7025, "resto": 18848366}, {"no": 18848510, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:39:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Damn, now I want some crispy roasted potatoes.
