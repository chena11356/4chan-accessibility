Unless you have a family you&#039;ll never use all 3 cups. Keep in mind that it&#039;s talking about dry cups -- that&#039;s 1900 calories of rice. You&#039;re really gonna eat more than that in one sitting? <br><br>If you&#039;re not gonna eat more than that in one sitting, the smaller cup size is actually better than the bigger cup size. 1 cup of rice cooks better in the 3-cup pot than in the 5-cup pot. That&#039;s because less of it is &quot;on the bottom&quot; and more of it is &quot;in the middle.&quot; It also stays more steamed since it&#039;s more cozy.

By the time roasted coffee gets to you it has rested enough. Coffee is rested for 1-3 days after roasting for the flavors to develop. Do not confuse this with the spergy weeks-long CO2 off-gassing espresso dorks do. They do this so that they can more precisely dial in their shots at the expense of losing flavor. I repeat: they are losing flavor as a trade off for replicability of espresso shot extraction. The volatile aromatic compounds that give good, fresh coffee its taste are lost over time.

Practice if you need to at home, and transport them in a cooler bag with some freezer blocks or ice.<br>Cook whatever you like at her home. Something simple like pasta with any one-pot sauce, aglio e olio and mushrooms, whatever. Presentation is not THAT important and in fact a home-cooked charm is more useful. If you feel flush with cash pick a more ritzy ingredient or two to highlight (steaks can work, or fancy cheeses, or the like). The dessert will be buying you the majority of the brownie points and you know it&#039;s good before you walk in the door. Pressure is off.

It&#039;s common in commercial kitchens, when roasting in large ovens, to either hang the meat by hooks or place it on a rotisserie device. That vessel is not ideal for roasting, and you mentioned you placed a lid on it, which means during some part of the cooking process you were actually braising which is pretty much the complete opposite of roasting.

I suck at describing spices, but you probably already know what this one tastes like.<br>Kashmiri chili powder: this is a pretty mild chili powder made from Kashmiri chilis. It has a strong red color. Flavorwise, it&#039;s kind of like paprika with a very mild amount of heat. You could also use a hotter chili powder (usually just sold as chili powder at your local Indian grocery store). Do not use American style chili powder. It&#039;s got a bunch of stuff besides ground chilis in it and does not have the sort of flavor profile you want.

It has an earthy flavor.<br>Hing AKA Asafoetida: It has an allium (that&#039;s the plant family things like onions and garlic are from) sort of flavor and a little goes a long way.<br>Salt: I err on the side of caution and just use a little salt in the initial spice blend.

Some people fear salt, but unless you&#039;ve got salt sensitive blood pressure, it&#039;s not something you need to worry about. If your Indian cooking tastes bland, odds are the problem is that you didn&#039;t use enough salt rather than not using enough spices. Salt brings out the flavors of spices, vegetables, lentils, beans etc. <br>Garam masala: Garam means warm, masala means spice. Garam masala can vary a lot and every brand will use different spices and in different amounts. It&#039;s a spice mix of ingredients like cumin, mace, cinnamon, cloves, fennel, star anise. Every mix will be made differently. Most of the time, it&#039;s made from spices that have already been toasted in which case you should add it at the end of cooking.

You see, I don&#039;t have much money in life, and it really makes me feel bad when I see other people being able to afford stuff that I cannot.<br>The frustration I feel is the feeling of inferiority and inadequacy that invariably surfaces when I have to resign myself to not sharing in these experiences due to a lack of funds. As such, I react with impotent frustration and dismiss the whole thing as merely a &#039;meme&#039; or as something only self-deceiving people would fall for (think expensive wines etc.) in order to not have to dwell on said feelings of inadequacy. It makes me feel momentarily better when I propose that it&#039;s all just shit that I&#039;m better off without, especially when other anons in the same position validate my opinion by agreeing with me.<br>So here we go:<br><br>Only fucking stupid woman idiot whores and libcuck retard NPCs controlled by Jewish mind-control would ever buy such trash!

This has several benefits:<br><br>- Allows the cut apples to cook before they&#039;ve had a chance to oxidize and turn brown from sitting out for too long, which is a problem with cooking pie the traditional way where the fruit filling isn&#039;t cooked until it goes in the oven with the pie. Some recipes try to solve this problem by instructing you to cover the peeled/sliced apples with lemon juice, but this isn&#039;t that effective as just cooking them straight away before they&#039;ve had a chance to turn brown.<br>- When apples cook, they soften, collapse, and release a lot of excess water which can make the pie soggy. By cooking them in the pan, you can control this variable and reduce that excess liquid into a syrup and intensify the apple flavor and its natural sweetness. Many recipes try to mitigate this problem by instructing you to add flour or starch to the pie filling, or to let the sliced apples sit in sugar to drain off some excess liquid. but once again if you let the apples sit out for too long they&#039;ll turn brown. And what do you do with that excess liquid? you can drain it off which is wasteful, or reduce that to a glaze or syrup, which is already accomplished in my method anyway, and no need for any additional starch in the filling.<br>- by cooking the pie filling in a pan, it&#039;s your opportunity to achieve nice caramelization of the various ingredients like the butter, the apples, and the sugar if you desire, which cannot happen in the oven if the pie is covered in a crust. Even if the top of the pie is exposed, you may only get browning on that surface but not throughout the pie filling.", "time": 1675438682, "resto": 18892209}, {"no": 18892249, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)10:38:09", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "ADF28555-4750-4C5A-8EB7-5D3FC1C83C69", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 220, "h": 286, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675438689619512, "time": 1675438689, "md5": "k0PuQnTMvzGbZre5pq1pZw==", "fsize": 18555, "resto": 18892209}, {"no": 18892251, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)10:40:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18892209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18892209</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m a professional piemaster</span><br>that&#039;s the funniest shit I&#039;ve read all day. thanks for the laugh, sis", "time": 1675438852, "resto": 18892209}, {"no": 18892324, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:09:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18892247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18892247</a><br>Precooking apples is the way to go.

First reason is i dont mind if the apple pie filling ends up soft and mushy. In fact i kind of like that. It can contrast with the crusty pie crust. But even so, the apples never get as mushy as applesauce unless if you actually mashed them like potatoes which I don\u2019t do. I\u2019m still left with satisfying pieces of apple in the finished pie. Second reason is the natural sweetness of the apples can be balanced out by adding acid if desired. Acid from any citrus fruit is a good way to go, and some recipes i\u2019ve seen even use balsamic vinegar.
