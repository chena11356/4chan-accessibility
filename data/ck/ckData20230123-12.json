It&#039;s the prepping of the meat that takes lots of time. The pork belly is washed, patted dry and seasoned with chillis, garlic, 15-20 sugar : 1 salt in a basin. Then let rest under direct sunlight for a whole day. (remember to use food wrapper). Then just cook under VERY low flame in 100% quality coconut water until the water becomes deep brown like a demi-glace.<br>What to expect from this dish? It&#039;s sweet, balanced with some salt and msg. The fat is almost translucent (thanks to sugar). It should be able to hold the meat together.<br>My recipe calls for extra steps in preparing the meat: The meat is seasoned and let rest like the OG. But then it is blanched from cold water with ginger until it sets its shape, then wash it. Dock the skin with whatever tool you have, and apply generous amount of salt, rub it, then pat it VERY dry. <br>Deep fry meat: fat, skin face down in just right amount of oil (only fat is fried). Once some of the fat is rendered, remove the deep fry oil and sear the meat on all sides until lightly brown with some scorching. Then, steam the meat on medium for 3-4 hours. After that, collect all the juice and fat and reserve meat in fridge. You can even smoke the meat by putting some smoking wood into the steaming water, and letting the water evaporate and burn the wood soot on purpose. I recommend having a dedicated steaming basin for this because it will get decimated.<br>Make coconut demi-glace with chilli pepper, garlic, salt, sugar, msg, and coconut water until thickened. Mix with steamed meat juice.<br>Pour demi-glace on meat, steam and serve.<br>The result from my recipe should be: less fatty, have a nice smokey flavour like how people in the countryside have it.<br><a href=\"#p18845661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18845661</a><br>thanks lol", "time": 1674462628, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846160, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:31:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18846155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18846155</a><br>i want those fingers down my throat", "time": 1674462697, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846443, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:02:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18845835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18845835</a><br>From the look of it, it&#039;s Vietnamese LNY food.<br>Source: t.Vietfag.", "time": 1674471746, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846521, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:42:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18841744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18841744</a><br>Pew pew pew", "time": 1674474121, "resto": 18841744}, {"no": 18846567, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)07:04:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18841744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18841744</a><br>It&#039;s Lunar New Year, you uneducated savage.<br>Half of asia celebrates that, not only china.

The religious rule of fasting exists to build character, primarily temperance and humility. Outside monastic communities it is not a strict law and more of an ideal, and for laymen it is usually considered enough to simply try your best. Not to get into the finer details, but there is also a strong tradition of vegetarian cooking which exists in order to properly celebrate religious feast days which occur during the fast. The food is meant to taste good, but it is very obviously lighter vegetarian cuisine.<br>Unlike the Catholics, fish is not licit during the fast (although it is seen as a &quot;less-bad&quot; food, in some places) and in fact in most places, the ideal fast excludes all dietary oils as well - which is by far the least-followed restriction among laymen for obvious reasons.<br>In this light, it is pretty clear where Beyond Meat and similar products belong. They are, at best, a &quot;less-bad&quot; food like fish, but fake meat products embody principles opposite to the ideal fasting food. The reason there is a &quot;debate&quot; is basically that disinterested laymen who might feel community pressure to fast will try to find loopholes in their daily life, and since the point of the fasting rule is humility, if you are another layman and not a priest it is considered counterproductive to insist and posture over the dietary rule that others are following, for the same reason that you aren&#039;t supposed to act prideful over people who don&#039;t fast.

Pork belly is very distinct from other meats because it&#039;s incredibly fatty and either made into bacon or used by Asians because it&#039;s really cheap. If uncured, it can be sliced and grilled or pan fried quite easily and makes a nice sandwich filling.<br>The loin is the more lean cut that&#039;s typically sliced into medallions with a small bit of fat to make pork chops. This cut is also better panfried or grilled but you must be cautious because the core loin is so lean that it&#039;s easy to overcook it and make shoe leather (hence why many adults don&#039;t like pork chops; their parents probably overcooked the loin into tasteless rubber to &quot;get rid of the fat&quot;). A favorite recipe of mine is lomo adobado, which is a whole pork loin that you marinate in a thick mix of quality paprika, crushed garlic, herbs, white wine vinegar, olive oil and lemon juice and then grill on a BBQ. Great dish to serve guests at a BBQ.<br>The hindquarters of pork are almost exclusively made into ham while you can often buy whole pork shoulder which is typically cooked as a roast with veg etc. a la roast beef or slow roasted to make pulled pork. Above the shoulder and across the neck is a tougher more marbled cut called the &quot;butt&quot; or &quot;scallop&quot; that is either cooked similarly to the shoulder, or minced to make sausage. Most pork sausages use meat from the butt and shoulder.<br>Finally you have the hocks: the ankles and lower legs of the pig. These are typically either boiled &amp; roasted or slow cooked in a stew. Probably the cheapest cut and makes a nice stew because it has a large amount of connective tissue that thickens the broth, and the tough meat lends well to stewing.<br><br>t. butcherfag", "filename": "77424714a7df12abaf6dd84c6204b81f", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 55, "tim": 1674469786160210, "time": 1674469786, "md5": "S2JNT7lv+C6aEV6djFk8Xg==", "fsize": 60970, "resto": 18845741}, {"no": 18846409, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)05:43:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18846381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18846381</a><br>In general, pork lends itself better to marinating or curing than any other kind of meat. You can make bacon out of any cut of pork by wet curing it in brine and in some countries like Ireland they make bacon not only from the belly and loin, but the butt, shoulder and ham as well. Another very common flavour profile besides curing is fresh pork, mustard and apples; pork tends to have a very slight sweetness to it that is complimented greatly by sweet apples which is a combination found across the world. Other kinds of natural sweetness also combine well with pork, such as honey and brown sugar. Pork chops cooked with slices of apple and garnished with a strong mustard is a very traditional British dish that is quite tasty.<br>For Asian dishes, you can marinate pork in some mixture of oil, soy sauce, freshly chopped garlic &amp; ginger. Like bacon, the sodium in soy sauce really enhances the pork&#039;s flavour which is then complimented by the garlic and ginger. Sliced pork belly marinated in this way and then grilled/fried and served with rice and steamed vegetables would make a nice Asiatic style dish.", "time": 1674470590, "resto": 18845741}, {"no": 18846437, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)05:56:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18845741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18845741</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sausage</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bacon</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cold cuts</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pulled pork aka the best form of bbq</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mother fuckin RIBS</span><br>It&#039;s very varied.

Here&#039;s the thing - all the ingredients can be prepared ahead of time and left in the fridge for days. Make a batch of dough, separate into several pieces (I make 4 at once), let them ferment in the fridge. Not only does the dough you made days ago lasts for about 6 days, it only gets better and better. Same with the sauce: buy a can of tomatoes, there should be enough sauce for about 10 small-medium sized pizzas, stores well for a couple weeks. Not to mention all the toppings: dry mozzarella, parmesan, pepperoni, onions, pepper and much more can be cut to size and stored in containers in the fridge for a long time.<br>In terms of cost, prices are different everywhere. I calculated the cost of my pizzas a few months ago, for a single pizza (out of batch of 12 from one can of tomatoes for sauce) it turned out to be under $1.5 for pizza roughly 25cm in diameter, which largely came from cheese - and I used a lot, could reduce by half and would still be great.<br>In terms of time, it&#039;s really just mixing the dough and cooking the sauce, which takes under half an hour for me, and then cutting up or shredding the toppings for a few minutes. Granted, I have to make dough two or three times to use all of the sauce, but it&#039;s not an issue at all. Making the pizza every day takes a couple minutes.<br>Dough recipe is important, as well as technique, but even the most basic homemade pizza would be great, and once you are comfortable with the basics, you can gradually improve. I make a lot of pizza at home since a few years ago, definitely over a hundred pizzas at this point, and I still improve something every time.

They&#039;re opening one near me soon and I plan on trying it out. What should I order? <br><br>I&#039;m making this thread because they&#039;ve opened a bunch of Whataburgers in my city and it seems to be an extremely polarizing fast food place. Some people, especially those from Texas, claim it is literally the best fast food restaurant, and that you can&#039;t do better. Other people I&#039;ve talked to have said it&#039;s okay, pretty decent, not bad, but nothing special. Which is true? <br><br>For the record I&#039;ve had great Fast Food in my life. I just moved away from a place that had a Braum&#039;s, and I loved it. Is Whataburger at least as good or cheap as Braum&#039;s? Aside from that we have Culver&#039;s here and I think it&#039;s great. Freddy&#039;s is also okay but not as good as Culver&#039;s. Is Whataburger better than either of those? I&#039;ve also had IN-N-Out on my journeys out west, and I think it&#039;s a fantastic burger for the price.<br><br>My internal ranking is that for fast food, Culver&#039;s and In-N-Out are the best. For the price, In-N-Out is definitely the best. I&#039;d put Braum&#039;s at #3 for me personally. <br><br>But Whataburger seems to have advantages. They&#039;re 24 hours, they have a 12 hour all night/morning breakfast menu, and it seems like they might have some stuff that other places don&#039;t?

However, they are very annoying to use and clean. Lodge seasoning is extremely tough and nonstick, but because of the bumpy texture, you do get food stains that are difficult to clean off of the seasoning. Your spatula will make a lot of noise just brushing it across the surface and if any food burns/sticks, even just a small spot, then you just know it&#039;s going to be there the whole time you&#039;re cooking and that spot won&#039;t be nonstick anymore. I do not like using them. <br>-Finex/Stargazer/Butterpat/Field do not hold their seasoning very well. It just flakes off under normal use and there&#039;s no nice way to say it. If you think it&#039;s because some amateur is doing something wrong, using too much heat, not enough oil, then take a look at their websites and see the photos of the &quot;owner of the company&#039;s collection.&quot; All their pans have splotchy seasoning. That&#039;s not to say they don&#039;t work for what they are, but it&#039;s distracting and annoying when your pan is constantly destroying itself. I do not like using these, and I&#039;ve tried most of them.<br>-OLD skillets you buy from a flea market or ebay are the best. I don&#039;t know why this is, and you should strip the old seasoning (just soak in lye for a few days and it&#039;s easy) and re-season them yourself, but all of my old skillets, doesn&#039;t matter the brand, hold onto their seasoning, are easy to clean AND are really pleasant to use.", "time": 1674399749, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18842753, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:05:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I soak beans in sugar water overnight will they be sweet enough to eat as a dessert once cooked?", "time": 1674399918, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18843643, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:50:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18842504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18842504</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people say many spices are only fat soluble and oil works for that.</span><br>Meat has fat in it", "time": 1674417021, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18844086, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:45:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy steak, same cut from the same place</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marinate it the same way, cook it the same way</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;95% of the time great and delicious</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5% of the time the steak is way too tough and tastes like a worse cut of steak</span><br>What causes this?

Thanks for the heads-up on the 21. Yeah I\u2019ve heard loads of people say it\u2019s not far off from the 15, but I\u2019ve also heard people say it ages well once the bottle has been opened and also after being poured. So just kinda curious there, as I thought that this might appeal to me since I\u2019m a slow drinker (I usually spend the first 15-30 minutes sniffing, kek). I also heard that the 21 43.2% is a lot better than the 40%, and I might be able to acquire one.<br><a href=\"#p18826957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18826957</a><br>I\u2019m very happy with my Delord! You get a lot for your money, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s sweeter than what I\u2019m typically used to, but it\u2019s very fragrant and clinical. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any cheese or mushroom, but I\u2019ll take note of that and see what I can spot when I have my next glass later on. With my example there\u2019s a lot of green grape skin going on though. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t call it slow to open up, I can pretty much drink it immediately after pouring my glass but I like to take my time as the nose really is something. I typically buy Armagnac that\u2019s been bottled about 30 years after the date it has been distilled (kinda my sweet spot, though I do have both younger and older), and I also only buy single vintage (i.e. bottles with the year stamped on them instead of the age of the product). My current Delord is 39 years however (distilled 1982, bottled 2021) and I\u2019d happily buy it again. The only thing that annoys me about Delord is the wax they use to seal the cap is a LOT harder than literally any other Armagnac I\u2019ve ever had to open, that said it\u2019s a small price to pay for what\u2019s a very affordable product in my opinion, especially given the age.", "time": 1674106463, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829142, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18827079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18827079</a><br>Kek just because Armagnac isn\u2019t to your liking doesn\u2019t make it poor quality.

It\u2019s simply a much more diverse (due to its wider grape variety) and dynamic spirit while simultaneously being extremely smooth. I like to say that Armagnac is kinda between Cognac and Whisky. Just because it\u2019s distilled once doesn\u2019t make it cheap; that\u2019s a feature by design. This kind of open generalisation though shows that you\u2019re full of shit; there\u2019s a LOT more shit-tier mass-marketed Cognac in wasteful and fancy bottles compared to Armagnac; that doesn\u2019t make all Cognac shit though, but I\u2019ve definitely had a lot more Cognac which absolutely wasn\u2019t worth the money simply because the money clearly went into the bottle, packaging, and marketing.

Laubade does that, there\u2019s a cloth string a few mm wide under the wax which you can just pull to get the fucker off. The problem with Delord isn\u2019t the lack of string though, it\u2019s that the wax is like fucking porcelain i.e. really hard. My older bottles of Laubade had no string but even despite that the wax was super easy to peel off. I typically don\u2019t ever leave a bottle open for more than three months so I don\u2019t have an issue with ageing becoming a problem. I typically drink one shot a day with my significant other (we do have one or two breaks a week though), sometimes we share one shot, sometimes we have a shot each; so with my rule of four open bottles at once that pretty much guarantees each bottle will finished within three months. I devised this rule mostly because for whisky it can be very unpredictable how well a bottle ages, and in my experience it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to go downhill fast once the bottle is about 50% empty with all that air mucking about inside. Funnily enough I find Armagnac holds much better than whisky; I once had a bottle open for over a year and I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

The sheer irony is that this basically means our alcohol tax is a poor people\u2019s tax more than anything because for cheaper shit you pay a higher percentage in tax (since the product is cheaper but the tax is fixed): thus the more expensive your liquor the more meaningless the tax becomes (you pay the same $ per litre regardless of whether you\u2019re buying a 20$ piss wine or a 1000$ or fuck it 10000$ bottle of scotch). Beer is thus pretty damn costly here (we\u2019re one of the most expensive countries to buy beer in), but once you go into the 3-figure range like I dunno a Dewar\u2019s 32, it\u2019s often cheaper here than in Europe.", "time": 1674207408, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18834545, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)10:11:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18833545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18833545</a><br>Does anyone think Jack is better than Maker&#039;s?", "time": 1674227467, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18834601, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)10:26:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I had 4 roses last night and I found it pretty good.

That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character. That said younger liubao or those that are aged somewhere drier like Kunming can be good too, they have a tendency to have more bitter and chocolate notes and maybe a sort of closer to ripe puer flavor profile. Anyway liubao is great, i think its generally better than ripe puer, at least in my experience.<br>Aged matters less with ripe puer, a couple years anywhere for the pile taste to air off some, preferably its aired loose leaf for a year or two before pressing. But after that aged makes a subtle difference unless we are talking hong kong traditional storage or some other very humid ageing environment. Older ripe (early 2000s and older) tended to be less heavily fermented and required a longer period of aging to reach a good taste profile and get out the pile notes. Modern ripes are rarely made that way and when they are they are typically fermented more carefully so they don&#039;t require the same aging period to be drinkable.", "time": 1674416876, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843658, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843631</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character.</span><br>I like this thread so I am resisting the urge to post a soyjak, you get away with it this time.", "time": 1674417390, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843661, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843459</a><br>I hate it", "time": 1674417409, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843683, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "drinking two GABA oolongs today, might as well make a brief comparison<br><br>unroasted Si Ji Chun GABA oolong:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scent: spices (cinnamon?) and maybe some honey</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taste: pears, spices, creamy, autumn leaves, some sweetness but also sourness / acidity. mild with no bitterness</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brewing: really easy to brew grandpa style. never gets bitter at all, it gets sour instead.

Every cluster of dorm buildings had a shared dining hall and little convenience store full of snacks (some also had little concession stand things in the stores). The way the meal plans worked is that you&#039;d get X amount of dining hall entries per week and Y amount of credits you could either spend at the store or for another dining hall entry. The credits were roughly equivalent to 1 credit = $1 at the store and I believe dining hall entry was 10-15 credits (total rip off). If I recall correctly the plans were something like:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Infinite dining hall entry, 0 credits</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;12 dining hall entries, 15 credits</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10 dining hall entries, 45 credits</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No dining hall entries, 130 credits</span><br><br>The trick was that credits would roll over into the next week, but dining hall entries didn&#039;t. So I found that the 10/45 plan was the best because it gave you the most flexibility. There were plenty of days where I&#039;d only go into the dining hall once because I&#039;d buy lunch at the student union building between classes, so 10 entries per week was plenty for me. Meanwhile, $45 at the store per week was a fuckton and it was almost difficult to spend it all. I was fucking loaded on snacks and I ended up storing most of the excess value in 12 packs of soda.

So I started doing only h. h is not as addictive as most people consider it, it also is a very subtle feeling compared to most other hard drugs.

Thus corn on the cob and cold cereal is our &quot;native&quot;/&quot;local&quot; food. This is also reflected in quite a bit lower costs for eared corn at grocery stores in Midwest cities, since the net transportation cost is much lower, which thus would increase consumption at the table. Indeed, when my family first moved to the U.S. and lived in subsidized housing in the Midwest, corn on the cob cookouts were the staple summer BBQ meat substitute for the building complex.

They had a location on South Street, another on Ridge Ave in Roxborough/Manayunk and a third somewhere in Southwest Philadelphia (forgot where). The Ridge Ave location is sorta still open, but on Henry Ave and under different ownership, now called d&#039;Alessandro&#039;s. The Ridge Ave location is actually where cheesesteak was first made in the late 1950s, several years before Whiz was even invented never mind sold in stores.
