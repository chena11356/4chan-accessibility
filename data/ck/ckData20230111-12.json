Another intern taught her how to spread the jam evenly, monitor the drying process, then use tweezers to assemble the head, thorax, abdomen and wings. Ms. Hegde repeated the process until she had 120 perfect specimens; each diner was served a single beetle in a wooden box.<br><br>She said the experience taught her to be quick, quiet and organized, but little about cooking. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I would use my knife only a couple of times a day,\u201d she said, \u201cor that I would be told I didn\u2019t need my tasting spoon because there was nothing to taste.\u201d<br><br>Ms. Hegde said she was required to work in silence by the junior chefs she assisted (Mr. Redzepi was rarely in the kitchen where she worked), and was specifically forbidden to laugh.<br><br>\u201cI thought an internship was about me learning, as well about contributing to Noma\u2019s success,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that kind of toxic work environment is necessary.\u201d", "filename": "8156565599675", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 874, "h": 1032, "tn_w": 211, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673266669713294, "time": 1673266669, "md5": "kOt3JLCOTqQiFGHwj+LGAg==", "fsize": 197847, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "500-dollars-please", "replies": 66, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 51}, {"no": 18789364, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)07:25:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "meanwhile japanese culinary students spend 10 years cooking rice then 10 years slicing fish and they don&#039;t complain", "time": 1673267110, "resto": 18789354}, {"no": 18789379, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)07:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You&#039;re expecting me to believe that if you&#039;re traveling to an entirely different continent on an internship that you&#039;ve been chosen for apparently on your own dime, you wouldn&#039;t even be the slightest bit curious as to ask the people employing you what you&#039;ll be doing as to prepare for the work?<br>Plus playing Devil&#039;s Advocate here it&#039;s possible that if this is the high class fancy schmancy smell your farts restaurant I&#039;m thinking this is then the kitchen would most likely be in view of the paying customers and as such you wouldn&#039;t want to disturb them.

I&#039;d find a really famous nice restaurant and go grind there doing grunt work for months before I&#039;d go to the next one. There was one restaurant where my entire job was seasoning mushrooms. For 6 months straight I&#039;d spend 8 hours a day seasoning mushrooms with salt, pepper, oil, and sumac. On my bad days the chefs would tear me apart about my seasoning being atrocious, on my good days nobody would say anything. I walked away from that kitchen with insane seasoning chops. I&#039;d focus on the minutia of seasoning every day, how could I season faster, which way would I twist my fingers to get the ideal spread of seasoning, what does a mushroom feel like before I oil it? Is it dry or is there a lot of moisture? Then doing this process rapid fire 200 times a night for six months slowly adjusting my technique, monitoring my product, pushing myself to be faster and more consistent. Now I can season anything perfectly at top speed because I know how to read moisture content by look and feel and how far to hold my hands, twist my fingers, and with different granular sizes for seasoning. Every single culinary skill I posess is because of repetition and grinding at minutia, because I didn&#039;t bitch out when I realized becoming a chef isn&#039;t some feel good Netflix movie where some compassionate beautiful famous chef recognizes how smart and creative and special your dishes are so they take you under their wing and hold your hand through opening a restaurant.", "time": 1673380949, "resto": 18789354}, {"no": 18794814, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)15:22:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18794743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18794743</a><br>you sound like a shit chef", "time": 1673382179, "resto": 18789354}, {"no": 18794816, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)15:23:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18794743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18794743</a><br><br>I think people obsess too much over minutiae like this, especially in fancy restaurants.

The U.S. economy is expected to continue to decline through 2020, with an anticipated growth rate of 1%. This will have a significant impact on the U.S. national debt, which will continue to increase throughout this period (Federal Reserve). In order to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment, governments around the world have implemented various fiscal stimulus packages aimed at increasing demand for goods and services in their respective economies (IMF).<br><br>One way that governments can support demand for goods and services is by increasing disposable income levels among consumers and businesses by reducing prices or wages (IMF). Governments may also implement policies that aim to increase employment such as tax cuts or public works programs (IMF). However, these measures are likely to be ineffective if they do not address underlying structural problems within an economy such as high levels of government debt or low productivity growth rates (IMF). Governments therefore need alternative policy options that can be implemented quickly without having long-term effects on their economies\u2019 ability to sustain high levels of debt orIn the year 2030, coffee prices will be very affordable.

This is due to the fact that there will be an abundance of coffee in the market because it was predicted that by 2030, there would be a global population growth of 2 billion people (\u201c2030 Economy\u201d). With this increase in population comes an increase in demand for coffee and therefore an increase in its price.

From what I&#039;ve read the best intro reposado buy on all counts (accessibility, cost, etc) is probably Espolon, but with tequila there&#039;s a lot of great brands and a lot of personal taste involved. With any new liquor, look for tastings in your area and go -- even if they cost some $50 at the door, IT&#039;S ALWAYS WORTH IT (not for wine or beer where there&#039;s a ton of free tastings however). <br><br>Adding to Bon Appetit&#039;s list, there are agave spirits in general including mezcals (of which tequila is of course a subtype), but don&#039;t dive into all this right away unless you live in Mexico or near the border and can access good bottles on the cheap. There are also non-100% agave spirits (mixtos), which should always be avoided in the U.S., but can again be fair game to explore in Mexico.<br><br>Unaged is cheaper, extra aged is more expensive, just like with any other liquor. Unaged can be just as good to sip as extra aged, just like any other liquor. Do some background research on general reviews from people in the know (liquor.com has nice intro best-of lists), but don&#039;t read more than you drink, just like any other liquor.", "time": 1673152092, "resto": 18778973}, {"no": 18784159, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)23:32:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18784144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18784144</a><br>This advice, btw, is courtesy of a guy who is currently reading way more than he drinks.

We met in high school, and I got her pregnant.<br>She is and always has been a lazy person and a shit cook. I wouldn&#039;t even mind eating shit food if she at least made it on time. But she rarely did.<br><br>We&#039;d get into screaming arguments constantly about how lazy and worthless she was. I felt like an asshole for it, but goddamn she was a real piece of work. The only reason I dealt with all this was for the kids, and also because the sex is great.<br><br>But one night, I got fed up. Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it. I told her &quot;one of these days, if you don&#039;t straighten up, I&#039;m going to lay hands on you.&quot;<br><br>All my meals have been on time, and she just recently tried to make a meatloaf.

Basically, the entire organism is a big fluffy network called the mycelium, which in the wild, lives normally underground or inside trees. And it eats food like animals.

Then strain, then dump them out onto a few baking sheets and let them dry off until they&#039;re dry on the outside. You want the grains to be fully wet on the inside (full of water) but not actually be wet on the outside, so they&#039;re just at maximum internal water capacity. That&#039;s the perfect hydration level. Then put the grains inside some jars and pressure cook them at 15psi for 90 minutes to kill all the mold and bacteria inside the jars.

When you&#039;re making your fruiting blocks, the best source for sawdust is hardwood pellets used for pellet grills and smokers. You can buy hickory pellets at Lowes for 37 cents a pound. Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold. So with these more effective substrates, you need to pressure cook them just like you did the grain jars.", "filename": "IMG_20221231_160402_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672812958863218, "time": 1672812958, "md5": "PWaoSdkvXVk110erHFxGKg==", "fsize": 406764, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769271, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18769113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18769113</a><br>There&#039;s outdoor cultivation methods which mimic the natural environment much more closely. If you grow mushrooms outside it&#039;s pretty similar to composting and you don&#039;t need to sterilize anything. However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years. But that&#039;s only worth it because you might as well do it, I wouldn&#039;t rely on that as a reliable farming method.<br><br>Another cool thing you can do is to inoculate an entire log with spores or liquid culture from a log colonizing species.

On Paul Stamets website he sells mushroom plugs that you can stick right into a log for this purpose.

That it&#039;s a big secret being kept under wraps by mushroom growers still sounds suspicious though. The toxicity of so many other substances is well known and it goes into food advisories.

The research has been out for decades and the gas industry should have already had a partnership with GE and federal lobbyists to mandate updating gas oven ranges and hoods -- even mandating something as simple as a unified switch such that the hood activates automatically whenever the stove is turned on, and ensuring legislation to mandate that, would be a huge financial windfall.

Its ok but there is no way of telling them while sitting i am ready to be helped... no cord on table to flip,light etc.<br>4. Have to sit to get a salad was unexpected. I came in from the pool to get a salad and at the salad area the staff asked me to sit and order... he was doing nothing .. no orders, just a little clean up... I asked him a few times to make it and after getting a little loud (me that is) he finally made it. It took him 45 seconds and i was able to pick out what i wanted by seeing and pointing, asking for little of this but more of that. Think he got back at me by putting a lot of dressing when i clearly said very very little.<br>Should not be a struggle to order at the salad at the counter when he is not busy/or during slow times. Saved me probably 20+- minutes from sitting, waiting on a waiter who has no way of knowing if you need help since there is nothing to flip on the tables to say you want service .. felt invisible at times previously unless i asked loudly can you pls take my order.<br>Never seen the Noddle area and some other food areas open in the Galley.
