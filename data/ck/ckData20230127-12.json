Dont worry about it fucking up your health just take a multivitamin (look for special vegetarian ones that dont use animals). Important things to ensure youre getting that might be difficult without meat is iron, and B vitamins (and maybe zinc I wanna say). B vitamins are a big deal, but you can actually get it from algae! If you like seaweed I highly recommend incorporating it into your diet plus its tasty af and virtually zero calories. Iron just eat lots of nuts/seeds, beans, and dark greens. If you like greens try using olive oil when making a salad or dish with them since it helps with nutrient absorbtion. Also check out nutritional yeast for b vitamins its also a nice thing to add for some umami to food or for a cheese alternative if you ever wanna vegan mode. Also getting enough protein is important so again nuts and beans and also stuff like tofu and seitan and eggs if you eat them (imo can be ethically consumed if locally sourced from someone you know is treating chickens properly). Vegan meat and cheese replacements have come a long way in recent years but definitely try to limit your use of them a bit, theyre kinda like junk food most of the time and easy to fall back on over a proper balanced diet.

it from falling for like 10 agonizing seconds, and then kind of caught the box by slapping it against the wall, and he was quite distraught at having ruined the customers pizza but the customer isn&#039;t a wound up neurotic wreck, so he just said, well lets look at the damage. <br><br> checked it out, and it wasn&#039;t that bad. he laughed and said, i&#039;ll take it, and paid the price of the pizza to the man. so the pizza i see, the story that brought it to my attention, and the image that caught my attention, it&#039;s the product of an accident and a reaction of people far away from me. if the pizza hadn&#039;t been fucked up a bit and slammed against a wall, it wouldn&#039;t have had a story to tell about it that i&#039;d hear one day<br><br>they wouldn&#039;t have taken a

However, they are very annoying to use and clean. Lodge seasoning is extremely tough and nonstick, but because of the bumpy texture, you do get food stains that are difficult to clean off of the seasoning. Your spatula will make a lot of noise just brushing it across the surface and if any food burns/sticks, even just a small spot, then you just know it&#039;s going to be there the whole time you&#039;re cooking and that spot won&#039;t be nonstick anymore. I do not like using them. <br>-Finex/Stargazer/Butterpat/Field do not hold their seasoning very well. It just flakes off under normal use and there&#039;s no nice way to say it. If you think it&#039;s because some amateur is doing something wrong, using too much heat, not enough oil, then take a look at their websites and see the photos of the &quot;owner of the company&#039;s collection.&quot; All their pans have splotchy seasoning. That&#039;s not to say they don&#039;t work for what they are, but it&#039;s distracting and annoying when your pan is constantly destroying itself. I do not like using these, and I&#039;ve tried most of them.<br>-OLD skillets you buy from a flea market or ebay are the best. I don&#039;t know why this is, and you should strip the old seasoning (just soak in lye for a few days and it&#039;s easy) and re-season them yourself, but all of my old skillets, doesn&#039;t matter the brand, hold onto their seasoning, are easy to clean AND are really pleasant to use.", "time": 1674399749, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18842753, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:05:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I soak beans in sugar water overnight will they be sweet enough to eat as a dessert once cooked?", "time": 1674399918, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18843643, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:50:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18842504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18842504</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people say many spices are only fat soluble and oil works for that.</span><br>Meat has fat in it", "time": 1674417021, "resto": 18841101}, {"no": 18844086, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:45:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy steak, same cut from the same place</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marinate it the same way, cook it the same way</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;95% of the time great and delicious</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5% of the time the steak is way too tough and tastes like a worse cut of steak</span><br>What causes this?

He&#039;s claiming that a buzzfeed video that was only a meme here is responsible for making an entire generation like Panda Express. It&#039;s an unmedicated claim because it shows that he&#039;s never been off this website or talked to real people in close to a decade. I have never seen that video mentioned outside these threads, and never met anyone IRL or in normie social media who likes Panda Express. It&#039;s literally a restraunt for black, old people, and various fat poors. The entire post is completely out of touch with reality. <br><br>2. Even in the context of being a 4chan poster, mentioning that video before it&#039;s even been brought up in an attempt to rout it is unmedicated behavior because it shows that this guy has been involved in multiple panda express threads, and has been BTFO in them, and now he&#039;s replying to people who aren&#039;t even here by saying things that are irrelevant and out of context in this thread. He thinks 4chan is one person and we&#039;re all the guy he was talking to last time. He was probably also directly replied to with mention of that video in the past, and now it takes up a comically oversized real estate in his brain.<br><br>3. Accuses a buzzfeed video of being used by &quot;shills&quot; to promote Panda Express. It&#039;s a common belief by schizophrenics that paid marketers browse this website and argue with posters to promote products. Basically, anyone who disagrees with you is a paid shill.

That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character. That said younger liubao or those that are aged somewhere drier like Kunming can be good too, they have a tendency to have more bitter and chocolate notes and maybe a sort of closer to ripe puer flavor profile. Anyway liubao is great, i think its generally better than ripe puer, at least in my experience.<br>Aged matters less with ripe puer, a couple years anywhere for the pile taste to air off some, preferably its aired loose leaf for a year or two before pressing. But after that aged makes a subtle difference unless we are talking hong kong traditional storage or some other very humid ageing environment. Older ripe (early 2000s and older) tended to be less heavily fermented and required a longer period of aging to reach a good taste profile and get out the pile notes. Modern ripes are rarely made that way and when they are they are typically fermented more carefully so they don&#039;t require the same aging period to be drinkable.", "time": 1674416876, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843658, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843631</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That high humidity aging really gives the liubao its classic taste profile of wood and soil notes and that sort of root celler vibe and smooth drinking character.</span><br>I like this thread so I am resisting the urge to post a soyjak, you get away with it this time.", "time": 1674417390, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843661, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18843459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18843459</a><br>I hate it", "time": 1674417409, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18843683, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "drinking two GABA oolongs today, might as well make a brief comparison<br><br>unroasted Si Ji Chun GABA oolong:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scent: spices (cinnamon?) and maybe some honey</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taste: pears, spices, creamy, autumn leaves, some sweetness but also sourness / acidity. mild with no bitterness</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brewing: really easy to brew grandpa style. never gets bitter at all, it gets sour instead.

It&#039;s not going to knock your socks off but it&#039;s nice to have some tea like this on hand.<br>https://kingteamall.com/collections<wbr>/home-page/products/2007-xinghai-me<wbr>i-li-xing-hai-charming-xinghai-cake<wbr>-357g-puerh-ripe-tea-shou-cha<br>https://kingteamall.com/collections<wbr>/home-page/products/2007-nanqiao-yi<wbr>-wu-zheng-shan-chun-jian-yiwu-mount<wbr>ain-spring-bud-cake-357g-puerh-raw-<wbr>tea-sheng-cha?variant=4340602395056<wbr>6<br>https://kingteamall.com/collections<wbr>/home-page/products/2009-jinglong-g<wbr>ua-feng-zhai-qiao-mu-guafengzhai-vi<wbr>allge-arbor-cake-400g-puerh-raw-tea<wbr>-sheng-cha?variant=43052118704358", "time": 1674768956, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18859614, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:41:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18858772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18858772</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he lesbisized lesbodicly.</span>", "time": 1674769263, "resto": 18829742}, {"no": 18859681, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:55:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18859590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18859590</a><br>thanks, I&#039;ll check these out.

Anyway, I would look at the soup as more of a way to remain satiated while consuming minimal calories. If you really want to do mega batches of soup like a souppilled chad, I guess I&#039;d first look at chicken tortilla soup, but go light on the tortilla and beans, and make sub the sour cream dallop for one of cottage cheese. <br><br>You&#039;ll basically want a mostly meat soup, with vegetables and spices for zero calorie (or near it) flavor. You can just get creative and throw shit in a pot with some stock too, say seared chicken, shrimp, peppers and whatever. Gumbo is also very low calorie if you omit the rice.

The religious rule of fasting exists to build character, primarily temperance and humility. Outside monastic communities it is not a strict law and more of an ideal, and for laymen it is usually considered enough to simply try your best. Not to get into the finer details, but there is also a strong tradition of vegetarian cooking which exists in order to properly celebrate religious feast days which occur during the fast. The food is meant to taste good, but it is very obviously lighter vegetarian cuisine.<br>Unlike the Catholics, fish is not licit during the fast (although it is seen as a &quot;less-bad&quot; food, in some places) and in fact in most places, the ideal fast excludes all dietary oils as well - which is by far the least-followed restriction among laymen for obvious reasons.<br>In this light, it is pretty clear where Beyond Meat and similar products belong. They are, at best, a &quot;less-bad&quot; food like fish, but fake meat products embody principles opposite to the ideal fasting food. The reason there is a &quot;debate&quot; is basically that disinterested laymen who might feel community pressure to fast will try to find loopholes in their daily life, and since the point of the fasting rule is humility, if you are another layman and not a priest it is considered counterproductive to insist and posture over the dietary rule that others are following, for the same reason that you aren&#039;t supposed to act prideful over people who don&#039;t fast.
