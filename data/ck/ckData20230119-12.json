They fell in love with it, and asked me to hoard my free bags of coffee and ship it to them, instead of flipping it on eBay as I usually did. I haven&#039;t worked at Starbucks in about a decade, but my dad will still go to the local stores and buy up their entire supply whenever it&#039;s available, and now it&#039;s all they drink and told me they can&#039;t really stand the shitty pre-ground supermarket stuff. If they run out of that coffee, they&#039;ll switch to tea. When I visited them yesterday, I offered to grind their coffee with my hand grinder, but my mom stopped me because she immediately knew it would make a huge difference to have fresh burr-ground coffee, and she sort of didn&#039;t want to know, because she knew the financial rabbit hole coffee snobbery can lead to.

Yeah I\u2019ve heard loads of people say it\u2019s not far off from the 15, but I\u2019ve also heard people say it ages well once the bottle has been opened and also after being poured. So just kinda curious there, as I thought that this might appeal to me since I\u2019m a slow drinker (I usually spend the first 15-30 minutes sniffing, kek).

You get a lot for your money, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s sweeter than what I\u2019m typically used to, but it\u2019s very fragrant and clinical. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any cheese or mushroom, but I\u2019ll take note of that and see what I can spot when I have my next glass later on. With my example there\u2019s a lot of green grape skin going on though. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t call it slow to open up, I can pretty much drink it immediately after pouring my glass but I like to take my time as the nose really is something. I typically buy Armagnac that\u2019s been bottled about 30 years after the date it has been distilled (kinda my sweet spot, though I do have both younger and older), and I also only buy single vintage (i.e. bottles with the year stamped on them instead of the age of the product). My current Delord is 39 years however (distilled 1982, bottled 2021) and I\u2019d happily buy it again. The only thing that annoys me about Delord is the wax they use to seal the cap is a LOT harder than literally any other Armagnac I\u2019ve ever had to open, that said it\u2019s a small price to pay for what\u2019s a very affordable product in my opinion, especially given the age.", "time": 1674106463, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829142, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18827079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18827079</a><br>Kek just because Armagnac isn\u2019t to your liking doesn\u2019t make it poor quality. I\u2019ve had my fair share of Cognac over the years and I always go back to Armagnac. It\u2019s simply a much more diverse (due to its wider grape variety) and dynamic spirit while simultaneously being extremely smooth. I like to say that Armagnac is kinda between Cognac and Whisky. Just because it\u2019s distilled once doesn\u2019t make it cheap; that\u2019s a feature by design. This kind of open generalisation though shows that you\u2019re full of shit; there\u2019s a LOT more shit-tier mass-marketed Cognac in wasteful and fancy bottles compared to Armagnac; that doesn\u2019t make all Cognac shit though, but I\u2019ve definitely had a lot more Cognac which absolutely wasn\u2019t worth the money simply because the money clearly went into the bottle, packaging, and marketing.

Laubade does that, there\u2019s a cloth string a few mm wide under the wax which you can just pull to get the fucker off. The problem with Delord isn\u2019t the lack of string though, it\u2019s that the wax is like fucking porcelain i.e. really hard. My older bottles of Laubade had no string but even despite that the wax was super easy to peel off. I typically don\u2019t ever leave a bottle open for more than three months so I don\u2019t have an issue with ageing becoming a problem. I typically drink one shot a day with my significant other (we do have one or two breaks a week though), sometimes we share one shot, sometimes we have a shot each; so with my rule of four open bottles at once that pretty much guarantees each bottle will finished within three months. I devised this rule mostly because for whisky it can be very unpredictable how well a bottle ages, and in my experience it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to go downhill fast once the bottle is about 50% empty with all that air mucking about inside. Funnily enough I find Armagnac holds much better than whisky; I once had a bottle open for over a year and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. But like my current Glenfiddich 15 VAT 03 that\u2019s open, I can tell I\u2019m enjoying it a wee bit less now that the bottle is down to its remainder 35%.

No one is walking around with a compendium of cocktail recipes in their head. This isn&#039;t the 1950&#039;s.<br><br>Just figure out a simple cocktail that you like and stick with it everywhere you go. Don&#039;t ask for a mojito, don&#039;t ask for something gay and stupid like a singapore sling that has six ingredients. If the bartender has to touch three bottles for a cocktail, they will hate you. Don&#039;t ask for anything with red bull. Don&#039;t ask for long island iced tea unless you&#039;re in a club setting (if you don&#039;t know the difference between a club, a pub, a bar, a cocktail lounge, etc, then don&#039;t ask for a long island iced tea).<br><br>If it&#039;s a reasonably okay bar, just ask for a rum daiquiri if you want something refreshing and light. It&#039;s delicious. Rum, lime, sugar syrup, shaken hard and served ice cold. If you want something boozier and more.. &quot;manly&quot;, ask for a Manhattan or an old fashioned. If you want something manageable that you can sip on for a while, get a highball, which is spirit + carbonated liquid: vodka soda, gin and tonic, tequila soda, whiskey soda. You can just ask for a Jameson highball and the bartender will know what you mean.<br><br>You can always ask for a whiskey on the rocks or neat and the bartender will totally respect you for it, especially if it&#039;s a nice whiskey. You&#039;ll need to specify by brand. Doesn&#039;t ask for &quot;whiskey on the rocks&quot;, that&#039;s what fucking alcoholics and retards ask for. <br><br>Don&#039;t ask for doubles. Don&#039;t ask a bartender to &quot;make it strong&quot;. Just order a drink like a real, normal human being who isn&#039;t a total retard and is visiting earth for the first time ever.<br><br>My usual drink order is a Victoria (mexican beer) and a fernet (italian amaro, very bitter, very unique).

Some basic suggestions:<br>Mushrooms - fry them in butter and garlic, or get some portobellos (the big ones) and stuff them with things you like and bake. Toss in dried shiitake to your ramen of choice + bok choy for easy upgrade.<br>Root vegetables for roasting/baking - add any mix of your favorite seasonings i.e cumin, chili flakes, s/p, rosemary/thyme and roast till cooked/crispy. <br>Lentil/beans can easily replace beef in certain recipes/cuisines. Canned for ease of use. Learn how to make chili. <br>Greens can be steamed and drizzled with olive oil, lemon juice and s/p. Or soy sauce, sesame oil/seeds if asian inspired. Kewpie sesame mayo is a godsend. Just throw in any leafy greens to whatever you&#039;re cooking for lazy vitamins.", "time": 1674118691, "resto": 18829113}, {"no": 18829518, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)04:13:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s a good cuisine/recipe book that focuses on vegetables themselves (i.e as a main, or learning how to cook each vegetable correctyl)?

Salisbury suspected diet was the greatest culprit, and came up with his own solution.<br><br>He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.<br><br>The Salisbury steak, his means of achieving this goal, is ground beef flavored with onion and seasoning and then deep-fried or boiled and covered with gravy or brown sauce. It was introduced in 1888. Salisbury saw beef as an excellent defense against many different physical problems. He suggested that Salisbury steak should be eaten three times a day, with much hot water to cleanse the digestive system. He was an early American proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss, and he promoted his diet for that purpose.

The economics are just very strange. For example, many young people looking to further their academic careers but failed to get into a paid PhD program would be willing, if able, to do research unpaid, or even pay for another year of education in the interim before applying again. And yet those hyper-competitive PhD programs still pay salaries (in some form) to their students. However, less-competitive programs do not seem to try to compete with other programs for better students by offering higher salaries, as would be expected in a competitive marketplace, even if they receive a windfall of funding. Part of it&#039;s a very intense social psychology for sure -- money is not really supposed to be a motivator -- but at the same time you obviously don&#039;t want to shut out, or force extra work upon, those who can&#039;t simply live on a parental stipend.<br><br>This world of top-tier restaurant internships, and many other classy internships, in theory seems like it should work with at least a somewhat similar mindset -- at least at a certain point the interns should be intrinsically qualified and valuable enough to be paid and competed over, else why have interns in the first place?<br><br>It kind of reminds me of that famous 19th-century economist&#039;s prediction that the most menial worker&#039;s wages would always fall to the bare minimum needed to sustain life.

However, there are many more mediocre companies than these, and they will often defer interns to low-level staff, who may only devote time to actually educating a handful, while, as is *very stereotypical* relegating the *vast majority* to &quot;coffee duty&quot;. They can do this because, again, there are usually many more applicants every year than there are positions. And as a company is not paying interns, which is by nature an investment, there is no incentive for retention, promotion, development, etc.<br><br>And this is only looking at part of the problem.

According to auditors (regarding, say, that massive yacht in my driveway that any insurance or bill collector would note down regarding consistency in my creditworthiness, or especially the IRS or insurers in any audit), that money appeared in my possession by magic -- there&#039;s no work history, no inheritance, no production, no gambling receipts -- nothing that would cause that much money to be in my possession -- therefore the only reasonable conclusion is I got it by illegal activity. Thus I &quot;launder&quot; the money to get it &quot;clean&quot;, to make it look like I got it by legal means. One way to do that is that I give the money to a patsy, who then buys a shitty piece of amateur art put up at a fancy auction for an utterly insane amount of money (a classic red flag for feds specifically trained to look for laundering in, among many other things, art sales). The patsy is international and/or has a bunch of legit accounts that make such a purchase relatively easy to hide. The artist in question is in on the scam and the money goes into his accounts to then be spent/invested in a series of other dubious purchases, shell companies and accounts, etc., before finally being transferred, with an entirely legitimate and auditable paper trail, to the original drug kingpin.<br><br>The relevance to threads like these is that if this were in fact an absolutely shitty restaurant with a shitty unqualified chef serving shit food and doing utterly shit business -- like taking enormous losses but somehow still running -- then that&#039;s a big red flag that it has some criminal affiliation. For money laundering, you&#039;d check things like tip receipts or hidden menu prices (like specials or special-order cocktails or bottling fees or some weird shit that wouldn&#039;t be obvious).", "time": 1674105774, "resto": 18813702}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18828740, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)22:45:47", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Five Guys", "com": "The burger Jew only put 2 ketchup packets with my large fry again.

Americans on average only eat incredibly low quality vegetables and protein since they were kids; they haven&#039;t built an expectation for what good ingredients taste like. The chlorinated chicken, the refrigerated eggs, the GMO vegetables, they all compromise flavor for something else.<br><br>It&#039;s the reason why Americans interested in gastronomy are genuinely surprised when they do travel abroad and eat simple food and it tastes great. In these other cultures, when we make a simple dish we expect it to be tasty like our good memories of it, and we get pissed of when the courgette, carrot, tomato, sea bream, shrimp, turkey leg, etc is of poor quality. For americans, that&#039;s the norm. That&#039;s why Americans regularly cite eating some extremely simple yet tasty dish X at country Y as a life changing experience. American society sacrificed love and respect for food as a cultural phenomenon in lieu of abundance and excess availability. Obviously a few americans are against that and try to go down the other path, but I imagine it&#039;s almost impossible to become accustomed to something that just isn&#039;t as easily available (quality ingredients).<br><br>continued below", "time": 1673997357, "resto": 18810740}, {"no": 18823871, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:18:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18823856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18823856</a><br>continued<br><br>For example, in my country of Portugal I can buy fresh Iberico pig meat for 13\u20ac/kg.
