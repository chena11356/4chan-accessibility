Best I&#039;ve been to was probably Tooth and Nail Brewing in Ottawa. The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

In a proposed class action filed on Wednesday, Christopher Lazazzaro said he would not have bought or would have paid less for Hershey&#039;s Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate, Lily&#039;s Extra Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa and Lily&#039;s Extreme Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa had Hershey disclosed their metals content.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hershey did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in the federal court in Central Islip, New York. Lazazzaro, a resident of Nassau County, New York, sued two weeks after Consumer Reports unveiled the results of scientific testing of 28 dark chocolate bars for lead and cadmium. Hershey&#039;s Special Dark bar and Lily&#039;s 70% bar were high in lead, and Lily&#039;s 85% bar was high in lead and cadmium, the magazine said. Lazazzaro said reasonable consumers would be turned off by such levels because they pose a &quot;serious health risk,&quot; and that consumers rely on Hershey to be truthful about ingredients in its products.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million of damages, including at least $500 per transaction under New York law.

When the chocolate is consumed in moderate amounts, the lead and cadmium levels are nothing to worry about, he says. &quot;If you make sure that the rest of your diet is good and sufficient in calcium and iron, you protect yourself even more by preventing absorption of some lead and cadmium in your diet.&quot;</span><br><br>I&#039;ve always thought the &quot;Moderation&quot; assurance was conferring false security as if we aren&#039;t an over-indulgent nation of consoomers. Asbestos exposure is probably okay too &quot;in moderation&quot;. There&#039;s no real safe level of heavy metal contamination for humans and the level of danger is dose-dependent. Milk chocolate tends to only have 30-40% Max Cocoa Solids (as they are mostly sugar with a sprinkling of milk solids) so the level of possible heavy metals in them be less than any semi-sweet or dark varieties.

This is meat cells that are grown in a controlled bioreactor lab setting. So, instead of raising a whole cow, they can produce just the meat cells. Back in 2010 a food technologist guest spoke in a college class of mine, and he said we will likely see in vitro meat become common in the next 10 years.

Hard to keep that wobble consistent from grinder to grinder when a random chinese factory is pumping out thousands of units for Breville or Oxo.

This type of cider is often referred to as &quot;hard cider&quot; to distinguish it from non-alcoholic cider. In other parts of the world, the term &quot;cider&quot; is more commonly used to refer to alcoholic cider, while non-alcoholic apple juice is referred to as simply &quot;apple juice.&quot;", "time": 1672455379, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755056, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:56:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18754585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he drinks apple flavored sugar water</span>", "filename": "1624578954736", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 536, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1672455392739994, "time": 1672455392, "md5": "npbnsvaeI4R3NtDQoY8m8A==", "fsize": 82472, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755061, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:57:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18754585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; calling apple juice &quot;cider&quot;</span>", "filename": "cidre-normand", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672455476824938, "time": 1672455476, "md5": "FWmnlGD1jW8CNiLZkU7KPg==", "fsize": 113583, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755077, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:02:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18755061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18755061</a><br>Uh actually, all kind of fruit juices contain alcohol since fermentation begins in the fruit", "time": 1672455755, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755094, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:06:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18755061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18755061</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t know the rhyme</span>", "filename": "maxresdefault[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672456004634239, "time": 1672456004, "md5": "6GNmKQYGVjXPQ2enP7X0yw==", "fsize": 66213, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755105, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:10:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "yeah here in borgerland we call cloudy apple juice cider, and we call the alcoholic cider &quot;hard cider&quot; and usually it has some stupid advertising with a guy with a gruff manly voice and a washed picture of an apple tree on the bottle so that you know it&#039;s the alcoholic stuff", "time": 1672456202, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755141, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:20:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18755094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18755094</a>", "filename": "fland-app", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672456832978266, "time": 1672456832, "md5": "O/d8yrxgPJvbQAkH62+dMw==", "fsize": 13757, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755146, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:22:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18754585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He drinks the piss instead of apple juice</span><br>Do Americunts really?", "time": 1672456938, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18755382, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:52:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18755053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18755053</a><br>Put on a trip so i can filter your inane chatgpt posts.", "time": 1672462374, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18756051, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:33:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18754728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754728</a><br>Prohibition had many strange and lasting cultural effects", "time": 1672482800, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18756308, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)08:43:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18755141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18755141</a><br>and of course in canada the whole thing is flip flopped", "time": 1672494197, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18758120, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)19:53:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18754585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754585</a><br>its pretty much the same", "time": 1672534416, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18758469, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)21:35:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18754585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754585</a><br>Apples from their Orchard only available when in season", "filename": "Good apple cider", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1185, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1672540506526532, "time": 1672540506, "md5": "mJLNWDm9ZTUKGvkwhlZIQw==", "fsize": 188457, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18758543, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)21:59:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18758469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18758469</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keep refrigerated at 38 F</span><br>Gets dropped off the truck at supermarket<br>Sits in crates at room temperature for hours in backroom before being stocked into refrigerated cases See also Coors beer<br><br>t. supermarket stocker for 2 years as a teen", "time": 1672541955, "resto": 18754585}, {"no": 18758578, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)22:10:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I got inspired by Fantastic Mr. Fox to make apple cider.

Of course it&#039;s not the same as a proper Japanese restaurant, and the selection is limited. (Lots of California rolls, salmon, tuna, imitation crab. Not so much eel.)

So if you want to eat raw salmon, it&#039;s best to freeze it to a temperature and for a time that will kill any parasites. Most places selling &quot;sashimi grade&quot; salmon use that term to indicate it&#039;s been frozen properly to eliminate any parasites. Again, do your research here, because freezing to eliminate parasites works the same as pasteurization: you need to hit a target temperature for a set amount of time. Your home freezer may not get cold enough to practically do this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;salmonella</span><br>Salmonella lives in the guts of fish. So when the fish is gutted, if the knife that opens the belly pierces the guts AND pierces the meat, then the meat is contaminated. The only protection you have is to trust your source of fish not to contaminate their product. If you don&#039;t trust them, your options are either to cook the fish (this kills the salmonella) or catch your own damn fish and process it yourself. Plenty of reputable places online will ship sashimi-grade, salmonella-free fish to your door.

I have been doing this since I was like 8 years old, no idea where I got the idea but my parents say it was all me, no one else in my family does it and they remember when I first concocted the mixture.

And while I do still appreciate the Glenfiddich 18 40% as it\u2019s really a decent bottle it\u2019s also kinda annoying that I often feel that the flavours could be exposed a little more, because there\u2019s really a lot going on. I agree with you though that one sign of a good liquor is having a silly high ABV while not actually tasting any of the alcohol, which Glenfiddich knows how to master. So it\u2019s somewhat aggravating that they\u2019re purposefully nerfing themselves. I don\u2019t think anyone really knows why but the rumour is that they just want to get more bottles out. Glenfiddich has also been doing this thing where they\u2019ll do restricted releases of higher ABV bottles like the one I just acquired (it\u2019s pretty much limited to duty free merchants at airports and only in select countries). And from what I heard the original 18 43% can still be acquired but only at their distillery. It\u2019s bloody annoying because they know their shit. The 15 VAT 03 50.2% I got was only about 80US$ and alcohol taxes in my country are stupid high. So they also know how to release a fucking stupid good product at a very decent price. Yeah. Go figure.

Not to mention the increasing influence of America and other nations of the world. Italy just became irrelevant. Even today they have slums in Italy still that are full of extreme poverty.<br><br>So after this, all they had left of influence was their food. It was the only thing they had left to be prideful of and so they can\u2019t stand to see other nations take what they see as theirs and change it or make it better. They\u2019re hanging into their last shred of dignity and relevance by playing ignorant, shouting and screaming if someone dares to cook \u201ctheir\u201d food.

in 15 minutes, its not that time consuming so im planning on doing this on the regular.<br>the stuffing was chicken liver farce. recipe is as follows;<br>render and brown 150 grams of cured pork belly(non smoked), add 75 grams of mushrooms and 50 grams of shallots(i used white onion because idgaf), add 300 grams of livers, brown ahrd and season with the usual suspects and allspice.Remove the contents and deglaze the pan with white wine(i used red wine because who the fuck cares), reduce to syrup and add. process everything and add 2 eggs when its cooled enough.<br>once cool you stuff the bird and truss it, you can sew the back skin if you are a fancy nigger.<br><br>it was rich as fuck. i served it with dauphinoise potatoes and homemade cherry wineand i nearly died because i ate two servings.also whilst making the wine i cracked several cherry pits so i was afraid of the cynanide. i drank 3 glasses and im fine so its okay.<br>in refards to the wine i didnt use any pectinase, i
