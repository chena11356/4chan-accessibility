In dough, salt helps to strengthen the gluten network, which gives structure and support to the finished product.

Best I&#039;ve been to was probably Tooth and Nail Brewing in Ottawa. The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

In large urban areas you might (MIGHT) find a Japanese food truck to sushi to-go.<br><br><br>But there is a special category of restaurants worth mentioning: all-you-can-eat Asian buffets.

Of course it&#039;s not the same as a proper Japanese restaurant, and the selection is limited. (Lots of California rolls, salmon, tuna, imitation crab. Not so much eel.) But it&#039;s usually a little fresher than than supermarket sushi, and you can eat 40 pieces if you&#039;re so inclined for like $10-15.<br><br>(To be fair, pic related is from an article called &quot;Why You Shouldn&#039;t Touch the Sushi at All-You-Can-Eat Buffets&quot;, citing concerns about temperature control.

So if you want to eat raw salmon, it&#039;s best to freeze it to a temperature and for a time that will kill any parasites. Most places selling &quot;sashimi grade&quot; salmon use that term to indicate it&#039;s been frozen properly to eliminate any parasites. Again, do your research here, because freezing to eliminate parasites works the same as pasteurization: you need to hit a target temperature for a set amount of time. Your home freezer may not get cold enough to practically do this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;salmonella</span><br>Salmonella lives in the guts of fish. So when the fish is gutted, if the knife that opens the belly pierces the guts AND pierces the meat, then the meat is contaminated. The only protection you have is to trust your source of fish not to contaminate their product. If you don&#039;t trust them, your options are either to cook the fish (this kills the salmonella) or catch your own damn fish and process it yourself. Plenty of reputable places online will ship sashimi-grade, salmonella-free fish to your door. So if you don&#039;t trust anyone local, try Fulton, Riviera, or somewhere else.", "time": 1672476716, "resto": 18751492}, {"no": 18755900, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)03:59:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18752666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18752666</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is it true that in Burgerland you can only get sushi from sit down resturaunts and grocery stores?</span><br><br>No. Plenty of &quot;sushi bowl&quot; fast food places exist.

In a proposed class action filed on Wednesday, Christopher Lazazzaro said he would not have bought or would have paid less for Hershey&#039;s Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate, Lily&#039;s Extra Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa and Lily&#039;s Extreme Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa had Hershey disclosed their metals content.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hershey did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in the federal court in Central Islip, New York. Lazazzaro, a resident of Nassau County, New York, sued two weeks after Consumer Reports unveiled the results of scientific testing of 28 dark chocolate bars for lead and cadmium. Hershey&#039;s Special Dark bar and Lily&#039;s 70% bar were high in lead, and Lily&#039;s 85% bar was high in lead and cadmium, the magazine said. Lazazzaro said reasonable consumers would be turned off by such levels because they pose a &quot;serious health risk,&quot; and that consumers rely on Hershey to be truthful about ingredients in its products.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million of damages, including at least $500 per transaction under New York law. Hershey bought Lily&#039;s for $425 million in June 2021.

It can be difficult to change long-standing habits, but it&#039;s important to remember that it&#039;s never too late to make a change. Here are a few tips that might help you feel better about your diet and make positive changes:<br><br>Start small: Rather than trying to overhaul your entire diet at once, start by making small, manageable changes. For example, try replacing one serving of soda or fast food with a piece of fruit or a healthier snack each day.<br><br>Focus on progress, not perfection: It&#039;s okay to indulge in unhealthy foods occasionally. What&#039;s important is to try to make healthier choices most of the time and focus on the progress you&#039;re making rather than trying to be perfect.<br><br>Plan ahead: Make a meal plan for the week and shop for healthy ingredients in advance. This can help you avoid the temptation to turn to unhealthy options when you&#039;re feeling hungry and don&#039;t have anything healthy on hand.<br><br>Don&#039;t beat yourself up: It&#039;s normal to have slip-ups, and it&#039;s important to be kind to yourself. If you do indulge in unhealthy foods, try to move on and make healthier choices at your next meal or snack.<br><br>Seek support: It can be helpful to enlist the support of friends, family, or a healthcare professional as you work to improve your diet. They can provide motivation and accountability as you make changes.<br><br>Remember, it&#039;s never too late to make positive changes to your diet and improve your overall health.

A lot of the reviews I&#039;ve read recommend the J-Max over the K4, but those are all from at least a year ago, when both grinders were around the same price. Now, the K4 is less than half the price of the J-Max, at ~$88 US versus $200 USD. For a beginner, is the J-Max that much better that it&#039;s worth spending twice as much? Or would I be fine with the K4, and spending the extra money on the esoteric accessories I&#039;ll need? Ultimately, I would like to spend as little as I can to get good results, but I&#039;m willing to spend the extra if it does make a big difference.

Naturally we eventually move to Hawai&#039;i where there is no ice or snow or biting cold and somehow live a comfortable, peaceful, pleasant life despite the high cost of living. Every day, I wear Hawaiian shirts from Costco and eat spam musubi and say &quot;aloha&quot; to my neighbors with a blissful lack of self-awareness; if I look ridiculous to my neighbors and the native kids shit on my lawn, somehow I never know it. We have weekly luaus with roasted pigs and coconuts and pineapples and I mow my FUCKING LUSH lawn (which is probably considered invasive flora but it&#039;s FUCKING LUSH bro) with a $20,000 supercharged John Deere tractor with Vance &amp; Hines straight pipes. Often I hearken back to the strange beauty of life, and the fact that I owe all this well-seasoned joy, all these rich memories and experiences, and most of all, all this love and tenderness with my beautiful island princess... I owe it all to a single simple can of Haiwaiian Sun Guava Nectar soda, and the chance conversation that it struck up with that skinny little nubile golden-brown queen of the surf and sands, so many decades ago. I eventually succumb to Spam-induced heart failure, mournfully surrounded by my dozens of mixed-race children, grandchildren--and also an official contingent of 4chan /ck/ jannies, who came to present me with an award for my many years of shitposting.
