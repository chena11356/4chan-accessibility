Today we will tell you how to cook tasty and healthy substitute of this very kvass without spending money on chemicals from the stores. This is an ancient Russian drink \u2014 meat kvass. There are many recipes of meat kvass, now, and in Russia, too, each hostess had her own, but we will stop on this one. Well, let&#039;s begin.<br><br>1. Prepare the meat. Any kind will do, but not poultry, although, you can try. We can also use by-products. The meat should be well washed with water and put in a jar.<br><br>2. Boil water. For 500 grams of meat about 2 liters of water. After pouring boiling water over the meat, cover the jar with a cloth and leave it for 5 hours. This way the meat must infuse and acquire color and flavor.<br><br>3. Now add sugar. In general, I add 50 grams for each liter, but here it all depends on your taste. Then you have to put the kvass in a warm place for two weeks. Every day stir it and remove the resulting thick foam. It is important to keep the place dark, and the sun away from the fermenting kvass.<br><br>4. Strain the finished drink through gauze. Kvass can be stored in the refrigerator. Meat kvass is used for various cold soups. Do not throw out the meat in the jars. Add more fresh meat to it and you can make meat kvass again.", "filename": "1671694660567", "ext": ".png", "w": 700, "h": 596, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1671694658723557, "time": 1671694658, "md5": "Xu3Y6GfHA9D5+Hm2UdiNjA==", "fsize": 623573, "resto": 18724568}, {"no": 18726063, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:38:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18724615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18724615</a><br><br>Are you equally baffled that buffaloes does have wings or are you just underage?", "time": 1671694739, "resto": 18724568}, {"no": 18726410, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)06:16:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You are supposed to chase it (drink another fluid immediately after it) for stronger spirits.<br>try real fruit juice, water, soda, etc", "time": 1671707808, "resto": 18724568}, {"no": 18726422, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)06:21:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I find alcohol easier to consume when it&#039;s hot.

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea.

Puerh is probably more or less the fancy stuff with the teapots designed around it and the culture of gifting it to your boss and such. But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either). Oolong is somewhat fancy, given as gifts and growers have some pride in it, takes some technical skill to manufacture consistently. It can get rather pricey as well, but the mid shelf stuff at like $0.20 to $0.50 a gram is really good", "time": 1671202277, "resto": 18703371}, {"no": 18704389, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)09:58:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704377</a><br>I think oolong is great for beginners in general.<br>great variety of flavors, sometimes very vivid floral, fruity or sweet creamy. you can use boiling water and it&#039;s often pretty forgiving to brew and doesn&#039;t get too bitter. and you don&#039;t have to worry about drinking it ASAP like with some green teas", "time": 1671202723, "resto": 18703371}, {"no": 18704424, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)10:24:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704358</a><br>Oh I think I had both.

I remember getting some &quot;Jump&quot; branded snuff in Austria several years ago, that was made by Poschl (I think it was an Austrian-market specific product). If you go to MrSnuff, you&#039;ll find they have a pretty wide variety of tinned snuffs. Unfortunately, I cannot order from them anymore (customs issues), and getting tobacco shipped from a continental online shop is an exercise in frustration and/or extreme patience. <br><br>I haven&#039;t tried many of their tinned snuffs, but I really liked Ozona President (which they apparently do not produce anymore, for some reason). Lowenprise is too cloying for my taste (too much anise). Gletscher Prise used to be good, but I think they changed the recipe, for the worse, a few years ago. Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess. However, Poschl schmalzlers are packed in sachets, and they tend to lose aroma if stored too long before use. You might occasionally get a dud.

I typically am a very moderate user however, keeping it mostly to 2-4 sniffs per day and don&#039;t have much of a problem with it. Also just to put it out there I blow and clean my nose grug style. Its a pretty private habit anyway since there aren&#039;t many users out there and I don&#039;t worry about it what people might think of it.

This, combined with having consumed enough sodium earlier to have killed a horse, meant that as I sat there spewing forth a waterfall from my ass it felt like thick boiling poison was flowing through every one of my veins, a truly horrifying feeling. My stomach felt like someone was pumping it full of air to bursting point, and after that it happened.<br><br>Undigested chunks came flying out in an unholy cacophony.

The youtuber idiot &quot;the cowboy kent rollins&quot; or whatever the fuck he goes by is a perfect example of this kind of shill. He has videos where he takes a supposedly new pan and cooks bacon in it, then claiming that it didn&#039;t stick, even once. <br><br>Here&#039;s what happens to a new cast iron pan when you cook three slices of bacon in it. Each slice of bacon literally stripped the seasoning off the pan in the shape of each bacon slice. <br><br>That said, <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything sticks even when copious amounts of oil/butter/etc are applied</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have to &quot;season&quot; it after every single use or it will shit the bed and die</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not allowed to wash it</span><br>I have other pans that are so well seasoned that I *can* cook bacon on them without any sticking or seasoning loss. However, when you get a new one, it can be a challenge to get to that point--and, once you get to that point, it&#039;s also possible to thin the seasoning so much in cooking with proteins that food sticks again. The key is, ironically, to actually wash the pan really well after cooking. Scrape off all the food, and use a chain mail rag if you need to, and cook in oil, at a very high heat, as much as possible during this time.
