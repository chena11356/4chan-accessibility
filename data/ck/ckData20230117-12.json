My mother has arthritis, and my father is lazy, so I know if I get them a hand grinder, they&#039;ll never use it. Especially since they&#039;d need to grind a lot of coffee, since just the two of them by themselves drink an entire pot in the morning.<br><a href=\"#p18821662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18821662</a><br>This is probably the best option for them, but they likely won&#039;t go for it.

When I was growing up, they would drink shitty pre-ground Yuban or whatever they&#039;d buy in bulk at Costco. About fifteen years ago, I got a part time at Starbucks, and got them a free bag of a coffee they sell called Casi Cielo, a seasonal Guatemalan coffee they sell, and probably the best whole bean coffee Starbucks carries. They fell in love with it, and asked me to hoard my free bags of coffee and ship it to them, instead of flipping it on eBay as I usually did. I haven&#039;t worked at Starbucks in about a decade, but my dad will still go to the local stores and buy up their entire supply whenever it&#039;s available, and now it&#039;s all they drink and told me they can&#039;t really stand the shitty pre-ground supermarket stuff. If they run out of that coffee, they&#039;ll switch to tea. When I visited them yesterday, I offered to grind their coffee with my hand grinder, but my mom stopped me because she immediately knew it would make a huge difference to have fresh burr-ground coffee, and she sort of didn&#039;t want to know, because she knew the financial rabbit hole coffee snobbery can lead to.

It was not clear, based on the established medical knowledge, exactly what caused these illnesses to flourish in military camps, but one physician by the name of James H. Salisbury suspected diet was the greatest culprit, and came up with his own solution.<br><br>He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.<br><br>The Salisbury steak, his means of achieving this goal, is ground beef flavored with onion and seasoning and then deep-fried or boiled and covered with gravy or brown sauce. It was introduced in 1888. Salisbury saw beef as an excellent defense against many different physical problems. He suggested that Salisbury steak should be eaten three times a day, with much hot water to cleanse the digestive system. He was an early American proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss, and he promoted his diet for that purpose.

I&#039;ve made many gallons of Apple and pear cider as well as ginger beer and other fermented beverages but I&#039;ve never made wine before.

Pitched the yeast and added it to the container with the airlock and it&#039;s been going great. Fermenting very vigorously. Yesterday I was at the store and found Welches simply peach juice blend drink on sale for $2.50 per 52 oz and I couldn&#039;t pass up the opportunity to give it a try. Check the label and it did not contain any absorbic acid or anything that would prevent fermentation to my knowledge. I added the same amylase enzyme, ec 1118 wine yeast and a small amount of vanilla paste and honey to 64 oz of the peach drink and it&#039;s been going for about 30 hours now but instead of vigorous fermentation with a lot of bubbles the only change that I&#039;ve noticed is a moderate amount of sediment collecting at the top of the fermentation vessel. I know what krausen is and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what this is, I didn&#039;t use an ale yeast. Does anyone with wine making experience know if this is okay or what it is?

The economics are just very strange. For example, many young people looking to further their academic careers but failed to get into a paid PhD program would be willing, if able, to do research unpaid, or even pay for another year of education in the interim before applying again. And yet those hyper-competitive PhD programs still pay salaries (in some form) to their students. However, less-competitive programs do not seem to try to compete with other programs for better students by offering higher salaries, as would be expected in a competitive marketplace, even if they receive a windfall of funding. Part of it&#039;s a very intense social psychology for sure -- money is not really supposed to be a motivator -- but at the same time you obviously don&#039;t want to shut out, or force extra work upon, those who can&#039;t simply live on a parental stipend.<br><br>This world of top-tier restaurant internships, and many other classy internships, in theory seems like it should work with at least a somewhat similar mindset -- at least at a certain point the interns should be intrinsically qualified and valuable enough to be paid and competed over, else why have interns in the first place?<br><br>It kind of reminds me of that famous 19th-century economist&#039;s prediction that the most menial worker&#039;s wages would always fall to the bare minimum needed to sustain life.

(Freakonomics Radio did a paid (secondary) episode about how much the coauthor liked his Cadillac, also without any clear warning anywhere that it was a paid promotion, for example.

The main feature was during the (edited) cooking there were two voice-only commentators giving &quot;live&quot; sports-talk-like commentary, and they actually were really talented (way more so than the chef) -- in addition to having good comedy they had good natural chemistry. So despite the chef being the same in the first episodes and being pretty mediocre, the production quality was good, and of course the commentary was solid, so I actually really liked it. I imagine though, since the commentary track would have to be scripted, that it was a shitload of work to produce and if it wasn&#039;t an early hit the comedians probably would have just moved to other projects.<br><br>The final cute gimmick they had was their closing scene was the chef saying goodbye while at the sink scrubbing all the pots and pans he used.", "time": 1673750276, "resto": 18807527}, {"no": 18812146, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:39:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18807527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18807527</a><br>out of that list I&#039;ve only ever made Chef John and Kenji recipes and they turned out good.
