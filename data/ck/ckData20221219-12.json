He has videos where he takes a supposedly new pan and cooks bacon in it, then claiming that it didn&#039;t stick, even once. <br><br>Here&#039;s what happens to a new cast iron pan when you cook three slices of bacon in it. Each slice of bacon literally stripped the seasoning off the pan in the shape of each bacon slice. <br><br>That said, <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything sticks even when copious amounts of oil/butter/etc are applied</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have to &quot;season&quot; it after every single use or it will shit the bed and die</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not allowed to wash it</span><br>I have other pans that are so well seasoned that I *can* cook bacon on them without any sticking or seasoning loss. However, when you get a new one, it can be a challenge to get to that point--and, once you get to that point, it&#039;s also possible to thin the seasoning so much in cooking with proteins that food sticks again. The key is, ironically, to actually wash the pan really well after cooking. Scrape off all the food, and use a chain mail rag if you need to, and cook in oil, at a very high heat, as much as possible during this time. Frying up potatoes is a really good way to build up seasoning.<br><br>Also, these are good points: <a href=\"#p18705004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18705004</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;properly preheat the thing before cooking in it.</span><br><a href=\"#p18705502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18705502</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I start heating the pan I put a drop of oil, probably half a teaspoon or less for a 12-inch skillet, in the center and then spread it around with a crumpled sheet of paper towel.</span><br>I don&#039;t think too much oil is going to cause sticking, or at least I&#039;ve never seen that happen when I cook with a lot of oil, but you really don&#039;t need much.

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea.

Puerh is probably more or less the fancy stuff with the teapots designed around it and the culture of gifting it to your boss and such. But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either). Oolong is somewhat fancy, given as gifts and growers have some pride in it, takes some technical skill to manufacture consistently.

The Famous Sauce is often served in small ramekins commonly called \u201cdookie drops\u201d by seaman and used for dipping their microwaved chicken tendies. Rations of the sauce are sometimes traded to other sailors in exchange for covering extra duty in 8 ounce containers, something many pollywogs (new recruits) take advantage of due to the popularity of the Famous Sauce. Navy vets know to order it as a \u201cBig Dump\u201d and the galley isn&#039;t shy about giving a little extra to sailors who order this way, knowing they\u2019re what\u2019s called a \u201cson of Neptune\u201d and thus one of their own.", "filename": "5350150154_9c192839de_b", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671427280329903, "time": 1671427280, "md5": "T3WaiOZqhSWBYG1JohPUhQ==", "fsize": 134157, "resto": 18711436}, {"no": 18715149, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)01:16:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18711505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18711505</a><br><a href=\"#p18711520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18711520</a><br>You know cruise ships exist.

Just take whatever chicken parts you want, whatever vegetables you want and whatever spices you want and boil all that shit for a few hours. If you want to make it good, make sure you use chicken parts with plenty of bones, I personally prefer just drumsticks but a whole chicken like your vid is a fine choice. Fresh garlic and onions are an absolute must. If you want to add carrots make sure you slice them thin- any soup vegetables should be chopped up small but for carrots it&#039;s especially important. Spices are entirely a matter of personal taste but I find sage goes excellent with chicken in all cases. The only real trick when it comes to seasoning is adding just the right amount of salt, and that skill only comes with practice.

Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess.

Here&#039;s how it turned out. Each color is a standard semolina and water dough. For coloring the green has basil juice (pureed and strained fresh basil), red has paprika and tomato paste. The colored pasta doesn&#039;t retain much basil or tomato/paprika flavor when eaten with a sauce, but on their own it&#039;s subtle yet present. The paprika is only for added color. It does not taste of paprika at all which was a little surprising.<br>I stuck with the approximate ratio of 3:1 semolina:liquid by weight. It&#039;s a very dry dough, but that tends to work better with a pasta extruder. I made the pasta in 9 batches of 420g over the course of a month to allow for adequate drying time. This left room for ~20g that gets lost in the extruder per batch and some for me to eat along the way.<br>This bag is 300g of pasta, about 3 servings. I made a total of 3300g of pasta which portioned out into 11 bags for my family and in-laws.<br>I&#039;d do it again next year, but probably with a faster style of pasta that I can make with a roller.
