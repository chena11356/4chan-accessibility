Until recently, the earliest evidence of cooking dates to approximately 170,000 years ago. However, a close analysis of the remains of a carp-like fish found at the Gesher Benot Ya\u2019aqov (GBY) archaeological site in Israel provides proof that the fish were cooked roughly 780,000 years ago, thus predating the available data by over 600,000 years ago.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By studying the structure of pharyngeal teeth belonging to the fish fossils, the scientists were able to prove that the fish caught at the ancient Hula Lake \u2013 adjacent to the archeological site \u2013 were exposed to temperatures suitable for cooking and were not simply burned by a spontaneous fire. The fact that fish cooking is evident over such a long period of settlement at the site indicates a continuous tradition of cooking food, and adds evidence to the high cognitive capacities of the Acheulian hunter-gatherers who were active in that region. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to the scientists, the transition from eating raw food to eating cooked food had major implications for human development and behavior. Since eating cooked food reduces the bodily energy required to break down and digest food, it allows other physical systems to develop, and leads to changes in the human jaw and skull. Such changes freed humans from the daily, intensive work of searching for and digesting raw food, providing them sufficient free time to develop new behavioral and social systems. Thus, eating fish can be considered a major milestone in human cognitive evolution, providing a central catalyst for the development of the modern human brain.</span><br>Probably not your normal wheelhouse /ck/ but thought you might be interested in this.
