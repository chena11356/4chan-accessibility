If you were given the choice between jail food and outside food, of course you&#039;d choose outside food 8 days out of the week. Jail food sucked man, the portions are tiny, the food is underseasoned and all they give you are some tiny salt and pepper packets that are about the size of your thumb nail.

I mean what are you expecting, it&#039;s fucking jail, not a 5 star resort.<br><br>That being said, when you&#039;ve been in jail for 16 hours and it&#039;s become abundantly clear that you&#039;re not getting out any time soon, a plate of lukewarm goyslop doesn&#039;t sound too bad. I got &quot;lucky&quot; during one of my trips to jail and I got to eat one of the bi-monthly hot breakfasts (normally it&#039;s cereal). Two tiny sausage patties, two tiny pancakes, a tiny syrup packet and no butter, one single limp dick slice of bacon and a fruit cup. Sounds like garbage to you. But for someone who hadn&#039;t eaten all day because I got arrested in the middle of the night, it was actually a pretty good meal. Oh yeah, and an acceptable side dish in jail is a half a slice of disgusting wheat bread. I got that shit during every single meal.

Things that should be paltry like bags of chips, pickles, hot sauce, tuna, and ramen were like 5x their outside price. Headphones and calling cards were like 10x a reasonable outside price. Just another way to extract money from people in jail.<br><br>I did try jail cuisine one single time, but it was wasted on me. I was detoxing/withdrawing from drugs when one of the guys in my block who coincidentally went to the same college I did cooked up some kind of jail house burrito. I remember him breaking up some bags of ramen and cheetos into a powder and mixing it with nacho cheese and hot sauce and chopped up pepperoni sticks. Since I was dope sick at the time, all I needed as a wiff of that bullshit and it was enough to make me gag, and it wasn&#039;t much better going down either. I only ate a few bites of my burrito before throwing it out. Looking back, that was such a dick move. That guy didn&#039;t have to spend his hard earned jail money and waste his time crafting a jail burrito for me, but he did, and I didn&#039;t even have the curtosey to finish it.

It simply fills brain receptors that would normally accept the hormone that sends you to sleep.

I definitely do not NEED caffeine as I also drink caffeine free coffee and teas about half the time. <br><br>But its more dependent on you personally and how your day goes. I have a caffeine sensitivity and if I made a really strong pot of tea and I finish drinking it at noon, sometimes I just cannot get to sleep until 1 or 2am. if I watch it and I&#039;m careful and make a normal to week pot and finish drinking by 10 while drinking plenty of water throughout the day I&#039;m fine. I also get to sleep a little better if I just don&#039;t drink any for the day. That said, caffeine doesn&#039;t help anyone sleep better so stopping &quot;too early&quot; is much better than stopping too late. Some people get really pissy because of their caffeine withdrawal symptoms too. Again, thats because they&#039;re a drug addict. The approximate halflife is 8 hours, meaning if you stop at 3, its like me drinking a single cup of coffee at 6pm. If you ever noticed your sleep isn&#039;t great, its because your brain isn&#039;t actually sleeping because of the caffeine. Try stopping at 10am and switch to anything decaf after that. I think even decaf coffee is a diuretic and dehydrates you, I know anything with &quot;energy&quot; like decaf monster or whatever also dehydrates you. Dehydrated brains also don&#039;t sleep well. <br><br>Just do an experiment for a solid week and try to notice the differences in your mood and sleep after 7 days. Stop caffeine at like 10am and don&#039;t drink any on the weekends. worst that happens is the first couple days feel weird but after that your body and brain adjust to less caffeine.", "time": 1676418774, "resto": 18938590}, {"no": 18938860, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:55:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I can&#039;t remember where I picked up this factoid but it takes seven hours before caffeine leaves the body<br><br>I usually stop drinking coffee before noon and (non-herbal) tea before three so I can get to sleep without any issues", "time": 1676418924, "resto": 18938590}, {"no": 18938877, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:59:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18938855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18938855</a><br>I love coffee too.

Much like coupons, it allows the poor and stingy to pay less, while the rich and generous can pay more, for the same product. This lowers the average price of the product, increases the pay for employees, increases the profit for the owner, and enables more consumers to purchase the product at a price they find agreeable. Tipping makes the economy more efficient and literally benefits everyone. If you&#039;ve never taken an economics class, please Google &quot;price discrimination&quot; and if you have a 3-digit IQ you will thereafter understand why tipping is good.<br><br>Most people who are against tipping only think this way because they think tipping results in servers getting less money, and/or customers paying more money. Neither of which is true. Compare wages and restaurant costs in the US and Europe to find out that it&#039;s literally the opposite. American servers make on average about double the salary of European servers, but our restaurants are simultaneously cheaper.

They can&#039;t allow any institution to exist which allows haggling, flexible prices, palm greasing, winking, or nudging, because these institutions benefit the many at the expense of the black.

He draws some understandable parallels to other fields, military and science that I also found enlightening. <br>However my favorite part of the video is how bloody well he articulates the necessity of a an objective hierarchy existing in the gamut of a product-based hobby. To not be elitist, as defined at the start of the video, is to not show passion and you might as well be drinking grocery store bags. Or worse yet, one might not have that passion and still have the desire to belong to this community of hobbyists, also known the arrogant snob. <br>There was also some great little snippets of hierarchy of understanding of tea and thinking about sha qing or tea in general as having layers of abstraction to understand.

The central desire is to go to the metaphorical buddhist monastery, and to be told that you are already enlightened, that you were always enlightened and that you just need to realize it. Not the reality, that you will be told that you will be spending the next twenty years of your life at least meditating and studying scripture, and maybe then you will become enlightened along the way some time later. 4chan does well both in killing snobbery, there&#039;s no face I have to present to this thread, I have no status or persona here so fighting over it or trying to build my status is pointless; and in promoting the necessarily somewhat violent discussion. No one&#039;s posts are put above another, there is no system of upvotes or likes to support a rebellion of the underclass, or the anti-enthusiasts. If you have a strong opinion about tea, you have to lay out your argument and be judged on its merits. Almost especially for tea, I think that this format emphasizes the &quot;jianghu&quot; of tea. There really are not clear lines, everyone has their own extremely strong opinion of what tea is, and you can make very compelling arguments for pretty much any of them.

We pour flavoured tallow (the layer that we skimmed after floating to the top of the broth during long simmer) on top of our bowls. It shines with the layer of the rich fat. My lips will chafe and feel sticky after eating my Pho. And it&#039;s completely wrong if they weren&#039;t.<br>Second, properly cooked brisket for Pho, btfo any Ramen Cha Siu, this is from my personal experience with top-tier Pho (my mom&#039;s) and top-tier Ramen (top-rated Ramen shops ran by Japanese, both non-chain and chain). This point is closely linked to the first point, because a good broth will enhance the brisket as well. Brisket, cooked properly will be tender, yet springy. Something that Ramen Cha Siu will never achieve. You will have to use another pork cut for that.<br>Third, again, closely linked to the 1st point, you have never slurped a proper high-quality egg yolk from an indigenous egg, slightly cooked and warmed in a hot bowl of Pho, along with a spoonful of that quality broth. Ramen egg (or ajitsuke tamago) is also my favourite, but when faced with a properly served Pho egg, it simply can not compete.<br>The problem is that, most Pho restaurants here blow.

So no, it doesn&#039;t really make sense.</span><br>On the Lodge website, the 12&quot; is $30, and the 13.25&quot; is $50. Their most common model is the $10.25&quot;, which is regularly $24 and currently marked down to $20. One of the reasons cast iron, in general, is not popular is due to the weight. We can see that the 12&quot;, at 7.89 lbs, is 47% heavier than the 10.25&quot; (5.35 lbs), and the 13.25&quot;, at 10.5 lbs, is 100% heavier than the 10.25&quot; skillet. So based on weight, there is TWICE the iron in the 13.25 inch skillet as in the 10.25 inch skillet--you might have had some inkling of this if you understood the difference between diameter and area of a circle.<br><br>Based on material alone, the regular price of the 10.25&quot; being half of the 13.25&quot; makes sense. However, you&#039;d be stupid if you thought that was the only factor. Because the 10.25&quot; is more popular, more stores are going to order them reliably. Lodge can make more of them, without worrying if they will sell and receive a return on their investment. It&#039;s the one model that they know they won&#039;t have leftover stock at the end of the year; therefore, they can afford to sell them with thinner margins. Hence the $20 price right now. <br><br>So basically, you&#039;re a complete idiot and you should feel bad about it.", "time": 1676396120, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937733, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:36:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937683</a><br>Mental illness.", "time": 1676396181, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937786, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937726</a><br>k", "time": 1676396867, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937793, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:49:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*I was wrong.

In 1621, Duke Math\u00e9o Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Subercaseaux orders dirt melon to be eradicated from Europe. The dish is no longer eaten for over a century until the chef of King George III prepares it for his luncheon with a Transylvanian baron.

By 1892, Asstree production had been banned in every country after several civil wars in multiple countries over Asstree orchard disputes and ethical concerns. In 1952, American scientist Norville Johnson isolates the flavor compound of Asstree bark, allowing mass production of the flavoring for pennies.

So we need to wean you off the goyslop and ease you into cooking from scratch. <br><br>First, you need to go to the isle that has premixes OP. You are going to pickup various packets of dry mixes with rice/risotto/pasta. These are going to be your practice material. Get some milk and butter to go with them, and maybe some meatballs from the freezer section. These packets are 1 pot meals, so get a pot from the store while you are there, and a wooden spoon/spatula. <br><br>Now, at home, fire up your range, medium burner, and put the pot on. Or zippy zap the coil to warm it up, whatever. Butter pat, in. Follow the meal instructions and put in water and milk in the ratio prescribed. Wait for it to boil. Add mix packet. Reduce heat, and stir for X minutes (7 - 10 depending on what it says). Put in bowl when done. <br><br>Congratulations, you are now a level 1 cook. You can follow basic directions and make a &quot;meal&quot;. <br><br>Next time, you add the frozen meatballs at the start to the dish. Now instead of just noodles and sauce, you have a strogenoff. Or whatever you want. Start learning creativity here. This is basic meal assembly skills here. <br><br>For level 2: start swapping ingredients. Learn what using alcohol does to the dish. Add things and seasonings to the mix; use the whole spice rack. This will give you a standard to keep so you can experience the effect ingredients have on a dish. Swap sherry for some of the water. Add broccoli. Add different meats. Add cheese at the end. Learn how ingredients change the process. Once you have experimented and learned all sorts of things, it is time for level 3. <br><br>Level 3: do it all from scratch. Your goal here is to recreate these packet meals from scratch: that means getting the rice, the onions, the garlic, the broccoli, the pasta, etc. from the market and doing all the processing yourself. From here you will need to learn knife work and start learning ingredient qualities.", "time": 1676433767, "resto": 18939180}, {"no": 18939682, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)23:13:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18939654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18939654</a><br>This is going to be the quickest and most effective way to learn a lot of shit fast. The meals are super fast, like done in 15-20 min, and they are standardized &amp; satisfying, so they will taste the same every time and be worth doing. This lets you practice with individual components and learn shit: is oil better than butter, what is my preferred salt level, what combination of things do I like, what seasonings are good, how do cream and cheese work, how does a sauce come together. And if you fuck up you literally only lose like 2 dollars. Start over and do it again, no tears shed. <br><br>Once you are familiar with food, its prep and what things actually do, you can move on to real recipes from scratch. This way you won&#039;t waste expensive cuts of meat and fish. <br><br>Oh, and curry is a great way to move off of packet based meals into near from scratch cooking. You will need to brown meat for that, and it involves basic chopping and veggie prep. The curry brick lets you avoid the seasoning process and roux production. <br><br>Once you get your training wheels off, you then move into all the from-scratch recipes and work your way up the complexity tree: start simple with stews, pasta, basic meals. Then get into things that take hours to make. Then fall down the rabbit hole that is baking. Or fall down the BBQ rabbit hole.

I&#039;m more of a rib eye or porterhouse kinda guy; I think the increased fat distribution really helps elevate the beefy flavor of steak. It&#039;s your call of course, but I&#039;d never choose a filet if I had other options. Maybe even better than, my God forgive me for using saying this name, s*rloin.<br><br>As for the pan sauce, I like the classic brown sauce/gravy. Deglaze your steak pan as your steaks cool off with half a shallot, add some compound garlic/thyme/rosemary butter, about a tablespoon of tomato paste, then hit it with 1 part red wine and 2 parts beef stock and season. Let it reduce to your desired consistency (don&#039;t forget it will thicken more as it cools), and Bing bang boom. Shit is so cash. That&#039;s a guaranteed panty melter of a meal, OP.
