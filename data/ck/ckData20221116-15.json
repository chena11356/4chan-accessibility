But many of you don&#039;t really know WHAT to grow, beyond the obvious stuff like potatoes or corn. The answer is squash. Squashes can be cleaned and stored for up to a year after harvest. They are full of nutrients. They are versatile in terms of cooking and recipes. They can be canned or stored for longer periods of time. And they aren&#039;t very difficult to grow in temperate climates.<br><br>There are thousands of varieties of squash, but beginners should start with the Cucurbita maxima, AKA the &#039;blue hubbard.&#039; Blue hubbards have dense, rich flesh which is prized for its texture and taste. They grow to respectable sizes, but aren&#039;t absurdly huge like pumpkins (a late-season healthy Hubbard should be anywhere from 10 to 20lbs / 4.5-9kg, or a bit bigger if they start earlier in the season). They have a rugged outer skin which helps ward off predators and damage. And they have a good aesthetic in general. Peeled and cubed hubbard fits great in stews and soups.<br><br>If you have limited experience with squashes or gardening, this is a good way to start. You can easily grow a dozen or more mature hubbards from a small number of plants and their vines, even with relatively limited space. That&#039;s a couple hundred pounds of fresh, high-quality, nutrient-rich food. And beyond that, there are many other squashes to grow.<br><br>You WILL grow some squashes the next time your local planting season comes around - right, /ck/?", "filename": "1652222503430[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1163, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 227, "tim": 1668486688270609, "time": 1668486688, "md5": "b6VxHD2AhP3V0jvLBfzpOA==", "fsize": 623553, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "youll-cowards-dont-even-grow-squash", "replies": 28, "images": 6, "omitted_posts": 23, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 18583641, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)19:14:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "THANKS FOR THE FREE FOOD STUPID LOL", "filename": "squash-vine-borer-melittia-cucurbitae", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1124, "h": 1124, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668557647150920, "time": 1668557647, "md5": "BEiXnN9GDFtT66+J1dujDQ==", "fsize": 771459, "resto": 18581158}, {"no": 18584631, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)23:50:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18582174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18582174</a><br>I like this one better", "filename": "mvpfkxuq94g41", "ext": ".png", "w": 338, "h": 464, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668574246121247, "time": 1668574246, "md5": "0MtqunGegSTMaZoWDp5+KQ==", "fsize": 292077, "resto": 18581158}, {"no": 18584688, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)00:18:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18581158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18581158</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You WILL grow some squashes the next time your local planting season comes around - right, /ck/?</span><br>I saved delicata, hubbard, blue hubbard, acorn, and carnival squash seeds this year to grow some next year.
