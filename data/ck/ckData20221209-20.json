And thus we\u2019re now in a situation where the prices are well and truly out of whack. It\u2019s decent stuff but nowhere near the price they\u2019re asking for these days.

I\u2019d rather go for variety and there\u2019s many solid options out there for much better prices. The key to whisky is: don\u2019t let anyone tell you what\u2019s good. Decide for yourself what you like. There\u2019s nothing wrong in being in love with a cheap young bottle if that\u2019s what you like.
