And while I do still appreciate the Glenfiddich 18 40% as it\u2019s really a decent bottle it\u2019s also kinda annoying that I often feel that the flavours could be exposed a little more, because there\u2019s really a lot going on. I agree with you though that one sign of a good liquor is having a silly high ABV while not actually tasting any of the alcohol, which Glenfiddich knows how to master. So it\u2019s somewhat aggravating that they\u2019re purposefully nerfing themselves. I don\u2019t think anyone really knows why but the rumour is that they just want to get more bottles out. Glenfiddich has also been doing this thing where they\u2019ll do restricted releases of higher ABV bottles like the one I just acquired (it\u2019s pretty much limited to duty free merchants at airports and only in select countries). And from what I heard the original 18 43% can still be acquired but only at their distillery. It\u2019s bloody annoying because they know their shit. The 15 VAT 03 50.2% I got was only about 80US$ and alcohol taxes in my country are stupid high. So they also know how to release a fucking stupid good product at a very decent price. Yeah. Go figure.

I also use Bisquick for my waffles like a basic bitch, but I make the batter thinner to accommodate the cheese.", "time": 1672627471, "resto": 18760224}, {"no": 18762094, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:01:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18762057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18762057</a><br>that sounds delicious, anon. when you say garlic, are you talking cloves, minced or powder?", "time": 1672628510, "resto": 18760224}, {"no": 18762190, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:52:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18760224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18760224</a><br>My default waffle recipe is just pancake batter but cooked in a waffle iron.<br><br>with waffle/pancake batter personally i like to add milk powder and extra egg yolks.<br><br>I&#039;ve also discovered that waffles are the superior bread thing for eggs and egg sandwiches because the holes in the waffle trap the egg yolk better than any english muffin and the like. i suppose you can also use waffles in savory applications as well which would include savory sandwiches like <a href=\"#p18762057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18762057</a> mentioned.", "time": 1672631567, "resto": 18760224}, {"no": 18762323, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)23:48:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18762094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18762094</a><br>Minced", "filename": "IMG_20221219_150333758", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4096, "h": 3072, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672634892724029, "time": 1672634892, "md5": "u9J4ftJswyThbVT/ysC1Xw==", "fsize": 3370311, "resto": 18760224}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18762282, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)23:26:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is my sandwich.

So if you want to eat raw salmon, it&#039;s best to freeze it to a temperature and for a time that will kill any parasites. Most places selling &quot;sashimi grade&quot; salmon use that term to indicate it&#039;s been frozen properly to eliminate any parasites. Again, do your research here, because freezing to eliminate parasites works the same as pasteurization: you need to hit a target temperature for a set amount of time. Your home freezer may not get cold enough to practically do this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;salmonella</span><br>Salmonella lives in the guts of fish. So when the fish is gutted, if the knife that opens the belly pierces the guts AND pierces the meat, then the meat is contaminated. The only protection you have is to trust your source of fish not to contaminate their product. If you don&#039;t trust them, your options are either to cook the fish (this kills the salmonella) or catch your own damn fish and process it yourself. Plenty of reputable places online will ship sashimi-grade, salmonella-free fish to your door.

Leave egg yolks aside and mix everything else (water/milk, starch, anything else you like besides the yolks) together in a saucepan and heat on the stove, stirring constantly until you reach a boil or the starch gels and the mixture thickens, then turn off heat. If the sauce isn&#039;t thickened after reaching a simmer, the egg yolks may curdle in the later steps, so add more slurry as needed until you achieve a thick sauce.<br>2. Let the sauce cool down in the pan off the heat for a minute or two, or until just not hot enough to scramble the egg yolks. Stirring the sauce around constantly at this point helps it cool down faster. <br>3.

Example of this phenomenon (but with cheese instead of yolks): 13:36 https://youtu.be/10lXPzbRoU0?t=816<br>- For step 1, you may use wheat flour instead and begin by making a roux, then proceeding with the rest of the recipe the same way. If using a non-wheat starch like potato, cornstarch, or rice flour, it helps to have a slurry handy to adjust the thickness of the sauce as you go.<br>- You can add the butter or fat at any point during step 1; personally I like to add it at the beginning before the heat.<br>- Obviously season to taste and add anything you want in the hollandaise like hot sauce, herbs, spices, lemon juice, vinegar, whatever.<br>- I deliberately left out ingredient amounts and proportions. The key to this method is starting out by making a pudding. The starch to liquid ratio is the main thing that affects the final thickness of the sauce, but this can be adjusted as you go with slurry. Every starch has different thickening power depending so look up starch you&#039;re using before you start the recipe.<br>- Yes I know about the blender + hot butter method. That method works but still sucks dick and who the fuck wants to bring out a whole ass blender just to make a sauce then clean it afterwards.

The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

Hershey&#039;s Special Dark bar and Lily&#039;s 70% bar were high in lead, and Lily&#039;s 85% bar was high in lead and cadmium, the magazine said. Lazazzaro said reasonable consumers would be turned off by such levels because they pose a &quot;serious health risk,&quot; and that consumers rely on Hershey to be truthful about ingredients in its products.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million of damages, including at least $500 per transaction under New York law. Hershey bought Lily&#039;s for $425 million in June 2021. The case is Lazazzaro v Hershey Co, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 22-07923.</span><br><br>There&#039;s a CR petition you can sign to prod for supply chain reform:<br>https://action.consumerreports.org/<wbr>20221215_heavymetalschocolate_cro<br>https://www.consumerreports.org/hea<wbr>lth/food-safety/lead-and-cadmium-in<wbr>-dark-chocolate-a8480295550/<br>But if a class action is what it takes to compel action then so be it.", "filename": "screencapture-i-dailymail-co-uk-1s-2022-12-15-21-65634145-0-image-a-4-1671139358244-jpg-2022-12-29-16_07_51", "ext": ".png", "w": 1600, "h": 1099, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 171, "tim": 1672351737720250, "time": 1672351737, "md5": "emz7ti/9nPWtkY2t3ZX68A==", "fsize": 1901193, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hershey-sued-over-heavy-metals", "replies": 48, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 30}, {"no": 18750391, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)17:17:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "THANK YOU FDA FOR KEEPING US SAFE", "time": 1672352251, "resto": 18750371}, {"no": 18750402, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)17:20:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "all lawyers should hang", "time": 1672352445, "resto": 18750371}, {"no": 18750522, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18750371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18750371</a>", "filename": "I got this from reddit", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 792, "h": 784, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1672354895110676, "time": 1672354895, "md5": "B8Q4Jw6pMVxURAXwwnyRSg==", "fsize": 116633, "resto": 18750371}, {"no": 18750824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:35:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18750371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18750371</a><br>I hope the greasy wop kneecaps the shit choc co then dies of a meatball induced heart attack a week later", "time": 1672360529, "resto": 18750371}, {"no": 18750942, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)20:16:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18750371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18750371</a><br>Couldn&#039;t care less", "time": 1672363019, "resto": 18750371}, {"no": 18751786, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:34:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18750371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18750371</a><br>At this point it seems like all water and food is contaminated with metals, plastics, and poisons.

When the chocolate is consumed in moderate amounts, the lead and cadmium levels are nothing to worry about, he says. &quot;If you make sure that the rest of your diet is good and sufficient in calcium and iron, you protect yourself even more by preventing absorption of some lead and cadmium in your diet.&quot;</span><br><br>I&#039;ve always thought the &quot;Moderation&quot; assurance was conferring false security as if we aren&#039;t an over-indulgent nation of consoomers.

You won\u2019t find this on any menu, but if you\u2019re a true local you\u2019ll know. The Famous Sauce is often served in small ramekins commonly called \u201cdookie drops\u201d by locals and used for dipping. The sauce is also sold for $10 for an 8 ounce container, something many New Britain locals take advantage of due to the popularity of the Famous Sauce. Locals know to order it as a \u201cBig Dump\u201d and the owners aren\u2019t shy about giving a little extra to people who order this way, knowing they\u2019re what\u2019s called a \u201ctool city townie\u201d and thus one of their own.", "time": 1672440727, "resto": 18753549}, {"no": 18754336, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)17:55:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18753549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18753549</a><br>Those things look as appealing as traffic cones, given a choice I&#039;d rather eat the traffic cones", "filename": "Traffic_Cone_Daleks", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 922, "h": 691, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672440904241508, "time": 1672440904, "md5": "xPPd1uWpRe8wQrjSe3Y7WA==", "fsize": 619280, "resto": 18753549}, {"no": 18754381, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)18:06:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18753549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18753549</a><br>Making kids eat their vegetables even though it doesnt taste as great as hotdogs or pizza?
