Leave egg yolks aside and mix everything else (water/milk, starch, anything else you like besides the yolks) together in a saucepan and heat on the stove, stirring constantly until you reach a boil or the starch gels and the mixture thickens, then turn off heat. If the sauce isn&#039;t thickened after reaching a simmer, the egg yolks may curdle in the later steps, so add more slurry as needed until you achieve a thick sauce.<br>2. Let the sauce cool down in the pan off the heat for a minute or two, or until just not hot enough to scramble the egg yolks. Stirring the sauce around constantly at this point helps it cool down faster. <br>3. Once the sauce/pudding is still warm but not too hot to cause scrambled eggs (cool enough that if you dipped your fingertip into the sauce it won&#039;t hurt), add yolks.<br>4. Place saucepan back on heat and resume stirring constantly until the sauce reaches a simmer once more so the egg yolks have cooked (at least 165\u00baF).<br>5.

Example of this phenomenon (but with cheese instead of yolks): 13:36 https://youtu.be/10lXPzbRoU0?t=816<br>- For step 1, you may use wheat flour instead and begin by making a roux, then proceeding with the rest of the recipe the same way. If using a non-wheat starch like potato, cornstarch, or rice flour, it helps to have a slurry handy to adjust the thickness of the sauce as you go.<br>- You can add the butter or fat at any point during step 1; personally I like to add it at the beginning before the heat.<br>- Obviously season to taste and add anything you want in the hollandaise like hot sauce, herbs, spices, lemon juice, vinegar, whatever.<br>- I deliberately left out ingredient amounts and proportions. The key to this method is starting out by making a pudding. The starch to liquid ratio is the main thing that affects the final thickness of the sauce, but this can be adjusted as you go with slurry.

They are smoked and packed in oil, so they taste mostly like... smoky oil, with a slight fishy aftertaste.

Some species of sheep/goat/lamb naturally have a rather unpleasant smell and flavor that is actually popular in other parts of the world but not so much in 1st world regions. Asking your butcher for advice on your selection is a good idea. <br><br>If you already have your meat and it&#039;s the kind of goat/lamb/sheep that naturally has that weird smell and flavor, you can start by preparing a marinade and then having your meat sit in that for like six hours but no longer than a day. Marinades chemically and permanently fix flavor to the outside of the meat but don&#039;t penetrate the meat, but you can also score your meat with deep cuts or straight stabs into the center with a skewer to help the marinade go deeper.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other than that I &#039;d braise it on low temperature in the oven to not let it dry out.</span><br>This is good. All big roasts of meat should be cooked low and slow anyway for even cooking and to avoid the outside drying out before the inside is cooked through. And it it&#039;s one of those cuts of meat that you want fall apart tender, even better; you cannot cook it for too long. <br>Also be sure to braise it in a flavorful and seasoned broth or stock, not water. If you cook it in water, the water will just suck out the flavor of the meat, but by cooking it in a rich broth with seasoning you&#039;ll contribute flavor to the meat.<br>The other thing you can do is cook up a very strong sauce with lots of herbs and spices and serve the meat roast with that. And really be generous with the herbs and spices. You can never go wrong with thyme. Also lots of garlic.<br>Some nice wine for sweetening would be good for the sauce too, and I don&#039;t see why you couldn&#039;t add wine to the braising liquid you&#039;ll cook the meat in, but I&#039;d reduce the wine a little bit first to concentrate it.", "time": 1672704153, "resto": 18764636}, {"no": 18764822, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18764636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18764636</a><br>What European board?

Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

Glenfiddich for me has always been more fruity with hardly any peat and not that much oak. And while I do still appreciate the Glenfiddich 18 40% as it\u2019s really a decent bottle it\u2019s also kinda annoying that I often feel that the flavours could be exposed a little more, because there\u2019s really a lot going on. I agree with you though that one sign of a good liquor is having a silly high ABV while not actually tasting any of the alcohol, which Glenfiddich knows how to master. So it\u2019s somewhat aggravating that they\u2019re purposefully nerfing themselves. I don\u2019t think anyone really knows why but the rumour is that they just want to get more bottles out. Glenfiddich has also been doing this thing where they\u2019ll do restricted releases of higher ABV bottles like the one I just acquired (it\u2019s pretty much limited to duty free merchants at airports and only in select countries). And from what I heard the original 18 43% can still be acquired but only at their distillery. It\u2019s bloody annoying because they know their shit. The 15 VAT 03 50.2% I got was only about 80US$ and alcohol taxes in my country are stupid high. So they also know how to release a fucking stupid good product at a very decent price. Yeah. Go figure.
