The economics are just very strange. For example, many young people looking to further their academic careers but failed to get into a paid PhD program would be willing, if able, to do research unpaid, or even pay for another year of education in the interim before applying again. And yet those hyper-competitive PhD programs still pay salaries (in some form) to their students. However, less-competitive programs do not seem to try to compete with other programs for better students by offering higher salaries, as would be expected in a competitive marketplace, even if they receive a windfall of funding. Part of it&#039;s a very intense social psychology for sure -- money is not really supposed to be a motivator -- but at the same time you obviously don&#039;t want to shut out, or force extra work upon, those who can&#039;t simply live on a parental stipend.<br><br>This world of top-tier restaurant internships, and many other classy internships, in theory seems like it should work with at least a somewhat similar mindset -- at least at a certain point the interns should be intrinsically qualified and valuable enough to be paid and competed over, else why have interns in the first place?<br><br>It kind of reminds me of that famous 19th-century economist&#039;s prediction that the most menial worker&#039;s wages would always fall to the bare minimum needed to sustain life.

(Freakonomics Radio did a paid (secondary) episode about how much the coauthor liked his Cadillac, also without any clear warning anywhere that it was a paid promotion, for example.

The main feature was during the (edited) cooking there were two voice-only commentators giving &quot;live&quot; sports-talk-like commentary, and they actually were really talented (way more so than the chef) -- in addition to having good comedy they had good natural chemistry. So despite the chef being the same in the first episodes and being pretty mediocre, the production quality was good, and of course the commentary was solid, so I actually really liked it. I imagine though, since the commentary track would have to be scripted, that it was a shitload of work to produce and if it wasn&#039;t an early hit the comedians probably would have just moved to other projects.<br><br>The final cute gimmick they had was their closing scene was the chef saying goodbye while at the sink scrubbing all the pots and pans he used.", "time": 1673750276, "resto": 18807527}, {"no": 18812146, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:39:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18807527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18807527</a><br>out of that list I&#039;ve only ever made Chef John and Kenji recipes and they turned out good.

You probably have that already. Don&#039;t worry, some of the posts telling you that you&#039;ll be hungry all the time are retarded. You won&#039;t. Though I am not 100% certain the 1st week or few days MAY have you feeling hungry regardless, after a couple weeks you&#039;ll fall into a rhythm and it will be smooth.<br><br>:::Part 1 (Macros):<br><br>1g fat = 9 calories<br>1g protein = 4 calories<br>1g carbs = 4 calories<br><br>Remember that. Food nutrition is split up between macro nutrients (fat/protein/carbs) that give you your energy and building blocks, and micro nutrients (vitamins/minerals) which supply your body with a host of important matter it will *need* to function correctly, if not optimally. <br><br>:::Part 2 (Micros):<br><br>Please look into getting an account on Cronometer. Just google it. It&#039;s free and you don&#039;t need the membership. You can use it to track your total calories intake and your vitamin and mineral intake, but it&#039;s mostly there for now so you can see which foods will supply you with what. This is for the long-term picture so you get to understand what&#039;s good and what isn&#039;t and, hopefully one day, learn to cook for yourself beyond the absolute basics.<br><br>Additionally, I highly recommend you look into getting a quality multi-vitamin. It will make the process easier and potentially fix some other problems you may have. If you&#039;re in the US or Canada you should try and find Vitamin Code for Men supplements, they are raw ingredients only and of the highest quality. Pic related is what I use. Being realistic here, you are not going to hit 100% of nutritional targets so it&#039;s important you use this.

It&#039;s time-restricted eating, which is a lot healthier and more natural than gorging yourself on food every 2-3 hours. You have an eating window you eat food in, and the the rest of the time you only drink water or things that do not contain any macros (fat/protein/carbs), like tea. I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I legitimately never feel hungry outside the eating window or even think about food (unless I&#039;m looking up a recipe intentionally) and I&#039;m barely hungry even when it&#039;s time to eat, but I still enjoy the food of course.<br><br>I recommend starting out with 16:8, meaning you do not eat for 16 hours and eat for 8. 10 AM to 6 PM is generally the accepted starting point.

Lacking or even off-putting flavors got covered up by sauce. Even mistakes like overcooked or burned food would be hidden by a sauce slathered all over on top of the food.<br>This is why fancy restaurants today mostly tend to put sauce on the plate, below the food, with the food like the steak or whatever sitting on top of the sauce. Because today\u2019s kitchens don\u2019t have to worry about covering up their mistakes so much while back in Escoffier\u2019s day covering up mistakes or making up for lacking food was the mindset of the restaurant kitchen industry.<br>According to Wolfgang Puck.", "time": 1673757624, "resto": 18808355}, {"no": 18812610, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:45:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18812584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18812584</a><br>Maybe I suck at cooking or have bad taste because I like the espagnole based sauces.

I think next was they switched from Chicken Tenders, little morsels of actual meat, and switched to the McDonald&#039;s style chicken slurry formed into a shape and then fried. And then they decided to reject the 90&#039;s fry recipe from the Mr. Potato Head promotion and switched over to whataver thrice-damned recipe that makes their fries look/feel like hollow husks of potato extract. The business went from #2 in the fastfood burger industry to #10.
