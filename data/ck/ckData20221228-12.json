We were debating on where to eat when I suggested some fried chicken from Popeyes. My buddy driving paused and said ok but we&#039;re gonna have to drive to a different Popeyes because the one he typically goes to next to his house always gets his order incorrectly. Before I could chime in, another buddy from a 3rd, unrelated city interrupts and says &quot;wow what a coincidence, the popeyes near my house has never gotten my order correct, there&#039;s always eomthing that&#039;s fucked up.&quot; It was there that we all realized at the same time that it might not be location based; every single Popeyes from every corner of the country seems to be filled with incompetent chimps.<br><br>And after doing some cursory googling, it seems we&#039;re not alone.

A few years in dry conditions will just make sheng a bit less green and &quot;fresh&quot;, mellow out some of the bright floral notes of the white tea, and clear up some of the funk on shou or liu bao (probably the most useful scenario here for only aging 3 years). Starting out I would not buy tea solely to age but if you buy more tea than you drink there is nothing wrong with aging some of it. That&#039;s what I do at least.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leave them in the pantry</span><br>Just be careful about the conditions there. You want the tea to be somewhere where it will not pick up smells. A lot of western puerh drinkers just store their tea in ziplock bags or sealed containers. The best way to store tea for aging in the west is a more complex topic and is still somewhat a mater of debate.

Prep the vegetable you&#039;re fermenting. for cabbage you do this by peeling off the outer leaves, keeping them as whole as possible and setting them aside, then halving and coring the cabbage and thin slicing. <br>2. Weigh your vegetables, then add about 5% of that weight in salt. Mix and let it sit about 20 minutes. <br>3. Bruise the vegetables by smashing. There are special tools for this, but you can do it by hand if you have to. You need them to release tons of water. Let them rest a few times while you&#039;re doing this. <br>4. Put it in your crock. The veg should have released enough water to just about cover. If they didnt, you can add tap water with 5% salt by weight. <br>5. Keep everything underwater. With cabbage, you put the outer leaves on top, then a weight on the outer leaves. They keep the sliced kraut underwater. <br>Anything above the brine will mold and provide an avenue for mold to penetrate the kraut below. So scoop any floaters. <br>6. Close the lid, keep the airlock watered, and check back in 2-4 weeks.

I dont like the recap movies. I think the TV series is superior in sound and music and the ending of the recaps is kind of an anti climax with the changes they made to the scene where madoka talks to homura. But rebellion story is different. It&#039;s an all new soundtrack and its addictively good and completely underrated. I wish there was a falcom style remix of one for all in the soundtrack. <br><br>IT&#039;s impossible to talk about the content of the movie, but you probably heard things about its conclusion. I&#039;ll say that whatever your feelings on it, it doesn&#039;t feel warrented to say things are unsalvagably bad for fans of madoka. Madoka has constantly been someone who cares about homura and doesn&#039;t want her to suffer alone. I guess the best thing I can say about the movie if you have mixed feelings is it left things off between them in a state of equality. They have the capacity, if they chose, to have a serious conversation about their passive agressive struggle to martyr themselves for one another. But like Madoka 1-12 was a triumphant return of the powerful girl after cleansing herself of her own conciets, naiveties, and foolish ambitions, Rebellion story is about a counterattack to that. IT&#039;s literally the &quot;strikes back&quot; in japanese from star wars iirc. Homuras story and goal through the 12 episode anime was an abject failure. It needed to be so that madoka could shine brighter in the narrative. But are we really okay with madoka suffering the ultimate painful sacrifice if it means she gets to be free and strong? Is she? Is homura? Madoka the rebellion story is fundamentally the opposite of the narrative of 12, and the entire movie sets this up with a captivating worth watching on animation and painting grounds alone, toy like world. It&#039;s also amazing how, after dehuminizing and masculinizing herself in 12, homura recaptures her feminity in this film&#039;s theme", "time": 1672137353, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742650, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)08:45:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733875</a><br>are we pretending Russia doesn&#039;t exist until the war is over or whatever?", "time": 1672148744, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742807, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)10:27:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742088</a><br>retard", "time": 1672154868, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18742808, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)10:28:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742650</a><br>I&#039;ve never had russian food", "time": 1672154929, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743032, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18742808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18742808</a><br>I seriously doubt that", "time": 1672162406, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743049, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:44:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733908</a><br>Nihonese, but only if folded a 1000 times.<br><br>Phineas &amp; Ferb - Across the 2nd Dimension.", "time": 1672163048, "resto": 18733875}, {"no": 18743069, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)12:54:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18733875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18733875</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Best Cuisines</span><br>Based on what?

Usually, it&#039;s no problem and they are appreciative that their craft and labour has been enjoyed.<br><br>However, there was one experience that left me rather shaken and made me consider if I should ever do it again. I travel most days of the week for work. We set up alot of IT stuff for hospitals. One day I was travelling to somewhere in Kentucky. I was excited to go because 1.) I had never been and 2.) I was excited to try the local fare and learn more about what people ate there. We got in late and really didn&#039;t have time to eat anywhere particularly locale the first night, but after arriving to work the next day we were recommended to eat at a place called &quot;Randy&#039;s Kountry Kitchen&quot;. I was a little hesitant because the name sounded foreboding, but I trusted our advice and we headed out for lunch.<br><br>I normally eat alone as I tend to take my time, but this time I rode along with some new coworkers. We were seated in a what appeared to be a very rundown shack. There were flies everywhere and our checkered tablecloth was sticky. The waitress was very rude and just asked &quot;What y&#039;all want?&quot; I didn&#039;t have time to peruse the menu, which just happened to be a piece of printer paper listing their items so I informed her I would need a few minutes. My coworkers immediately started drinking. They just got burgers. I thought that was foolish and opted to get their special: A chicken fried steak with pepper gravy. I was floored. It was fried just right and the gravy was smooth and creamy. My coworkers at this point were beginning to get more and more inebriated, even though it was a lunch break and I began to wonder how we were going to get back. As, I stated I usually take my time with my food. My coworkers began to tease and berate my eating habits. One said &quot;I ate like a faggot&quot; to which I found very insulting.

Our waitress seemed confused, but went back to the kitchen anyways. While doing this, my coworkers left to use the bathroom. Several minutes later a morbidly obese man wearing a very dirty motorhead shirt lumbered over to my table and introduced himself as Randy. He asked me &quot;what was wrong with my food&quot;. I informed him that I wished to tell him the latter and that I found his meal to be delicious. The man seemed perplexed and just stared at me. I took of my cap, (I was wearing a baseball hat at the time) and tipped in his direction in a respectful manner as to say thank you. He immediately became furious. He asked if &quot;I was coming on to him&quot; and said that &quot;He doesn&#039;t allow any fucking queers in his Kountry Kitchen&quot;.
