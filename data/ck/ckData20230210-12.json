For both theanine and caffeine, I believe it&#039;s matcha since you ingest the whole leaf. It&#039;s difficult to measure because what you actually care about is how much your body absorbs when you drink it. The most L-theanine will be in young shoots harvested in the spring that are steamed. Sencha, gyokuro, and matcha are comparable in this case, puerh seems to have a lower l-theanine content, maybe because of the kill-green. Having said that, the differences are a fraction of the total amount of L-theanine present in the leaves, it doesn&#039;t really matter. Having said THAT, we don&#039;t actually even care, because how much L-theanine is present in the leaves doesn&#039;t really tell us anything.

Another possibility is that the water temperature may be too high which causes more efficient extraction of bitter compounds in coffee.

If acidity and bitterness are both balanced and there&#039;s a pleasant almost sweet taste from the espresso then you&#039;re right where you want to be. A general rule of thumb is to get your desired amount of coffee out in approximately 30s, which is a surprisingly long time if you&#039;re not used to it. If you want 2:1 (30g espresso out for 15g of coffee in) you may need to grind quite fine. If you find your shots are running quick, then you may need to settle for luongo shots at a 3 or 4:1 ratio until you can dial in your grind for more conventional 1.5-2.5 espresso ratios. <br><br>Temperature defects are tough to deal with because typically only really high-end machines will have custom temperature settings. Hoffman says that temp defects are typically not that severe compared to extraction defects so grind size and its effect on shot timing are more important. <br><br>Another factor a lot of lower-end machines run into is channeling because the pumps run at too high of pressure. You end up with underextracted and overextracted areas which creates the worst of both worlds. Adding a puck screen in forces even flow over the puck and if your machine is modifiable with an lower-pressure OPV spring (9 bar is considered standard) then I would recommend making that modification because it&#039;s easy and cheap to do. My Gaggia runs at 15 bar stock which is way too high, the 9 bar spring will set that as the new upper limit.", "time": 1675857056, "resto": 18904783}, {"no": 18913638, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18913624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18913624</a><br>thas a lot of words bro", "time": 1675857322, "resto": 18904783}, {"no": 18913652, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:59:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18913624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18913624</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No guarantees this will solve your issue but a broad rule of thumb is that harsh bitter flavors are from overextraction and harsh acidity is from underextraction.
