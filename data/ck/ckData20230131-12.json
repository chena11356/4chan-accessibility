His father, Sam Born, was a Russian immigrant who had founded Just Born Inc., a small candy company, in 1923. The family later moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where Just Born is still based. Bob Born graduated from Lehigh University with a degree in engineering physics. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as a radar specialist and a lieutenant on a destroyer in the Pacific. Later, the Navy sent him to the University of Arizona and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for graduate work in math and physics.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Born applied to medical school and was accepted, but while he was waiting for his classes to begin, he went to work at Just Born. He fell in love with the candy business and decided to stay. In 1953, Just Born acquired Rodda Candy Co., a jelly bean maker that had a side business producing shaped marshmallow candies by hand. At the time, it took about 27 hours to make the marshmallows. Bob Born saw the candies&#039; potential, so he and an engineer at the company designed and built a machine to make them in less than six minutes. The company still uses a version of that machine.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seventy years later, Peeps remain Just Born&#039;s most recognizable candy brand, the company says. Just Born makes around 2 billion Peeps each year, or enough to circle the globe twice. It sells the most at Easter, but also has versions sold for Halloween, Valentine&#039;s Day and other holidays. Bob Born also came up with the recipe for another popular Just Born candy, Hot Tamales. Just Born also makes Mike and Ike fruit chews and Goldenberg&#039;s Peanut Chews.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bob Born became Just Born&#039;s president in 1959 and held the role for more than 30 years. He spent most of his retirement in Florida, where he led a literacy program and enjoyed hobbies including photography. He was active until a few months before he died, when he had a difficult recovery after a hard fall.</span>", "filename": "T5TWQIUOYNBMTHYBDPNEZVMDCU", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1084, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 132, "tim": 1675159537039672, "time": 1675159537, "md5": "zIr0G3stm0JjooA8mjpTWw==", "fsize": 746426, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "father-of-peeps-dead-at-98", "replies": 8, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 18879941, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:16:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Team Mini here to pay respects<br>F", "filename": "6A666D9D-EB43-4B2C-9CA0-CE0B86108C42", "ext": ".png", "w": 695, "h": 900, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675160199764034, "time": 1675160199, "md5": "MC0Pi3Zl/FvBenc7c6WuNg==", "fsize": 865224, "resto": 18879930}, {"no": 18879948, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:23:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;i was working in this factory and noticed that there was some corn syrup and sugar that wasn&#039;t making it back into the mix, so I said, &quot;hey, why don&#039;t we add some gelatin and put it back through the oozer and then we could cover it with more sugar?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*here he is 70 years later, contemplating how one little idea he had as a kid made him responsible for one of the worst confectionaries in existence</span><br>You could literally replace the peep painting with a picture of Auschwitz and nothing would be lost.", "filename": "1645027067596", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675160589789184, "time": 1675160589, "md5": "mLvTovCqohz3zg22mg+3TQ==", "fsize": 39547, "resto": 18879930}, {"no": 18879967, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:43:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why do people keep buying candy that nobody likes?

However, I have cohabitated with Nigerians briefly, and they seem to like really greasy food that is on the spicy side. They also love cooking with palm oil. Their favourite dishes are a cassava-based mash (fufu) and they eat a lot of meat, mostly beef. Jollof is a big hit there, but everyone knows this already. They also love pastry.<br>East Africa&#039;s food, specifically Kenya&#039;s, is very legume, leaf vegetable and cereal-heavy. We drink a lot of tea. We also drink a lot of beer. We have really good beer. We eat a lot of beef.<br>Fish is popular in the Lake Victoria and Indian Ocean regions, but I wouldn&#039;t call it a staple. We don&#039;t drink coffee even though we are famous for our coffee exports. Chicken is a delicacy, but it&#039;s too expensive, so it&#039;s a red-letter day kind of food.<br>Our staple food is definitely maize. The most popular form of maize is what you would call gritz, or polenta that&#039;s very firm. We call it ugali. All of east africa loves it, and even Zambians, South Africans have it regularly. It&#039;s basically our form of fufu. <br>The Indian ocean coast has very middle-eastern/mediterranean-influe<wbr>nced cuisine, and Tanzania is very similar to our coast in cultural and culinary influence. Parts of Uganda are very similar to our Lake Victorian coast, and their staple food is bananas. <br>We eat pork, but mostly in form of sausage. Raw pork isn&#039;t a hot grocery item here. We don&#039;t eat bush meat, that&#039;s an American savage peculiarity, except if an occassional elephant or hippo decides to fuck with and/or kill people, then bush meat is what&#039;s for supper.<br>We have multiple KFC outlets in every major city, a few McD&#039;s, countless pizza parlours and several Burger Kings. These are very popular with younger people (up to 35 years) but most people can&#039;t afford to eat at these places everyday.

Depending on your preference, you can do a fairly long hard rinse, boiling water for 30s or more depending on how dense your buds are, or you can do a short rinse, 5-10s at with boiling water, then a long brew, say 30s with boiling water. Once the leaves seem soaked through, they&#039;ll noticeably extract much faster. Do 10-15s brews here, if your tea is pleasant but thin, use more leaf, I brew with a very high ratio of leaf to water for baihao yinzhen. If it starts to be astringent or develop off flavors, you can do your main brews at around 90C instead.

You will need a huge walk in fridge with rails and hooks to hang your meat and cure it before cutting.

Most farmers haven&#039;t figured out to have an internet presence, so taking a drive around the country-side or visiting local or regional farmer&#039;s markets is also an option. I lucked out and was able to join a private association to buy grass-fed beef and raw milk directly from a local farmer. We purchased half a cow that I split with my family, it worked out to be around $3.50/lb hanging weight after the processing fee for the butcher. Don&#039;t butcher it yourself, you&#039;d probably have to pick up the cow from the farm with a trailer and kill it yourself if you really wanted to do that. At that point you might as well just buy a calf and raise it yourself in your back yard or indoors. The beef we&#039;ve gotten locally is superior to anything in the grocery store. The flavor is out of this world, very buttery and earthy. My only complaint is that the cuts are fairly small compared to the grocery store, but it&#039;s still cheaper per lb buying wholesale cow. Maybe the size of the cuts were bc of how I told the butcher to process it, or because the breed they raise are smaller than other cattle, or because they don&#039;t raise them as long before they slaughter them. I don&#039;t really mind eating smaller cuts, but that&#039;s the biggest complaint I have for my local farmer. Also in general, local meat will always come frozen, even at the farmer&#039;s market, it&#039;s really not that big of a deal. If you&#039;re buying from farmer&#039;s market retail, then you&#039;ll pay more than the grocery store. We also got a quarter pig last year, worth it 100%. Deep freezer is necessary. Again, don&#039;t butcher it yourself plz.

There have been many stories of local farmers sending their high quality cows to a butcher and getting shit meat back, different animal received than the one sent in. Also buying via a private association means that the meat is not for sale to the public, and most likely, it is not USDA inspected, so there are looser restrictions on where they can process the meat. My local farmer has an open door/farm 24/7/365 policy where you&#039;re welcome to visit anytime as a club member and inspect for yourself what is going on at the farm, state and federal agents are not welcome since it is a private club. Being a private association, they are not allowed to sell to the public at farmer&#039;s markets. It saves on costs on public regulation which they pass on to the club members, and it has allowed them to stay in business and not go under as a local family farm. I&#039;ve been a member for almost 3 years and have always been satisfied with their quality, their chickens are better than any other farmer or grocery store in the region. They have raw milk butter that I don&#039;t really care for since it&#039;s very grassy and I don&#039;t like that flavor in my butter, but if you like Irish butter you&#039;d probably love it.

Why is that important? Let&#039;s take one of the most used purposes for cast iron, pan seared steak. In pan searing a steak, surface temperature is critical to making a good sear. Once the steak is placed on the pan, the temperature will drop momentarily as the two surfaces work their way into equalizing their temperatures. A good sear requires maintaining as close temperature of the Maillard Reaction as possible, which is roughly around 357*F but requires a surface temperature greater than that since the steak is colder as both surfaces fight to equalize their temperatures. A cast iron skillet with more thermal mass than a stainless steel skillet will resist that temperature gradient longer than a stainless skillet because stainless steel is both less massive as well as less conductive.<br><br>With all that said however, I&#039;m a stainless steel guy simply because itjustwerks\u2122", "time": 1675039690, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874333, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18871964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18871964</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tomato sauce or dahl or anything with wine</span><br>just cook that shit in a stainless steel pan or dutch oven, jesus christ", "time": 1675039713, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874334, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18871634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18871634</a><br>Its fitting too, because it doesnt take any more effort but retards who havent touched them think its hard.", "time": 1675039726, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874338, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:49:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does cast iron on an electric stove even work?

We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u201d to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u2019s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u2019s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u2019t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)", "filename": "th-1530947230", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1675048587538304, "time": 1675048587, "md5": "ZwxwSxR6KJEuUWEyJjMAjA==", "fsize": 18079, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874891, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18870257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18870257</a><br>I eat shrimps and prawns whole, with shell, tail and head", "time": 1675048842, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874893, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874891</a><br>Do you enjoy the gritty poops?", "time": 1675048875, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874899, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874893</a><br>i like it when the poops tickly my bunghole on the way out<br><br>usually from eating too much popcorn", "time": 1675048960, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874923, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:33:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874899</a><br>No, the shrimpies poopers.

That&#039;s why northern countries historically have wet-cured pork through brining to make it into bacon, English ham etc., which is also more economical in that the process might take a week instead of a year minimum. This is why countries that dry-cure ham typically only use small slices of it and the reason that it costs a lot more than bacon.
