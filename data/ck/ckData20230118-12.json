Which was alright at the beginning but I began getting health problems after a couple of years, got fat and did get good sleep. I felt burned out and worked towards the evening beers. I stopped when I drove to the store with my gf and she told me I smell like a fucking alcoholic. It was really hard the first days and weeks to not drink anything but I kept going through and now I have the occasional beer at some events on weekends. I feel much better and lost a lot of weight.

The economics are just very strange. For example, many young people looking to further their academic careers but failed to get into a paid PhD program would be willing, if able, to do research unpaid, or even pay for another year of education in the interim before applying again. And yet those hyper-competitive PhD programs still pay salaries (in some form) to their students. However, less-competitive programs do not seem to try to compete with other programs for better students by offering higher salaries, as would be expected in a competitive marketplace, even if they receive a windfall of funding. Part of it&#039;s a very intense social psychology for sure -- money is not really supposed to be a motivator -- but at the same time you obviously don&#039;t want to shut out, or force extra work upon, those who can&#039;t simply live on a parental stipend.<br><br>This world of top-tier restaurant internships, and many other classy internships, in theory seems like it should work with at least a somewhat similar mindset -- at least at a certain point the interns should be intrinsically qualified and valuable enough to be paid and competed over, else why have interns in the first place?<br><br>It kind of reminds me of that famous 19th-century economist&#039;s prediction that the most menial worker&#039;s wages would always fall to the bare minimum needed to sustain life.

When I was growing up, they would drink shitty pre-ground Yuban or whatever they&#039;d buy in bulk at Costco. About fifteen years ago, I got a part time at Starbucks, and got them a free bag of a coffee they sell called Casi Cielo, a seasonal Guatemalan coffee they sell, and probably the best whole bean coffee Starbucks carries. They fell in love with it, and asked me to hoard my free bags of coffee and ship it to them, instead of flipping it on eBay as I usually did. I haven&#039;t worked at Starbucks in about a decade, but my dad will still go to the local stores and buy up their entire supply whenever it&#039;s available, and now it&#039;s all they drink and told me they can&#039;t really stand the shitty pre-ground supermarket stuff.

By far my favorite method is spatchcocking and roasting in a cast iron or large roasting pan for a large chicken. You cut out the backbone and flatten the bird before roasting. Here&#039;s a chef john video showing the technique https://youtu.be/37UB_7q9c7M<br>That recipe is good, I&#039;ve made it a few times. But if you want something simpler and more traditional you can&#039;t go wrong with a butter and herb compound butter. Mix a stick of butter with minced garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and lemon zest. Rub half under the chicken skin and the rest all over the exterior before roasting.<br>Also, don&#039;t roast the chicken in a very shallow pan and definitely don&#039;t use a rimless sheet pan. A lot of fat and juices will render out and you don&#039;t want them leaking.<br>I typically throw in a bunch of potatoes and carrots to fill the void space in my roasting pan. You don&#039;t want it too crowded, but they&#039;ll taste great having been cooked in chicken fat for an hour.<br>When it&#039;s done, remove the bird and rest it a few minutes.

I get good results starting with high heat, 425 F, for the first 15-20 minutes depending on bird size to crisp the skin, then drop down to 375 for 45-55 minutes or until temp hits if I have a thermometer in the thigh.

Americans on average only eat incredibly low quality vegetables and protein since they were kids; they haven&#039;t built an expectation for what good ingredients taste like. The chlorinated chicken, the refrigerated eggs, the GMO vegetables, they all compromise flavor for something else.<br><br>It&#039;s the reason why Americans interested in gastronomy are genuinely surprised when they do travel abroad and eat simple food and it tastes great. In these other cultures, when we make a simple dish we expect it to be tasty like our good memories of it, and we get pissed of when the courgette, carrot, tomato, sea bream, shrimp, turkey leg, etc is of poor quality. For americans, that&#039;s the norm. That&#039;s why Americans regularly cite eating some extremely simple yet tasty dish X at country Y as a life changing experience. American society sacrificed love and respect for food as a cultural phenomenon in lieu of abundance and excess availability. Obviously a few americans are against that and try to go down the other path, but I imagine it&#039;s almost impossible to become accustomed to something that just isn&#039;t as easily available (quality ingredients).<br><br>continued below", "time": 1673997357, "resto": 18810740}, {"no": 18823871, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:18:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18823856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18823856</a><br>continued<br><br>For example, in my country of Portugal I can buy fresh Iberico pig meat for 13\u20ac/kg.

For example, my favorite meal is fresh fish grilled on charcoal with salt, olive oil and garlic. Put a wild sea bass on the charcoal grill and its fat is so naturally delicious that you will slobber yourself if it&#039;s cooked to the right temperature. I love fancy meals wit technique, but in terms of pure deliciousness, the great ingredients are already 90% as they will ever be when cooked in simple ways.

The sauce seemed to be making you want to stir well, which is nice to have included, but no way I could believe that something that so obviously is the real deal in any other bakery. Instead, I used a homemade butter sauce which actually tastes better (after I cooked it in a pre-drying pan for an hour before I added more of the ingredients to it) and that adds a beautiful texture to the cake. It&#039;s one of those cake cakes, and I&#039;m super super thankful for it. But seriously, who doesn&#039;t love something delicious and decadent?! It&#039;s so sweet!!

It&#039;s about the way in which you dislike them. Every adult with anything resembling a developed palate is going to have preferences, but having preferences doesn&#039;t make you a picky eater. It only takes a single food/ingredient to make someone a picky eater, and you know they&#039;re a picky eater because they absolutely will not give that ingredient a chance no matter what it&#039;s in or how it&#039;s prepared. And usually it&#039;s a very common ingredient (onions, tomatoes, pickles, olives, seafood of any kind, celery, licorice/anise, mushrooms, etc.). These people could go to one of the best restaurants around, or just have someone they trust cook a meal for them, but if they see that there&#039;s olives or tomatoes involved they will obstinately refuse to even give it a chance, and if you force them to try one bite they will pretend like they&#039;re going to vomit because they have some deep set psychological issues stemming from one bad experience in their childhood and are unwilling to grow up. Often times this is the result of poverty and ignorance; I honestly can&#039;t think of a single food that I didn&#039;t enjoy at first but would never try again. There were a bunch of foods I didn&#039;t like as a kid, but then I had them prepared in a different way and realized they&#039;re some of my favorite things (salmon, goat cheese, zucchini come to mind).

Salisbury suspected diet was the greatest culprit, and came up with his own solution.<br><br>He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.<br><br>The Salisbury steak, his means of achieving this goal, is ground beef flavored with onion and seasoning and then deep-fried or boiled and covered with gravy or brown sauce. It was introduced in 1888. Salisbury saw beef as an excellent defense against many different physical problems. He suggested that Salisbury steak should be eaten three times a day, with much hot water to cleanse the digestive system. He was an early American proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss, and he promoted his diet for that purpose.

Fucked you over, and made you clean it like a useless bitch. You don&#039;t even fucking like oatmeal. Piece of shit, you&#039;ve been repeating those three words your whole life, haven&#039;t you. Yeah, how was work after that piece of shit fucked you over? I bet it was on your mind the whole day, you probably didn&#039;t say shit to nobody. Can&#039;t be telling people about your mistakes. How your little fix yourself plan, failed you. Don&#039;t want people to start thinking you&#039;re the failure. You&#039;re the piece of shit, all along. You don&#039;t want that do you? You don&#039;t want to be the piece of shit everybody secretly whispers about, do you? Was your father a piece of shit like you? I bet he never had a slow cooker. He had a woman, a house, a damn good job. I bet it&#039;s slow cooking you the fuck alive, isn&#039;t it. Comparing yourself to him.

Tri tip is another nice grilling steak, cheap and full of fat and you get a nice spectrum where one side is thick and the other is thin so you can keep one side on the hot spot of the grill and cook the other side on a more mild spot and it wont be as uneven as a ribeye for example. tri tips also marinate really nice, i like doing stuff like pineapple pulp or newmans salad dressing.
