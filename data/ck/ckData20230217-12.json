The tea probably isn&#039;t worth it, ive had good longjing style teas that were 16\u00a2 per gram or so. The main reason it&#039;s so expensive is that it is a very popular and prestigious gift that is valued highly in Chinese gifting culture where they consider the high price to be a positive thing to show how valuable their gift is. Unfortunately lots of the very high end of Chinese teas are subject to this gifting culture price inflation so the prices won&#039;t necessarily reflect their value as a tea drinking experience. There are also some teas like silver needle white tea where the grading and value is based totally on the appearance and size of the buds and the actual taste of the tea falls fairly low on the the list of qualities the tea is priced and judged for. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to have a decent understanding of Chinese teas before you start throwing money around in the upper price categories of tea.

So no, it doesn&#039;t really make sense.</span><br>On the Lodge website, the 12&quot; is $30, and the 13.25&quot; is $50. Their most common model is the $10.25&quot;, which is regularly $24 and currently marked down to $20. One of the reasons cast iron, in general, is not popular is due to the weight. We can see that the 12&quot;, at 7.89 lbs, is 47% heavier than the 10.25&quot; (5.35 lbs), and the 13.25&quot;, at 10.5 lbs, is 100% heavier than the 10.25&quot; skillet. So based on weight, there is TWICE the iron in the 13.25 inch skillet as in the 10.25 inch skillet--you might have had some inkling of this if you understood the difference between diameter and area of a circle.<br><br>Based on material alone, the regular price of the 10.25&quot; being half of the 13.25&quot; makes sense. However, you&#039;d be stupid if you thought that was the only factor. Because the 10.25&quot; is more popular, more stores are going to order them reliably. Lodge can make more of them, without worrying if they will sell and receive a return on their investment. It&#039;s the one model that they know they won&#039;t have leftover stock at the end of the year; therefore, they can afford to sell them with thinner margins. Hence the $20 price right now. <br><br>So basically, you&#039;re a complete idiot and you should feel bad about it.", "time": 1676396120, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937733, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:36:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937683</a><br>Mental illness.", "time": 1676396181, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937786, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937726</a><br>k", "time": 1676396867, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937793, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:49:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*I was wrong.

My point is that for my own mixing currently I have two go-to gins: Gordon&#039;s and New Amsterdam (contemp, not their vile London dry), the cheapest stuff out there for totally smooth juniper-forward and citrus-forward-no-juniper. (Kirkland and Bombay Classic are also nice juniper-forward at a similar price). I have some nicer gins -- an import bottle and a lot of nips -- that I keep around when I want to experiment with martinis or new bitters (for pink gin), but for right now, as someone still relatively new to all this, I&#039;m recommending people who are ok with the juniper-forward taste to just do mixing with Gordon&#039;s and NA (or instead of the latter any contemporary you can find at a steal deal -- NA is rather pathetic as a &quot;gin&quot;, but it certainly is a better sub in any vodka cocktail).", "time": 1676568267, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18944835, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)12:27:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18935939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18935939</a><br>Fucking based.", "time": 1676568421, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18944848, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)12:31:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18935434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18935434</a><br>1 ounce blue curacao<br>1 ounce triple sec<br>1/2 ounce lemon juice<br>1/2 ounce lime juice<br>6 ounce tonic water<br>serve with ice in a cold glass", "time": 1676568686, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18944904, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)13:08:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937777</a><br>c&#039;mon now sometimes you can have a long island", "time": 1676570893, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18944923, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)13:25:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18943189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18943189</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is something truly, magically stress relieving about them</span><br>it&#039;s all the botanicals that get distilled in, both in the amaro and the vermouth. same reason why mint schnapps will fuck you up on a completely different level from normal liquor, peppermint tincture is some hardcore shit", "time": 1676571915, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18944929, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)13:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18944671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18944671</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kalimotxo</span><br>yeah I was pleasantly surprised by how good these tasted, I was expecting another garbage meme like ranch water but they&#039;re actually nice<br>You look like a psychopath when you make them though if people aren&#039;t familiar with the drink", "time": 1676572096, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18945018, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)13:58:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18935434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18935434</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Godfather, 2 parts bourbon, 1 part amaretto, big ice cube, you can also make it Canadian by replacing all or half of the amaretto with maple syrup, strong, sweet, delicious </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The aspirin, 2 parts bourbon, 1 part honey, fill the glass with ginger beer, mix bourbon and honey well before adding the ginger beer, trust me this will help any cold, or any other occasion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pisco sour, 4-5 cl pisco, 3cl simple syrup, 1 lime fresh squeezed, 1 egg white, add everything to a shaker, shake for 1 minute, add ice, shake thirty seconds, strain, add some angostura bitters on top, aloooot of angostura bitters if you are me, replace pisco with whiskey for a whiskey sour</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Santa&#039;s smashed, half a glass of apple cinnamon wine, 3cl vodka, top off with sprite, this is an incredibly sweet yet delicious concoction that will get you drunk off your ass, the apple cinnamon wine i buy is usually 9% abv, combined with the shot of vodka and the fact that it tastes like a god-damned apple pie, you will get tipsy, and you will get so fast, perfect for welcome drinks since it&#039;s not very common and easy to make</span>", "time": 1676573929, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18945041, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)14:06:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18945018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18945018</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you can also make it Canadian</span>", "filename": "chad disgust", "ext": ".png", "w": 287, "h": 290, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676574407780058, "time": 1676574407, "md5": "iHBGibaR2VGVp0BhKmz5Fg==", "fsize": 85072, "resto": 18935434}, {"no": 18945050, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)14:11:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18945041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18945041</a><br>Sorry aboot that!
