The youtuber idiot &quot;the cowboy kent rollins&quot; or whatever the fuck he goes by is a perfect example of this kind of shill. He has videos where he takes a supposedly new pan and cooks bacon in it, then claiming that it didn&#039;t stick, even once. <br><br>Here&#039;s what happens to a new cast iron pan when you cook three slices of bacon in it. Each slice of bacon literally stripped the seasoning off the pan in the shape of each bacon slice. <br><br>That said, <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything sticks even when copious amounts of oil/butter/etc are applied</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have to &quot;season&quot; it after every single use or it will shit the bed and die</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not allowed to wash it</span><br>I have other pans that are so well seasoned that I *can* cook bacon on them without any sticking or seasoning loss. However, when you get a new one, it can be a challenge to get to that point--and, once you get to that point, it&#039;s also possible to thin the seasoning so much in cooking with proteins that food sticks again. The key is, ironically, to actually wash the pan really well after cooking. Scrape off all the food, and use a chain mail rag if you need to, and cook in oil, at a very high heat, as much as possible during this time.

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea.

Puerh is probably more or less the fancy stuff with the teapots designed around it and the culture of gifting it to your boss and such. But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either). Oolong is somewhat fancy, given as gifts and growers have some pride in it, takes some technical skill to manufacture consistently.

I personally prefer grapes, which are like raisins, but with the water included. Trust me, the water makes it better. <br><br>However, I draw the line with mixing raisins into other food. How did the idea even arise? What depths of depravity were reached in this concept generation? Could a concept so evil even spawn from the abyss of perverted evil we simply call the nature of man? I do not know the answers to these questions, but I do know mixing raisins with other food is evil.

Their atlantis 7 series has the most even heating bottoms due to having the thickest bottom cladding of all cookware, but no rim to rim cladding. The problem, as with a lot of cookware, is their handle ergonomics kind of suck. The part of the handle closest to the pan is the thinnest, which makes it uncomfortable when you inevitably choke up on the handle to counteract the leverage on your wrist. Currently, the best overall cookware in my humble opinion is the Hestan Thomas Keller cookware. Their handles are by far the best out of all the clad cookwares, wide and thick where it counts. Their rim to rim cladding is a bit thicker than all-clad&#039;s, but not as thick as demeyere. But the rims are sealed so there no chance of the cladding separating over time.

Unfortunately, I cannot order from them anymore (customs issues), and getting tobacco shipped from a continental online shop is an exercise in frustration and/or extreme patience. <br><br>I haven&#039;t tried many of their tinned snuffs, but I really liked Ozona President (which they apparently do not produce anymore, for some reason). Lowenprise is too cloying for my taste (too much anise). Gletscher Prise used to be good, but I think they changed the recipe, for the worse, a few years ago. Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess. However, Poschl schmalzlers are packed in sachets, and they tend to lose aroma if stored too long before use. You might occasionally get a dud. This is different from something like Bernard&#039;s Gekachelter Virginie, which is super harsh, very strong manure smell right out of the box, and actually benefits from air exposure to mellow out.", "time": 1670704331, "resto": 18673985}, {"no": 18680925, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:01:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18673985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18673985</a><br>why the fuck do people recommend nightcap so often it tastes like straight hose shit. morning pipe is way better", "time": 1670706091, "resto": 18673985}, {"no": 18680938, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:07:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18680925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18680925</a><br>Tbh I haven\u2019t had a Peterson blend that has wowed me.", "time": 1670706423, "resto": 18673985}, {"no": 18681190, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)17:09:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18678280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18678280</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;None but the Piper keeps up with the Dancer&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shitty clip art flames</span><br>KINO.

My first venture to the Honeybaked Ham store was on 12/15/2022. <br>I had a coupon and thought I would give them a try. I went in the store and a very nice employee, Megan, asked if she could help me. I showed her my coupon and said this was my first time there. I asked for suggestions and she said she liked the roasted turkey sandwich. Since ham is right in the name, I said I think I would try their classic ham sandwich with a side of Bacon Broccolli. I didn&#039;t take a picture of the items, as I forgot and I was hungry. The classic ham sandwich came on a croissant and it was very, very good. The Bacon Broccolli was also very good.<br>On my receipt there was a survey. If I completed the survey I would get a code for a bogo sandwich. So of course I did the survey. Then today I went back to the store. Megan was there, as was the owner. I decided to try the turkey and got 2 of the roasted turkey sandwiches. One for me and one for my hubby. These came on a long roll and were just as good as the ham sandwich I had the day before.<br>The owner rang me up but didn&#039;t know how to enter my phone number so I would receive \u201cpiggy points\u201d for my purchase. Megan came over and showed him how to do it. I said to him \u201cYou&#039;re the owner and you don&#039;t know how to do that?\u201d To which he responded he&#039;s usually in the back and that the program was new. I asked if Megan was going to make my sandwiches and he joked about me not trusting his sandwich-making abilities. I said, well you didn&#039;t know how to give me points. He said yes, Megan would be making my sandwiches. I liked that he could take a joke.<br>If you are looking for a great ham or turkey sandwich, I suggest giving Honeybaked Ham a try.

I went in the store and a very nice employee, Megan, asked if she could help me. I showed her my coupon and said this was my first time there. I asked for suggestions and she said she liked the roasted turkey sandwich. Since ham is right in the name, I said I think I would try their classic ham sandwich with a side of Bacon Broccolli. I didn&#039;t take a picture of the items, as I forgot and I was hungry. The classic ham sandwich came on a croissant and it was very, very good. The Bacon Broccolli was also very good.<br>On my receipt there was a survey. If I completed the survey I would get a code for a bogo sandwich. So of course I did the survey. Then today I went back to the store. Megan was there, as was the owner. I decided to try the turkey and got 2 of the roasted turkey sandwiches. One for me and one for my hubby. These came on a long roll and were just as good as the ham sandwich I had the day before.<br>The owner rang me up but didn&#039;t know how to enter my phone number so I would receive \u201cpiggy points\u201d for my purchase. Megan came over and showed him how to do it. I said to him \u201cYou&#039;re the owner and you don&#039;t know how to do that?\u201d To which he responded he&#039;s usually in the back and that the program was new. I asked if Megan was going to make my sandwiches and he joked about me not trusting his sandwich-making abilities. I said, well you didn&#039;t know how to give me points. He said yes, Megan would be making my sandwiches. I liked that he could take a joke.<br>If you are looking for a great ham or turkey sandwich, I suggest giving Honeybaked Ham a try. I know I will be going back there again!!", "time": 1671222924, "resto": 18703984}, {"no": 18705359, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:36:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "R A D U L A", "filename": "Gotta go fast", "ext": ".webm", "w": 460, "h": 460, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671222980877936, "time": 1671222980, "md5": "cTsv2fzg9fSY4NsABGdoUA==", "fsize": 1530686, "resto": 18703984}, {"no": 18705363, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:36:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18704503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18704503</a><br>feelsgoodman", "filename": "sinfuld", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 355, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1671223003231227, "time": 1671223003, "md5": "vjneBSTBeohsfs1QR6h2Sw==", "fsize": 2094788, "resto": 18703984}, {"no": 18705374, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:39:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18705192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18705192</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

The website says &quot;stabilised cream&quot; so I tried both chantilly cream and just normal whipped cream, both whipped to stiff peaks. I also tried diplomat cream. none of those three options were the same as the tesco filling, and from my vague memory of them (I&#039;m an expat), they weren&#039;t even close at all. <br>Do any of you have any ideas how to make &quot;stabilised cream&quot; at home that actually tastes like the stuff from tesco? <br>2. Should Choux pastry be difficult to pipe? Whenever I pipe them I really struggle. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because I could have been adding more egg (I sometimes feel like it might need just a tiny bit more egg but don&#039;t add any as I&#039;m worried I&#039;ll fuck it up, and it forms a V from my spatula so in theory it should be fine), or if my arm strength is really just that terrible. Or is it simply meant to be difficult to pipe for everyone and takes some getting used to?<br>3. Most eclair recipes online recommend a french star tip for piping them, because the ridges will create a more even rise, and warn that using an open circular nozzle will cause lots of cracks. Is this actually true? I don&#039;t particularly like the way they turn out with the french star tip and the ones from tesco definitely weren&#039;t piped like that.
