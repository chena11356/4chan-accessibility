However, for a couple of reasons I\u2019d recommend stretching to a dual-walled, stainless-steel version if your budget allows. Primarily, I recommend these because they\u2019re unbreakable and glass most definitely is not. More expensive glass options generally have better and stronger glass, but a stainless-steel version will last a lifetime. Secondly, for those with a concern about the loss in temperature with a longer brew time, like the one I recommend, a dual-walled, stainless-steel press will retain the heat much better than glass.<br><br>Some people do say they can taste something \u2018off\u2019 or metallic with stainless-steel brewers, but in blind testing I\u2019ve never been able to detect any difference. However, it is possible some people have a particular sensitivity that I do not.<br><br>Maintenance: Soap and water should be used after every brew. If for any reason you start to get a brown patina building up on the brewer, then dissolve about 1 tablespoon (10g) of espresso-machine cleaner (I use Cafiza, but other brands also work well) per litre of very hot water and soak for a few hours before rinsing thoroughly.", "filename": "PXL_20230103_182701707", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1409, "h": 1878, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672770638269458, "time": 1672770638, "md5": "8nemhBDj6Ve54b5WpdyVHQ==", "fsize": 898736, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767029, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:34:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767022</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THIS HOW YOU DO THINGS BOOK TOLD ME SO</span><br>kys", "time": 1672770855, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767033, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:34:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18766205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18766205</a><br>I have no idea how to and probably will be too much work<br><a href=\"#p18766554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18766554</a><br>We came from such a dark age.", "time": 1672770878, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767037, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:35:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18766995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18766995</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;french press</span><br>oh i thought you meant aeropress. <br>well in this case AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHAHAHAAHA", "time": 1672770930, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767044, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:36:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767029</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THIS HOW YOU DO THINGS BOOK TOLD ME SO</span><br>guess you failed 3rd grade then.", "time": 1672770991, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767046, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:37:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767029</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My coffee tastes bad when I follow instructions</span>", "filename": "nsplash", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 657, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672771023727146, "time": 1672771023, "md5": "yeyVbeI+kgQUBAUGHN5tLg==", "fsize": 254253, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767062, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:42:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767044</a><br><a href=\"#p18767046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767046</a><br>let me guess, vaxxed?", "time": 1672771327, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767085, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:52:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How does Jimmy brew his coffee?", "time": 1672771942, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767089, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767085</a>", "filename": "180d6a4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 466, "h": 687, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672772036932907, "time": 1672772036, "md5": "aeXo3n5wNLLcGVcSdjsRog==", "fsize": 159551, "resto": 18764555}, {"no": 18767097, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)13:56:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18767062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18767062</a><br>Fuck no.

So eat that big meal, bed, wake up you&#039;re gonna want water like nothing else at 200 pounds 6 foot I drink about 1/3 of the gallon immediately upon waking.

Best I&#039;ve been to was probably Tooth and Nail Brewing in Ottawa. The waitress also wasn&#039;t wearing a bra and there was a nice bakery across the road. <br>In Quebec, Frontibus and Naufrager in Gaspesie both make some great beers. Fin du Monde also comes in tallboys in Quebec and you can buy them for 4$ at grocery stores. Probably my favourite beer province not so much for going to breweries but almost all the beer is good and you can buy it anywhere.<br> Only been to one brewery in New Brunswick, Four Rivers in Bathurst. It was okay but nothing special, which is kind of the impression I&#039;ve gotten of most NB beers.<br>Only been to PEI Brewing on PEI. Nothing special.<br>In Nova Scotia, the best brewery I went to was 2 Crows in Halifax, but I think most of the beer I had from Halifax breweries was pretty good. Schoolhouse Brewery in Windsor was pretty good too.<br>All the breweries I&#039;ve visited in Alberta have been kind of eh, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good one out there. I had a rye beer from Medicine Hat Brewing which was alright.<br>In the Yukon, Winterlong is probably the most consistently good but Woodcutters Blanket has made some okay beers and Polarity does some good ones too. Yukon Brewing has been on a downward trend in quality the last three years.<br>Haven&#039;t had any beer from NWT, Nunavut or Newfoundland.<br>Another of my favourite breweries in BC is Backroads Brewing in Nelson. Also like Category 12 in Saanichton and Driftwood in Victoria (pic related is one of my all time favourite beers).", "filename": "c32526a32c93ddfd491480fa150f5859_640x640", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672296026531872, "time": 1672296026, "md5": "3JB1ph0MvTNv714JYWHRYA==", "fsize": 63006, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748515, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hd", "ext": ".png", "w": 664, "h": 553, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672296346284323, "time": 1672296346, "md5": "ASw8DXmRc9d6fDF8vxMEfA==", "fsize": 528160, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748563, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:14:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748038</a><br>Look for a tripel or quadrupel, it&#039;s like drinking wine", "time": 1672298073, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748622, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748016</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;italian beer: atrocious</span><br>What about Italian Trappist monk beer? <br>https://www.belgianstyleales.com/pr<wbr>oduct/tre-fontane-tripel-italian-tr<wbr>appist-11oz/shop-belgian-beers-sort<wbr>ed-by-name", "filename": "D3AAB938-D81A-4260-AE03-DE7BD1C54AB0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672300358723805, "time": 1672300358, "md5": "eu1KzmqlQAVQ/UjtDRvRZw==", "fsize": 62668, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748645, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18744904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18744904</a><br><a href=\"#p18746235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18746235</a><br><a href=\"#p18748216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748216</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orval </span><br>I wish I could find it", "filename": "F35E077A-A105-4BD6-B619-970C3F0C758B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 300, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672301222352285, "time": 1672301222, "md5": "5ZBpJsIfzGSI5TYZCeXghA==", "fsize": 17171, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748751, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:13:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18748230</span><br>Kinda macabre to name a beer that.", "time": 1672305194, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748824, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748012</a><br>OP only gets (OP)s", "time": 1672308689, "resto": 18744892}, {"no": 18748826, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18748401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18748401</a><br>As a Belgian, that actually looks pretty good.

The secret that Big Mushroom doesn&#039;t want you to know is that you have to do all this in an extremely clean environment. Mushrooms are a fungus, and so is mold, which means that in order to grow mushrooms you need to essentially prepare a perfect environment for mold to grow, but without growing mold. The only way to do this is by physically preventing a single mold spore to come in. So when you open up the mushrooms, do so by ripping them, and then use a flame -sterilized scalpel to carefully get out a piece of flesh. All of this needs to be done inside a still air box, which can be made by overturning a large plastic tote and cutting two armholes so you can do mushroom stuff inside it.", "filename": "PXL_20221206_180501912", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3072, "h": 4080, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672802649366753, "time": 1672802649, "md5": "gaiaOxLYirHRpftRaro6ng==", "fsize": 1058093, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18768783, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)22:25:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18768748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18768748</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Has anyone in this board grown culinary mushrooms</span><br>Yes", "filename": "shorts", "ext": ".png", "w": 2714, "h": 1046, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 48, "tim": 1672802755853698, "time": 1672802755, "md5": "5GsRcET4vcuQPgg15byylg==", "fsize": 890162, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18768809, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)22:34:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18768775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18768775</a><br>The medium that I have placed the flesh on is malt extract agar.

When you&#039;re making your fruiting blocks, the best source for sawdust is hardwood pellets used for pellet grills and smokers. You can buy hickory pellets at Lowes for 37 cents a pound. Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold.

However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years.

Leave egg yolks aside and mix everything else (water/milk, starch, anything else you like besides the yolks) together in a saucepan and heat on the stove, stirring constantly until you reach a boil or the starch gels and the mixture thickens, then turn off heat.

Let the sauce cool down in the pan off the heat for a minute or two, or until just not hot enough to scramble the egg yolks. Stirring the sauce around constantly at this point helps it cool down faster. <br>3. Once the sauce/pudding is still warm but not too hot to cause scrambled eggs (cool enough that if you dipped your fingertip into the sauce it won&#039;t hurt), add yolks.<br>4.

Example of this phenomenon (but with cheese instead of yolks): 13:36 https://youtu.be/10lXPzbRoU0?t=816<br>- For step 1, you may use wheat flour instead and begin by making a roux, then proceeding with the rest of the recipe the same way. If using a non-wheat starch like potato, cornstarch, or rice flour, it helps to have a slurry handy to adjust the thickness of the sauce as you go.<br>- You can add the butter or fat at any point during step 1; personally I like to add it at the beginning before the heat.<br>- Obviously season to taste and add anything you want in the hollandaise like hot sauce, herbs, spices, lemon juice, vinegar, whatever.<br>- I deliberately left out ingredient amounts and proportions. The key to this method is starting out by making a pudding. The starch to liquid ratio is the main thing that affects the final thickness of the sauce, but this can be adjusted as you go with slurry. Every starch has different thickening power depending so look up starch you&#039;re using before you start the recipe.<br>- Yes I know about the blender + hot butter method. That method works but still sucks dick and who the fuck wants to bring out a whole ass blender just to make a sauce then clean it afterwards.

Some species of sheep/goat/lamb naturally have a rather unpleasant smell and flavor that is actually popular in other parts of the world but not so much in 1st world regions. Asking your butcher for advice on your selection is a good idea. <br><br>If you already have your meat and it&#039;s the kind of goat/lamb/sheep that naturally has that weird smell and flavor, you can start by preparing a marinade and then having your meat sit in that for like six hours but no longer than a day. Marinades chemically and permanently fix flavor to the outside of the meat but don&#039;t penetrate the meat, but you can also score your meat with deep cuts or straight stabs into the center with a skewer to help the marinade go deeper.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other than that I &#039;d braise it on low temperature in the oven to not let it dry out.</span><br>This is good. All big roasts of meat should be cooked low and slow anyway for even cooking and to avoid the outside drying out before the inside is cooked through. And it it&#039;s one of those cuts of meat that you want fall apart tender, even better; you cannot cook it for too long. <br>Also be sure to braise it in a flavorful and seasoned broth or stock, not water. If you cook it in water, the water will just suck out the flavor of the meat, but by cooking it in a rich broth with seasoning you&#039;ll contribute flavor to the meat.<br>The other thing you can do is cook up a very strong sauce with lots of herbs and spices and serve the meat roast with that. And really be generous with the herbs and spices. You can never go wrong with thyme. Also lots of garlic.<br>Some nice wine for sweetening would be good for the sauce too, and I don&#039;t see why you couldn&#039;t add wine to the braising liquid you&#039;ll cook the meat in, but I&#039;d reduce the wine a little bit first to concentrate it.", "time": 1672704153, "resto": 18764636}, {"no": 18764822, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18764636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18764636</a><br>What European board?

If it&#039;s just long-haul, full load to the destination at the end of that week, loaded and unloaded on your day off, you&#039;re still looking at a 70h cap (we have the option of 120h over a 14 day period, but it doesn&#039;t usually help). You&#039;re looking at an average speed of 75km/h, so... quickmath... It&#039;s possible to make about $5500 per week or $275k/a in Ontario, Canada, as a maximum. The average, working full tilt is probably more like $3000/wk / 150k/a because of deliveries, maintenance, construction, etc.<br><br>I thought about doing that, but then I found that logistics in the film industry can pay almost as well, and depending on what the day entails (if I have to remain on set), I can make $600/day (my absolute minimum is $300, usually low end is $450) to drop a truck and trailer off maybe an hour away, somewhere that a team of locations personnel has cleared and coned off for me. I&#039;ve got all day to do maintenance, or a few more leisurely timed drops and pickups if I&#039;m leaving set. If I wind up having to help the audio or video guys, I can charge an assistant fee on top (an extra $350)... and because I&#039;m on time and useful, I&#039;ve got a bunch of these guys scheming with me. If all goes well in the next year, I&#039;ll have a small fleet of all-in-one-ish trailers and some client-oriented video busses at my disposal, a dedicated vehicle return and maintenance crew, and I&#039;ll have to actually work for 13h a day, but I&#039;ll be pulling in $1500-ish a day 5 or 6 days a week, possibly with paid holidays.", "time": 1672585026, "resto": 18753331}, {"no": 18760064, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)10:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18754863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18754863</a><br>this.
