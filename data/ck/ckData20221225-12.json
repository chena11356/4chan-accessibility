This is because beer is often stored and transported at room temperature before it is sold, and it is not necessary to refrigerate it in order to preserve its quality. There are several reasons why beer is traditionally sold at room temperature in Europe. One reason is that beer is often sold in small quantities, and refrigerating it would be inefficient. In addition, many European beers are designed to be served at cellar temperature, which is slightly cooler than room temperature. It is also worth noting that refrigeration technology has not always been widely available, and in some parts of Europe, it is still not as common as it is in other parts of the world. However, this is changing as refrigeration becomes more widespread, and it is now possible to find beer that is sold chilled in many European countries.

Cooking something on medium instead of medium-low isn&#039;t gonna incinerate whatever&#039;s in your pan, etc.<br>Plus, not following exact instruction gives you the flexibility to tweak the dish to your own tastes.

The classic recipe and its original ingredients \u2013 flour, butter, raisins and candied citrus among them \u2013 were intended to make the cake last for some time. It was created to transport easily and takes days to make, for the dough to prove, but can last for weeks. It is pure. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Modern technology, which enables producers to pump just about anything into panettone, has led to an ill-formed cake with an ingredients list packed with additives that are far from conducive to your health.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Secondly, the idea that everything has to be new, or reinvented with new flavours, saddens me. Of course food \u2013 and our attitude towards it \u2013 changes through the ages, but just sometimes in life we ought to just stop and enjoy something that has been around for centuries. If something still excites our senses and makes our heart sing after so long, we ought to ask the question why.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Panettone has been a Christmas tradition my whole life. We didn\u2019t have much money when I was growing up and we didn\u2019t have an oven capable of making one, but we would buy one \u2013 it was our treat, a Christmas cake only sold at Christmas time. I loved the airy texture, the generous amount of raisins and chunks of candied peel studded throughout, and would happily pick off the sugar crystals from the top to eat, to the annoyance of my mother.

Even more reason to respect the skill and specialist equipment of its traditional expert bakers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Consider panettone like you would a beautiful sourdough loaf \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want to change anything about such a brilliant bread.

The garni bouquet for pickling provides such a complex taste to the cucumbers or plum tomatoes. Cherry and blackcurrant leqves, horseradish, dill parasol, list can go on.

Quick-brined are also a thing, light on salt, a perfect balance between freshness of a summer cumber and saltiness of a pickle. Screw cucumbers as a whole, use aubergine or courgette instead in the same recipe or use a paste of blended bell peppers, chilies, onions and gar of lick as a base for marinated courgette or cumber instead of water.

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea.

Puerh is probably more or less the fancy stuff with the teapots designed around it and the culture of gifting it to your boss and such. But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either). Oolong is somewhat fancy, given as gifts and growers have some pride in it, takes some technical skill to manufacture consistently.

In the course of the film, the women end up together, but the joke/not-joke about lesbians and their fondness for herbal tea remains. What can we make of this conjunction? What does the linkage of tea and lesbianism connote and how does tea function within representational economies of lesbianism? On the one hand, tea functions as prelude to eroticism and codes for the opacity of lesbian sex. On the other hand, it also works to consolidate stereotypes about lesbianism.
