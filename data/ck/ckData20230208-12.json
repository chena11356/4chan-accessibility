If acidity and bitterness are both balanced and there&#039;s a pleasant almost sweet taste from the espresso then you&#039;re right where you want to be. A general rule of thumb is to get your desired amount of coffee out in approximately 30s, which is a surprisingly long time if you&#039;re not used to it. If you want 2:1 (30g espresso out for 15g of coffee in) you may need to grind quite fine. If you find your shots are running quick, then you may need to settle for luongo shots at a 3 or 4:1 ratio until you can dial in your grind for more conventional 1.5-2.5 espresso ratios. <br><br>Temperature defects are tough to deal with because typically only really high-end machines will have custom temperature settings. Hoffman says that temp defects are typically not that severe compared to extraction defects so grind size and its effect on shot timing are more important. <br><br>Another factor a lot of lower-end machines run into is channeling because the pumps run at too high of pressure. You end up with underextracted and overextracted areas which creates the worst of both worlds. Adding a puck screen in forces even flow over the puck and if your machine is modifiable with an lower-pressure OPV spring (9 bar is considered standard) then I would recommend making that modification because it&#039;s easy and cheap to do. My Gaggia runs at 15 bar stock which is way too high, the 9 bar spring will set that as the new upper limit.", "time": 1675857056, "resto": 18904783}, {"no": 18913638, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18913624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18913624</a><br>thas a lot of words bro", "time": 1675857322, "resto": 18904783}, {"no": 18913652, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:59:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18913624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18913624</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No guarantees this will solve your issue but a broad rule of thumb is that harsh bitter flavors are from overextraction and harsh acidity is from underextraction.

Savory broadly describes foods that are tasty but not sweet or dessert-like. Savory foods can be salty, umami, and even bitter. Potato chips could be described as savory, for instance. Bacon is both salty and umami. Umami refers specifically to the meaty taste sensation of glutamates, regardless of the presence of salt or bitterness. It refers to something very specific and that justifies it having its own word.", "time": 1675840273, "resto": 18907318}, {"no": 18912971, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)02:12:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18907318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18907318</a><br>It&#039;s delicious", "time": 1675840358, "resto": 18907318}, {"no": 18912975, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)02:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18907318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18907318</a><br>sure, right after you&#039;ve described the other flavors.

Here&#039;s an analogy that might be a little more on your level: anon A has had an itch he couldn&#039;t scratch since he was a baby, but was so used to it by the time he was old enough to buy a back scratcher he completely forgot it was even there. Anon B got the exact same itch out of nowhere as an adult and it drove him crazy, kept him awake at night, and generally just ruined his day. Eventually anon B figured out that he accidentally bought iodized salt and immediately threw it in the trash before buying some regular salt and was immediately cured.", "time": 1675840679, "resto": 18908296}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18908283, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:09:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You may only choose one.", "filename": "1675746079999010", "ext": ".png", "w": 700, "h": 876, "tn_w": 199, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675746556028934, "time": 1675746556, "md5": "jof87lebr9Q9m9xNZkoZ2Q==", "fsize": 1030989, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-may-only-choose-one", "replies": 55, "images": 7, "unique_ips": 39}, {"no": 18908288, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:10:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Too much.<br>Gimme a normal vanilla cone", "time": 1675746611, "resto": 18908283}, {"no": 18908289, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:10:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Option E", "filename": "DCE3B604-1AA2-4D9D-A3E6-A555E57F030A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675746633242471, "time": 1675746633, "md5": "joKgERoYlWCVIQQ2oOWPqg==", "fsize": 73687, "resto": 18908283}, {"no": 18908290, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:10:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18908283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18908283</a><br>I&#039;m ok thanks", "time": 1675746637, "resto": 18908283}, {"no": 18908293, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:11:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "sprinkle cake", "time": 1675746673, "resto": 18908283}, {"no": 18908300, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:12:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18908283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18908283</a><br>Throw them all in the trash and order two scoops of vanilla instead", "time": 1675746757, "resto": 18908283}, {"no": 18908322, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:17:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "chocky chippy", "time": 1675747053, "resto": 18908283}, {"no": 18908327, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:20:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18908283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18908283</a><br>Top left looks the least abominable", "time": 1675747212, "resto": 18908283}, {"no": 18908334, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)00:21:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18908283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18908283</a><br>Nope, not in the mood to OD on sugar today.

Other animals seemed to have been able to shed their hair fairly quickly -- it&#039;s not too difficult an evolutionary step. Disease? Any old disease vulnerability would be useful to find out about. Lack of food would be the obvious, but again, they had a huge area over which to migrate. All this is relevant to how we manage megafauna today (an operation we spend a lot of money on, whether in zoos or wildlife parks or the hunting industry, or as climate change persists, in future de-extinction projects).

Don&#039;t buy pre-grated cheese, ever. Add it to a bowl with some mayonnaise. Ratio depends on how much cheese you use. Add your pimentos, and some Worcestershire and cayenne. Mash it all together into a spread. Can make it more homogenous in your stand mixer with the paddle attachment.<br><br>The seasonings are a matter of taste, so put whatever you like. Try some granulated onion or garlic, hot sauce, whatever. Pimento cheese is one of those things that is infinitely better if you make it at home.

Your question of what boils down to essentially &quot;how can we fix it&quot; is a complicated one considering historically we&#039;ve been trying to &quot;fix it&quot; for the passed 50+ years with lukewarm results.
