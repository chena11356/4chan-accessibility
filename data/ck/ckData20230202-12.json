We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u201d to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u2019s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u2019s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u2019t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)", "filename": "th-1530947230", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1675048587538304, "time": 1675048587, "md5": "ZwxwSxR6KJEuUWEyJjMAjA==", "fsize": 18079, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874891, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18870257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18870257</a><br>I eat shrimps and prawns whole, with shell, tail and head", "time": 1675048842, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874893, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874891</a><br>Do you enjoy the gritty poops?", "time": 1675048875, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874899, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874893</a><br>i like it when the poops tickly my bunghole on the way out<br><br>usually from eating too much popcorn", "time": 1675048960, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874923, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:33:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874899</a><br>No, the shrimpies poopers.

At 750-800F you can get a beautiful paper thin char on the crust. I&#039;ve used steel, baking stone, and even a 2$ paving stone from Home Depot that weighs like 25 pounds. The paving stone actually cooks great as long as you let it heat up enough. I don&#039;t double bake; I assemble the pizza and throw it in all at once.<br>- wetter dough is fluffier because of all the water turning to steam. It&#039;s harder to handle though if you&#039;re not experienced and it can stick to the surface that you&#039;re building the pizza on. This is just one of those things that you get better at as you gain experience.<br>- regular baking yeast cannot compete with sourdough for flavor, but the yeast is fast and has excellent handling properties.<br><br>DO NOT use grated cheese out of a bag. Grate your own from a block or ball. The shredded stuff in the bag is coated in some kind of powder to keep it from sticking together into one big ball, and this really seems to harm its melting properties.

I think it&#039;s fun, but a lot of the cultural and focus around tasting is people like Mei Leaf, who do it as a performance and not as any serious exercise.
