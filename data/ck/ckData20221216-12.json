Andechs Kloster is good, though some people might find it a bit too sweet. Gawith Apricot (yes, it&#039;s made by Poschl, despite carrying the name of a different snuff maker) is acceptable for a fruit-flavored snuff, the menthol helps rein in the apricot flavor&#039;s &#039;perfumy&#039; tendencies. <br>Of the schmalzlers, I&#039;d go for Sudfrucht (SF) and/or Doppelaroma (D), for that classic jamminess. However, Poschl schmalzlers are packed in sachets, and they tend to lose aroma if stored too long before use. You might occasionally get a dud.

They hate his loyal titcow Asian wife and his five strong boys who all grew up hunting wild game in the Florida everglades. They hate the fact that his palatial Jacksonville plantation is owned debt-free and tax-free because of his Native American heritage and the royalties from his numerous movie roles as a lowkey but respected character actor. They absolutely despise his natural kinship with animals, especially the regal opossum, the most intelligent and gentle of all non-human mammals. They hate his natural, instinctual knife skills and the fact that he could cook a meal better than Gordon Ramsay on a sterno can in the parking lot at a Love&#039;s Truck Stop. In summary, Dinotendies is the antithesis of the malding tranny Redditor /ck/ janny archetype, and they will never forgive him for his success, or indeed his very existence, which implicitly reveals their Rick &amp; Morty Nintendo Switch manbabyhood for all to see.

Supposedly, according to social media posts that were &quot;totally genuine and not paid-for marketing&quot;, it was the best fast food item.<br>I ordered the sandwich and received what appeared to be a disheveled wad of paper, perhaps something to toss in the refuse bin. However, I was assured that it was to be unwrapped and my supposedly tasty treat was inside.<br>I followed the instructions and, upon removing the many layers of questionable wrapping material, was met with what appeared to be a &quot;food-related item&quot; that suffered a tumble down a set of stairs before being stomped under a steel toe boot. <br>Now, I&#039;m not one to decry fast food presentation differing from advertisements, they all do it. But this seemed to be crossing the line. Nevertheless, I knew that presentation wasn&#039;t everything, so I carried on. I picked up the scrambled mass and, upon bringing it to my mouth, was hit with a pungent aroma that seemed to seat itself in the back of my sinus. Tears welled in my eyes as I opened my mouth and took my first (and only) bite. I tasted nothing upon entry. I tasted nothing upon the first bite of the chew. I chewed thrice more before &quot;flavor&quot; made itself known. It was not a welcome one. I have never had the displeasure of chewing on an old dishrag that had been dropped and forgotten behind a restaurant dishwasher, but this must have been its closest &quot;edible&quot; imitation.<br>I let the chewed mass fall from my mouth, back into the so-called &quot;wrapper&quot;, letting it dribble upon the supposed &quot;sandwich&quot;. I went to the nearest drug store and bought mouth wash - it took 5 cycles to rinse out the taste. Unfortunately, the pungent aroma that had seated itself in my sinus would persist.<br><br>It was not until I stopped at my local Subway restaurant and ordered a Roast Beef (six-inch) that I had an actual roast beef sandwich for the day.

The right shoe went &quot;on top&quot; as the Van&#039;s logo went left-to-right. One night I realized that the Van&#039;s logo was on both sides going left-to-right and maybe I had gotten the direction reversed at some point.

The industry 5 is the second thickest rim to rim cladding, only behind their own proline series. Their atlantis 7 series has the most even heating bottoms due to having the thickest bottom cladding of all cookware, but no rim to rim cladding. The problem, as with a lot of cookware, is their handle ergonomics kind of suck. The part of the handle closest to the pan is the thinnest, which makes it uncomfortable when you inevitably choke up on the handle to counteract the leverage on your wrist. Currently, the best overall cookware in my humble opinion is the Hestan Thomas Keller cookware. Their handles are by far the best out of all the clad cookwares, wide and thick where it counts. Their rim to rim cladding is a bit thicker than all-clad&#039;s, but not as thick as demeyere. But the rims are sealed so there no chance of the cladding separating over time.

After the green tea leaves are evaporated at high temperature to soften the water, and then repeatedly fried, the leaves change from turquoise green to reddish brown. The green tea made with heavy fire is the characteristic of fried tea, and the soup is yellow and red. Jieyang Stir-Fried Tea is famous for its strong taste and a little sweetness, and it does not hurt the stomach after long-term drinking.</span><br>From another listing<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Traditional tea from Guangdong province. It has a strong characteristic aroma of green roasted tea and a bright complex taste.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is produced in the same places as the more famous Guandunskie oolongs, such as Feng Juan tribute Cong or Chaozhou cha. This tea is not known outside China. It can be said that this is a tea place in Guangdong province. Made from the same raw materials as most oolongs in this province. In the final stage of cooking tea is roasted by hand, in special boilers. Hence its strong and characteristic aroma and original taste, with a taste of fried chestnuts. Perfect for every day.</span><br>It seems like it repeatedly wok fried or otherwise roasted instead of the charcoal roast you usually see on oolongs. Im guessing the roast on the darker ones will be fairly intense which as the description says makes it easy on the stomach but the flavor isn&#039;t for everyone.

Liquor is a dark reddish, orangish, brown that is appropriate for its age and storage. <br><br>Notes:<br>Aggressively camphor, moth balls, aromatic cedar chests and closets, mild bitterness and astringency but the camphor itself can be slightly irritating, good longevity. There are probably some other notes in there but the camphor truly dominates. The name LP gave it is accurate.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Not entirely sure how I feel about this one. It is a unique tea and a great example of a camphory tasting sheng but It seems a bit too intensely camphor for my taste. I expect this to be a divisive tea, some out there will love it but many others probably won&#039;t care for it.

It&#039;s the most pedestrian list one can think of, and is the easiest way to overpay on a marked-up name for something that&#039;s mediocre quality in its class.<br><br><a href=\"#p18698779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18698779</a><br>This is the only good advice. If you have one type of liquor you&#039;re trying to learn a bit more about, to get a bit more of a refined taste, start thinking to up your spending on that, then look at what the major cocktails/variations that are done on it look like and diversify from there. I&#039;ve found some decent lists online that give an overview of quality versus price ranges to a much more thorough degree than most burn-outs working high-turnover sections in liquor stores (unless you have a *really good* liquor store like Binny&#039;s), but in the end once you have a list of candidates in your price range it&#039;s probably just a matter of taste who ranks which higher in reviews. Thus:<br><br>Always be on the look out for any type of tastings and write down what the names you want to look out for, in all price ranges, even those way out of your league now. I still remember vividly the sensation of a tequila, totally unaffordale for me at the time (but not even in the premium XA category), I tasted a decade ago, but I never wrote down the name, and I have always regretted it. You&#039;ll always, no matter how rich you may get, have need of cheapo go-to brands that you can give with a clear conscience to guests you don&#039;t want to waste money on, or those who obviously aren&#039;t there to appreciate the drink.", "time": 1671088375, "resto": 18698749}, {"no": 18698940, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)02:46:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18698882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18698882</a><br>Let&#039;s give some basic recs (U.S. brand availability and prices I&#039;m afraid) for a minimal cheap versatile entry-level bar setup:<br><br>Tequila: Espolon reposado ($25-30)<br>Whiskey: Four Roses ($25-30)<br>Rum: Don Q Cristal (for white if you&#039;re primarily mixing daiquiris etc, &lt;$15); Flora de Cana 4year (for dark, its associated cocktails and variants, and maybe sipping, $20 -- I don&#039;t know rum well at all)<br>Gin: Beefeater seems to be the entry one everyone recommends, and seems cheapest of those recommended at about $20/750ml.<br>Vermouth: Dolin at $15 for sweet or dry seems to be the minimum brand people go for if you want to consider using it for anything other than mixing (as a secondary) and cooking. If you&#039;re mixing you might as well get a $5 Trader Joes or M&amp;R sweet vermouth at first and see what kind of manhattans (or the equivalent using your best base liquor) and the like that gives you, then get a Dolin and see how that elevates it.<br>Bitters: If you&#039;re near a Wegman&#039;s they have Angostura for super cheap (like $8).

Costco in particular apparently carries some value gems.)<br><br>Again, maybe only focus on exploring one type of liquor at a time, to upgrade to something of higher value or more diversity. The way to do it is this: say I want a starter bar and I&#039;m interested in exploring rum.

Now I take a basic cocktail like the Old Fashioned -- it&#039;s be re-spun a million times, and wouldn&#039;t you know, you can re-spin it with dark rum instead of whiskey (or anejo tequila, or rye, or brandy, or mezcal combo, and it just goes on and on).
