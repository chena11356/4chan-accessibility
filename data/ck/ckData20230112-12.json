PG Tips has 2.9g. ISO 3103 traditionally used 2.83g based on an old sixpence coin. This goes into a 6-10 ounce sized cup, or 140ml for ISO 3103.<br>Teabag packaging directions are typically 2-5 minutes. ISO 3103 is 6 minutes for black tea with milk, 3-5 minutes for other types depending on how chopped up it is.<br>Green tea is fine up to 80-85C and others can use off-the-boil or more precisely 86-90C is ideal. This is based on several papers I can link if you&#039;re curious, plus I tested with a thermapen. There&#039;s not a lot of nuance.

Our bodies are not calorimeters, they don&#039;t burn food. When you eat food containing &quot;X kcal&quot;, you don&#039;t actually derive that amount of energy from food, you derive far less. The reason why calorie counting &quot;&quot;&quot;works&quot;&quot;&quot; is because you&#039;re massively underfeeding yourself.<br><br>2. Moreover, counting calories doesn&#039;t actually work even in theory, because the margin of error on caloric content in food that is specified on the label is very high. In some countries it&#039;s as high as 20%. This means that you can&#039;t even count calories properly, assuming our bodies are perfect calorimeters (they aren&#039;t).<br><br>3. The CICO concept (more like El Circo lmao) doesn&#039;t even work in theory, because the second law of thermodynamics applies ONLY to a closed system - a system that does NOT exchange mass with the environment, it only exchanges energy. The human body is not a thermodynamically closed system, because it constantly exchanges MASS with the environment: sweat, piss, shit - all of this is MASS leaving your body.<br><br>4. For the reasons specified above, counting calories is the dumbest shit you can do, because it doesn&#039;t even work in theory, let alone in practice. You end up massively underfeeding yourself in any scenario where you count calories with multiple sources of both systematic and random errors. Underfeeding your body leads to a homeostatic response that lowers your basal metabolic rate, so you now need to eat even less food in order to keep losing weight at the same rate which leads you to underfeeding yourself even harder and this CICO circus leads only to one possible outcome - psychological meltdown and binge eating.<br><br>The solution?

I use a quart sized deli container.<br>- 100ml soy sauce<br>- 100ml mirin<br>- 500ml water<br><br>Now either steam or boil eggs for 6.5 minutes. After the 6.5 minutes you want the cooking process to stop completely so run cold water right into the pot. You can peel the eggs either when still warm or let them cool idk doesn&#039;t matter.

If demand is localized and scaled appropriately, quality of life for animals and quality of end food product both improve. I think the issue of veganism is really troubling, because it reflects a natural reaction to a terrible system created by humans (factory food) and a rejection of naturalistic tendencies (most animals eat other animals, and the ones that don&#039;t typically get eaten). Human veganism is antithetical to optimized health. But, since we&#039;ve created a system of animals that are dependent on humans for security and longevity, it seems that a balancing act of ethical breeding practices and maximizing the wellbeing of animals while alive (but ultimately which will either die and feed other animals or can die and feed people) has to occur at some point.

It&#039;s insane that such a simple thing is so uncommon now.<br>A good egg, fresh from a good chicken is unlike what is at the stores. People will go on about yolk color but that will depend only on diet and it can be faked by the industrial farms if they care to do it by feeding the chickens certain nutrients which will make the yolks a darker yellow. A good egg when fresh has a white that will naturally stay around the yolk in the pan. It will be tight and the egg will have some height to it after cooking without you having to push the white towards the yolk. The texture of the white is also way different. It has some texture and it quite opposite of the rubbery that store bought eggs get especially when old. The yolks flavor is noticeably better and it feels just _good_ to eat. Also the shells break cleaner while also being harder.<br>I pay 5 bucks a dozen and I&#039;ll keep doing so until they retire or I die.

When you&#039;re making your fruiting blocks, the best source for sawdust is hardwood pellets used for pellet grills and smokers. You can buy hickory pellets at Lowes for 37 cents a pound. Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold. So with these more effective substrates, you need to pressure cook them just like you did the grain jars.", "filename": "IMG_20221231_160402_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672812958863218, "time": 1672812958, "md5": "PWaoSdkvXVk110erHFxGKg==", "fsize": 406764, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769271, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18769113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18769113</a><br>There&#039;s outdoor cultivation methods which mimic the natural environment much more closely. If you grow mushrooms outside it&#039;s pretty similar to composting and you don&#039;t need to sterilize anything. However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years.

From what I&#039;ve read the best intro reposado buy on all counts (accessibility, cost, etc) is probably Espolon, but with tequila there&#039;s a lot of great brands and a lot of personal taste involved. With any new liquor, look for tastings in your area and go -- even if they cost some $50 at the door, IT&#039;S ALWAYS WORTH IT (not for wine or beer where there&#039;s a ton of free tastings however). <br><br>Adding to Bon Appetit&#039;s list, there are agave spirits in general including mezcals (of which tequila is of course a subtype), but don&#039;t dive into all this right away unless you live in Mexico or near the border and can access good bottles on the cheap. There are also non-100% agave spirits (mixtos), which should always be avoided in the U.S., but can again be fair game to explore in Mexico.<br><br>Unaged is cheaper, extra aged is more expensive, just like with any other liquor. Unaged can be just as good to sip as extra aged, just like any other liquor. Do some background research on general reviews from people in the know (liquor.com has nice intro best-of lists), but don&#039;t read more than you drink, just like any other liquor.", "time": 1673152092, "resto": 18778973}, {"no": 18784159, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)23:32:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18784144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18784144</a><br>This advice, btw, is courtesy of a guy who is currently reading way more than he drinks.

Was it life changing? I wouldn&#039;t go quite this far but it certainly was an eye opener.<br><br>No, it might not be my usual or even a frequent companion in my car, but the Filet-O-Fish holds a special place in my heart. The soft steamed bun is like a heavenly pillow that holds a perfectly crisp and flaky patty of sustainable Alaskan pollock. The tartar sauce is impeccable with just the right amount of tanginess and the perfect creamy companion to the patty; it really does tie everything together. Cheese on fish? I wasn&#039;t a believer either but that slice of processed cheddar cheese, invariably perfectly melted like you see in the ads, is a magnificient addition. Possibly superfluous, I can&#039;t say for sure because I&#039;ve only had one with cheese, but I have faith that the McDonald&#039;s creators knew what they were doing when they added it; they tend to perceive the gestalt of each menu item in a way that most of us simply cannot.<br><br>I am a fan of juxtaposing textures and I concede that the Filet-O-Fish does not have a contrasting crunch to balance the impossibly soft steamed bun and generous helping of tartar sauce.

The U.S. economy is expected to continue to decline through 2020, with an anticipated growth rate of 1%. This will have a significant impact on the U.S. national debt, which will continue to increase throughout this period (Federal Reserve). In order to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment, governments around the world have implemented various fiscal stimulus packages aimed at increasing demand for goods and services in their respective economies (IMF).<br><br>One way that governments can support demand for goods and services is by increasing disposable income levels among consumers and businesses by reducing prices or wages (IMF). Governments may also implement policies that aim to increase employment such as tax cuts or public works programs (IMF). However, these measures are likely to be ineffective if they do not address underlying structural problems within an economy such as high levels of government debt or low productivity growth rates (IMF). Governments therefore need alternative policy options that can be implemented quickly without having long-term effects on their economies\u2019 ability to sustain high levels of debt orIn the year 2030, coffee prices will be very affordable.

This is due to the fact that there will be an abundance of coffee in the market because it was predicted that by 2030, there would be a global population growth of 2 billion people (\u201c2030 Economy\u201d). With this increase in population comes an increase in demand for coffee and therefore an increase in its price.

We met in high school, and I got her pregnant.<br>She is and always has been a lazy person and a shit cook. I wouldn&#039;t even mind eating shit food if she at least made it on time. But she rarely did.<br><br>We&#039;d get into screaming arguments constantly about how lazy and worthless she was. I felt like an asshole for it, but goddamn she was a real piece of work. The only reason I dealt with all this was for the kids, and also because the sex is great.<br><br>But one night, I got fed up. Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it. I told her &quot;one of these days, if you don&#039;t straighten up, I&#039;m going to lay hands on you.&quot;<br><br>All my meals have been on time, and she just recently tried to make a meatloaf.

And now I&#039;ll blow the lid on it and tell you all, because flavor is meant to be shared. You see, you&#039;re supposed to imbibe the marinade onto your own self, performing the most ritualistic of enemas, and once you&#039;re good and flavored up, you can then and only then proceed to cram that bird right up in there, letting it rest for no less than 24hours before birthing it onto a roasting pan<br>Mwah!
