I haven&#039;t worked at Starbucks in about a decade, but my dad will still go to the local stores and buy up their entire supply whenever it&#039;s available, and now it&#039;s all they drink and told me they can&#039;t really stand the shitty pre-ground supermarket stuff. If they run out of that coffee, they&#039;ll switch to tea. When I visited them yesterday, I offered to grind their coffee with my hand grinder, but my mom stopped me because she immediately knew it would make a huge difference to have fresh burr-ground coffee, and she sort of didn&#039;t want to know, because she knew the financial rabbit hole coffee snobbery can lead to.

Moving on, and regarding gochugaru, I came to the conclusion that it is an ingredient that is absolutely superior to all the alternatives, and I admit this in shame, since I&#039;m from a culture that prouds itself for its paprika/chili obsession (Hungary).<br><br>About my choice of different types of onions: scallion &amp;... &quot;regular&quot; onions. I just like the difference in texture, basically. And lastly, about the quality of my salt... I admit, it&#039;s substandard. Koreans emphasize that it should be the coarsest salt you can get - mine is not.

You get a lot for your money, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s sweeter than what I\u2019m typically used to, but it\u2019s very fragrant and clinical. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any cheese or mushroom, but I\u2019ll take note of that and see what I can spot when I have my next glass later on.

And I definitely wouldn\u2019t call it slow to open up, I can pretty much drink it immediately after pouring my glass but I like to take my time as the nose really is something. I typically buy Armagnac that\u2019s been bottled about 30 years after the date it has been distilled (kinda my sweet spot, though I do have both younger and older), and I also only buy single vintage (i.e. bottles with the year stamped on them instead of the age of the product). My current Delord is 39 years however (distilled 1982, bottled 2021) and I\u2019d happily buy it again. The only thing that annoys me about Delord is the wax they use to seal the cap is a LOT harder than literally any other Armagnac I\u2019ve ever had to open, that said it\u2019s a small price to pay for what\u2019s a very affordable product in my opinion, especially given the age.", "time": 1674106463, "resto": 18825577}, {"no": 18829142, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18827079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18827079</a><br>Kek just because Armagnac isn\u2019t to your liking doesn\u2019t make it poor quality.

I just had my Delord with my partner and we both agree no cheese or mushroom in the nose, palate and finish, lol. Looking at my tasting notes though, this is what I wrote: nose: extremely grape-y, like sniffing a well packed bouquet of fruits and berries packed in a basket held together by UHU glue; palate: sweet, minty and clinical, hard to pinpoint individual flavours, there\u2019s something synthetic about the flavour but in a way I very much enjoy, it just tastes super clean; finish: the synthetic part really comes out here, plasticky but damn it\u2019s addictive (bits of the UHU glue nose come out here on your taste buds, and just like UHU glue, it\u2019s god damn addictive).

Laubade does that, there\u2019s a cloth string a few mm wide under the wax which you can just pull to get the fucker off. The problem with Delord isn\u2019t the lack of string though, it\u2019s that the wax is like fucking porcelain i.e. really hard. My older bottles of Laubade had no string but even despite that the wax was super easy to peel off. I typically don\u2019t ever leave a bottle open for more than three months so I don\u2019t have an issue with ageing becoming a problem. I typically drink one shot a day with my significant other (we do have one or two breaks a week though), sometimes we share one shot, sometimes we have a shot each; so with my rule of four open bottles at once that pretty much guarantees each bottle will finished within three months. I devised this rule mostly because for whisky it can be very unpredictable how well a bottle ages, and in my experience it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to go downhill fast once the bottle is about 50% empty with all that air mucking about inside. Funnily enough I find Armagnac holds much better than whisky; I once had a bottle open for over a year and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. But like my current Glenfiddich 15 VAT 03 that\u2019s open, I can tell I\u2019m enjoying it a wee bit less now that the bottle is down to its remainder 35%.

Super simple and damn good. <br>1. Get ~1 lb brussel sprouts, remove any discolored leaves, wash and dry, then split in half. <br>2. Put halved sprouts in a large bowel, add about a tablespoon of salt and toss well. You want these suckers to be evenly salted. <br>3. Drizzle in a tablespoon or two of olive oil, a clove or two of minced or crushed garlic, and a two teaspoons of a chopped herb of your choosing. Choose something strong, mind, sprouts stand up well to big flavors. I like rosemary. <br>4. Mix together extremely well and evenly as best you can. <br>5. Heat oven to 450 F and let your sprouts soak in the salt, oil, and flavorings. Ideally the sprouts have 30-40 minutes to get good and tasty, but work with what time you have. <br>6. Once the ovens&#039; hot, put the sprouts on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, stir and flip and shit, put back in and bake again for 15 minutes. <br>7. Take &#039;em out early if they&#039;re starting to burn though, ovens are weird. They&#039;re done when a fork goes through with little resistance, and smaller leaves are dark and brittle like kale chips. <br>8. Let them cool for a bit these bastards are hot!

Firstly, mixing the sawdust and soy pellets is annoying and takes a long time to get an even mixture. Secondly, sterilizing them takes forever and is annoying, but with straight sawdust it&#039;s not necessary to sterilize because it&#039;s not nutritious enough for mold (I hope). And then, it&#039;s also annoying to put the grains inside the bags inside my SAB after sterilization and then shake them up. In all my previous attempts, I haven&#039;t gotten a good mix and the mycelium just starts on top and has to grow down to colonize the rest of the sawdust which takes a long time. For these, I just hydrated the sawdust pellets in a bucket, and then mixed the grains into the mix, and then put the mixture right into the bags. It saved a ton of work and I think it will colonize faster because it&#039;s much more evenly mixed.

Don&#039;t expose anything to the open air except in a still air box, and don&#039;t let anything touch your materials except flame-sterilized implements. Be vigilant about this and you&#039;ll be fine. The only things that can be exposed to open air and unsanitary objects are fully colonized grains (as the mycelium&#039;s immune system protects it) and non-nutritive substrates like coir or straw. <br><br>The only expensive piece of equipment you need is a pressure canner but it&#039;ll pay for itself quickly.

Thread is full of idiots &quot;WELL IF IM JUST MAKING RICE I CAN DO IT BETTER ON THE STOVETOP!&quot; no shit bro, making good rice is easy as fuck, the point is to just free yourself from having to worry about it for every.single.meal. and just have warm rice ready to go whenever, so you can focus on other things.", "time": 1673887180, "resto": 18813772}, {"no": 18818806, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)11:42:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18818784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18818784</a><br>Upvote", "time": 1673887345, "resto": 18813772}, {"no": 18818807, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)11:42:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18818786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18818786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an keep the rice warm for ~40 hours.</span><br><br>i&#039;ve eaten my rice at like, 92 hours. which you&#039;re not supposed to...but it imparts a nutty flavor...", "time": 1673887358, "resto": 18813772}, {"no": 18818810, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)11:43:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18818806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18818806</a><br>Thank you kind sir.", "time": 1673887411, "resto": 18813772}, {"no": 18818833, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)11:50:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18818810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18818810</a><br>This.

Don&#039;t ask for a mojito, don&#039;t ask for something gay and stupid like a singapore sling that has six ingredients.

It&#039;s delicious. Rum, lime, sugar syrup, shaken hard and served ice cold. If you want something boozier and more.. &quot;manly&quot;, ask for a Manhattan or an old fashioned. If you want something manageable that you can sip on for a while, get a highball, which is spirit + carbonated liquid: vodka soda, gin and tonic, tequila soda, whiskey soda. You can just ask for a Jameson highball and the bartender will know what you mean.<br><br>You can always ask for a whiskey on the rocks or neat and the bartender will totally respect you for it, especially if it&#039;s a nice whiskey. You&#039;ll need to specify by brand. Doesn&#039;t ask for &quot;whiskey on the rocks&quot;, that&#039;s what fucking alcoholics and retards ask for. <br><br>Don&#039;t ask for doubles.
