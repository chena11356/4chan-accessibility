I came in from the pool to get a salad and at the salad area the staff asked me to sit and order... he was doing nothing .. no orders, just a little clean up... I asked him a few times to make it and after getting a little loud (me that is) he finally made it. It took him 45 seconds and i was able to pick out what i wanted by seeing and pointing, asking for little of this but more of that. Think he got back at me by putting a lot of dressing when i clearly said very very little.<br>Should not be a struggle to order at the salad at the counter when he is not busy/or during slow times.

Same bag of tea though, just some standard taiwanese oolong.<br>First of all, please just gong fu oolong. These both turned out very watery. The old way draws out much more of the floral notes of the oolong, and some honeysuckle and a bit of nuttiness, but overall is a pretty weak cup. Would probably shine when eating some spicy, greasy chinese food like all oolongs do though.<br>The new method has a bit more penetrating fruitiness, but still is a bit watered down. Kinda has this hard to describe berry note with the tiniest bit of floralness. Its amazing how much the brew actually changes things in oolong. Benefit for the new method is it cooled down to drinking temperature much faster. Its very hard to pick a winner, I genuinely think the new needs a higher brewing temperature to open up the leaf and extract more flavor, and both just need more leaf to water.

Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it.

This will have a significant impact on the U.S. national debt, which will continue to increase throughout this period (Federal Reserve).

Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold. So with these more effective substrates, you need to pressure cook them just like you did the grain jars.", "filename": "IMG_20221231_160402_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672812958863218, "time": 1672812958, "md5": "PWaoSdkvXVk110erHFxGKg==", "fsize": 406764, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769271, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18769113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18769113</a><br>There&#039;s outdoor cultivation methods which mimic the natural environment much more closely. If you grow mushrooms outside it&#039;s pretty similar to composting and you don&#039;t need to sterilize anything. However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years. But that&#039;s only worth it because you might as well do it, I wouldn&#039;t rely on that as a reliable farming method.<br><br>Another cool thing you can do is to inoculate an entire log with spores or liquid culture from a log colonizing species. I have seen it done where someone gets a whole log, then drills a few holes in it and inseminates the log with mycelium, then plugs the holes and wait for mushrooms to start popping out of the log. On Paul Stamets website he sells mushroom plugs that you can stick right into a log for this purpose. However I&#039;ve never done this so I can&#039;t speak in depth about it.", "time": 1672813903, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769312, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:59:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Proper flow hood costs an arm and a leg to build and run.

If it&#039;s lumpy or uneven, or the casing layer is not the same thickness all over, you&#039;re more likely to get fewer larger mushrooms rather than an even canopy of smaller ones.

With any new liquor, look for tastings in your area and go -- even if they cost some $50 at the door, IT&#039;S ALWAYS WORTH IT (not for wine or beer where there&#039;s a ton of free tastings however). <br><br>Adding to Bon Appetit&#039;s list, there are agave spirits in general including mezcals (of which tequila is of course a subtype), but don&#039;t dive into all this right away unless you live in Mexico or near the border and can access good bottles on the cheap. There are also non-100% agave spirits (mixtos), which should always be avoided in the U.S., but can again be fair game to explore in Mexico.<br><br>Unaged is cheaper, extra aged is more expensive, just like with any other liquor. Unaged can be just as good to sip as extra aged, just like any other liquor.
