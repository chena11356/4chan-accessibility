Most farmers haven&#039;t figured out to have an internet presence, so taking a drive around the country-side or visiting local or regional farmer&#039;s markets is also an option. I lucked out and was able to join a private association to buy grass-fed beef and raw milk directly from a local farmer. We purchased half a cow that I split with my family, it worked out to be around $3.50/lb hanging weight after the processing fee for the butcher. Don&#039;t butcher it yourself, you&#039;d probably have to pick up the cow from the farm with a trailer and kill it yourself if you really wanted to do that. At that point you might as well just buy a calf and raise it yourself in your back yard or indoors. The beef we&#039;ve gotten locally is superior to anything in the grocery store. The flavor is out of this world, very buttery and earthy. My only complaint is that the cuts are fairly small compared to the grocery store, but it&#039;s still cheaper per lb buying wholesale cow. Maybe the size of the cuts were bc of how I told the butcher to process it, or because the breed they raise are smaller than other cattle, or because they don&#039;t raise them as long before they slaughter them. I don&#039;t really mind eating smaller cuts, but that&#039;s the biggest complaint I have for my local farmer. Also in general, local meat will always come frozen, even at the farmer&#039;s market, it&#039;s really not that big of a deal. If you&#039;re buying from farmer&#039;s market retail, then you&#039;ll pay more than the grocery store. We also got a quarter pig last year, worth it 100%. Deep freezer is necessary.

There have been many stories of local farmers sending their high quality cows to a butcher and getting shit meat back, different animal received than the one sent in. Also buying via a private association means that the meat is not for sale to the public, and most likely, it is not USDA inspected, so there are looser restrictions on where they can process the meat. My local farmer has an open door/farm 24/7/365 policy where you&#039;re welcome to visit anytime as a club member and inspect for yourself what is going on at the farm, state and federal agents are not welcome since it is a private club. Being a private association, they are not allowed to sell to the public at farmer&#039;s markets. It saves on costs on public regulation which they pass on to the club members, and it has allowed them to stay in business and not go under as a local family farm. I&#039;ve been a member for almost 3 years and have always been satisfied with their quality, their chickens are better than any other farmer or grocery store in the region. They have raw milk butter that I don&#039;t really care for since it&#039;s very grassy and I don&#039;t like that flavor in my butter, but if you like Irish butter you&#039;d probably love it.

It should literally look like giant hairpin U-Turn and not be straight.<br>https://homeinspectiongeeks.com/wha<wbr>t-is-a-dishwasher-high-loop-and-why<wbr>-do-you-need-one/", "filename": "d1f6cbd3-f5f2-46c3-8ed6-2f647a8d2cdb.8d53ac2dcdc2b0ff68ebd4bccefcdc3c", "ext": ".png", "w": 1393, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 116, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674980938672828, "time": 1674980938, "md5": "V8Wabhv42PxSAFGI5DZucA==", "fsize": 1380965, "resto": 18868470}, {"no": 18871282, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)03:30:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18870969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18870969</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;better can opener</span><br>What did you get?

We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u201d to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u2019s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u2019s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u2019t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)", "filename": "th-1530947230", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1675048587538304, "time": 1675048587, "md5": "ZwxwSxR6KJEuUWEyJjMAjA==", "fsize": 18079, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874891, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18870257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18870257</a><br>I eat shrimps and prawns whole, with shell, tail and head", "time": 1675048842, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874893, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874891</a><br>Do you enjoy the gritty poops?", "time": 1675048875, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874899, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874893</a><br>i like it when the poops tickly my bunghole on the way out<br><br>usually from eating too much popcorn", "time": 1675048960, "resto": 18870257}, {"no": 18874923, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:33:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18874899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18874899</a><br>No, the shrimpies poopers.

I know there would be a lot of details to hash out in a system like this and the percentages would have to be calculated for each company, I don&#039;t think you&#039;d really be able to standardize something like this but if there was a serious effort by the government to regulate and enforce this kind of thing you&#039;d still have people being incentivized to work as hard as they can without leaving an option open for upper management to abuse the rest of the people working there and take home way more money than they really deserve at the expense of everyone else working for them.", "time": 1675032231, "resto": 18870943}, {"no": 18873905, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)17:44:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18873889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18873889</a><br>Understand that &quot;lefty&quot; means &quot;decent, moral human being&quot;.<br>But hey, just keep hating if that&#039;s your thing.", "time": 1675032268, "resto": 18870943}, {"no": 18873908, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)17:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18873859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18873859</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Post WW2 baby-boom lasted from 1946 to the early 50&#039;s</span><br>more like early 60&#039;s.", "time": 1675032292, "resto": 18870943}, {"no": 18873919, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)17:47:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18873908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18873908</a><br><a href=\"#p18873859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18873859</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1946 to the early 50&#039;s, no matter how many people want to pretend I have cultural commonality with Beatlemania, Woodstock and Anti-Vietnam protests.</span><br>I have absolutely no common generational culture with actual boomers.<br>Google &quot;interstitial&quot;.<br>Still rather be a boomer than one of your shitbag generation.", "time": 1675032440, "resto": 18870943}, {"no": 18873922, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)17:48:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18873886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18873886</a><br>You clearly didn&#039;t test well in reading comprehension evaluations in schools.<br><br>Posting your sources on 4chan would be like posting the source for the image capture -- in that case the Twitter post.

It is true that your basal metabolic Raye does slow to some extent, but maintaining a 500 calorie deficit for a week, will make you lose about a pound. If your theory was correct, a person eating only 1000 calories would then only use 1090 calories for the entirety of their bodily functions ad machinery, which just isn&#039;t true. A 9% reduction in metabolic rate after TWO YEARS isn&#039;t even a drop in the bucket compared to what you are insinuating. Dont even bother to reply since you are clearly obese and don&#039;t lift, which are the only people who push this narrative to try to cope with their inability to attain fitness because of their life choices. I&#039;m not going to argue with you, none of your points disprove the fact that any object that produces work requires input and output energy, and this applies to the body.

Why is that important? Let&#039;s take one of the most used purposes for cast iron, pan seared steak. In pan searing a steak, surface temperature is critical to making a good sear. Once the steak is placed on the pan, the temperature will drop momentarily as the two surfaces work their way into equalizing their temperatures. A good sear requires maintaining as close temperature of the Maillard Reaction as possible, which is roughly around 357*F but requires a surface temperature greater than that since the steak is colder as both surfaces fight to equalize their temperatures. A cast iron skillet with more thermal mass than a stainless steel skillet will resist that temperature gradient longer than a stainless skillet because stainless steel is both less massive as well as less conductive.<br><br>With all that said however, I&#039;m a stainless steel guy simply because itjustwerks\u2122", "time": 1675039690, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874333, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18871964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18871964</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tomato sauce or dahl or anything with wine</span><br>just cook that shit in a stainless steel pan or dutch oven, jesus christ", "time": 1675039713, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874334, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18871634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18871634</a><br>Its fitting too, because it doesnt take any more effort but retards who havent touched them think its hard.", "time": 1675039726, "resto": 18871626}, {"no": 18874338, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:49:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does cast iron on an electric stove even work?

But does it really take that long to extract this herb\u2019s flavor? To find out, we simmered bay leaves in tomato sauce and in lightly salted water (to eliminate the distraction of competing tastes) for varying lengths of time. In both liquids, the bay leaf\u2019s herbal notes were noticeable in as little as five minutes, but it took about an hour for the full spectrum of its more than 50 flavor compounds to become apparent. The moral of the story: Feel free to add bay leaves to dishes with cooking times as short as a few minutes, but to really maximize their flavor, simmer them for a full hour.</span><br><br>Also Chris Kimball (the bowtie guy that left ATK to start not-ATK) did a segment on Bay Leaves (google it since 4chan thinks linking the video is spam).<br>tl;dw is he can&#039;t taste them and his support staff say there is a difference between Turkish Bay Leaves which are the dried common variety we are used to which are subtle flavorings and Californian Bay Leaves that are typically sold fresh and extremely overpowering.

Most of it&#039;s crap anyways, the only water that really has benefits above others is &quot;natural spring water,&quot; and this is because natural water rubs against sediments and collects minerals that we need for hydration. So this is also why waters like Dasani are criticized, because they source their water from municipal sources.

The religious rule of fasting exists to build character, primarily temperance and humility. Outside monastic communities it is not a strict law and more of an ideal, and for laymen it is usually considered enough to simply try your best. Not to get into the finer details, but there is also a strong tradition of vegetarian cooking which exists in order to properly celebrate religious feast days which occur during the fast. The food is meant to taste good, but it is very obviously lighter vegetarian cuisine.<br>Unlike the Catholics, fish is not licit during the fast (although it is seen as a &quot;less-bad&quot; food, in some places) and in fact in most places, the ideal fast excludes all dietary oils as well - which is by far the least-followed restriction among laymen for obvious reasons.<br>In this light, it is pretty clear where Beyond Meat and similar products belong. They are, at best, a &quot;less-bad&quot; food like fish, but fake meat products embody principles opposite to the ideal fasting food. The reason there is a &quot;debate&quot; is basically that disinterested laymen who might feel community pressure to fast will try to find loopholes in their daily life, and since the point of the fasting rule is humility, if you are another layman and not a priest it is considered counterproductive to insist and posture over the dietary rule that others are following, for the same reason that you aren&#039;t supposed to act prideful over people who don&#039;t fast.
