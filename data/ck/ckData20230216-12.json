So no, it doesn&#039;t really make sense.</span><br>On the Lodge website, the 12&quot; is $30, and the 13.25&quot; is $50. Their most common model is the $10.25&quot;, which is regularly $24 and currently marked down to $20. One of the reasons cast iron, in general, is not popular is due to the weight. We can see that the 12&quot;, at 7.89 lbs, is 47% heavier than the 10.25&quot; (5.35 lbs), and the 13.25&quot;, at 10.5 lbs, is 100% heavier than the 10.25&quot; skillet. So based on weight, there is TWICE the iron in the 13.25 inch skillet as in the 10.25 inch skillet--you might have had some inkling of this if you understood the difference between diameter and area of a circle.<br><br>Based on material alone, the regular price of the 10.25&quot; being half of the 13.25&quot; makes sense. However, you&#039;d be stupid if you thought that was the only factor. Because the 10.25&quot; is more popular, more stores are going to order them reliably. Lodge can make more of them, without worrying if they will sell and receive a return on their investment. It&#039;s the one model that they know they won&#039;t have leftover stock at the end of the year; therefore, they can afford to sell them with thinner margins. Hence the $20 price right now. <br><br>So basically, you&#039;re a complete idiot and you should feel bad about it.", "time": 1676396120, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937733, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:36:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937683</a><br>Mental illness.", "time": 1676396181, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937786, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937726</a><br>k", "time": 1676396867, "resto": 18935532}, {"no": 18937793, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:49:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18937786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18937786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*I was wrong.

If you were given the choice between jail food and outside food, of course you&#039;d choose outside food 8 days out of the week. Jail food sucked man, the portions are tiny, the food is underseasoned and all they give you are some tiny salt and pepper packets that are about the size of your thumb nail. Crispy things are soft, soft things are rock hard, hot things are cold and cold things are suspiciously warm. I mean what are you expecting, it&#039;s fucking jail, not a 5 star resort.<br><br>That being said, when you&#039;ve been in jail for 16 hours and it&#039;s become abundantly clear that you&#039;re not getting out any time soon, a plate of lukewarm goyslop doesn&#039;t sound too bad. I got &quot;lucky&quot; during one of my trips to jail and I got to eat one of the bi-monthly hot breakfasts (normally it&#039;s cereal). Two tiny sausage patties, two tiny pancakes, a tiny syrup packet and no butter, one single limp dick slice of bacon and a fruit cup. Sounds like garbage to you. But for someone who hadn&#039;t eaten all day because I got arrested in the middle of the night, it was actually a pretty good meal. Oh yeah, and an acceptable side dish in jail is a half a slice of disgusting wheat bread. I got that shit during every single meal.

Things that should be paltry like bags of chips, pickles, hot sauce, tuna, and ramen were like 5x their outside price. Headphones and calling cards were like 10x a reasonable outside price. Just another way to extract money from people in jail.<br><br>I did try jail cuisine one single time, but it was wasted on me. I was detoxing/withdrawing from drugs when one of the guys in my block who coincidentally went to the same college I did cooked up some kind of jail house burrito. I remember him breaking up some bags of ramen and cheetos into a powder and mixing it with nacho cheese and hot sauce and chopped up pepperoni sticks. Since I was dope sick at the time, all I needed as a wiff of that bullshit and it was enough to make me gag, and it wasn&#039;t much better going down either. I only ate a few bites of my burrito before throwing it out. Looking back, that was such a dick move. That guy didn&#039;t have to spend his hard earned jail money and waste his time crafting a jail burrito for me, but he did, and I didn&#039;t even have the curtosey to finish it.

The main reason it&#039;s so expensive is that it is a very popular and prestigious gift that is valued highly in Chinese gifting culture where they consider the high price to be a positive thing to show how valuable their gift is. Unfortunately lots of the very high end of Chinese teas are subject to this gifting culture price inflation so the prices won&#039;t necessarily reflect their value as a tea drinking experience. There are also some teas like silver needle white tea where the grading and value is based totally on the appearance and size of the buds and the actual taste of the tea falls fairly low on the the list of qualities the tea is priced and judged for. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to have a decent understanding of Chinese teas before you start throwing money around in the upper price categories of tea.

This point is closely linked to the first point, because a good broth will enhance the brisket as well. Brisket, cooked properly will be tender, yet springy. Something that Ramen Cha Siu will never achieve. You will have to use another pork cut for that.<br>Third, again, closely linked to the 1st point, you have never slurped a proper high-quality egg yolk from an indigenous egg, slightly cooked and warmed in a hot bowl of Pho, along with a spoonful of that quality broth. Ramen egg (or ajitsuke tamago) is also my favourite, but when faced with a properly served Pho egg, it simply can not compete.<br>The problem is that, most Pho restaurants here blow.

I definitely do not NEED caffeine as I also drink caffeine free coffee and teas about half the time. <br><br>But its more dependent on you personally and how your day goes. I have a caffeine sensitivity and if I made a really strong pot of tea and I finish drinking it at noon, sometimes I just cannot get to sleep until 1 or 2am. if I watch it and I&#039;m careful and make a normal to week pot and finish drinking by 10 while drinking plenty of water throughout the day I&#039;m fine. I also get to sleep a little better if I just don&#039;t drink any for the day. That said, caffeine doesn&#039;t help anyone sleep better so stopping &quot;too early&quot; is much better than stopping too late. Some people get really pissy because of their caffeine withdrawal symptoms too. Again, thats because they&#039;re a drug addict. The approximate halflife is 8 hours, meaning if you stop at 3, its like me drinking a single cup of coffee at 6pm. If you ever noticed your sleep isn&#039;t great, its because your brain isn&#039;t actually sleeping because of the caffeine. Try stopping at 10am and switch to anything decaf after that. I think even decaf coffee is a diuretic and dehydrates you, I know anything with &quot;energy&quot; like decaf monster or whatever also dehydrates you. Dehydrated brains also don&#039;t sleep well. <br><br>Just do an experiment for a solid week and try to notice the differences in your mood and sleep after 7 days. Stop caffeine at like 10am and don&#039;t drink any on the weekends. worst that happens is the first couple days feel weird but after that your body and brain adjust to less caffeine.", "time": 1676418774, "resto": 18938590}, {"no": 18938860, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:55:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I can&#039;t remember where I picked up this factoid but it takes seven hours before caffeine leaves the body<br><br>I usually stop drinking coffee before noon and (non-herbal) tea before three so I can get to sleep without any issues", "time": 1676418924, "resto": 18938590}, {"no": 18938877, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:59:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18938855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18938855</a><br>I love coffee too.
