Of course food \u2013 and our attitude towards it \u2013 changes through the ages, but just sometimes in life we ought to just stop and enjoy something that has been around for centuries. If something still excites our senses and makes our heart sing after so long, we ought to ask the question why.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Panettone has been a Christmas tradition my whole life. We didn\u2019t have much money when I was growing up and we didn\u2019t have an oven capable of making one, but we would buy one \u2013 it was our treat, a Christmas cake only sold at Christmas time.

The idea of drinking out of a small cup is to influence the mouth feel and cool it down quicker so you can drink it faster and taste more. Certain cups exist to increase aroma, some focus more on cooling faster, really if you ever get into wanting a kind of cup it&#039;ll mostly be for aesthetics. Very few people really get several kinds of cups for different occasions, some people into tasting get smelling cups. I do find myself enjoying the flavor more out of my porcelain 60 ml cups more than my antique western style 6 oz teacups, but I use the 6 oz cup more because I don&#039;t have to use a gong dao bei. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impossible to make amounts like I&#039;m used to with western teas if I want to go for quality?</span><br>eh, I typically get a bit more tea liquor out of gong fu brewing overall than if I used the same amount of leaf to brew western style. But at once? Yeah you&#039;re going to get less, but brew times are faster. I guess its more an active effort to taste tea than just western style drinking. I still mostly brew red tea in western style because the quality increase in gong fu is negligible unless I&#039;m really in the mood for trying to find different notes. <br>Japanese tea is the annoying one. you only get 3, maybe 4, extractions and it&#039;s a higher leaf to water ratio than chinese, so it ends up costing more money for less tea.

Puerh is probably more or less the fancy stuff with the teapots designed around it and the culture of gifting it to your boss and such. But you still drink it with the same technique as anything else. I wouldn&#039;t put it even near the same category of flavors that matcha presents though, its just a completely different flavor profile and honestly its not very beginner friendly. <br>Chinese green teas have a different flavor overall from Japanese green teas, and that comes mostly from 2 factors; different cultivars and different processing. You can get into soil conditions as well but the other two are a bigger influence. Japanese have different tea tree cultivars that they&#039;d bread for the qualities they want, chinese have their tea trees for the qualities they want. Japanese process via steaming and mostly do machine processing which cuts up the leaf more and increases surface area, Chinese process via dry heat and more by hand (due to cheap labor) so the leaf is more whole and has a different flavor profile. If you took a high quality Shincha and good Longjing, not even the most novice tea drinker could confuse them despite being both the most coveted highest quality greens in their respective countries. One is grassier with seaweed notes, one is tastes like roasted nuts. <br>Chinese and Japanese tea tastes don&#039;t overlap very much, and you can see that by what they drink. 90% of Japanese tea is green tea, Chinese is varied with Oolong probably having a slight edge. <br>Speaking of Oolong, it&#039;s probably going to be the best in class and taste without having to break into Puerh (though it&#039;s not the same flavor either).

This is the very beginning <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; In Go Fish, Rose Troche and Guinevere Turner&#039;s seminal lesbian film from 1994, one of the protagonists complains that the woman who her friends want to set her up with has cupboards of herbal tea and no sex appeal. In the course of the film, the women end up together, but the joke/not-joke about lesbians and their fondness for herbal tea remains. What can we make of this conjunction? What does the linkage of tea and lesbianism connote and how does tea function within representational economies of lesbianism? On the one hand, tea functions as prelude to eroticism and codes for the opacity of lesbian sex. On the other hand, it also works to consolidate stereotypes about lesbianism.

Procedural<br>Start with dried BEANS, canned ones have already been cooked at far too high a heat and will turn to shit. I recommend pressure cooking your own rehydrated beans, this is also far cheaper. <br><br>Ground beef often has too much fat to sear, don&#039;t be scared to pour that fat off then add it back in with the onions.<br><br>Use whole spice, fry the whole spice off in vegetable oil, then either blend the mixture or just use the oil. This is unfamiliar to Americans but Indians and Chinese understand you get more value and fresher spices. Again add this with the onions and you speed up the cooking time. <br><br>Add the beans after the onions are done, this avoids over cooking your beans. <br><br>Add stock rather than water. <br>I boil beef bones then ladle the stock in as the chili reduces so it&#039;s not dry. This adds nutrition and means you can use less ground beef. <br><br>B. Ingredients<br>Whole spice is always preferable.<br>Don&#039;t buy meat which was butchered 5 days ago then pumped full of water, or mince that&#039;s half fat, the fat will merely stop you getting a good sear and float to the top as an oil slick. <br><br>When it comes to tomatoes make sure you&#039;re buying sauce tomatoes to make sauce. You may find passata is a better option, only use tomato paste if you can&#039;t get sauce tomatoes or is significantly cheaper. <br><br>Cinnamon lifts a chili up, so does bay leaf.

The waitress serving your microwaved tendies isn&#039;t getting rich from that extra 15%, it&#039;s just allowing the restaurant owner to avoid paying her minimum wage, and yeah that sucks, but if you don&#039;t like it, microwave your own tendies like a grown manchild.", "time": 1671863486, "resto": 18732993}, {"no": 18733173, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:52:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;18733078</span><br>Buck up, champ!

Cooking something on medium instead of medium-low isn&#039;t gonna incinerate whatever&#039;s in your pan, etc.<br>Plus, not following exact instruction gives you the flexibility to tweak the dish to your own tastes.

The height of each dam varies; two dams stand about ten feet tall and the third stands about 20 feet tall. The total amount of water collected behind these dams totals about 40 acre feet; enough to fill almost 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These man-made reservoirs feature boat docks, boats, and were stocked by Harrington with trout and Bluegill for recreational fishing.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The state first identified Harrington&#039;s illegal water use more than ten years ago and initiated enforcement action to discontinue his illegal use of water. After numerous attempts by OWRD and the Watermaster to achieve voluntary compliance, the Department enlisted the assistance of the Oregon State Police in 2002. Citations were issued, and Harrington pleaded guilty to several violations. He was assessed a nominal fine and ordered to drain the three reservoirs, which he did. However, Harrington again closed the headgates in 2004 and refilled the reservoirs. As a result, OWRD and the Oregon State Police submitted reports to the Jackson County District Attorney&#039;s Office alleging additional violations of Oregon water law. That office filed misdemeanor charges against Harrington, and in 2008 he pled guilty to one count.

This is because beer is often stored and transported at room temperature before it is sold, and it is not necessary to refrigerate it in order to preserve its quality. There are several reasons why beer is traditionally sold at room temperature in Europe. One reason is that beer is often sold in small quantities, and refrigerating it would be inefficient. In addition, many European beers are designed to be served at cellar temperature, which is slightly cooler than room temperature. It is also worth noting that refrigeration technology has not always been widely available, and in some parts of Europe, it is still not as common as it is in other parts of the world. However, this is changing as refrigeration becomes more widespread, and it is now possible to find beer that is sold chilled in many European countries.

The problem with mason jars is that you cannot easily remove the oxygen. They make coffee storage canisters with vacuum pumps, but I don&#039;t bother. You can suck the air out of plastic bags by sticking a straw into the corner and sucking if you really want to. You can also buy one-way valve bags, but those are more for selling roasted coffee.
