class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18737418</a><br>Bugs are not a viable alternative protein source for humans for several reasons. First, the human body cannot digest chitin, the main component of insect exoskeletons. Second, bugs are not a very efficient source of protein, requiring more food (in the form of insects) to convert into protein than other animals such as chickens<br><br>There are a number of reasons why the human body cannot digest chitin. Chitin is a complex polysaccharide that is not broken down by human digestive enzymes. Additionally, chitin is not a good source of nutrition for humans, as it is not a good source of essential amino acids. Finally, chitin can actually have a negative impact on human health, as it can bind to and kill beneficial gut bacteria<br><br>Bugs are also not a very efficient source of protein. In order to obtain usable protein from bugs, humans would need to eat a large number of them. This is because insects are mostly made up of exoskeleton, which is indigestible for humans. Additionally, insects have a very low conversion rate of food to protein, meaning that more insects would need to be eaten to obtain the same amount of protein as from other animals<br><br>Finally, bugs are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in the journal Science found that a diet rich in insects would result in higher emissions of methane and nitrous oxide, two of the most potent greenhouse gases. The study found that the emissions from a diet of insects were about double those of a typical livestock-based diet.<br><br>Source:<br>htps://www.scientificamerican.com/a<wbr>rticle/sorry-entomophagy-fans-eatin<wbr>g-insects-is-not-sustainable/<br>https://www.sciencedirect.com/scien<wbr>ce/article/pii/S0271531711003073<br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC3709646/", "filename": "6C44B3DA-591C-44A8-A165-0F97468C5BA6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672000110920750, "time": 1672000110, "md5": "O3vIHyA+zjjKtPQaxMheiw==", "fsize": 44802, "resto": 18737184}, {"no": 18738088, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)15:39:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18738063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18738063</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sources</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;removed</span><br>kek", "time": 1672000745, "resto": 18737184}, {"no": 18738093, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)15:43:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18737184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18737184</a><br>Who the fuck is &quot;we&quot; you faggot not out of school yet?

I&#039;m a complete newb so I&#039;m winging it my best following guides but even if I&#039;m sipping on a few liters over 4 hours I find serving suggestion is too strong. Maybe I&#039;m a slow sipper. I enjoy the stronger caffine and bitterness in a black coffee sort of way.

A few years in dry conditions will just make sheng a bit less green and &quot;fresh&quot;, mellow out some of the bright floral notes of the white tea, and clear up some of the funk on shou or liu bao (probably the most useful scenario here for only aging 3 years). Starting out I would not buy tea solely to age but if you buy more tea than you drink there is nothing wrong with aging some of it. That&#039;s what I do at least.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leave them in the pantry</span><br>Just be careful about the conditions there. You want the tea to be somewhere where it will not pick up smells. A lot of western puerh drinkers just store their tea in ziplock bags or sealed containers. The best way to store tea for aging in the west is a more complex topic and is still somewhat a mater of debate.

I dont like the recap movies. I think the TV series is superior in sound and music and the ending of the recaps is kind of an anti climax with the changes they made to the scene where madoka talks to homura. But rebellion story is different. It&#039;s an all new soundtrack and its addictively good and completely underrated. I wish there was a falcom style remix of one for all in the soundtrack. <br><br>IT&#039;s impossible to talk about the content of the movie, but you probably heard things about its conclusion. I&#039;ll say that whatever your feelings on it, it doesn&#039;t feel warrented to say things are unsalvagably bad for fans of madoka. Madoka has constantly been someone who cares about homura and doesn&#039;t want her to suffer alone. I guess the best thing I can say about the movie if you have mixed feelings is it left things off between them in a state of equality. They have the capacity, if they chose, to have a serious conversation about their passive agressive struggle to martyr themselves for one another. But like Madoka 1-12 was a triumphant return of the powerful girl after cleansing herself of her own conciets, naiveties, and foolish ambitions, Rebellion story is about a counterattack to that. IT&#039;s literally the &quot;strikes back&quot; in japanese from star wars iirc. Homuras story and goal through the 12 episode anime was an abject failure. It needed to be so that madoka could shine brighter in the narrative. But are we really okay with madoka suffering the ultimate painful sacrifice if it means she gets to be free and strong? Is she? Is homura? Madoka the rebellion story is fundamentally the opposite of the narrative of 12, and the entire movie sets this up with a captivating worth watching on animation and painting grounds alone, toy like world. It&#039;s also amazing how, after dehuminizing and masculinizing herself in 12, homura recaptures her feminity in this film&#039;s theme", "time": 1672137353, "resto": 18733875}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 18741656, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)22:51:22", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Red Lobster Time", "com": "I\u2019m going to feast at Red Lobster tomorrow.

Hoffmeme probably has a good video, too, but I get distracted by his fetal alcohol syndrome face under his massive eyeglasses.<br><br>adjusting the brew ratio to balance the flavors is a common technique. it&#039;s generally accepted that during extraction you get acids &amp; oils first, then sugars, and finally bitter compounds.

I travel most days of the week for work. We set up alot of IT stuff for hospitals. One day I was travelling to somewhere in Kentucky. I was excited to go because 1.) I had never been and 2.) I was excited to try the local fare and learn more about what people ate there. We got in late and really didn&#039;t have time to eat anywhere particularly locale the first night, but after arriving to work the next day we were recommended to eat at a place called &quot;Randy&#039;s Kountry Kitchen&quot;.

My coworkers immediately started drinking. They just got burgers. I thought that was foolish and opted to get their special: A chicken fried steak with pepper gravy. I was floored. It was fried just right and the gravy was smooth and creamy. My coworkers at this point were beginning to get more and more inebriated, even though it was a lunch break and I began to wonder how we were going to get back. As, I stated I usually take my time with my food. My coworkers began to tease and berate my eating habits. One said &quot;I ate like a faggot&quot; to which I found very insulting.

Several minutes later a morbidly obese man wearing a very dirty motorhead shirt lumbered over to my table and introduced himself as Randy. He asked me &quot;what was wrong with my food&quot;. I informed him that I wished to tell him the latter and that I found his meal to be delicious. The man seemed perplexed and just stared at me.

The primary one that most people will notice would be carbination. Bottles, cans, glass, they all hold carbination at different rates. Bottles tend to be the best for holding carbination but corporate has realized they can get away with less so its not a guarentee. Carbination is also dependent upon the supply of co2 gas. When it gets pricier, they cut it back and your soda tasts flatter regardless of what its in and how old it is. When I see soda on sale, I usually dont buy it because that usually indicates that the containers are old. The older the container, the higher chance for more off gassing, which means the less carbinated it is. Shipments being left out in the sun, or being exposed to dramatic temperature shifts can also cause carbinaization loss. lots of people dont realize but plastic is permeable, and it breaks down over time as well. Cans use to be the go to for a good soda but theyve slowly been made thinner and thinner, and to compensate for that they started lining the cans with a kind of chemical plastic.<br><br>Moving on, other things can effect the taste. What kind of sugar or sugar substitute used can vary throughout the season, and if you arent a heavy drinker/smoker/degenerate then you might pick up on the particulars of the different serups beingt used. This is something a non-gourmand wont understand. Temperature is also important. Soda tastes different hot/cold or with ice. <br><br>Also keep in mind that how something tastes is directly related to the state of your taste buds and nose. If you are sick or have a stuffy nose, the taste will be different. If you consume certain foods, the taste will be different.

Of course food \u2013 and our attitude towards it \u2013 changes through the ages, but just sometimes in life we ought to just stop and enjoy something that has been around for centuries. If something still excites our senses and makes our heart sing after so long, we ought to ask the question why.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Panettone has been a Christmas tradition my whole life. We didn\u2019t have much money when I was growing up and we didn\u2019t have an oven capable of making one, but we would buy one \u2013 it was our treat, a Christmas cake only sold at Christmas time.
