From what I&#039;ve read the best intro reposado buy on all counts (accessibility, cost, etc) is probably Espolon, but with tequila there&#039;s a lot of great brands and a lot of personal taste involved. With any new liquor, look for tastings in your area and go -- even if they cost some $50 at the door, IT&#039;S ALWAYS WORTH IT (not for wine or beer where there&#039;s a ton of free tastings however). <br><br>Adding to Bon Appetit&#039;s list, there are agave spirits in general including mezcals (of which tequila is of course a subtype), but don&#039;t dive into all this right away unless you live in Mexico or near the border and can access good bottles on the cheap. There are also non-100% agave spirits (mixtos), which should always be avoided in the U.S., but can again be fair game to explore in Mexico.<br><br>Unaged is cheaper, extra aged is more expensive, just like with any other liquor. Unaged can be just as good to sip as extra aged, just like any other liquor. Do some background research on general reviews from people in the know (liquor.com has nice intro best-of lists), but don&#039;t read more than you drink, just like any other liquor.", "time": 1673152092, "resto": 18778973}, {"no": 18784159, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)23:32:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18784144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18784144</a><br>This advice, btw, is courtesy of a guy who is currently reading way more than he drinks.

The old way draws out much more of the floral notes of the oolong, and some honeysuckle and a bit of nuttiness, but overall is a pretty weak cup. Would probably shine when eating some spicy, greasy chinese food like all oolongs do though.<br>The new method has a bit more penetrating fruitiness, but still is a bit watered down. Kinda has this hard to describe berry note with the tiniest bit of floralness. Its amazing how much the brew actually changes things in oolong. Benefit for the new method is it cooled down to drinking temperature much faster. Its very hard to pick a winner, I genuinely think the new needs a higher brewing temperature to open up the leaf and extract more flavor, and both just need more leaf to water.

This method is good for thicker pieces of cartilage and can help to break down the connective tissue and make it more tender.<br><br>Stewing: Similar to braising, stewing involves cooking the cartilage in liquid over low heat, but the liquid is typically thicker and the cartilage is cut into smaller pieces. This method can be used for a variety of types of cartilage.<br><br>Pressure cooking: Pressure cooking can help to speed up the cooking process and make cartilage more tender. Simply add the cartilage to the pressure cooker with some liquid and cook according to the appliance&#039;s instructions.<br><br>Grinding: If the cartilage is very tough and cannot be made tender through cooking, it can be ground into a fine powder and used as a natural supplement or added to other dishes as a source of collagen.<br><br>It is important to note that some types of cartilage, such as those found in the nose or ears, may not be safe to eat due to the risk of bacterial contamination.

Ketchup&#039;s sweetness overpowers the flavor of the hotdog, as it does with most meats, making it pointless to consume said meat for the taste of meat.<br><br>For the older generation, you would only put ketchup on stuff you cant stand the flavor of. Before the 1990s, most people would only consume something like 60 grams of sugar a week, or even a month. Most people in the older generation grew up enjoying mostly salty or savory foods, or even fatty foods. Sweetness was a rare treat, reserved solely for deserts or maybe certain drinks. Even soda back then was sipped, not gulped. A single bottle of cola could last you all day long. The wide mouth can, and the implimentation of drinking as much soda as you could started in the 1990s.<br><br> So if you say you love hotdogs, then you obviously cant be putting ketchup on it because that would mean you dont like it. This doesnt make sense to zoomers, because zoomers consume all their food with at least 20 grams of sugar per serving.

When you&#039;re making your fruiting blocks, the best source for sawdust is hardwood pellets used for pellet grills and smokers. You can buy hickory pellets at Lowes for 37 cents a pound. Soy hulls are an agricultural waste product and you can buy it online for even cheaper than that. I think they&#039;re normally used to feed pigs. The best recipe for bulk substrate for woodloving mushrooms, which includes oysters and shiitake, is 1 part sawdust, 1 part soy hulls, and 3 parts water, all by weight.<br><br>There are some alternative substrates which you can use to varying degrees of success. Oysters can also be grown on a mixture of straw and coffee grounds. Or just sawdust, or just straw. <br><br>You also don&#039;t need to use these bags, obviously, you can use any container. But these are cheap, large, and transparent. And they&#039;re safe to pressure cook, which you&#039;ll need to do depending on how nutritious your substrate is. If you&#039;re just using pure straw, you can just soak it in water and put it right in the bags, and then dump the grain spawn on top and shake it up. Mushroom mycelium has its own immune system, as it&#039;s a complex living organism after all, so it&#039;s naturally pretty resistant to mold and bacteria once it&#039;s established. You can expose a fully colonized jar to the open air, or dump it in a bag of straw, and it will be fine. But soy hulls and coffee grounds are extremely nutritional and encourage the growth of competitive mold. So with these more effective substrates, you need to pressure cook them just like you did the grain jars.", "filename": "IMG_20221231_160402_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672812958863218, "time": 1672812958, "md5": "PWaoSdkvXVk110erHFxGKg==", "fsize": 406764, "resto": 18768748}, {"no": 18769271, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p18769113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18769113</a><br>There&#039;s outdoor cultivation methods which mimic the natural environment much more closely.

However, whether you can do this depends largely on your local climate and what you want to grow. And it&#039;s also pretty much a crapshoot and less controlled than what I&#039;m doing here. Like you can get some mushrooms from the grocery store and shred them up, throw them on the ground in your backyard, and cover it with a pile of hardwood chips and sawdust and coffee grounds, and your weather and local humidity is right, then mushrooms are probably gonna grow out of it. But it might be multiple years before you see anything and you won&#039;t have huge yield, and you might accidentally grow some other shit you didn&#039;t want. Most people in this hobby throw their spent substrate in a pile in the backyard and extra mushrooms keep randomly growing out for many years.

I was so ready to love In-n-Out and sing its praises back home where we don&#039;t have it. So I&#039;m not just being contrarian. I had it 3 times while in California, and more than just being overrated, it was legitimately bad. It was 3 separate locations, too, so you can&#039;t tell me &quot;there was probably something wrong with that specific In-N-Out.&quot; I wonder what kind of psychology is behind this phenomenon. Obviously people are conformist but how did the lie start in the first place? Were people in California desperate to have their own &quot;thing&quot; and they assumed this old-timey thing must be the best? That has to be a part of it. Just like how people pretend old music is so much better than new music. They&#039;re afraid to say their actual favorite (new) thing is the best because they don&#039;t trust themselves. I guess that&#039;s another aspect of conformity. And so people are afraid to tell the truth which is that In-N-Out isn&#039;t even the best California hamburger chain (it&#039;s Jack in the Box, which is too new-looking). I wonder if it&#039;s just straight-up corruption, like In-N-Out literally paid people to say they were the best chain. The only one I can think of that&#039;s worse than this is White Castle, but that&#039;s almost a different genre of food. Scarcity has to be part of it, too.

Additionally, the ingredients used in Indian restaurants in North America may differ from those used in India, as some ingredients may not be readily available or may be substituted with locally available ingredients. The presentation and serving styles of Indian food in North America may also be different from those traditionally used in India, such as the use of silverware instead of eating with one&#039;s hands.

I just filled my coin jar up after 10 years, and I really wanted to treat myself. I maxed out my cards on my prescription sciatica medication. You know how painful that is without the doctors help? Don&#039;t even get me started! And then my faucet started leaking, and I had to call the landlord and then the landlord told me to call the maintenance and then the maintenance told me to call a plumber and I&#039;ve just been really up shit creek with all these problems. Did I mention my cat was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes? You wouldn&#039;t believe what the vets are charging these days! They tell me I gotta buy a specialty cat food for him, and monitor his insulin levels and shoot him with insulin everyday! Do you know how expensive cat insulin is? I&#039;ll be brief and just say it ain&#039;t cheap. The way this guy runs through it he will have me begging on the street in a matter of months. You know what&#039;s even worse? My aunt who lives part time with me busted her right hand slipping on the curb on a snowy november evening and now I gotta take care of her. She&#039;s run into real rough times and I&#039;m the only one there for her. She would be on the streets if I didn&#039;t provide a roof, and food for her. You know expensive it is to feed a 65 year old aunt? I&#039;m totally slammed on all fronts. Reminds me of a couple war stories where I was surrounded on all fronts by those dirty zipper heads. Guess what? I survived! Hah I&#039;m here so you could have guessed I supposed! Did I tell you how exoensive PTSD medication and therapy is? The government never recognized my struggle, so I&#039;m stuck paying all the bills on that. You know what I was like before I got treatment for my PTSD? It wasn&#039;t good. I would even say it was bad. Hiding under the table, killing homeless people at night, screaming, shitting myself on occasion. You know how everyone has nightmares?
