There are many to choose from, such as:\n<br>\n-3DS Max<br>\n-Cinema 4D<br>\n-Maya<br>\n-Softimage XSI<br>\n-Lightwave<br>\n-Blender 3D (Free!)<br>\n<br>\nOnce you obtain one the next step is to start with tutorials. There are many on the net, they range from text and image tutorials to video tutorials. You aren&#039;t going to find a tutorial for everything out there, but most will explain techniques that you need to adapt in order for you to achieve whatever final result you want.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>2.) &quot;Wow! That&#039;s a lot of programs! Which one is best? I heard ______ is best.&quot;</i>\n<br>\nYou heard wrong, there is no one program that is better than the rest, it has and always will be the skill level of the artist. Which program you choose is solely dependent on your own personal taste and which aspect of the 3D industry you want to be involved in.<br>\nMax and Maya are the most hyped and so therefore the most used, they have the most available documentation online. The interfaces have a steep learning curve, but there isn&#039;t any 3D program you can&#039;t learn if you take the time to use it and follow some tutorials. Go with a generalized package, not a specialist one.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>3.) &quot;Whoah, Generalized vs Specialized? How do I know?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nA generalised package like Maya, Max, Softimage are packages that let you model, render, animate, texture, and create dynamics all within the same application. They don&#039;t require third party plugins or applications to add another basic feature, like a renderer or animation tools.<br>\nHowever you can get plugins for these apps to enhance their features. There are several Specialized applications out there that cater to a specific skill.<br>\n<br>\nAnimation: Motion Builder, Messiah 3D.<br>\nModeling: Modo, Wings3D, Silo 3D<br>\nCAD: Autocad, Sketchup, SolidWorks<br>\nDetailing: Zbrush, Mudbox, 3DCoat<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>4.) &quot;Ooooo Zbrush, I see so much awesome shit from that, I&#039;m gonna start there!&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, you&#039;re getting ahead of yourself. You should start learning about basic modeling and topology before jumping into Zbrush. Zbrush is a great program for advanced users to add detail to their existing models, or to prototype models quickly by sculpting them out.<br>\nIt is not a good idea to get into Zbrush when you&#039;re not very familiar with general 3D concepts<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>5) &quot;Ok, I see I&#039;m not very good at this stuff, can you model ______ for me?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, anybody with any decent skill on this board does this work for a living or for some kind of gain. Some of those just starting out may pick up the project but don&#039;t expect Miets Meier level of work. You get what you pay for.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>6.) &quot;But it&#039;s too haaaaaaaaard, isn&#039;t there any easy button?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, like all things it takes time and effort to master a program, practice makes perfect and playing around with the interface will get the shortcuts ingrained into your muscle memory.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>7.) &quot;So which program is the easiest to learn?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nYou shouldn&#039;t learn a program, you should learn techniques. When you master a technique the program becomes nothing more than a tool. As said before Max and Maya have the most documentation but you should look at learning how to model and the right techniques instead of &#039;what button does X&#039;.<br>\nYou can get UI information from the program&#039;s help files. F1 and Google are your friends.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>8.) &quot;So, what do studios look for when hiring if I don&#039;t know program ______ won&#039;t I get turned down?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nWhen a studio judges your demo reel and resume they have an order of priority.<br>\n<br>\n1-Quality of Work<br>\n2-Versatility<br>\n3-Experience<br>\n4-Program skills<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>9.) &quot;So studios don&#039;t care what program I use? Why do they care about versatility?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nExcept for Animators who are pretty much exempt from most rules of 3D, most studios want people who can perform multiple tasks instead of just a specialised one. They want modelers who can also texture, they want riggers who can also do dynamics, they want lighters who can also texture. It&#039;s ok to be specialised in one area, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to be versatile, it will always keep you employed.<br>\n<br>\nWhen a studio looks at your program skills they do often look to see if you have experience in their preferred in house package, but MANY times you&#039;re going to get a studio that has added their own tools and pipeline so it wouldn&#039;t matter what program you know as long as your skills are good. If you know techniques you can pretty much pickup any 3D package in a matter of days. Of course there are some that are hard set that you know program ________ but for the most part what package you know is not that important (yes even you Blender fags can get a job in a studio if you know good techniques.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>10.) &quot;What about gaming?&quot;<br></i>\nWhat about it?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>11.) &quot;How do I make my own game? How do I program shaders or a video game?&quot;<br></i>\nThis is a 3D board, not a programming board! Do you want to make 3D game assets or do you want to be a programmer?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>12.) &quot;Uhhhh....&quot;<br></i>\nExactly.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>13.) If you want to get into game asset creating, your three primary focus of interests are:<br></i>\n-Modeling<br>\n-Texturing<br>\n-Animation<br>\n<br>\nLow poly modeling is an art in itself, trying to get as much detail with as few polys as possible takes some practice, there is no formula for this. You create a low poly model and use techniques such as good UV textures and normal maps to enhance the look of the model in the game engine.<br>\n<br>\nTwo great places to start for game asset creation:<br>\nhttp://www.poopinmymouth.com/tutori<wbr>al/tutorial.htm <br>\nhttp://www.gameartisans.org/gamecon<wbr>/tutorials/tut_3.htm <br>\n<br>\nAnimating for games is pretty much the same as for movies, except that your model has a higher chance of deforming badly and you may not have as much control over your rig. Still the basic concepts of animation will always apply.<br>", "time": 1493151163, "resto": 561987, "capcode": "mod"}, {"no": 561989, "now": "04/25/17(Tue)16:13:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com":

Stock photos have a certain &quot;look&quot; to them, but in the dataset there&#039;s (potentially), a bunch of stock photos from Getty Images, images that are copyright.

The mom wouldn&#039;t blame the kid for letting it slip, she&#039;d blame the dad for knowingly letting it happen. Kind of a shitty analogy, but the point is that the watermark is the &quot;secret&quot; that slipped.

Because of forced diversity, especially in IT companies, employers are have to hire less than ideal candidates: blacks, hispanics, women, gays, and trannies. Epic is unable to reproduce Daz Studio for the same reason Daz Studio has been stagnating as a piece of software: the diversity hires are not at the same level of the people who created the tech in the first place.

Diffusion is a method that just statistically says how noise should be reduced with information from a text prompt. It takes white noise and passes over it several times, each time using math to figure out how the noise should best be reduced to match the prompt, based on a model. The model is basically what tells it what a square looks like, what a circle looks like, what a nose looks like, etc. But that model is not a collection of a bunch of different people&#039;s artworks, it&#039;s just a bunch of math formulas that are organized in a hierarchy. There is not a single shred of art in a Stable Diffusion model. It is NOT a database of art. There is no copy or remix of anything. None of the art that was fed into it was preserved, it was used to give the model statistical information about what things CAN look like. If you fed it a bunch of Picasso paintings it&#039;d never be able to replicate Picasso because things like &quot;nose&quot; and &quot;eye&quot; lose all meaning when it comes to cubism and depend very heavily on context, which is something AI does not understand. It can generate generic anime waifus because they all look very similar and it&#039;s easy to statistically describe how a nose should look in anime style. Try telling it to replicate something as simple as Calvin and Hobbes, and it can&#039;t.

The more appropriate comparison in the music world would be amp profiling like Kemper does, which has also been hotly debated, whether it breaks some kind of IP law or not. What amp profiling does is take a snapshot of a recording of a guitar through a given rig, and with math, figures out what a given input should give as an output. It&#039;s conceptually similar to Stable Diffusion, albeit way way waaaay simpler (it&#039;s not AI, it&#039;s really just basic algorithms). But, amp companies have tried to argue that this breaches their IP. The Kemper amp does not copy any circuitry or IP of any amp company. All it does is read the changes in a soundwave when a guitar is played through an amp, and replicates those changes digitally.<br>Also Kemper has been around for a decade and is basically a third tier company still, because people vastly prefer playing either real amps, or modelers like the Axe FX where you can just build your entire sound from scratch.", "time": 1674626263, "resto": 934276}, {"no": 934806, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)02:04:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p934276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;934276</a><br>Generates concepts much much faster.

Even if you work with your hands, doing some things creatively as opposed to doing them by the manual is always more fun. We even let kids be creative for fun.

Ai might be able to do ugly 3D models of bright animals, but that just replaces the sculpting part of 3D artist work. 3D artist also has to create the model from extrusion out of a cube to make good topology, and then also rig it properly. There are AIs that can help you animate better by adding physics, drag and other stuff to your keyframes, so you just make like 4 keyframes for kick animation ant the AI will make it look very organic. Those programs still suck at making rigs, because unsurprisingly they cant make drivers for shit. And none of this is again going to be automated anytime soon, this is very technical knowledge, something that the bots will strugle with. It is combination of visual learning, creativity and technical knowledge.

I personally think they&#039;re invaluable, because color affects your composition as much as lighting does. Ultimately, the role of a visual artist is to create a balanced, readable composition with a clear hierarchy and points of interest. It does *not* matter what causes that hierarchy materials or lighting, only that it is present through a combination of the two. I&#039;ve joined two images to my post: the first is an example of an environment with neutral materials and hierarchy created through lighting. The second is an example of an environment with neutral, flat lighting, and hierarchy created through materials. On most productions you&#039;ll be working with both (well honestly, you&#039;ll mostly be working with people who don&#039;t give a shit), but it&#039;s definitely possible to strongly prioritize materials or lighting on a production as an art direction choice.", "filename": "light-vs-materials", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1094, "h": 846, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1662068075323303, "time": 1662068075, "md5": "1PXwyb5VxPYfTS71Eksh3A==", "fsize": 708104, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 916230, "now": "09/01/22(Thu)17:35:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916218</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also tell me what do to in situations where the environment has lot of colorful props, but you\u2019re going for a desaturated TLOU type of look.

That said, creating a good environment begins with good set design practices. Take a look at how they populate a set in a movie or TV show: The color, lightness, and saturation of every object on set is carefully considered. The actors are gonna be dressed in specific colors, props throughout the set will respect color palettes, items (and people) that aren&#039;t important will get a color that will let them blend with their surrounding and those that you want to draw attention to will get a color that makes them stand out.<br><br>In games I still see few productions do this properly, and while it&#039;s 100% something that goes through the mind of most concept artists, it often gets lost when translated to level art, for a multitude of reasons. Perhaps modelers, texture artists, and level artists aren&#039;t keenly aware of those considerations, or often they&#039;re stuck working with a limited library of assets (if you NEED a barrel and your game only has barrels that come in ugly green, that&#039;s what you&#039;re stuck with.)<br><br>I personally believe that game productions need to rely more heavily on tintable materials, or produce several variants of their BC textures so the level artists can choose how light, dark, and colorful specific objects should be in order to best suit the scene&#039;s composition.", "time": 1662068149, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 916232, "now": "09/01/22(Thu)17:46:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916218</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Okay, but tell me what I should be doing, though</span><br>Have a good understanding of the rules of composition, then change anything that doesn&#039;t belong where it currently is. Wrong colors, wrong shapes, wrong textures. Your lighting and post process will supplement that, but you can&#039;t carry a scene with schizo materials, good work starts with what&#039;s in the scene itself before you even begin to light.<br><br>If you wanna show off lighting, it helps to build most of your scene with light materials, because you&#039;ll get more bounce light, and see the contrast between lights &amp; shadows better that way. If your scene looks like a schizo mess after lighting, you probably have too many dark and light materials close to each other creating unwanted material contrasts that overpower your lighting. Bring all the values closer together, by replacing your brightest or darkest standouts with stuff that&#039;s more aligned with your general color palette.<br><br>DON&#039;T fuck with your PBR and make your coal white or your snow gray to reduce your material contrast, though.

Either people reach out to you, or you reach out to people.<br><br>Don&#039;t expect the former to happen a lot as a junior, although it can. I used to live in a major gamedev city, so simply having my stuff trending on artstation, facebook groups, and having a linkedin profile led to a few recruiters reaching out to me. That said, you&#039;ll get more people contacting you once you have some experience on your profile. Also, people contacting you is great because that means *they&#039;re* interested, but you might not like what they have to offer. You&#039;ll mostly meet general-purpose recruiters who might or might not know how good of a fit you&#039;d be for their studio, so results may vary.<br><br>For doing the reaching out, this is purely anecdotal, but I think you&#039;re better off being picky where you apply, instead of casting a wide net and applying to every place you can find. There&#039;s no shortage of gamedev jobs, and you don&#039;t wanna be stuck in a place you hate, especially after you put years of effort building your skills. For example, as a junior, I don&#039;t recommend working with studios that have obvious bad art, or extremely small teams where you&#039;d practically be the sole 3D artist.

Think of games like Prey or Deus ex, which have levels with relatively small footprints, but filled with dense, varied content which makes them feel like a really fun toybox full of stuff to explore.

I&#039;m gonna judge hard surface and texturing at the same time since prop art is mostly that.<br><br>Here are three props that I would consider appropriate for a &quot;hireable&quot; AAA-junior portfolio:<br>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/<wbr>X1X48D<br>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/<wbr>klnoaA<br>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/<wbr>xY9gBY<br>Rather than comment on them individually, I&#039;ll look at them together. What I&#039;m looking here is mostly a display of baseline abilities in various aspects of the creation pipeline, which prove that whoever made these understands what a game art pipeline is generally about. From a very basic level, game prop art has two main goals: look truthful to real life, and fit within limitations of game engines.<br><br>1.: &quot;Look truthful to real life&quot;<br>-Whether real or invented, the props look like objects with a believable design and function<br>-The proportions are correct, for example buttons and handles have the right size for human hands, materials have an appropriate thickness, details have the right size for the way the materials can be worked<br>-All details are present and reflect the object&#039;s construction (for example the radio&#039;s body is assembled out of sheet metal and bolts, it&#039;s not a magic &quot;metal box&quot;)<br>-The materials respect PBR (more or less) and look like the surfaces they&#039;re meant to represent. Color, roughness, metalness and height information are appropriate for each surface.<br>-Wear and damages are distributed appropriately for surface type, and the expected usage of the item", "time": 1663183991, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918062, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)15:37:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p918061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;918061</a><br>2.: &quot;Fit within limitations of game engines&quot;<br>-Good polycount distribution means there are no wasteful polys or unnecessary loops, but the object does not look visibly faceted either where it should be smooth<br>-Bakes (if applicable) are free of errors<br>-Bake details come through properly: edge bevels are an appropriate width for each material, baked details are mostly small things that would be wasteful to keep as geo, and details that have a greater effect on the silhouette &amp; shadowing are kept as geo rather than baked<br>-The unwrap isn&#039;t wasteful, and the model is textured at a nice resolution<br>-There&#039;s details in the texturework that make the prop interesting both up-close and at a distance. Since game engine lighting is still pretty shit, it&#039;s very important to put more visual complexity in the textures so your prop doesn&#039;t look like a default lambert material.", "time": 1663184220, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918063, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)15:46:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p918062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;918062</a><br>Keep in mind these are all things I&#039;d expect juniors to show *understanding* of, not necessarily be perfect at. Photoreal textures are especially difficult to nail and not something I&#039;d expect a junior to fully achieve without help. Same for modeling, it doesn&#039;t need to be perfect, just most of the way there.<br><br>The props I linked have some flaws. The radio&#039;s green body is way too dark compared to its reference counterpart. The axe&#039;s head is missing unique details, the metal base texture is a bit lacking, and the upper segment of leather bands lacks thickness. Some of the cash register&#039;s larger forms are a bit too low poly, while some of its smaller details are too high poly and could be optimized or baked down.<br><br>But those are manageable flaws, there isn&#039;t a *ton* of them, and that&#039;s what makes them easy to work with. A more experienced artist could easily point out those flaws and help a junior gradually work on them, which is exactly what happens in an organized production.", "time": 1663184814, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918065, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)15:52:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916966</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A-any references for what a junior level character artist should be at?</span><br>If you&#039;re applying for a mid or large studio, it&#039;s as easy as looking up their other junior character artists and seeing what the quality bar is.

If you&#039;re doing realistic art, obviously, aim for realism. If you&#039;re doing stylized, there&#039;s so many different types of stylization that studios won&#039;t be looking for &quot;perfect matches&quot;, just people who understand the stylization process as a whole and who they can teach their studio&#039;s unique style to.

Composition, design theory, how to use the right colors and shapes, balance out designs, work from big to small, etc. That stuff isn&#039;t taught in game art courses and communities, yet it&#039;s an integral part of making game art and growing into more mature roles like becoming a director. It&#039;s also damn fun to be able to design your own things and have them come out great, instead of constantly stressing that the parts of your design that haven&#039;t been touched by a concept artist will come out the worst.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you pace yourself at work?

This means they might give you way less time to make something than you&#039;re used to, but they&#039;ll also be satisfied even if the result is utter shit. Learning where to cut corners becomes a useful skill to have in production. Besides that I&#039;d say be diligent, identify and work on your weaknesses, and your employers will never accuse you of being a slow worker.

For me, what keeps me working is the idea of creating an entire game that many people will get to enjoy, and having other talented people working alongside me. I see my art as part of a bigger whole (the game), which makes it a lot easier to accept the many compromises that you have to make on a daily basis when you work in production.<br>Another consideration that I&#039;ve had is that working on a game production is by far my best chance of getting some really ambitious projects realized. It&#039;s not 100% my dream, but my dream is so crazy and ambitious and something that I alone care about, whereas a game that I work on can contain 20, 30, 50% of that but eventually gets to see light. I also feel bad cutting corners on personal projects, but in production it&#039;s not only normal but expected, which helps a lot with finishing things guilt-free.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you wish you could work on without money or talent being in question?</span><br>Probably a game that brings people good emotions. It can be joy, sadness, plain old fun, get them to reflect on their lives a bit, on the condition of others, I just want to make a game people can take something away from. A lot of games are surprisingly lacking on that front, and aren&#039;t even fun. The best way I can describe them is they lack &quot;soul&quot;, you can just feel that they&#039;re big-budget productions &quot;by the numbers&quot; sometimes, and it&#039;s not clear why the games exist other than to sell you a product.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you wish others would understand about your job?</span><br>Honestly nothing lmao, I mostly wish game developers understood their own jobs better themselves sometimes.", "time": 1663186576, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918069, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)16:24:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p917024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;917024</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can i make money doing freelance stuff as an intermediate blender user</span><br>Sure, if you can make a model like that in an a-pose and give it a face that&#039;s not totally uncanny, you&#039;ll get work.<br>There are two things people might expect you to do as a freelance character artist that will most likely be a major pain in the butt: clothes, and hair.

Though now I won&#039;t have enough room.<br><br>First, you need to separate your lighting process in two parts. Technical execution, and artistic execution.<br><br>Technical execution is making sure your shit works properly, and is as physically correct as possible. This means using your engine to the best of its capacity, making sure all the features you need and can afford are working properly (AO, bounce light, reflections, shadows, so on.) This might seem like a &quot;duh&quot; thing, but a lot of people aren&#039;t using their game engines properly, for example tons of people using UE4 don&#039;t know how to get clean lighting bakes, how to unwrap lightmaps and build scenes so they don&#039;t break, etc. Another example could be shadows - if you use a directional light with shadow cascades, you need to enable contact shadows to get near shadows and distance field/far shadows to get distant shadows. Some people legitimately don&#039;t know about this and leave their directional with default settings, then wonder why their open world level looks so bad (because nothing is casting shadows past a couple hundred feet).<br><br>The second part of technical mastery is making your shit true to life. Things like having a realistic sun angle for the time of day, date, and distance from the equator (a northern winter sun will have long shadows while a summer sun near the tropics will have very short ones), making sure your surfaces have the correct albedo value to bounce enough light around, giving your lights correct intensities relative to each other (you can barely see most manmade lights under daylight, but at night they overpower moonlight almost completely).<br><br>(cont.)", "time": 1664163330, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 919696, "now": "09/25/22(Sun)23:39:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919695</a><br>Back in my day, I learned the technical side of CG lighting through Daedalus51&#039;s UE4 lighting series, which was one of the first widely available tutorial that covered a proper PBR lighting workflow in a time when everybody was still doing random shit.

And I specifically said *exterior* lighting.</span><br>Yeah I gotcha, we&#039;re getting to that.<br><br>So the secret of lighting, is that it&#039;s really just a tool for composition. There&#039;s no such thing as good &quot;lighters&quot;, only people who know how to use light to compose a good image (or scene, which is a series of images viewed from multiple angles). Ian Hubert said, &quot;people asked me to do a lighting tutorial, but really I&#039;m gonna do a composition tutorial because that&#039;s what lighting is&quot; (that video is on his patreon by the way, there&#039;s lots of cool CG knowledge there and the stuff he explains is almost always things no one has documented before.)<br><br>So, composition. Good composition is made through contrast, and hierarchy. 60-30-10, big read to small read, focal point, all that jazz. What makes exterior lighting look *bad*? Well, usually, it being flat. (And the scene not having a good distribution of colors, <a href=\"#p916229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916229</a> contains a great example of successful composition done with very flat lighting).<br><br>Why is it flat? Usually because you&#039;re not lighting your subject with a light and shadow side. Lighting from the front flattens, and can be a killer if you&#039;re not extremely careful. Lighting from the side ensures half the planes of your subject are lit and the other half are shaded, which is a very good way to describe form. Lighting from the back usually works well too, as it puts more accent on silhouettes, and makes cast shadows come towards the viewer, which not only looks really cool, but gives you more dark zones to build zones of value contrast with.<br><br>Remember, the point of lighting is to come up with a readable composition. An eye-catching focal point, nice framing through blocks of values, a light angle that describes form, and keeping things things outside the focal point simplified so you don&#039;t draw the eye away with lots of unnecessary contrast.<br><br>(cont.)", "time": 1664164399, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 919702, "now": "09/26/22(Mon)00:06:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919699</a><br>When you&#039;re indoors, or working with manmade lights, you can create zones of light and darkness (= blocks of values and zones of contrast, for your composition!) quite easily. But when you&#039;re outdoors, you run into a problem: The sun is a directional light, which casts light on every surface equally no matter the distance, caring only about surface angle.<br><br>Yes, you can create compositions through varying your surface materials (think of a landscape painting that&#039;s 70% sky, 20% field and 10% mountains), or by having some big shapes to create variation, though while that&#039;s gonna work at the level of an alley, it won&#039;t help you light something the size of a city.<br><br>Enter picrel: cloud shadows.<br><br>These can be done as Gobos, either as shadow casters set outside of the camera&#039;s field of view (for cutscenes and stills), or in the case of a walkable game environment, a simple light function that dims the directional with some fake panning clouds.

A couple prominent examples of games with great cloud shadows are Witcher 3, RDR2, and most recently AC: Valhalla (where they took advantage of the British setting to go hard with the cloud shadows, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a clear day in that game.) Nowadays some game engines (Unreal included) are able to cast cloud shadows from volumetric clouds, so that&#039;s a cool bonus because the placement of your shadows will be physically accurate (though since cloud shadows - on the ground - come from something that&#039;s offscreen - in the sky, viewers generally aren&#039;t too picky about their accuracy and you most likely won&#039;t be able to notice if a shadow in a shot is being bullshitted.<br><br>(cont.)", "filename": "cloud shadows", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2560, "h": 1764, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1664165172404690, "time": 1664165172, "md5": "tOjn58vsC/GKbXPu1MombQ==", "fsize": 1349989, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 919704, "now": "09/26/22(Mon)00:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919702</a><br>If you take a look at the image with the cloud shadows, and compare it to the one without, you can see that the composition with them is much better.

Use a sky with a faint light direction. This can work if your lighting is baked, but most realtime engines still struggle with hyper soft shadows, so your skylight&#039;s shadowing might not have any directionality. You can also add faint directional light with a very wide shadow radius that simulates some of your sun coming through the clouds, but good luck getting soft shadows with standard shadowmaps. Do note that using extra point lights/spotlights to enhance the direction of ambient light in cutscenes/stills is totally valid, and works well.<br><br>2. Use fog to create zones of interest.<br><br>3. Use the color of local surfaces to create zones of interest.<br><br>#3 is where your skill as a set designer really comes in. With a good color palette, interesting shapes, and an expert distribution of features, you can make even a flatly lit environment interesting.

In the realms of 2D vs 3D, that results in three sets you can pick up over time: general art skills, technical skills related to 3D, and technical skills related to 2D. The entry point is with either 2D or 3D skills, cause if you can&#039;t create an image by some kind of means, you obviously can&#039;t do any work on what goes *into* the image. But they&#039;re two separate paths to art mastery. A great 3D artist and a great 2D artist will both be able to produce good images, and they&#039;ll rely on the same fundamental rules of aesthetics and design, just executed via different mediums.<br>Do note that this means that coming from a trad art background, you would be able to make great images faster cause you&#039;d only have one set of skills left to learn rather than two (3D technical skills).<br><br><a href=\"#p929138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;929138</a><br>Who cares?

It depends on what you want to make though, it&#039;s quite a different job to make a realistic interior scenes than to make a fully rigged 3D character for games. There&#039;s a big difference if you rely on premade props to build your scenes or you do every bit yourself. Sculpting, modeling, retopology, texturing, shading, rigging, composing, animation, simulation, scripting, all are different skills within 3D art and few people master all these very well. If you want to be great at all this you would have to be very dedicated and spend most your time focused on this just to keep yourself updated with the development of 3D software.<br>The more realistic goal would be to find out which of these skills you want to be good at and start from there. <br>Personally i ended up spending much time on learning how to make animatable characters and i have found that topology is the most important aspect of this niche. You can make a character look amazing on a still photo with shitty topology, but once you start posing this character it will look like shit. I have probably about 50 attempts of retopology before i started to get it right, but then i rigged the character and it would still look like shit when posing it. At first i thought it was my rigging that was the problem, but then i realized it was actually the topology which i thought was good enough. So i had to go back to the drawing table and figure out exactly what i did wrong.

Unreal Engine also has a better license for independent developers; it&#039;s 100% free to use until your project generates more than $1 million in revenue, whereas with Unity you must pay to remove the splash screen in your game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blueprints or C++?</span><br>Both. When creating a new object, consider creating a C++ class, then a blueprint that derives from it to get the best of both worlds.<br>C++ is much better for performance and memory management. Certain types of code can be much easier to create and manage compared to blueprints. The downside of C++ is that it can be verbose and difficult to understand, particularly with Unreal Engine&#039;s archaic macros.<br>Blueprints are easier to learn initially and compile much quicker, but as they grow bigger, they can get very messy and difficult to manage. Operations involving real time loops, structs and casts in blueprints can cause performance issues.<br><br>For more information:<br>https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/<wbr>en-US/Resources/SampleGames/ARPG/Ba<wbr>lancingBlueprintAndCPP/<br>https://dev.epicgames.com/community<wbr>/learning/courses/bY/unreal-engine-<wbr>balancing-blueprint-and-c-in-game-d<wbr>evelopment/LdK/introduction-to-the-<wbr>course<br><br>Previous: <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;902644</span>", "filename": "movement", "ext": ".png", "w": 1600, "h": 805, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669808786175007, "time": 1669808786, "md5": "m2mced7yLC9lIIvl68iAxA==", "fsize": 601912, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ueg-unreal-engine-general", "replies": 91, "images": 13, "unique_ips": 49}, {"no": 927904, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)12:03:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "can i model like realistic rape?", "time": 1669827811, "resto": 927882}, {"no": 927913, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)14:22:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p927882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;927882</a><br>How powerful is the unreal node system?<br>I&#039;m not expecting houdini like functionality but can it do things you&#039;d do in blender shader and geometry nodes?", "time": 1669836130, "resto": 927882}, {"no": 927933, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)16:30:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p927913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;927913</a><br>You can procedurally generate meshes and textures, if that&#039;s what you mean.", "time": 1669843829, "resto": 927882}, {"no": 927942, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)17:39:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What is the reason for the new very retarded animation retargeting system?<br>It was extremely easy in version 4.

To go back to the hemispherical protrusions, I just noticed today they are slightly too large, and would prevent the removal several of the tubes in the center of the model. As the tube removal is an essential function of that device it is unacceptable and I consider that a violation of suspension of disbelief (very autistic, but I can&#039;t help it). This is a major headache to fix in blender and probably would take an hour or two of work.

I personally make a circular hole for the eye on a lower resolution while I&#039;m working for more geometry when I remesh, and when I remesh to a lower res after that one I draw the edges around the hole using a sharp brush, then mask the eye area, and from the front view use a grab brush with a projected falloff to shape the eye around the eyeball, then pinch the edges a bit and use the crease brush to make the fold above the eyelid. One thing that kinda tripped me up was that eyeballs are actually unexpectedly small, at least in realistic faces. The outer corners of the eye are actually more meat than eyeball but your mind processes it as part of the eye, kinda like how your fingers look longer from the top of the palm than from the bottom because you can clearly see the webbing from the top. Touch your eyes and note where the eyeball actually curves in. The general guide people throw around is that eyeballs are about 1 eyeball apart from each other. I&#039;m also always instinctively tempted to make the eyeballs larger than normal because it makes the eye area flatter and thus it&#039;s easier make it look less bad when you get the shape incorrectly, something else to avoid. I recommend having an actual, correctly sized pupil on the eyeball for size reference and seeing if your eye is too large relative to it.

And the more VRAM the easier it is to work with (you still need to optimize everything in the end because you dont ship your game to people who all run 3090s). <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can you explain why would these require less vram?</span><br>well because they use a lot more CPU / sys ram for most things. General modeling, history, a lot the sims are still CPU bound and so on. Your GPU is only really utilized in modeling programs when rendering and running GPU power sims (which is more and more the case). However since both Blender (Eevee) and UE5 use a deferred &quot;real-time&quot; render that does not require the entire scene to fit on your VRAM (it can work in chunks but ofc you lose heavily on performance and get stutters). <br>In Maya you have a host of different renders but most are paid options. However due to the age of Maya its a lot more CPU bound than GPU. 8GB might not to optimal but for doing work on a character or such and then moving the model to UE5 or such to render is not a problem. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve been thinking about 4080 as well, but worried 16GB may not be enough.

The best thing everyone in any creative field can hope for at this point, is that all the techjeets get replaced as well. And no, there wont be UBI to save us.

If you feel like you don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong, go to the /WIP/ thread or Blender general.<br>But by far your best move is to continue grinding on tutorials and revisit this when your fundamental knowledge improves even more than where it&#039;s at now.<br><a href=\"#p925534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;925534</a><br><a href=\"#p926174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;926174</a><br>Good job finishing the tutorial, looks more complex / advanced than the original donut tutorial. <br>Keep at it, do more, keep going.<br><a href=\"#p925777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;925777</a><br>Keep at it, you&#039;ll understand in time. You have to grind a lot of tutorials and piece together knowledge. You can also read about Subsurface on your own; the answer is Subsurface makes something translucent (the prime example is skin) then bounces some light back that matches the color of what&#039;s inside, so a Caucasian model that&#039;s going to use SS will have a texture that&#039;s green or grey (like real lifeless skin) and then red SS (like blood) and the combination will create the lively white/pink glow of a living person.<br>Human skin, while complex, is a little easier to grasp than the more strange/nuanced subsurface of the icing of a donut or how some light does pass through a tomato or whatever.<br>Key takeaway: Keep grinding on tutorials, do a little reading on your own, experiment A LITTLE (don&#039;t fall into the trap of reinventing the wheel), then move on to more tutorials.

Famous Japanese artists today are known to be extremely hard workers. Take, for example, one of the most well-known Japanese artists Yayoi Kusama. Even though Yayoi Kusam is dealing with mental illness, she goes to work every day and puts in long working hours. Yayoi Kusama continues to produce an astonishing amount of artwork \u2013 all by herself.<br><br>You can learn more about Yayoi Kusama, by reading our blog What Type Of Artist Is The Japanese Artist Yayoi Kusama? by clicking here.<br>5.

But in Japan the Japanese believe talent is important but also hard work and practice can help you to achieve your goals.<br><br>This is a little bit different from how many of us view artistic skills. A Japanese views artistic skills as something you can learn and master through practice and hard work. A person can learn to draw not because they are born with the talent, but they can practice and hard work at the skill of drawing.

I mean I guess that&#039;s kind of the point that it&#039;s fundamentally the same, but it still feels lacking in some aspects. Boids as an example is a neat concept, that&#039;s decent for making flocks of birds, but doing anything advanced with it is a lesson in patience. Doing anything more than birds/insects with them is asking for trouble. Particles isn&#039;t really where I&#039;d put &quot;crowd simulation&quot;, but something along those lines would be pretty interesting.<br>Particles are definitely going to be getting some love with Geo Nodes, so I&#039;m not too worried about that though.<br><br>NLA editor is god fucking awful.

To say nothing of animation layers, which needs to be a native feature imo.<br><br>The whole &quot;Texture&quot; panel of Blender still feels like a holdout from the Internal renderer though. It just seems like a weird, gated-off section of the software that interacts with other things, but you have to do very specific things to use it. There&#039;s a weird split between texture nodes in the panel, and texture nodes when shading, and they have little to no overlap or interaction with each other.
