There are many to choose from, such as:\n<br>\n-3DS Max<br>\n-Cinema 4D<br>\n-Maya<br>\n-Softimage XSI<br>\n-Lightwave<br>\n-Blender 3D (Free!)<br>\n<br>\nOnce you obtain one the next step is to start with tutorials. There are many on the net, they range from text and image tutorials to video tutorials. You aren&#039;t going to find a tutorial for everything out there, but most will explain techniques that you need to adapt in order for you to achieve whatever final result you want.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>2.) &quot;Wow! That&#039;s a lot of programs! Which one is best? I heard ______ is best.&quot;</i>\n<br>\nYou heard wrong, there is no one program that is better than the rest, it has and always will be the skill level of the artist. Which program you choose is solely dependent on your own personal taste and which aspect of the 3D industry you want to be involved in.<br>\nMax and Maya are the most hyped and so therefore the most used, they have the most available documentation online. The interfaces have a steep learning curve, but there isn&#039;t any 3D program you can&#039;t learn if you take the time to use it and follow some tutorials. Go with a generalized package, not a specialist one.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>3.) &quot;Whoah, Generalized vs Specialized? How do I know?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nA generalised package like Maya, Max, Softimage are packages that let you model, render, animate, texture, and create dynamics all within the same application. They don&#039;t require third party plugins or applications to add another basic feature, like a renderer or animation tools.<br>\nHowever you can get plugins for these apps to enhance their features. There are several Specialized applications out there that cater to a specific skill.<br>\n<br>\nAnimation: Motion Builder, Messiah 3D.<br>\nModeling: Modo, Wings3D, Silo 3D<br>\nCAD: Autocad, Sketchup, SolidWorks<br>\nDetailing: Zbrush, Mudbox, 3DCoat<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>4.) &quot;Ooooo Zbrush, I see so much awesome shit from that, I&#039;m gonna start there!&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, you&#039;re getting ahead of yourself. You should start learning about basic modeling and topology before jumping into Zbrush. Zbrush is a great program for advanced users to add detail to their existing models, or to prototype models quickly by sculpting them out.<br>\nIt is not a good idea to get into Zbrush when you&#039;re not very familiar with general 3D concepts<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>5) &quot;Ok, I see I&#039;m not very good at this stuff, can you model ______ for me?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, anybody with any decent skill on this board does this work for a living or for some kind of gain. Some of those just starting out may pick up the project but don&#039;t expect Miets Meier level of work. You get what you pay for.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>6.) &quot;But it&#039;s too haaaaaaaaard, isn&#039;t there any easy button?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, like all things it takes time and effort to master a program, practice makes perfect and playing around with the interface will get the shortcuts ingrained into your muscle memory.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>7.) &quot;So which program is the easiest to learn?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nYou shouldn&#039;t learn a program, you should learn techniques. When you master a technique the program becomes nothing more than a tool. As said before Max and Maya have the most documentation but you should look at learning how to model and the right techniques instead of &#039;what button does X&#039;.<br>\nYou can get UI information from the program&#039;s help files. F1 and Google are your friends.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>8.) &quot;So, what do studios look for when hiring if I don&#039;t know program ______ won&#039;t I get turned down?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nWhen a studio judges your demo reel and resume they have an order of priority.<br>\n<br>\n1-Quality of Work<br>\n2-Versatility<br>\n3-Experience<br>\n4-Program skills<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>9.) &quot;So studios don&#039;t care what program I use? Why do they care about versatility?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nExcept for Animators who are pretty much exempt from most rules of 3D, most studios want people who can perform multiple tasks instead of just a specialised one. They want modelers who can also texture, they want riggers who can also do dynamics, they want lighters who can also texture. It&#039;s ok to be specialised in one area, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to be versatile, it will always keep you employed.<br>\n<br>\nWhen a studio looks at your program skills they do often look to see if you have experience in their preferred in house package, but MANY times you&#039;re going to get a studio that has added their own tools and pipeline so it wouldn&#039;t matter what program you know as long as your skills are good. If you know techniques you can pretty much pickup any 3D package in a matter of days. Of course there are some that are hard set that you know program ________ but for the most part what package you know is not that important (yes even you Blender fags can get a job in a studio if you know good techniques.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>10.) &quot;What about gaming?&quot;<br></i>\nWhat about it?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>11.) &quot;How do I make my own game? How do I program shaders or a video game?&quot;<br></i>\nThis is a 3D board, not a programming board! Do you want to make 3D game assets or do you want to be a programmer?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>12.) &quot;Uhhhh....&quot;<br></i>\nExactly.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>13.) If you want to get into game asset creating, your three primary focus of interests are:<br></i>\n-Modeling<br>\n-Texturing<br>\n-Animation<br>\n<br>\nLow poly modeling is an art in itself, trying to get as much detail with as few polys as possible takes some practice, there is no formula for this. You create a low poly model and use techniques such as good UV textures and normal maps to enhance the look of the model in the game engine.<br>\n<br>\nTwo great places to start for game asset creation:<br>\nhttp://www.poopinmymouth.com/tutori<wbr>al/tutorial.htm <br>\nhttp://www.gameartisans.org/gamecon<wbr>/tutorials/tut_3.htm <br>\n<br>\nAnimating for games is pretty much the same as for movies, except that your model has a higher chance of deforming badly and you may not have as much control over your rig. Still the basic concepts of animation will always apply.<br>", "time": 1493151163, "resto": 561987, "capcode": "mod"}, {"no": 561989, "now": "04/25/17(Tue)16:13:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com":

Unreal Engine also has a better license for independent developers; it&#039;s 100% free to use until your project generates more than $1 million in revenue, whereas with Unity you must pay to remove the splash screen in your game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blueprints or C++?</span><br>Both. When creating a new object, consider creating a C++ class, then a blueprint that derives from it to get the best of both worlds.<br>C++ is much better for performance and memory management. Certain types of code can be much easier to create and manage compared to blueprints. The downside of C++ is that it can be verbose and difficult to understand, particularly with Unreal Engine&#039;s archaic macros.<br>Blueprints are easier to learn initially and compile much quicker, but as they grow bigger, they can get very messy and difficult to manage. Operations involving real time loops, structs and casts in blueprints can cause performance issues.<br><br>For more information:<br>https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/<wbr>en-US/Resources/SampleGames/ARPG/Ba<wbr>lancingBlueprintAndCPP/<br>https://dev.epicgames.com/community<wbr>/learning/courses/bY/unreal-engine-<wbr>balancing-blueprint-and-c-in-game-d<wbr>evelopment/LdK/introduction-to-the-<wbr>course<br><br>Previous: <a href=\"/3/thread/902644#p902644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;902644</a>", "filename": "movement", "ext": ".png", "w": 1600, "h": 805, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669808786175007, "time": 1669808786, "md5": "m2mced7yLC9lIIvl68iAxA==", "fsize": 601912, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ueg-unreal-engine-general", "replies": 47, "images": 13, "unique_ips": 30}, {"no": 927904, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)12:03:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "can i model like realistic rape?", "time": 1669827811, "resto": 927882}, {"no": 927913, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)14:22:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p927882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;927882</a><br>How powerful is the unreal node system?<br>I&#039;m not expecting houdini like functionality but can it do things you&#039;d do in blender shader and geometry nodes?", "time": 1669836130, "resto": 927882}, {"no": 927933, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)16:30:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p927913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;927913</a><br>You can procedurally generate meshes and textures, if that&#039;s what you mean.", "time": 1669843829, "resto": 927882}, {"no": 927942, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)17:39:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What is the reason for the new very retarded animation retargeting system?<br>It was extremely easy in version 4.

To go back to the hemispherical protrusions, I just noticed today they are slightly too large, and would prevent the removal several of the tubes in the center of the model. As the tube removal is an essential function of that device it is unacceptable and I consider that a violation of suspension of disbelief (very autistic, but I can&#039;t help it).

It almost looks like skin that&#039;s cracked and then been candied. It&#039;s disgusting. I have a feeling it&#039;s just not scaled enough so I&#039;ll try that first.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am not really sure why the planks has spaces between em</span><br>From what I know it depends what they&#039;re storing.

In the realms of 2D vs 3D, that results in three sets you can pick up over time: general art skills, technical skills related to 3D, and technical skills related to 2D.

It depends on what you want to make though, it&#039;s quite a different job to make a realistic interior scenes than to make a fully rigged 3D character for games. There&#039;s a big difference if you rely on premade props to build your scenes or you do every bit yourself. Sculpting, modeling, retopology, texturing, shading, rigging, composing, animation, simulation, scripting, all are different skills within 3D art and few people master all these very well. If you want to be great at all this you would have to be very dedicated and spend most your time focused on this just to keep yourself updated with the development of 3D software.<br>The more realistic goal would be to find out which of these skills you want to be good at and start from there. <br>Personally i ended up spending much time on learning how to make animatable characters and i have found that topology is the most important aspect of this niche. You can make a character look amazing on a still photo with shitty topology, but once you start posing this character it will look like shit. I have probably about 50 attempts of retopology before i started to get it right, but then i rigged the character and it would still look like shit when posing it. At first i thought it was my rigging that was the problem, but then i realized it was actually the topology which i thought was good enough. So i had to go back to the drawing table and figure out exactly what i did wrong.

Well, you get more control over interpolation curves and such in blender but the difference isn&#039;t big.

MMD is limited to global space &quot;copy rotation/translation&quot; and IK in which you can&#039;t control IK axis limits in local space, and since almost all MMD models are in A-pose you can&#039;t really make correct elbow bending using IK. Well you can through a ridiculous hack I worked out a while back, I forget the exact details since it was so long ago but it involved having the axis limited IK chain in t-pose, lowering the ik chain using a IK parent pointing 30deg down, and aiming the actual a-pose limbs using IK toward the IK bones, and then copying the IK chain&#039;s twist across the twist bones along the arm (to make nice arm twisting). You also obviously can&#039;t use shapekeys in MMD, only corrective bones at best, but this is potentially another problem since MMD, and most realtime engines limit you to 4 vertex groups per bone whereas you can have unlimited vertex groups in blender, and the 4 vgroup limit can make it hard to squeeze in corrective bones. Well, all of this would require some manual re-rigging (ie adjusting the bone structure and constraints/scripted drivers) and possibly even re-skinning (ie adjusting the weights on the mesh) but I consider those part of good animation, so.", "time": 1668642455, "resto": 926164}, {"no": 926255, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:03:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p926164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;926164</a><br>MMD is totally fine, OP.

I guess the intentional exaggeration adds to that as well. 3DCG is a more modern medium, so I guess people don\u2019t expect to see this type of stuff even though people who do real-life sculpting make stuff like this, albeit less pornographic. I know the hands are still fucked, she\u2019s obviously missing her head and feet, and the sculpt is still at a low resolution so there is a lot of refining and cleaning that could be done.

They are very horizontally long and stick forward, the nipples are outward-facing, but the actual mass of the breasts is not. The breasts are squeezed together in an unnatural way, but the tips are pointed outward. They need to either hang naturally, or sit unnaturally in a way that still looks good (usually meaning giving them support and treating them like they&#039;re in a bra even though they aren&#039;t). The top of the breast does not hang from the entire width of the chest, either.<br>* The arms are not attractively shaped, The shoulder in particular is way too broad compared to the center of the bicep, which should be just about as thick.<br>* The chest is narrow to the point of looking alien, especially with the size of the breasts. The ribs are very conical as well, when the upper body shouldn&#039;t taper down that thin gradually. The rear view especially looks wonky.<br>* Those abs. It&#039;s like a stylized pulsing cock vein. No ribs or real connection to the thorax at all.<br>* You know the issues with the hands, and the legs being way too long.

Stylization is a great reason to not have perfect anatomy or proportions, but you still need to have a good knowledge and understanding of anatomy and proportion to make good stylization. If somebody who doesn&#039;t understand human anatomy and proportion well does strong stylization, it usually looks off in a lot of places that have simple fixes, and at worst looks like it was done by a child. People in real life do stylized sculptures as well, but the ones that look good are still based in anatomical knowledge. 3DCG does not have stricter critique than life sculptures for anatomy and proportion. I see WAY MORE intense stylization in 3DCG than in physical sculptures. Stylization can be an explanation, but it&#039;s not an excuse. If somebody tells you that it doesn&#039;t look good because the proportions are unpleasing, saying &quot;it&#039;s stylized&quot; does not suddenly make it look good. Stylization means you can violate real proportions and anatomy, but it still needs to look good, and every part should still look planned, rather than accidental.<br><br>But, at first, you&#039;re going to be posting things that look like shit. Every realistic attempt looks very wrong to you and everybody else, because you&#039;re still learning, and every stylized attempt looks fine to you but shit to everybody else.

I personally think they&#039;re invaluable, because color affects your composition as much as lighting does. Ultimately, the role of a visual artist is to create a balanced, readable composition with a clear hierarchy and points of interest. It does *not* matter what causes that hierarchy materials or lighting, only that it is present through a combination of the two. I&#039;ve joined two images to my post: the first is an example of an environment with neutral materials and hierarchy created through lighting. The second is an example of an environment with neutral, flat lighting, and hierarchy created through materials. On most productions you&#039;ll be working with both (well honestly, you&#039;ll mostly be working with people who don&#039;t give a shit), but it&#039;s definitely possible to strongly prioritize materials or lighting on a production as an art direction choice.", "filename": "light-vs-materials", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1094, "h": 846, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1662068075323303, "time": 1662068075, "md5": "1PXwyb5VxPYfTS71Eksh3A==", "fsize": 708104, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 916230, "now": "09/01/22(Thu)17:35:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916218</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also tell me what do to in situations where the environment has lot of colorful props, but you\u2019re going for a desaturated TLOU type of look.

That said, creating a good environment begins with good set design practices. Take a look at how they populate a set in a movie or TV show: The color, lightness, and saturation of every object on set is carefully considered. The actors are gonna be dressed in specific colors, props throughout the set will respect color palettes, items (and people) that aren&#039;t important will get a color that will let them blend with their surrounding and those that you want to draw attention to will get a color that makes them stand out.<br><br>In games I still see few productions do this properly, and while it&#039;s 100% something that goes through the mind of most concept artists, it often gets lost when translated to level art, for a multitude of reasons. Perhaps modelers, texture artists, and level artists aren&#039;t keenly aware of those considerations, or often they&#039;re stuck working with a limited library of assets (if you NEED a barrel and your game only has barrels that come in ugly green, that&#039;s what you&#039;re stuck with.)<br><br>I personally believe that game productions need to rely more heavily on tintable materials, or produce several variants of their BC textures so the level artists can choose how light, dark, and colorful specific objects should be in order to best suit the scene&#039;s composition.", "time": 1662068149, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 916232, "now": "09/01/22(Thu)17:46:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916218</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Okay, but tell me what I should be doing, though</span><br>Have a good understanding of the rules of composition, then change anything that doesn&#039;t belong where it currently is.

Bring all the values closer together, by replacing your brightest or darkest standouts with stuff that&#039;s more aligned with your general color palette.<br><br>DON&#039;T fuck with your PBR and make your coal white or your snow gray to reduce your material contrast, though.

Either people reach out to you, or you reach out to people.<br><br>Don&#039;t expect the former to happen a lot as a junior, although it can. I used to live in a major gamedev city, so simply having my stuff trending on artstation, facebook groups, and having a linkedin profile led to a few recruiters reaching out to me. That said, you&#039;ll get more people contacting you once you have some experience on your profile. Also, people contacting you is great because that means *they&#039;re* interested, but you might not like what they have to offer. You&#039;ll mostly meet general-purpose recruiters who might or might not know how good of a fit you&#039;d be for their studio, so results may vary.<br><br>For doing the reaching out, this is purely anecdotal, but I think you&#039;re better off being picky where you apply, instead of casting a wide net and applying to every place you can find. There&#039;s no shortage of gamedev jobs, and you don&#039;t wanna be stuck in a place you hate, especially after you put years of effort building your skills. For example, as a junior, I don&#039;t recommend working with studios that have obvious bad art, or extremely small teams where you&#039;d practically be the sole 3D artist. These places might be eager to hire you out of desperation, but they&#039;re a career trap: you can spend a decade at a place like that and never grow your skills, which will eventually leave you unemployable for anything other than more shit jobs.<br><br>Being picky also helps you once you make it to the interview. You&#039;ll have an easier time explaining naturally why you&#039;re interested in the studio, because, well, you have a genuine interest in them and chose them instead of them being just another job that pays you money. Lemme tell you, finding a junior with decent skills, a solid head, and interest in the studio, pretty much makes you a unicorn. They HAVE to give you the job at that point.", "time": 1662138130, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 916329, "now": "09/02/22(Fri)13:24:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916245</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what did your portfolio look like?</span><br>Lastly I wanted to answer this, but I genuinely can&#039;t find images of my old stuff, and tech + standards have changed so much since then it&#039;s basically no longer relevant. Instead I encourage you to look on artstation, sort by new, look for a variety of posts and see if the person has got a job, where, and doing what. You&#039;ll find a good amount of junior pro portfolios that way.<br><br>One thing you&#039;ll see is that the skill &quot;floor&quot; can vary greatly between studios. There&#039;s some &quot;leads&quot; out there that have portfolios so bad I wouldn&#039;t hire them as a junior. Tempting as it may, you probably don&#039;t wanna work with these people, or compare yourself to them. They can do nothing for you.<br><br>Here&#039;s a few examples of pieces I would consider &quot;acceptable&quot; from a junior.

I&#039;m reminded of a time Ian Hubert said he was asked to do a &quot;lighting tutorial&quot;, and he basically did a composition tutorial instead, because what people call &quot;good lighting&quot; is essentially just good composition.<br><br>https://www.artstation.com/learning<wbr>/instructors/wootha<br>Watch &quot;Composition in Painting&quot; and &quot;Practical Composition&quot; from this guy, they&#039;re excellent technical breakdowns of the broad, overarching rules of composition.<br>Once you&#039;re done with Wootha, look up a book called &quot;The Visual Story&quot; by Bruce Block. Wootha covers broad image theory, Bruce Block will help you see how it&#039;s applied to film in a practical manner.<br>With these two you should be good for a while. Come back to them regularly as you won&#039;t be able to retain all the information from the get go and will need several refreshers, inbetween doing work and trying to apply what you&#039;ve learned from them. Feel free to supplement your learning with additional material on composition as there&#039;s plenty of other stuff to learn, just try not to spread yourself too thin.<br><br><br>Protip: when you wanna learn ART, don&#039;t look for game art resources. People who teach game art overwhelmingly deal with the TECH side of it, but can be pretty clueless when it comes to art. You&#039;ll find better resources in cinematography, photography, and (sometimes) illustration teachers.", "time": 1662140138, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 916333, "now": "09/02/22(Fri)13:48:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916317</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How would you go about making an urban environment (a city) that&#039;s not too big but still gives you the motivation to explore it?</span><br>Your statement makes it seem like you might correlate an environment&#039;s size with how engaging it is to explore, which definitely isn&#039;t the case. Thing is, a lot of how much long-lasting fun a game provides ultimately boils down to content, but not just art content. Think of games like Prey or Deus ex, which have levels with relatively small footprints, but filled with dense, varied content which makes them feel like a really fun toybox full of stuff to explore. Now compare those to a massive dead open world like release-era No Man&#039;s Sky, which simulates the entire universe but gives you nothing to do in it. There&#039;s no singular element the success of Prey&#039;s levels or the failure of NMS&#039;s boils down to, it&#039;s about the amount of content that&#039;s presented to the player, and how polished that content is.<br><br>Visually, though? Prototype your levels with sizes that are good for GAMEPLAY, then build art vistas outside the playable area to give the player a sense of scale.

What I&#039;m looking here is mostly a display of baseline abilities in various aspects of the creation pipeline, which prove that whoever made these understands what a game art pipeline is generally about. From a very basic level, game prop art has two main goals: look truthful to real life, and fit within limitations of game engines.<br><br>1.: &quot;Look truthful to real life&quot;<br>-Whether real or invented, the props look like objects with a believable design and function<br>-The proportions are correct, for example buttons and handles have the right size for human hands, materials have an appropriate thickness, details have the right size for the way the materials can be worked<br>-All details are present and reflect the object&#039;s construction (for example the radio&#039;s body is assembled out of sheet metal and bolts, it&#039;s not a magic &quot;metal box&quot;)<br>-The materials respect PBR (more or less) and look like the surfaces they&#039;re meant to represent. Color, roughness, metalness and height information are appropriate for each surface.<br>-Wear and damages are distributed appropriately for surface type, and the expected usage of the item", "time": 1663183991, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918062, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)15:37:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p918061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;918061</a><br>2.: &quot;Fit within limitations of game engines&quot;<br>-Good polycount distribution means there are no wasteful polys or unnecessary loops, but the object does not look visibly faceted either where it should be smooth<br>-Bakes (if applicable) are free of errors<br>-Bake details come through properly: edge bevels are an appropriate width for each material, baked details are mostly small things that would be wasteful to keep as geo, and details that have a greater effect on the silhouette &amp; shadowing are kept as geo rather than baked<br>-The unwrap isn&#039;t wasteful, and the model is textured at a nice resolution<br>-There&#039;s details in the texturework that make the prop interesting both up-close and at a distance. Since game engine lighting is still pretty shit, it&#039;s very important to put more visual complexity in the textures so your prop doesn&#039;t look like a default lambert material.", "time": 1663184220, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918063, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)15:46:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p918062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;918062</a><br>Keep in mind these are all things I&#039;d expect juniors to show *understanding* of, not necessarily be perfect at. Photoreal textures are especially difficult to nail and not something I&#039;d expect a junior to fully achieve without help. Same for modeling, it doesn&#039;t need to be perfect, just most of the way there.<br><br>The props I linked have some flaws. The radio&#039;s green body is way too dark compared to its reference counterpart. The axe&#039;s head is missing unique details, the metal base texture is a bit lacking, and the upper segment of leather bands lacks thickness. Some of the cash register&#039;s larger forms are a bit too low poly, while some of its smaller details are too high poly and could be optimized or baked down.<br><br>But those are manageable flaws, there isn&#039;t a *ton* of them, and that&#039;s what makes them easy to work with. A more experienced artist could easily point out those flaws and help a junior gradually work on them, which is exactly what happens in an organized production.", "time": 1663184814, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918065, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)15:52:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p916966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916966</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A-any references for what a junior level character artist should be at?</span><br>If you&#039;re applying for a mid or large studio, it&#039;s as easy as looking up their other junior character artists and seeing what the quality bar is. If you&#039;re applying for a small studio and don&#039;t have any examples... I&#039;d look at big studios&#039; juniors still and extrapolate.<br><br>As for style, I wouldn&#039;t worry. If you&#039;re doing realistic art, obviously, aim for realism. If you&#039;re doing stylized, there&#039;s so many different types of stylization that studios won&#039;t be looking for &quot;perfect matches&quot;, just people who understand the stylization process as a whole and who they can teach their studio&#039;s unique style to.

Composition, design theory, how to use the right colors and shapes, balance out designs, work from big to small, etc. That stuff isn&#039;t taught in game art courses and communities, yet it&#039;s an integral part of making game art and growing into more mature roles like becoming a director. It&#039;s also damn fun to be able to design your own things and have them come out great, instead of constantly stressing that the parts of your design that haven&#039;t been touched by a concept artist will come out the worst.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you pace yourself at work? As in how do you make sure you&#039;re not working too fast or too slow?</span><br>Timelines in most studios are pretty forgiving for the *quality* of work they&#039;ll expect. This means they might give you way less time to make something than you&#039;re used to, but they&#039;ll also be satisfied even if the result is utter shit. Learning where to cut corners becomes a useful skill to have in production. Besides that I&#039;d say be diligent, identify and work on your weaknesses, and your employers will never accuse you of being a slow worker. (You might still strain to achieve your own standards, though.)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any trial by fire moments that changed how you feel or think about your work?</span><br>Any time I do something new, it makes me reevaluate my perspective and helps me learn a bit more about game production.

For me, what keeps me working is the idea of creating an entire game that many people will get to enjoy, and having other talented people working alongside me. I see my art as part of a bigger whole (the game), which makes it a lot easier to accept the many compromises that you have to make on a daily basis when you work in production.<br>Another consideration that I&#039;ve had is that working on a game production is by far my best chance of getting some really ambitious projects realized. It&#039;s not 100% my dream, but my dream is so crazy and ambitious and something that I alone care about, whereas a game that I work on can contain 20, 30, 50% of that but eventually gets to see light. I also feel bad cutting corners on personal projects, but in production it&#039;s not only normal but expected, which helps a lot with finishing things guilt-free.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you wish you could work on without money or talent being in question?</span><br>Probably a game that brings people good emotions.

The best way I can describe them is they lack &quot;soul&quot;, you can just feel that they&#039;re big-budget productions &quot;by the numbers&quot; sometimes, and it&#039;s not clear why the games exist other than to sell you a product.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you wish others would understand about your job?</span><br>Honestly nothing lmao, I mostly wish game developers understood their own jobs better themselves sometimes.", "time": 1663186576, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 918069, "now": "09/14/22(Wed)16:24:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p917024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;917024</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can i make money doing freelance stuff as an intermediate blender user</span><br>Sure, if you can make a model like that in an a-pose and give it a face that&#039;s not totally uncanny, you&#039;ll get work.<br>There are two things people might expect you to do as a freelance character artist that will most likely be a major pain in the butt: clothes, and hair.

Though now I won&#039;t have enough room.<br><br>First, you need to separate your lighting process in two parts. Technical execution, and artistic execution.<br><br>Technical execution is making sure your shit works properly, and is as physically correct as possible. This means using your engine to the best of its capacity, making sure all the features you need and can afford are working properly (AO, bounce light, reflections, shadows, so on.) This might seem like a &quot;duh&quot; thing, but a lot of people aren&#039;t using their game engines properly, for example tons of people using UE4 don&#039;t know how to get clean lighting bakes, how to unwrap lightmaps and build scenes so they don&#039;t break, etc. Another example could be shadows - if you use a directional light with shadow cascades, you need to enable contact shadows to get near shadows and distance field/far shadows to get distant shadows. Some people legitimately don&#039;t know about this and leave their directional with default settings, then wonder why their open world level looks so bad (because nothing is casting shadows past a couple hundred feet).<br><br>The second part of technical mastery is making your shit true to life. Things like having a realistic sun angle for the time of day, date, and distance from the equator (a northern winter sun will have long shadows while a summer sun near the tropics will have very short ones), making sure your surfaces have the correct albedo value to bounce enough light around, giving your lights correct intensities relative to each other (you can barely see most manmade lights under daylight, but at night they overpower moonlight almost completely).<br><br>(cont.)", "time": 1664163330, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 919696, "now": "09/25/22(Sun)23:39:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919695</a><br>Back in my day, I learned the technical side of CG lighting through Daedalus51&#039;s UE4 lighting series, which was one of the first widely available tutorial that covered a proper PBR lighting workflow in a time when everybody was still doing random shit.

And I specifically said *exterior* lighting.</span><br>Yeah I gotcha, we&#039;re getting to that.<br><br>So the secret of lighting, is that it&#039;s really just a tool for composition. There&#039;s no such thing as good &quot;lighters&quot;, only people who know how to use light to compose a good image (or scene, which is a series of images viewed from multiple angles). Ian Hubert said, &quot;people asked me to do a lighting tutorial, but really I&#039;m gonna do a composition tutorial because that&#039;s what lighting is&quot; (that video is on his patreon by the way, there&#039;s lots of cool CG knowledge there and the stuff he explains is almost always things no one has documented before.)<br><br>So, composition. Good composition is made through contrast, and hierarchy. 60-30-10, big read to small read, focal point, all that jazz. What makes exterior lighting look *bad*? Well, usually, it being flat. (And the scene not having a good distribution of colors, <a href=\"#p916229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;916229</a> contains a great example of successful composition done with very flat lighting).<br><br>Why is it flat? Usually because you&#039;re not lighting your subject with a light and shadow side. Lighting from the front flattens, and can be a killer if you&#039;re not extremely careful. Lighting from the side ensures half the planes of your subject are lit and the other half are shaded, which is a very good way to describe form. Lighting from the back usually works well too, as it puts more accent on silhouettes, and makes cast shadows come towards the viewer, which not only looks really cool, but gives you more dark zones to build zones of value contrast with.<br><br>Remember, the point of lighting is to come up with a readable composition. An eye-catching focal point, nice framing through blocks of values, a light angle that describes form, and keeping things things outside the focal point simplified so you don&#039;t draw the eye away with lots of unnecessary contrast.<br><br>(cont.)", "time": 1664164399, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 919702, "now": "09/26/22(Mon)00:06:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919699</a><br>When you&#039;re indoors, or working with manmade lights, you can create zones of light and darkness (= blocks of values and zones of contrast, for your composition!) quite easily. But when you&#039;re outdoors, you run into a problem: The sun is a directional light, which casts light on every surface equally no matter the distance, caring only about surface angle.<br><br>Yes, you can create compositions through varying your surface materials (think of a landscape painting that&#039;s 70% sky, 20% field and 10% mountains), or by having some big shapes to create variation, though while that&#039;s gonna work at the level of an alley, it won&#039;t help you light something the size of a city.<br><br>Enter picrel: cloud shadows.<br><br>These can be done as Gobos, either as shadow casters set outside of the camera&#039;s field of view (for cutscenes and stills), or in the case of a walkable game environment, a simple light function that dims the directional with some fake panning clouds. A few open world games do this. Quite surprisingly, several others don&#039;t. A couple prominent examples of games with great cloud shadows are Witcher 3, RDR2, and most recently AC: Valhalla (where they took advantage of the British setting to go hard with the cloud shadows, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a clear day in that game.) Nowadays some game engines (Unreal included) are able to cast cloud shadows from volumetric clouds, so that&#039;s a cool bonus because the placement of your shadows will be physically accurate (though since cloud shadows - on the ground - come from something that&#039;s offscreen - in the sky, viewers generally aren&#039;t too picky about their accuracy and you most likely won&#039;t be able to notice if a shadow in a shot is being bullshitted.<br><br>(cont.)", "filename": "cloud shadows", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2560, "h": 1764, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1664165172404690, "time": 1664165172, "md5": "tOjn58vsC/GKbXPu1MombQ==", "fsize": 1349989, "resto": 916215}, {"no": 919704, "now": "09/26/22(Mon)00:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919702</a><br>If you take a look at the image with the cloud shadows, and compare it to the one without, you can see that the composition with them is much better.

Use a sky with a faint light direction. This can work if your lighting is baked, but most realtime engines still struggle with hyper soft shadows, so your skylight&#039;s shadowing might not have any directionality. You can also add faint directional light with a very wide shadow radius that simulates some of your sun coming through the clouds, but good luck getting soft shadows with standard shadowmaps. Do note that using extra point lights/spotlights to enhance the direction of ambient light in cutscenes/stills is totally valid, and works well.<br><br>2. Use fog to create zones of interest.<br><br>3. Use the color of local surfaces to create zones of interest.<br><br>#3 is where your skill as a set designer really comes in. With a good color palette, interesting shapes, and an expert distribution of features, you can make even a flatly lit environment interesting.

With this release, we\u2019ve built upon the groundbreaking feature set introduced in UE5, making it more robust, efficient, and versatile for creators across all industries. As part of this effort, we\u2019ve been stress-testing the engine against different workflows, making it applicable to more sectors.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We\u2019ve laid the groundwork for the Lumen dynamic global illumination and reflections system, the Nanite virtualized micropolygon geometry system, and Virtual Shadow Maps (VSM) to support games and experiences running at 60 fps on next-gen consoles and capable PCs, enabling fast-paced competitive games and detailed simulations to run without latency. Lumen now supports the Two-Sided Foliage shading model, by gathering lighting from the backface and scattering it through the leaf, attenuated by the material&#039;s Subsurface Color.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meanwhile, Nanite has also been updated with a Programmable Rasterizer to allow for material-driven animations and deformations via World Position Offset, as well as opacity masks. This exciting development paves the way for artists to use Nanite to program specific objects\u2019 behavior, for example Nanite-based foliage with leaves blowing in the wind.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In this release, we\u2019ve continued to enhance tools for building massive open worlds with additional functionality and improved workflows.

I have the Space Navigator one.<br>When not using it for 3d, it makes a handy scroll wheel that works extremely smooth, and the buttons on the side help out too for opening/closing tabs. I use it occasionally in PS as well for panning/zooming. They also have a really nice weight to them so they don&#039;t move around.<br><br>For 3d, and Blender specifically, it&#039;s a godsend for navigating a scene. One quick movement and I&#039;m right where I need to be with exact finesse. Only real issue is with Blender itself, in that zoom and camera movement is tied to the object you&#039;ve got focused. So if you focus on a tiny object and try and move the camera out a lot it&#039;ll move slow, but if you have a large object and try to move small amounts it&#039;ll move too fast. This isn&#039;t a problem with the 3d mouse, just more the contextual nature of Blender. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a setting to not do it, but it&#039;s not too much of an issue, and the benefits outweigh the little issue I have.<br><br>I think the 3d mouse itself is reasonably priced (I think I got mine new for like $99), but I think the bigger ones with the shortcuts are a bit of a waste to be honest. In all likelihood you won&#039;t be using them at all unless you make a conscious effort to. Not to mention that with the next size up you only get 4 programmable keys (opposed to 2 on the basic one), and 12 on the biggest one. They&#039;re not exactly placed in a way you can reach them super comfortably without taking your hand off the controller, especially the biggest one, so it&#039;s not really much of an advantage compared to pressing the key normally, or using a macro on your keyboard.<br><br>I&#039;d just grab the basic one new if you&#039;re on the fence.

Did you work on a famous movie? Do you think you were irreplaceable? Do you honestly think, that the movie you were a part of was made better thanks to your presence, or that the end user noticed the minor parts of the massive production you were a part of? You&#039;ll never hear the opinion of the end user on the work you personally did, unless you&#039;re an actor or a director. You&#039;ll only hear what they thought of the whole. The only thing you&#039;ve gained, is a name in the credits, some bragging rights and some extra coin in your employer&#039;s pocket, and maybe the respect of your peers, but did the end product of *your* work, not the production as a whole, truly have any meaning?

Would I be happier doing something non-porn related on my own instead? Possibly, I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m happy enough with what I do right now, and have no regrets about switching.

In the more civilized world children move out because: they found a job in a different city, their parents&#039; home isn&#039;t big enough, they&#039;re making bank and are only temporarily moving out to build a large house at which point their parents will move in with them.<br><br>Moving out because &quot;I just want to do my thing&quot; is financially and socially devastating as the entire US society proves it. Moving out will severely decrease your chances of starting a family because: you will give a large portion of your salary to strangers for rent, if you get married you will need to pay another large portion of your salary to strangers so they can babysit your kids while you and your wife are busy making money in order to pay the bills, your leisure time will be spent on running errands, your health will be diminished because you will simply not have the time to cook your own meals, etc. If you live with your parents: you will not pay any rent, you will have a 24/7 free babysitter, a 24/7 free cook, a 24/7 assistant who can run basic errands for you.<br><br>If in your particular case your father wants you to move out in order for him to &quot;do his own thing&quot; then fuck him.

A NURBS object is essentially a flat plane that&#039;s been sculpted/deformed into another shape. (e.g. a cylinder is a NURBS plane bent into a circle) The NURBS object itself IS the UV texture coordinates. It&#039;s like if you did planar mapping on a plane and then bent that plane into something else. <br><br>But there are serious disadvantages:<br><br>1. NURBS models are usually made of multiple objects stitched together, so this means you have multiple objects with different texture coordinates that don&#039;t line up with one another. <br><br>A typical car model is typically made of hundreds or even thousands of NURBS objects! Imagine texturing all of those and having thousands of textures (image files)- it&#039;s insane. <br><br>2.Another problem with NURBS is texture stretching. Because the object itself is the texture coordinates you run into the issues of &quot;local detail&quot;. This means areas of the NURBS object with high concentrations of vertices will have sharper textures while areas where the vertices are spread apart, the texture will look more blurry there. <br><br>Again, think of a NURBS object as just a plane with planar mapping. If you started to stretch and deform this plane into another shape, of course you would see some texture stretching.<br><br>Most complex NURBS models just use plain colors- no textures. In manufacturing of real objects (what NURBS is used for today) you don&#039;t have to worry about texturing in 3D software. Any textures you need will be applied in real life in way that isn&#039;t bound by limitations of 3D software. There is no texture stretching in the real world!<br>-------<br><br>Hope this helped, anons.", "filename": "hhgg", "ext": ".png", "w": 768, "h": 981, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1664229279116425, "time": 1664229279, "md5": "xwkbPTqAMEY23km0bE2WKg==", "fsize": 826388, "resto": 917389}, {"no": 919882, "now": "09/27/22(Tue)09:37:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p917787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;917787</a><br>Are there some in-depth tutorial with voice over \u01a1n this workflow ?", "time": 1664285841, "resto": 917389}, {"no": 920510, "now": "10/01/22(Sat)19:17:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919882</a><br>_bump", "time": 1664666254, "resto": 917389}, {"no": 920532, "now": "10/01/22(Sat)23:06:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p917787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;917787</a><br>Moi isn&#039;t good software for me, it enters into a calculation loop when doing boolean unions and stuff, it&#039;s annoying.", "time": 1664679964, "resto": 917389}, {"no": 920892, "now": "10/04/22(Tue)08:16:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p919818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;919818</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was the one who uploaded that!</span><br>How the fuck did you find it?

What you use in your workflow and to what extent will depend on what you want to do as a 3d artist. Is it 3D printable anime figurines like pic related and/or characters destined for animation? Zbrush is what you will need for sculpting these and its zmodeler will allow to do things like armor and swords. Note that Zbrush is a CPU-dependant software and the better viewport performance you want, the better single threaded cpu with higher frequency and such you desire. There&#039;s a trade off between more of that and more cores so mind the sweet spot (there are some graphs that show it I&#039;ll have to find again).

The genius of anime is that it can hide its inherent cheap production under stylized aesthetics.<br><br>Look at how much work goes into lip synching characters in a Pixar movie. People literally spend years on just this small element for a 90min movie. Anime solved this by just making the mouth smaller and giving it less than a dozen &quot;shapes&quot;. If viewers are distracted by the character&#039;s large eyes and weird ass hair then they won&#039;t notice and/or care that the lips don&#039;t match the audio.<br><br>You can transcribe any Hollywood movie in anime and the audience will have the exact same reaction to it. This is why Hollywood is done. If I want to scare someone do I:<br>(a) pay tens of thousands of dollars to create the concept, the make-up, the prosthetics for some live-action monster?<br>(b) get some artist draw a bunch of images for only a fraction of the cost?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anime movies have extremely limited runs in the US</span><br><br>Exactly. Cinemas are owned by Hollywood. Cinemas are Hollywood&#039;s distribution service. They have no interest in letting the competition make full use of their distribution service.<br><br>Streaming services have pretty much made cinemas obsolete. The only reason why people even go to cinemas is tradition and social interaction.<br><br>You also don&#039;t realize how popular anime content is. The world&#039;s top most popular IP&#039;s are Japanese stuff. The audience Disney has is nothing compared to the audience China, Russia, and Japan have. It&#039;s not even a competition at this point.<br><br>You might be a zoomer/millennial but try to look outside yourself. What are the IP&#039;s your generation grew up with?
