The whole reason stop-motion works is because, when doing it straight-ahead, you can use measurements to keep track of how much you&#039;re moving an arm or a leg for each frame exposed, so it stays consistent. if you were to do it out of order you would not have the benefit of knowing for sure that your actor&#039;s hand is moving a quarter inch or whatever amount every frame, so you lose that certainty and your animation ends up looking hopelessly jittery.<br>Of course this all only applies to armature/doll animation and if you used replacement animation then the matter of &quot;animating&quot; just becomes a matter of shooting models on a set, not animating, because that part&#039;s already been calculated and done.", "time": 1669035899, "resto": 926445}, {"no": 926766, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)08:10:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p926763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;926763</a><br>pic", "filename": "57832097584325", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 547, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 66, "tim": 1669036220023231, "time": 1669036220, "md5": "hf3h5kMCjIKnhg/NDD4SzQ==", "fsize": 52195, "resto": 926445}], "last_modified": 1669036220}, {"no": 926745, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)03:32:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Midjourney V4 by some random I kneel", "filename": "d8aszrslb61a1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669019565419706, "time": 1669019565, "md5": "SK1txj867YD9gwtHvwOv9g==", "fsize": 210410, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "midjourney-v4-by-some-random-i-kneel", "replies": 8, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 926749, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)03:40:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p926748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;926748</a><br>Yes it is", "filename": "MidjourneyV4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669020016946093, "time": 1669020016, "md5": "hGzpaX3vR0TxrWYRy8IPdA==", "fsize": 130999, "resto": 926745}, {"no": 926750, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)04:09:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Yeah well the AI just had to google Batman 3D and it settled with whatever it found. <br><a href=\"#p926749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;926749</a><br>Immediatly there&#039;s a drop in quality.", "time": 1669021755, "resto": 926745}, {"no": 926751, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)04:21:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I came here from /ic/ to escape the relentless jeetflix AI spamming and actually learn 3D.

Keep going. Don&#039;t become discouraged, but don&#039;t avoid growing or learning, even on silly exercises.<br><br>As my own bit of constructive criticism, it&#039;s not attractive or really well-stylized, though. I get some aspects of it, but some things don&#039;t look silly or abstract, but just unlearned. Exaggeration in style can be good, but a number of things really don&#039;t lend themselves to it:<br><br>* The breasts don&#039;t connect right. They are very horizontally long and stick forward, the nipples are outward-facing, but the actual mass of the breasts is not. The breasts are squeezed together in an unnatural way, but the tips are pointed outward. They need to either hang naturally, or sit unnaturally in a way that still looks good (usually meaning giving them support and treating them like they&#039;re in a bra even though they aren&#039;t). The top of the breast does not hang from the entire width of the chest, either.<br>* The arms are not attractively shaped, The shoulder in particular is way too broad compared to the center of the bicep, which should be just about as thick.<br>* The chest is narrow to the point of looking alien, especially with the size of the breasts. The ribs are very conical as well, when the upper body shouldn&#039;t taper down that thin gradually. The rear view especially looks wonky.<br>* Those abs. It&#039;s like a stylized pulsing cock vein. No ribs or real connection to the thorax at all.<br>* You know the issues with the hands, and the legs being way too long. You need kneecaps if you have visible shin bones.", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 680, "h": 796, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668449249593949, "time": 1668449249, "md5": "JxG1UZMfVHtbcRah8+UpmA==", "fsize": 766192, "resto": 925156}, {"no": 925967, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)13:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p925357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;925357</a><br><a href=\"#p925965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;925965</a><br>I know it pisses off a lot of people here, but the old adage really is true: You have to know the rules to know how and when to break them. Stylization is a great reason to not have perfect anatomy or proportions, but you still need to have a good knowledge and understanding of anatomy and proportion to make good stylization. If somebody who doesn&#039;t understand human anatomy and proportion well does strong stylization, it usually looks off in a lot of places that have simple fixes, and at worst looks like it was done by a child. People in real life do stylized sculptures as well, but the ones that look good are still based in anatomical knowledge. 3DCG does not have stricter critique than life sculptures for anatomy and proportion. I see WAY MORE intense stylization in 3DCG than in physical sculptures. Stylization can be an explanation, but it&#039;s not an excuse. If somebody tells you that it doesn&#039;t look good because the proportions are unpleasing, saying &quot;it&#039;s stylized&quot; does not suddenly make it look good. Stylization means you can violate real proportions and anatomy, but it still needs to look good, and every part should still look planned, rather than accidental.<br><br>But, at first, you&#039;re going to be posting things that look like shit. Every realistic attempt looks very wrong to you and everybody else, because you&#039;re still learning, and every stylized attempt looks fine to you but shit to everybody else.

Well, you get more control over interpolation curves and such in blender but the difference isn&#039;t big. Keyframe control in mmd is robust enough.<br>Now if you have an actually complex model made in blender then mmd obviously won&#039;t cut it since you can&#039;t really translate more complex bone constraints to MMD. MMD is limited to global space &quot;copy rotation/translation&quot; and IK in which you can&#039;t control IK axis limits in local space, and since almost all MMD models are in A-pose you can&#039;t really make correct elbow bending using IK. Well you can through a ridiculous hack I worked out a while back, I forget the exact details since it was so long ago but it involved having the axis limited IK chain in t-pose, lowering the ik chain using a IK parent pointing 30deg down, and aiming the actual a-pose limbs using IK toward the IK bones, and then copying the IK chain&#039;s twist across the twist bones along the arm (to make nice arm twisting). You also obviously can&#039;t use shapekeys in MMD, only corrective bones at best, but this is potentially another problem since MMD, and most realtime engines limit you to 4 vertex groups per bone whereas you can have unlimited vertex groups in blender, and the 4 vgroup limit can make it hard to squeeze in corrective bones. Well, all of this would require some manual re-rigging (ie adjusting the bone structure and constraints/scripted drivers) and possibly even re-skinning (ie adjusting the weights on the mesh) but I consider those part of good animation, so.", "time": 1668642455, "resto": 926164}, {"no": 926255, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:03:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p926164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;926164</a><br>MMD is totally fine, OP.

You would build a flesh mesh invisible under every character and then spawn in/modify chunks as needed. Code to modify the meshes here is necessary both to despawn parts of the ragdoll, and also spawn in the gore.

Building a bunch of spaceships for a show, there is bound to be plenty of details and small components you can copy between them even if the shapes of the ships are quite different.

It&#039;ll demonstrate a range and that you aren&#039;t a one trick pony with your interpretation of a character staying inside your comfort zone.

I actually learned that the hard way. First time i posted my work online, people in the thread shit on it hard. There was even a guy writing in ghetto speak, telling me he didn&#039;t know why, but he &quot;hated my work&quot;. At first i was fuming, telling myself &quot;what the fuck do they know?&quot;. Took me a whole day to find the &quot;perfect&quot; reply to every one of their posts, cause i took the time to check their profiles and see their work. i was convinced that, because their work wasn&#039;t as good as mine, they didn&#039;t have any basis to criticize me. My reply was passive aggressive as fuck. I basically told them &quot;thank you for your crictics, but i&#039;m satisfied with the way i&#039;m doing things&quot;. They didn&#039;t reply back, so i thought i won. Two days later i wen&#039;t through my works, and they looked like shit. Seriously, it was like midas touch in reverse, i wasn&#039;t satisfied with how any of it looked. it took me a whole week to go back to work, cause i didn&#039;t want to even look at it, so i thought to myself, &quot;maybe those fags were right&quot;. I started following their advices, even the ghetto guy, and my work actually improved greatly. At first i was ashamed with how i responded to their crictics, but eventually i started posting my work there again, and they like it. Some of them were even impressed.
