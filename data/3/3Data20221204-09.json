What you use in your workflow and to what extent will depend on what you want to do as a 3d artist. Is it 3D printable anime figurines like pic related and/or characters destined for animation? Zbrush is what you will need for sculpting these and its zmodeler will allow to do things like armor and swords. Note that Zbrush is a CPU-dependant software and the better viewport performance you want, the better single threaded cpu with higher frequency and such you desire. There&#039;s a trade off between more of that and more cores so mind the sweet spot (there are some graphs that show it I&#039;ll have to find again).

When creating a new object, consider creating a C++ class, then a blueprint that derives from it to get the best of both worlds.<br>C++ is much better for performance and memory management. Certain types of code can be much easier to create and manage compared to blueprints. The downside of C++ is that it can be verbose and difficult to understand, particularly with Unreal Engine&#039;s archaic macros.<br>Blueprints are easier to learn initially and compile much quicker, but as they grow bigger, they can get very messy and difficult to manage.

So if the movie makes 500 mil $ at the box office then that&#039;s like 50 mil $ profit. The studio only gets about 50-60% of the price of the ticket (depending on the region). When Avengers Infinity War broke 1 billion $ at the box office that was the moment it actually broke even which is not how it was presented in the press.<br><br>Hollywood is a machine that is heavily dependent on manufactured promotion. Anime is not like this. The manga IP is mainly creator promoted (very cheap). Then if successful it gets turned into an anime (very very cheap). This is when it has the opportunity to break worldwide. Absolutely zero $ in invested in promoting it around the globe because streaming sites with pirated content do that for them. The money they would receive from people actually paying to watch their stuff online is less than the money they would need to spend to artificially manufacture the same level of worldwide interest (like Hollywood does).<br><br>Long story short, Avengers Infinity War grossed 2 billion $ at the box office but only made ~400 mil $ in profit.<br>Demon Slayer made ~200 mil $ in profit (50% of box office minus let&#039;s say 50 mil $ production cost which includes the anime).<br><br>So you have 2x return on investment for Avengers (being generous) compared to 10x return on investment for Demon Slayer (being not so generous).<br><br>Hollywood is DONE.", "time": 1670030159, "resto": 927877}, {"no": 928242, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)03:29:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p928204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;928204</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hollywood is DONE.</span><br>I don&#039;t really think there&#039;s much competition between movies and anime.

They&#039;re different sectors.<br>Especially considering that most of the time, anime movies have extremely limited runs in the US. Anime movies around where I live get 1-2 night of shows and that&#039;s it. Even then, it&#039;s a coin flip if they&#039;re showing the sub or the dub. They all sell out pretty much, but that&#039;s only because they have such a limited run and anyone that would want to go see it does. <br>Anime movies I&#039;d think would need a bigger foothold in the west to really think they&#039;re in competition with Hollywood in terms of audiences.

Anime is a style which removed as much pointless costly production elements as possible. Anime studios do not have the budgets Hollywood studios have. Anime is a medium that was born out of necessity and not a stylistic choice. The genius of anime is that it can hide its inherent cheap production under stylized aesthetics.<br><br>Look at how much work goes into lip synching characters in a Pixar movie. People literally spend years on just this small element for a 90min movie. Anime solved this by just making the mouth smaller and giving it less than a dozen &quot;shapes&quot;.

This is why Hollywood is done.

With this release, we\u2019ve built upon the groundbreaking feature set introduced in UE5, making it more robust, efficient, and versatile for creators across all industries. As part of this effort, we\u2019ve been stress-testing the engine against different workflows, making it applicable to more sectors.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We\u2019ve laid the groundwork for the Lumen dynamic global illumination and reflections system, the Nanite virtualized micropolygon geometry system, and Virtual Shadow Maps (VSM) to support games and experiences running at 60 fps on next-gen consoles and capable PCs, enabling fast-paced competitive games and detailed simulations to run without latency. Lumen now supports the Two-Sided Foliage shading model, by gathering lighting from the backface and scattering it through the leaf, attenuated by the material&#039;s Subsurface Color.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meanwhile, Nanite has also been updated with a Programmable Rasterizer to allow for material-driven animations and deformations via World Position Offset, as well as opacity masks. This exciting development paves the way for artists to use Nanite to program specific objects\u2019 behavior, for example Nanite-based foliage with leaves blowing in the wind.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In this release, we\u2019ve continued to enhance tools for building massive open worlds with additional functionality and improved workflows.

They are very horizontally long and stick forward, the nipples are outward-facing, but the actual mass of the breasts is not. The breasts are squeezed together in an unnatural way, but the tips are pointed outward. They need to either hang naturally, or sit unnaturally in a way that still looks good (usually meaning giving them support and treating them like they&#039;re in a bra even though they aren&#039;t). The top of the breast does not hang from the entire width of the chest, either.<br>* The arms are not attractively shaped, The shoulder in particular is way too broad compared to the center of the bicep, which should be just about as thick.<br>* The chest is narrow to the point of looking alien, especially with the size of the breasts. The ribs are very conical as well, when the upper body shouldn&#039;t taper down that thin gradually. The rear view especially looks wonky.<br>* Those abs. It&#039;s like a stylized pulsing cock vein. No ribs or real connection to the thorax at all.<br>* You know the issues with the hands, and the legs being way too long.

Stylization is a great reason to not have perfect anatomy or proportions, but you still need to have a good knowledge and understanding of anatomy and proportion to make good stylization. If somebody who doesn&#039;t understand human anatomy and proportion well does strong stylization, it usually looks off in a lot of places that have simple fixes, and at worst looks like it was done by a child. People in real life do stylized sculptures as well, but the ones that look good are still based in anatomical knowledge. 3DCG does not have stricter critique than life sculptures for anatomy and proportion. I see WAY MORE intense stylization in 3DCG than in physical sculptures. Stylization can be an explanation, but it&#039;s not an excuse. If somebody tells you that it doesn&#039;t look good because the proportions are unpleasing, saying &quot;it&#039;s stylized&quot; does not suddenly make it look good. Stylization means you can violate real proportions and anatomy, but it still needs to look good, and every part should still look planned, rather than accidental.<br><br>But, at first, you&#039;re going to be posting things that look like shit.

You&#039;ll never hear the opinion of the end user on the work you personally did, unless you&#039;re an actor or a director. You&#039;ll only hear what they thought of the whole. The only thing you&#039;ve gained, is a name in the credits, some bragging rights and some extra coin in your employer&#039;s pocket, and maybe the respect of your peers, but did the end product of *your* work, not the production as a whole, truly have any meaning?

Well you can through a ridiculous hack I worked out a while back, I forget the exact details since it was so long ago but it involved having the axis limited IK chain in t-pose, lowering the ik chain using a IK parent pointing 30deg down, and aiming the actual a-pose limbs using IK toward the IK bones, and then copying the IK chain&#039;s twist across the twist bones along the arm (to make nice arm twisting). You also obviously can&#039;t use shapekeys in MMD, only corrective bones at best, but this is potentially another problem since MMD, and most realtime engines limit you to 4 vertex groups per bone whereas you can have unlimited vertex groups in blender, and the 4 vgroup limit can make it hard to squeeze in corrective bones.
