With this release, we\u2019ve built upon the groundbreaking feature set introduced in UE5, making it more robust, efficient, and versatile for creators across all industries. As part of this effort, we\u2019ve been stress-testing the engine against different workflows, making it applicable to more sectors.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We\u2019ve laid the groundwork for the Lumen dynamic global illumination and reflections system, the Nanite virtualized micropolygon geometry system, and Virtual Shadow Maps (VSM) to support games and experiences running at 60 fps on next-gen consoles and capable PCs, enabling fast-paced competitive games and detailed simulations to run without latency. Lumen now supports the Two-Sided Foliage shading model, by gathering lighting from the backface and scattering it through the leaf, attenuated by the material&#039;s Subsurface Color.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meanwhile, Nanite has also been updated with a Programmable Rasterizer to allow for material-driven animations and deformations via World Position Offset, as well as opacity masks. This exciting development paves the way for artists to use Nanite to program specific objects\u2019 behavior, for example Nanite-based foliage with leaves blowing in the wind.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In this release, we\u2019ve continued to enhance tools for building massive open worlds with additional functionality and improved workflows.

You can&#039;t use them on areas that need to match on set but they are invaluable for quickly detailing out less obvious areas. A lot of studios will have premade model parts like pipes etc to use on assets to speed up the time, there is no need to make pipes over and over if you already have some nice UV&#039;d ones. Reuse anything you can, even if it involves taking another part and modifying. Building a bunch of spaceships for a show, there is bound to be plenty of details and small components you can copy between them even if the shapes of the ships are quite different. Kitbashing is more of a dressing thing to add that extra level of detail fast. Also dont look at each piece as a whole but the smaller components. There are plenty of times I have brought in a whole engine to take a small component that I wanted and deleted the rest.</span><br>Andrew Hodgson articulates nicely the efficient reality of the production workflow.", "filename": "1668059929022796", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 768, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668136622768958, "time": 1668136622, "md5": "Kh7SMqTqx+gK2D6f024iiA==", "fsize": 593625, "resto": 925453}, {"no": 925659, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)16:03:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You just everything you can.

They are very horizontally long and stick forward, the nipples are outward-facing, but the actual mass of the breasts is not. The breasts are squeezed together in an unnatural way, but the tips are pointed outward. They need to either hang naturally, or sit unnaturally in a way that still looks good (usually meaning giving them support and treating them like they&#039;re in a bra even though they aren&#039;t). The top of the breast does not hang from the entire width of the chest, either.<br>* The arms are not attractively shaped, The shoulder in particular is way too broad compared to the center of the bicep, which should be just about as thick.<br>* The chest is narrow to the point of looking alien, especially with the size of the breasts. The ribs are very conical as well, when the upper body shouldn&#039;t taper down that thin gradually. The rear view especially looks wonky.<br>* Those abs. It&#039;s like a stylized pulsing cock vein. No ribs or real connection to the thorax at all.<br>* You know the issues with the hands, and the legs being way too long.

Stylization is a great reason to not have perfect anatomy or proportions, but you still need to have a good knowledge and understanding of anatomy and proportion to make good stylization. If somebody who doesn&#039;t understand human anatomy and proportion well does strong stylization, it usually looks off in a lot of places that have simple fixes, and at worst looks like it was done by a child. People in real life do stylized sculptures as well, but the ones that look good are still based in anatomical knowledge. 3DCG does not have stricter critique than life sculptures for anatomy and proportion. I see WAY MORE intense stylization in 3DCG than in physical sculptures. Stylization can be an explanation, but it&#039;s not an excuse. If somebody tells you that it doesn&#039;t look good because the proportions are unpleasing, saying &quot;it&#039;s stylized&quot; does not suddenly make it look good. Stylization means you can violate real proportions and anatomy, but it still needs to look good, and every part should still look planned, rather than accidental.<br><br>But, at first, you&#039;re going to be posting things that look like shit.

Did you work on a famous movie? Do you think you were irreplaceable? Do you honestly think, that the movie you were a part of was made better thanks to your presence, or that the end user noticed the minor parts of the massive production you were a part of? You&#039;ll never hear the opinion of the end user on the work you personally did, unless you&#039;re an actor or a director. You&#039;ll only hear what they thought of the whole. The only thing you&#039;ve gained, is a name in the credits, some bragging rights and some extra coin in your employer&#039;s pocket, and maybe the respect of your peers, but did the end product of *your* work, not the production as a whole, truly have any meaning? At least with porn you made yourself, you can be certain that your work specifically has some meaning, even if it&#039;s just that you made thousands of people cum. The users will tell you as much, for better or worse.<br><br>Of course, we all allocate worth and meaning differently, so if you&#039;re happy with what you get out of industry work that&#039;s fine, but thinking that people are just clamoring for some big porn bucks is a bit narrowminded. It&#039;s a bonus, I wasn&#039;t hoping for anything more than a livable wage when starting. The biggest draw for me at least is the freedom working on your own comes with. Would I be happier doing something non-porn related on my own instead? Possibly, I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m happy enough with what I do right now, and have no regrets about switching. Either way, doing the same with non-porn work, is a much higher wall to topple.<br><br>And as mentioned earlier, less work hours. Work to live, not live to work. Sure, I won&#039;t be showing off my creations to most of my loved ones or friends, but as a tradeoff, I have more free time, which can be spent with them, instead of slaving away so some exec at Disney can afford another car.

Well you can through a ridiculous hack I worked out a while back, I forget the exact details since it was so long ago but it involved having the axis limited IK chain in t-pose, lowering the ik chain using a IK parent pointing 30deg down, and aiming the actual a-pose limbs using IK toward the IK bones, and then copying the IK chain&#039;s twist across the twist bones along the arm (to make nice arm twisting). You also obviously can&#039;t use shapekeys in MMD, only corrective bones at best, but this is potentially another problem since MMD, and most realtime engines limit you to 4 vertex groups per bone whereas you can have unlimited vertex groups in blender, and the 4 vgroup limit can make it hard to squeeze in corrective bones.

I realize this might be a bit difficult to convey/grasp so I&#039;ll post images below showing what I mean.<br><br>[1/5]", "filename": "LETS FUCKING GO", "ext": ".png", "w": 606, "h": 606, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1667914685647415, "time": 1667914685, "md5": "NUKeyQxe/lGC9rfP+KgbsA==", "fsize": 539345, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "lets-talk-about-gore-in-vidya-how-do-developers", "replies": 34, "images": 10, "omitted_posts": 29, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 925749, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)12:43:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p925733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;925733</a><br>It&#039;s a long story, basically this is the only way I found to allow for &quot;modular&quot; dismemberment via Alpha Masks, because if I don&#039;t use Alpha Masks with transparency enabled what happens is that the &quot;dismemberment alpha masks&quot; of each limb end up canceling one another pretty much, for the cause I explained here <a href=\"#p925343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;925343</a>.

It would need boxes to detect where the hit went, and probably more variables for the power or type of damage (missing head? explosion damage? 50 cal? 556?) You would build a flesh mesh invisible under every character and then spawn in/modify chunks as needed. Code to modify the meshes here is necessary both to despawn parts of the ragdoll, and also spawn in the gore. You can have as many underlying meshes as you want, so if you modify their head away, you can have multiple types of mutilations or spawned in objects.<br><br>I&#039;ll talk about how a few games likely deal with gore:<br><br>Metal Gear Rising: mechanic of a sword that lets you freestyle chop people up. These are simple mesh cuts, updating of collision bodies, fill in textures, update rigid bodies. The code needs to be high performance because this game encourages 30+ slices as a finishing move.<br><br>Fallout 3, Call of Duty 4: these games use a simpler gore spawner with pre determined mesh modification states (missing arm? missing head?). Fallout is a big fan of gore chunk explosions.<br><br>Sniper Elite: probably the most polished implementation of this idea period.

There was even a guy writing in ghetto speak, telling me he didn&#039;t know why, but he &quot;hated my work&quot;. At first i was fuming, telling myself &quot;what the fuck do they know?&quot;. Took me a whole day to find the &quot;perfect&quot; reply to every one of their posts, cause i took the time to check their profiles and see their work. i was convinced that, because their work wasn&#039;t as good as mine, they didn&#039;t have any basis to criticize me. My reply was passive aggressive as fuck. I basically told them &quot;thank you for your crictics, but i&#039;m satisfied with the way i&#039;m doing things&quot;. They didn&#039;t reply back, so i thought i won. Two days later i wen&#039;t through my works, and they looked like shit. Seriously, it was like midas touch in reverse, i wasn&#039;t satisfied with how any of it looked. it took me a whole week to go back to work, cause i didn&#039;t want to even look at it, so i thought to myself, &quot;maybe those fags were right&quot;. I started following their advices, even the ghetto guy, and my work actually improved greatly. At first i was ashamed with how i responded to their crictics, but eventually i started posting my work there again, and they like it. Some of them were even impressed.
