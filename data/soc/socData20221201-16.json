tend to dress in less-showy sorts of ways. Formal attire is okay for the office, which is the same for me, but away from the office I avoid T-Shirt casual at all costs. Although it is trendy, it reeks of lazy to a prospective mate. That doesn&#039;t mean you have to dress for success in all situations, but just present yourself, when seeking a date, like you have no doubt you are an adult who IS successful. <br><br>I am a 38 year old career professional in the judicial field. I wear a good quality polos and dress pants on most days, and that wardrobe changed my life. Before, I was in retail, and as soon as I got out of work I threw on a logo&#039;d T-Shirt, shorts, sandals, and went to do my business. I was failing MISERABLY at dating and entering relationships. People seemed to run away. <br><br>I think, for me, I was feeling as if I had to keep up with the other barely-adult 20-somethings who broke their necks to get hitched and have tons of kids. But if you think about it, those break-neck decisions were made, a lot of times, when people are 20, 21 ,22... children. <br><br>So by staying in that barely-adult world you aren&#039;t doing yourself any favors. Because, those of us who have been around a while, can tell you that 20, 21, 22 year olds are idiots. In my field I see them fail daily. Move past trying to run with that crowd, looking and acting like they do, because all that does is tell the women you are going after that you aren&#039;t confident enough to be the successful person you are. <br><br>As to your clothes, I think going too hard into the suits and ties also won&#039;t do you any favors, because you&#039;re still young enough to look like you&#039;re trying too hard. Go in between, and don&#039;t be afraid to be casual when it&#039;s called for.<br><br>My rules for myself: NO logo&#039;d T&#039;s, high quality cologne, No dirty clothes, no messy hair, I always coordinate colors, good clean shoes, wear a belt if shirt tucked, no bad breath, and always be kind.", "time": 1669857928, "resto": 31720462, "id": "bxOTsiEP"}, {"no": 31731465, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)20:27:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "23 f doing ratings and tributes. whatever you want<br><br>popcornbabe333 on kik<br>guccigrl1017 on snapchat", "time": 1669858037, "resto": 31720462, "id": "uOwMdUku"}, {"no": 31731468, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)20:28:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p31730680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;31730680</a><br>Christ, more excuses to avoid working on your personality.

I&#039;ve done quite a bit with my life but I&#039;ll give a quick summary/intro. It&#039;s likely that you&#039;ve seen my ad in other threads anyway. I&#039;ve been here for a little while and met some really nice people that I appreciate and get along with.<br><br>In my early 20&#039;s I mostly set about doing a math PhD on optimal transport. Living in college was really fun and I discovered a love of baking and socialising. During that time I became a national champion at quidditch which was a bit strange and had a lot of friends. I also wrote a weird romance novel.<br><br>After PhD I went back to my hometown to support my dad. During this time I felt like retraining to do software development and studied just enough until I dropped out of my course and got a job with a startup. It was a weird little company and I was programming a raspberry pi to talk to some chinese machinery. During this time I developed an interest in computers and all sorts of development (ML/AI/blockchain/osdev/whatever) I even bought a bitcoin for fun! I have a few stories from this company but it&#039;ll be a bit of a bore if I just go on and on.<br><br>In my early 30&#039;s I switched to a more corporate company and climbed the corporate ladder until I became a tech lead. Now in my mid 30&#039;s I manage a team of 14 developers to deliver to a 1.5B company and one of Australia&#039;s major economic movers. I also decided to learn Japanese and went to school for a little while to learn it. I think I got pretty good! But lockdowns ruined my Japan trip.<br><br>Now in my mid 30&#039;s I found that I&#039;m single again so I&#039;m online looking for a connection. I&#039;ve also picked up Electric guitar (I played music for most of my life, but I never really got good at it) and I&#039;m sort of using my little bits of free time to enjoy my hobbies or enjoy any content that might be on. <br><br>I like to relax by watching VTubers and chill anime about nothing.

I intend to leave academia after my degree and settle down on a farm. Would love to talk about DIY, farming and orchard keeping. No-one else knows this, they all and think I will become a professor or work in a thinktank. I essentially have nothing in common with my colleagues and am very much alone but surrounded by people. Most of these people want things from me. *I am happy to penpal with men or women, but I am straight and will have no lewd conversations with men* *If we have talked in the past, we can talk again, that&#039;s no problem.*<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Main Boards</span><br>/k/, /out/, /lit/, /diy/, /wsg/, /pol/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Email / Contact</span><br>Salty234@proton.me", "filename": "1638841794923", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 840, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669756478105862, "time": 1669756478, "md5": "h/wjgq4OnrO8m0W/gwLT1Q==", "fsize": 109905, "resto": 31727088, "id": "j7UGKwf4"}, {"no": 31730532, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)13:03:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p31727794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;31727794</a><br>Paywhore", "time": 1669831406, "resto": 31727088, "id": "XZNTSUEJ"}], "last_modified": 1669831406}, {"no": 31728777, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)16:59:18", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Your ideals", "filename": "6EE4FAB8-5879-48F6-8C56-A7889140A19D", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669759158999813, "time": 1669759158, "md5": "6MFzmTmC3Bw4GFg3LvE35g==", "fsize": 24801, "resto": 0, "id": "XkaMcRjz", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "your-ideals", "replies": 3, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 31728781, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)17:01:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I\u2019ll start", "filename": "1BCE7587-949E-4AEE-BDDA-90A8C2FAC1E7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669759298901742, "time": 1669759298, "md5": "8+lUzoFPDER9McTJJmE8Pg==", "fsize": 414768, "resto": 31728777, "id": "XkaMcRjz"}, {"no": 31730528, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)13:02:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p31728781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;31728781</a><br>Thights too fat.
