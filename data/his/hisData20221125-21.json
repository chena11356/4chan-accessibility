There are accounts of such people experiencing racism in the GDR. At the same time, the state was officially anti-racist and anti-fascist, like racism here was officially considered a Bad Thing and associated with the Third Reich (along with capitalism and Western imperialism). Then I&#039;ve also read there were some anti-immigrant rioting in the 80s, but was this also tied in with anti-government attitudes?

Then migrants start showing up. Basically the region turned into the Rust Belt. Also the German state is officially anticommunist and anti-DDR. So I feel the right-wing populists are like a schizo response to all of this, basically directionless anguish from the void. Also the German left can be stupid and it&#039;s also divided. Look up the response from the SPD/Green left types to Sahra Wagenknecht for example who is an Ossi leftist.

God made Satan &quot;god&quot; as much as he could be, obviously Satan can&#039;t actually be god because what makes god god is that he is &quot;the word&quot; meaning he is purely righteous, he only does what is right, that&#039;s what make Jesus god in the flesh because he&#039;s the word made flesh, he&#039;s all that is righteous as a person, he only ever does what is right, he is infallible, you couldn&#039;t troll Jesus into acting out of character. All of us are sinners, all of us have the possibility of making a sinful choice but not Jesus and not god the father, they are perfectly good. Satan is not perfectly good and that&#039;s why he can&#039;t possibly be god but he did get god like powers, almost sort of omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent, he has power, knowledge, and presence and he&#039;s an evil force seeking to drag people away from God. So Satan the serpent wasn&#039;t a malicious plan by god to cause the fall of man, it was Satan doing the evil things he wanted to do with his godlike influence in this world. This is true for any evil thing that anyone does, and even the evil stuff that you do. The evil stuff that you do isn&#039;t gods fault it&#039;s your fault but god somehow managed to turn everyone&#039;s actions into something good and something that accomplished his purposes such as saving souls.", "time": 1669413714, "resto": 14221746}, {"no": 14238337, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)17:11:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14236943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14236943</a><br>God is pure love, And he does everything possible to create the best possible outcome with everyone&#039;s evil choices.

the qahtanites (so-called first arabs) descended from one of the ancestors of abraham, joktan, as he is called in the bible, hence theyre called joktanites (hebrew yuqtani becomes qtani in arabic), now he belonged to the tribe of eber/abir, hence a hebrew, which is not something exclusive to jews, because the ishmaelites (&quot;arabized arabs&quot; as you call them), also belonged to the tribe of eber, as did the qahtanites (which are actually more closely related to eber since joktan is literally the firstborn of eber), but since they shared tribal origins from eber, they had to distinguish themselves by the latest tribe after him, hence they split in two;
