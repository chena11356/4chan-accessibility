Current Capitalist societies have the productive forces to eliminate scarcity of most consumer goods if managed properly but due to the internal contradictions within the system we can never get to that point. Capitalism requires a scarcity of goods and sees a lack of scarcity as &quot;over-production&quot; which requires mass selloffs and mass layoffs - essentially a destruction of productive power power.

These lozenges are still common in Marocco and Persia. Cannabis would have most likely been eaten until after the crusades when hash smoking was introduced from the levant to Europe.

(If you believe in eternal hell, doesn\u2019t this mean Jesus is suffering forever?) Can\u2019t he just forgive us anyway? And why didn\u2019t Jesus specify all of this stuff before he died? Why did Paul have to appear 40 years later and \u201cexplain\u201d everything? What is heaven? Is there free will in heaven? If so, then why do people use free will to explain away the problem of evil? Going back to souls, are people born with unique souls, or are they all the same? If they are different, then God is responsible for a person\u2019s actions. If they are the same, then why do some sin more than others? Why does anyone sin at all? If Jesus was sinless, then why can\u2019t most Christians be sinless? Do they not have free will? Why would they purposely disobey God if they don\u2019t actually want to? Why didn\u2019t Jesus clearly specify that Catholicism is true or false?", "filename": "D9DC7D5D-5B5C-4CA1-9452-1F37146D97B6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 275, "h": 183, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1674595099866584, "time": 1674595099, "md5": "1+IuLiUrcrK9JTHSnCbLPg==", "fsize": 7408, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-genesis-literally-true-if-not-then-why-did-god", "replies": 69, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 14523862, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)16:27:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How does a transcendent source of existence have a personality, or desires, or a mind?

I could go on about parenting, but basically most parents are retards who have little concern for giving their children an advantage. They simply don\u2019t have the intellectual capacity, or perhaps love for their children (maybe because they hate themselves, and see their reflection in their children), to consistently take an organized and proactive approach to child-rearing. Everything should be planned and weighed. What they eat, what they read, who they hang out with, their hobbies, everything. It should be obvious by now that the main objective is to make them more POWERFUL. Mentally, physically, socially, financially, emotionally, spiritually. They can always know more, exercise their brain more (Dual N Back improves working memory for adults, just imagine with children!), exercise more, eat good food, socialize, be more confident, have more options in the future, etc. This doesn\u2019t mean physically forcing them to do what you want. There are so many ways to incentivize constructive behavior, and it helps to establish that structure from the beginning. For example, if your child is used to only having one hour of video games per day, then you can simply reward them by increasing that time if they do some chore or productive task. Depending on the task, you shouldn\u2019t make it sound like a task, but rather something that benefits them of course. \u201cThis will make you smarter. More disciplined.

Thus, today, the kilt and the tartan are regarded as the traditional dress of historic Scotland: Lowland Scots imagine themselves as members of\u2018 clans\u2019, and visitors from England are welcomed by the noise of bagpipes, and must struggle to read road signs in Irish lettering. The process was the work of a well-defined era: the century from 1745 to 1845. Before 1745, the Highlanders and all their customs were disownedand despised by every articulate Scotchman.

By the end of July, the Jews in Budapest were virtually the only Jews remaining in Hungary. They were not immediately ghettoized. Instead, in June 1944, Hungarian authorities ordered the Jews into over 2,000 designated buildings scattered throughout the city. The buildings were marked with Stars of David. About 25,000 Jews from the suburbs of Budapest were rounded up and transported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center. Hungarian authorities suspended the deportations in July 1944, sparing the remaining Jews of Budapest, at least temporarily.</span><br>https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/cont<wbr>ent/en/article/budapest<br><br>Your response is either going to be shifting the goalposts or OY VEY THIS SOURCE ISN&#039;T KOSHER!

He deduced this front his ideas about physics. He neglected other aspects of astrology. e.g. the significance of the zodiac. In 1604 Kepler observed a new star and believed in a connection to a special and very rare planetary conjunction. After a Jupiter-Saturn-conjunction Jupiter met Mars. Kepler speculated that the star of Bethlehem might be a new star which was generated after a similar conjunction and recalculated it for 6/7 BC. Nowadays examples of both astronomical (and astrological) interpretations of the star of Bethlehem exist. The best known is the three time conjunction of 6/7 BC. But the interpretation of Martin (1980) for 213 BC seems equally excellent. Vardaman (1989) takes the Halley comet of 12 BC to be the star of Bethlehem. Other speculations arise from two Novae in the years 5 and 4 BC, tabulated in sources from the Far East. But historians tell us that there is no need fo a real star. The text in Matthew, book 2 is a legend. What is important in regard to the understanding of the star of Bethlehem is the &quot;sidus Julium&quot; the comet which could be seen in the sky during Caesar&#039;s funeral and the match of the King of Armenia Tiridates to Nero in Rome during.

During his travels, the boy stopped to rest beside a lake that was shaded by a Banyan tree. A beautiful woman, carrying a child, is said to have appeared, and asked the boy for some milk to feed her child, which he gave. When he reached the home for his milk delivery, he apologised for the delay and that there would be less milk in his pot. But when they opened the lid of the milk pot, the container was brimming with milk.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second apparition is alleged to have occurred a few years later. A lame boy would sell buttermilk to passing travellers, who would pause in the shade of a large Banyan tree, to escape the heat of the day. However, he had no customers. According to the account, suddenly, an ethereal woman, holding a child appeared before him, and asked for a cup of buttermilk. He gave her a cup, which she fed to her child. The woman asked the boy to go to Nagapattinam, and find a certain Catholic man in the town, and tell him to build a chapel at Vailankanni in her honour. Apparently cured, the boy ran to Nagapattinam, where he found the man and told him his story. The Catholic men of Nagapattinam subsequently built a thatched chapel at Vailankanni, dedicated to Mary under the title of &quot;Our Lady of Good Health&quot;.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 17th century, a Portuguese merchant vessel sailing from Macau to Ceylon was caught in a severe storm in the Bay of Bengal. The sailors prayed fervently for Mary, Star of the Sea to save them, and promised to build a church in her honor wherever they could land. The sea became calm, and their ship landed near Vailankanni on 8 September, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary. To honor their promise, the Portuguese rebuilt the thatched chapel into a stone church.

experience from a certain perspective and alter a person&#039;s psyche and it can all happen at once and at the same time and even over the course of history. consider a simple example such as a wedding proposal in a restaurant. we might all think that to be a silly place to propose in front of everyone as we think about it now but if we were standing there before them in person we might crack a smile and perhaps clap as we witness the joy on the faces of the couple. or we may still think it&#039;s silly while at the same time not understanding that this was the location of the couple&#039;s first date when they were young and though it was corny to others it was deeply meaningful to them. or we may not see the old woman in the corner by herself shedding a small tear affected by the memory of the time with her husband who had just passed away from cancer. we may not know that a man at another table just found out his wife was cheating on him and wanted a divorce or the waitress who would find out in the morning that she was cast in the role she dreamed about when she was a girl or the bartender who is about to find out the one night stand he went home with on independence day is almost seven months pregnant with his son. and it can all change our perspective if i tell you that i&#039;m describing or that you&#039;re watching an old home movie of something that happened in a restaurant in downtown Kansas City, Missouri in 1957. the point is that God is always speaking to us, anon. it&#039;s us who have to listen. and it&#039;s often the most meaningful and momentous events in our lives when we experience our greatest wonder and awe and humility and deference to our place in the grand scheme of things and it&#039;s often then when we, ourselves,

As was shown in the case of Germany and Japan, while they were in fact capable of continuing to put out more then enough military hardware to meet their needs, they were chronically short of the experienced crews required to man them. Germany had lost many of its best pilots trying to defend its skies, while Japan lost all of its finest Carrier aircraft pilots either at Midway or during the Solomon Islands campaign; while both nations were able to make good their losses of aircraft, they simply could never train pilots with the sort of skill to match their predecessors in a short time. So the lesson that could be learned from this is that while machines are expendable, the men who know how to use those machines are not.
