They do this by attacking supplies, recon teams, and generally forcing their enemy to waste war material chasing them down to no real effect.

Ottomans and Algerian Regency during late 18th century, but it never had or could maintain its Eastern Saharan borders, notably because those were just trade routes, no other state could attack Morocco, and Moroccan army only crossed these borders to conquer subsaharan kingdoms for slaves and gold, so only expeditionnary forces, but never stationnary presence. which truely signed an end to

She provided them with shelter for a night, as she was considered the best housekeeper in the village, with the most pleasant home. The magi invited her to join them on the journey to find the baby Jesus, but she declined, stating she was too busy with her housework. Later, La Befana had a change of heart, and tried to search out the astrologers and Jesus. That night she was not able to find them, so to this day, La Befana is searching for the little baby.

Greek boys no longer left the confines of the community, but rather paired up with older men within the confines of the city. These men, like their earlier counterparts, played an educational and instructive role in the lives of their young companions; likewise, just as in earlier times, they shared a sexual relationship with their boys. Penetrative sex, however, was seen as demeaning for the passive partner, and outside the socially accepted norm.[11] In ancient Greece, sex was generally understood in terms of penetration, pleasure, and dominance, rather than a matter of the sexes of the participants. According to Dover, pederasty was not considered to be a homosexual act, given that the \u2018man\u2019 would be taking on a dominant role, and his disciple would be taking on a passive one. When intercourse occurred between two people of the same gender, it still was not entirely regarded as a homosexual union, given that one partner would have to take on a passive role, and would therefore no longer be considered a \u2018man\u2019 in terms of the sexual union.[12] Hubbard and James Davidson argue however that there is insufficient evidence that a man was considered effeminate for being passive in sex alone. For example, the lowborn protagonist of Aristophanes&#039; play The Knights openly admits to having been a passive partner.[13]</span>", "time": 1672172907, "resto": 14380586}, {"no": 14383842, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)15:32:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Phalanx vs horse archers</span><br>You dont even need to have played total war to figure out how that one ends", "time": 1672173132, "resto": 14380586}, {"no": 14383847, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)15:33:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14383842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14383842</a><br>Alex did BTFO some horse archers you idiot<br>I still think Alex would lose but its not because of &quot;muh horse archers&quot;", "time": 1672173205, "resto": 14380586}, {"no": 14383861, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)15:36:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14383830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14383830</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The legislator Philolaus of Corinth, lover of the stadion race winner Diocles of Corinth at the Ancient Olympic Games of 728 BC,[24] crafted laws for the Thebans in the 8th century BCE that gave special support to male unions, contributing to the development of Theban pederasty in which, unlike other places in ancient Greece, it favored the continuity of the union of male couples even after the younger man reached adulthood, the most famous example being the Sacred Band of Thebes, composed of elite soldiers in pairs of male lovers in the 4th century BCE, as was also the case with him and Diocles, who lived together in Thebes until the end of their lives.[25]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The romance between Pausanias and Agathon in Athens, made famous by their appearance in Plato&#039;s Symposium, also continued from the pederastic phase into adulthood as a stable and long-lasting relationship.</span><br>It&#039;s hobestly an interesting look at social development, I wonder how greeks lost practices such as these.

Pagan religions started compiling regional folk beliefs into single, organized, institutionalized religious organizations surrounded around maybe a city or even a king. In the bronze age and classical periods is was very popular to conceive of either your ruler as a demigod or the city-state you lived in to be patroned by a god. At this point the embellishment of ancestors and their worship also began. People had always prayed for the restful sleeps of their dead, but now people were beginning to get sanctified and deified as better oral and written record keeping allowed the stories of people to be passed down, and embellished, for generations. An example of this kind of belief system taken to this &quot;logical extreme&quot; is probably Judaism.

Abortion happens when a soul is supposed to come in but they back out at the last minute once they enter the womb and the veil of being a human on earth starts to come over them again and they remember how bad this place is again, they back out like oh hell no fuck that. As souls on the other side, when it&#039;s time for us to come back to earth and have another earth life, we spend so much time prepping and preparing and arranging and working out the logistics. You even go into a veil simulator where you practice losing your memory and practice the earth veil coming over you, that way you don&#039;t back out once it begins to happen. When you are born, your essence or vibration goes all the way down from like 100 to like a 2. Only a piece of you goes into this body and the rest stays in spirit and acts as your higher self and you can even divide your essence into multiple experiences at once meaning you could be having a life here and on another planet at the same time. Your energy is reduced soooo much just to come to this vile, dual planet with all the evil and crime and bad things going on here compared to where we are coming from. So when souls finally get sent off to the womb going into a new life, they sometimes back out or chicken out once they start to realize and remember how bad it is on earth and the fact that they will be back in a physical reality where everything will be based on touch an sight an smell an this dense plane where everything takes a long drawn out process. It also happens on purpose to certain people who have a soul contract that calls for them to learn the lesson of grieving or the lesson or experience of a miscarriage.

Gorgias, however, is particularly frustrating for modern scholars to attempt to understand. While scholars debate the precise subtleties of the teachings of Protagoras, Hippias, and Prodicus, they generally agree on the basic frameworks of what these thinkers believed. With Gorgias, however, scholars widely disagree on even the most basic framework of his ideas, including over whether or not that framework even existed at all. The greatest hindrance to scholarly understanding of Gorgias&#039;s philosophy is that the vast majority of his writings have been lost and those that have survived have suffered considerable alteration by later copyists.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These difficulties are further compounded by the fact that Gorgias&#039;s rhetoric is frequently elusive and confusing; he makes many of his most important points using elaborate, but highly ambiguous, metaphors, similes, and puns.
