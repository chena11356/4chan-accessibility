It may come as a surprise to some people, but Russia has been there already. After the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks, relying on the dogmas of Marx and Engels, also said that they would change existing ways and customs and not just political and economic ones, but the very notion of human morality and the foundations of a healthy society. The destruction of age-old values, religion and relations between people, up to and including the total rejection of family (we had that, too), encouragement to inform on loved ones \u2013 all this was proclaimed progress and, by the way, was widely supported around the world back then and was quite fashionable, same as today.

Holy Tradition always existed. The Church existed almost 400 years without a Bible. You don\u2019t have any justification to even prove that the books that you have in the Bible are authentic without relying on tradition. The epistle of Hebrews? Author is entirely unknown, and you\u2019re relying on tradition to say that it was Paul, who authored it. The large amounts of books that are referenced in the Bible, but are forever lost? The fact that protestants claim that everything that the apostles didn\u2019t write down should be discarded automatically, seems pretty suspicious and inconsistent to me. <br><br>Now that I think about it, it\u2019s so weird why so many Westerners are fascinated with a \u201clost gnostic gospels\u201d. The church declared those things heretical and forgeries in the first place. It actually makes sense why Westerners are so fascinated by it, because of the heresy sola Scriptura, makes them wonder what Thomas or Judas wrote. The truth is that the apostles, all touch, the holy tradition, and then only a select of them, had to write letters of correction to churches that they previously did missionary work with, to help them against some stumbling blocks. <br><br>You must understand, the apostles, as missionaries stayed in cities for months, if not years teaching and catechizing the inhabitants.

Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga&#039;s camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners,[33] mostly by crucifixion and decapitation[34] with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek&#039;s teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as &quot;a very sweet and pleasing maiden&quot;, while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses.[35][36][37] The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that &quot;the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.&quot;[38] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga&#039;s but it came to nothing.[39][40][41]</span>", "filename": "Taiwan", "ext": ".png", "w": 1717, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673902383137808, "time": 1673902383, "md5": "iRRS8qd+zKjZKzcK7ObMYQ==", "fsize": 785060, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481483, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)15:56:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478876</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The very fact the two were engaged on the same level and the Chinese had to fight them for decades is an incredible embarrassment for the Chinese lol</span><br><br>Chinese didn&#039;t fight them for decades.

The first time they tried to land, they were forced away by bad weather, and one ship&#039;s crew was captured by the natives when it crashed into the beach. The natives killed most of the crew and sent them to Koxinga.[12] On July 5, the relief force arrived and engaged in small scale confrontations with Koxinga&#039;s fleet. On July 23, the two sides gave major battle as the Dutch fleet attempted to break Koxinga&#039;s blockade. A second, ultimately unsuccessful attempt at relief was mounted in October. The Dutch tried to bombard the Chinese position with their ships, but their shots were too high and missed their target, giving the Chinese gunners time to prepare and return fire. Meanwhile, the smaller Dutch ships engaged the Chinese junks, which lured them into a narrow strait with a false withdrawal. The Dutch ships were unable to get away as the wind had died and they were forced to paddle their boats, but the Chinese caught them and massacred the crew on board and used pikes to kill those who jumped overboard. The Chinese caught Dutch grenades in nets and threw them back at the Dutch. The Dutch flagship Koukercken ran aground right in front of an enemy cannon placement and was sunk. Another ship was stranded and its crew fled to Fort Zeelandia. The remaining Dutch fleet was forced to retreat with the loss of two ships, three smaller vessels, and 130 casualties.[25]</span>", "time": 1673903089, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481521, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:05:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481504</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chinese DIDN&#039;T LOSE A SINGLE SHIP </span><br><a href=\"#p14481512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481512</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chinese didn&#039;t lose a single ship</span><br><br>If you truly believe this you are not only a chinkshill, you truly are an utter imbecile lol<br><br>A portion of the Chinese vessels were smaller junks, to believe none of those were sunk is just fucking comedy.", "filename": "Capture", "ext": ".png", "w": 586, "h": 386, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673903110533936, "time": 1673903110, "md5": "MVEqv+xzaAczb83cAMO/FA==", "fsize": 396899, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481527, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:06:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481511</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; But Europeans don&#039;t boast about beating them,</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; because they aren&#039;t pissy pathetic little nationalistic frustrators.</span><br><br>/thread<br>/chinkshot<br>/chinkseethe<br>/itsover", "time": 1673903171, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481541, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:09:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481521</a><br><a href=\"#p14481527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481527</a><br>Chinese didn&#039;t lose any ships to enemy fire in the naval campaigns.<br><br>look at Dutch wikipedia you retard or Hans Putmans account of the battle.

The Red Army in World War II, much like the Russian army in Ukraine today, suffered from a problem of oscillation: their officer corps went back and forth between being utterly disorganized and being overly rigid. Sometimes all order broke down; sometimes officers stayed put against their own judgment because to disobey even an irrational order was to invite charges of desertion. The Germans, on the other hand, had an excellent officer corps, who were allowed through the Auftragstaktik system to accomplish known objectives in their own way, without having to constantly await orders.<br><br>3: Morale. German officers, while undeniably brutal and hierarchical, had a much higher level of support among their men. Many of their men also felt that they fought for a good and glorious cause. Soviet soldiers, on the other hand, had awful morale for the most part. They spent the first year of the war retreating in panic, and the remaining three years being methodically inserted into a meat grinder on the way to Berlin.

Because to me it seems that there&#039;s flaws in these dating methods, they aren&#039;t airtight methods, and again nobody can go back in time and witness and observe the creation so we have to be careful and objective in how we interpret this likely inaccurate data.", "time": 1673806880, "resto": 14472870}, {"no": 14474749, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:23:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14473913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14473913</a><br>most intellectual atheist", "time": 1673807034, "resto": 14472870}, {"no": 14474764, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:25:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14474735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14474735</a><br>Nta but how about you just skip the bullshit and debunk uranium-lead dating if you can.", "time": 1673807129, "resto": 14472870}, {"no": 14474772, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:27:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14474735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14474735</a><br>There you go<br><br>https://www.nature.com/articles/nge<wbr>o2075", "time": 1673807244, "resto": 14472870}, {"no": 14474785, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:28:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14474577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14474577</a><br>The other guy said the same thing, but my question is how reliable or accurate are these dating methods really.

The evidence of accelerated decay is in the fact that uranium radiohalos and polonium radiohalos are found next to each other, coexisting, forming concurrently. Poloniums half life is short, for all three isotopes, anywhere from microseconds to just 130 days, and again for a polonium radiohalos to form there needs to be 500 million to a billion alpha particles shooting out quickly before decaying for that radiohalos to form. The source of all that polonium is from the uranium in the zircon inside the biotite. The uranium decays, releasing polonium into the biotite crystal, then that polonium decays creating its own radiohalos, but it&#039;s half life is so short that it would need an abundance of polonium very quickly to have enough alpha particles to create the radio halo. So, there&#039;s not a storage of polonium in the biotite from the start like gentry theorizes and like your article debunks, rather the source of the polonium creating the radiohalos is the uranium in the zircon crystal that&#039;s in the biotite. If the uranium truly decayed at the slow rate of millions of years then the polonium would decay too fast for it to create its own radiohalos.

It saw some skirmishes but no great field battle, instead it was a war of seizures and sieges. Bergues, Ath, Charleroi, Tournai, Douai, Oudenarde, and Alost fell immedietaly or after only very brief sieges. (The Wars of Louis XIV, pg. 106-108).&quot; The Triple Alliance was the only thing that apparently preempted the conquest of the entire Spanish Netherlands, with &quot;Turenne [opposing] the peace, since he believed he could have conquered the Spanish Netherlands that year (pg. 109).&quot; <br><br>France-Comte was also conquered with the leading general having met &quot;no substantial resistance pg. 108).&quot; We also see in the later Franco-Dutch War, which Spain joined as part of a large coalition, that &quot;[France-Comte] was secured in a campaign of only six weeks (pg. 124)&quot; with France&#039;s forces spread relatively thin given their commitments and the size of the coalition descending upon them.", "time": 1673946789, "resto": 14480080}, {"no": 14484368, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)04:22:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14480728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14480728</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Las universidades que existian en letrinoamerica eran basura eclesiastica que daba solo teologia y estaba destinada a una minoria cerrada y elitista</span><br><br>literalmente todas las universidades europeas empezaron as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n", "time": 1673947366, "resto": 14480080}, {"no": 14484433, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)04:44:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14484345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14484345</a><br>Henry Kamen is a hateful Spain hating gook.

The case involved a septet of black men, ranging in ages from 20 to 38, who were executed by the state of Virginia in what has been described as &quot;a legal lynching.&quot;<br><br>The case began on January 8, 1949 when Ruby Floyd, a white woman and practicing Jehovah&#039;s Witness in her early 30s, was gang-raped in the black section of Martinsville where she had gone to collect money for clothing she&#039;d sold. The seven men, Frank Hairston, Francis Grayson, Booker Millner, James Hairson, Howard Hairston, Joe Hampton, and John Taylor, were quickly convicted and found guilty by an all-white jury. A month before their executions, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The lawyers for the Martinsville Seven, although ultimately unsuccessful, had appealed based on the novel claim of equal protection rather than due process (the Virginia state supreme court argued that &quot;equal protection in this case means the state will have to execute one white person for each Negro executed.&quot;)<br><br>The case seemed open-and-shut as far as Virginia was concerned.

This basic paradigm underlies most of the conflict in the third world, because once women get rights and know about the greater outside world they want that civilization. Unironically, and being completely truthful, feminism is a marker of civilization. The entire concept of &quot;white&quot; ness (using the Americlap Anglo definition) is largely a means to extend white male society&#039;s benefits to white women, as a means to keep them supportive of it. It worked and continues to work flawlessly in this regard as even brown, black, asian etc women will respect white men more than their husbands if the white men respect them back as equals. There is a basic element of the human condition here that white people, perhaps inadvertently, adopted in the 19th century that made them the dominant global culture.

This takes effort to elaborate, effort that&#039;s barely worth for beginners. This is why it enters veeery late in the development of deplorables-in-the-making. What the JQ starts with is the application of general race-realism to the Jews. So Tyrone lied or omitted politics, race, IQ, crime and most of history to get his gibs-me-dats and &quot;reparayshuns&quot;, Ahmad, Sanjay and Juan so they could serve ethnic food in the EU, UK and US respectively, while Zhang, Juw\u014fn and S\u014dta did it, because they feared being next after whitey&#039;s quota&#039;d and cancelled out of big tech and chicom delusions of a &quot;White Peril&quot;. OK. Now what about Shlomo? Shlomo seems a like a lovely guy at first. Isn&#039;t he basically white? One of us? High IQ? Israel: the white ethno-state? JUDEO-Christian civilisation? Based? On Ben Shapiro? OK, this is epic. But at this point, you&#039;ve learned to let go, even if it hurts. So you investigate. You commit more heresy against the cathedral, of course, using its own means against itself. What&#039;s the taboo about Jews? Everything. &quot;Early life&quot; is to Jews what &quot;13/50&quot; is to blacks: numbers and patterns that defy mere chance. You look at politics, genetics, history, pic related. Ouch, that hurt, but you needed that. If one thing was only hazy before, it&#039;s that someone&#039;s biography REALLY puts their work into perspective.

All I need to point it is when the Jews use these three to get an advantage, it harms whites. Educational culture? Culture of critique. Jews instinctively deconstruct white concepts that glue majority-white society together. Big example: Hart-Celler Immigration Act of 1965 (few gentlemen begged to differ). Endogamy? Jews, like any other group, instinctively practice identity politics/ethno-centrism/nepotism to further their group-interest. Big example: Ivy League (see Ron Unz) and uni in general, promoting critical whiteness. Bigger example: Franz Boas, Ashley Montagu, the UNESCO on race (the gentleman known as Ronald Fisher begged to differ). Economic success? Well, capitalism is Jewish, the study literally proved that. Sassoon family? Goldman-Sachs? Capitalism sucks. All gentlemen agree. No matter how many pots of gold, leprecauns and rainbows, the Irish NEVER did anything like this.

Lawrence Lowell and his peers was to transform the admissions process from a simple objective test of academic merit into a complex and holistic consideration of all aspects of each individual applicant; the resulting opacity permitted the admission or rejection of any given applicant, allowing the ethnicity of the student body to be shaped as desired. As a consequence, university leaders could honestly deny the existence of any racial or religious quotas, while still managing to reduce Jewish enrollment to a much lower level, and thereafter hold it almost constant during the decades which followed.11 For example, the Jewish portion of Harvard\u2019s entering class dropped from nearly 30 percent in 1925 to 15 percent the following year and remained roughly static until the period of the Second World War.12</span><br>Jesus Christ THIS IS YOUR FUCKING SOURCE LMAO", "time": 1673935107, "resto": 14482027}, {"no": 14483878, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:01:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14483868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14483868</a><br>Jews being discriminated a century ago doesn&#039;t disprove what has happened since the 60s.<br>Anyway Jews have used threats and accusations of anti-semitism and subterfuge to get into positions of power in academic institutions since the late 30s", "time": 1673935297, "resto": 14482027}, {"no": 14483900, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:07:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14483702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14483702</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is coming from the guy who&#039;s &quot;&quot;&quot;evidence&quot;&quot;&quot; was for me to control f &quot;Jew&quot; in a history book on soviet ukraine. rich.</span><br>Jeez, you sure are mad.

Nonetheless, in a later letter to her sister, she avoided eating pork and dreaded attending church, stressing that she remained Muslim in secret.[4] She had given birth to a son, Heinrich, in Aden in December 1866; he died in France en route to Germany in the summer of 1867.[5]</span><br><br>This is the Muslim princess&#039;s autobiography.<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00ruetgoog/page/n11<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00stragoog/page/n9<br><br>Her descendants with the Christian German man still live in Florida in the US I&#039;ve heard.", "filename": "Salma_bent_said", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 322, "h": 468, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673933437342457, "time": 1673933437, "md5": "GppG639XxUMv7QbQc/dt7A==", "fsize": 69055, "resto": 14478065}, {"no": 14483778, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)00:31:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14483773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14483773</a><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phili<wbr>ppe_Servaty<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Philippe Servaty is a Belgian[1] Walloon journalist who formerly worked for Brussels-based newspaper Le Soir.[2] While in Morocco from 2002\u201305, he engaged in sex with over 80 Moroccan women, promising to take them to Belgium.[3] Before leaving for Belgium, he asked them for sexual photos as souvenirs and photographed them in poses that could be seen as degrading. They included ejaculating on the face of a veiled woman and having another woman kneel, bound, and gagged while he urinated on her.[3][4] After returning to Belgium, he published the photos on the internet under the pseudonym, &#039;Belguel&#039; and included captions such as, &quot;There is no better drug than to ejaculate on the veiled face of a woman.&quot; &quot;These sluts are so naive. If you promise to marry them and take them along with you to Brussels they do whatever you ask&quot; and \u201cI met her walking down the street in her djellaba.

In a computer a series of electrons being in certain states &quot;is&quot; the data. You can, theoretically, take these electrons, in some configuration, and remove them from the computer (this obviously doesn&#039;t work, but it&#039;s still theoretically possible). That&#039;s not the case with the brain, as it&#039;s constantly in motion. If you must make a comparison of brains and computers, the brain is a bunch of peripherals plugged into a motherboard with no CPU or hard drive, just huge amounts of RAM; because the same RAM that is used for, say, visual processing, is ALSO used for memory (there&#039;s no hard drive, remember), the memories are never &quot;stored&quot; anywhere, but are rather constantly being moved around. A simple empirical demonstration of this is why your memories change, such as viewing certain events in your head from a ghostly third-person camera, or from the point of view of someone else present. So, yes, this does mean that a mind is only doing anything over time: a mind frozen in time doesn&#039;t do any thinking, and is basically dead. <br><br>So, yes, correct, materialists argue that you cannot hold a memory in your hand, or experience, or any mental phenomena, because these things aren&#039;t material, they&#039;re processes. Materialists (who I suppose should be rebranded to something like &quot;brains cause minds&quot;-ists or something) aren&#039;t required to believe that everything is matter, they aren&#039;t monists after all (it would be absurd to argue that everything is matter given that spacetime is very real and isn&#039;t matter). <br><br>Dualists, however, do actually have to hold that memories are discrete, physical things, made out of matter, it&#039;s just a different kind of matter than, say, hands are made out of.

People would assimilate their Pagan Anglo-Saxan and Nordic beliefs into the body of Christianity to fill in the cosmological gaps. Magic could now come from God (Miracles), as an inherent property of *Nature (White or Benign Magic), and of course Satan (Black Magic).

Like, yeah, Jews are associated with moneylending and speculative finance -- okay we get it. And that&#039;s due to the role that Jews played in medieval Europe and this role became highly prized with the development of capitalism, but this also posed great dangers as we see with the destruction of most of European Jewry in the 20th century. It&#039;s like a vicious circle of Jewish &quot;middlemen&quot; benefiting but also being thrown to the wolves when the going gets tough. So the Marxist answer is &quot;get rid of money, get rid of speculation, get rid of capitalism.&quot; So a radical self-critique is part of this whole thing too.<br><br>The Frankfurt School were also complex individuals with different ideas, and generally had (with the exception of Marcuse I think) a negative appraisal of Israel since that&#039;s opposed to a sense of universalism that they were going for.

He thought the modern world is here to stay and totalitarianism is bad, but people yearn for it because of an underlying illness of modern society which is frightening and neurotic and in which freedom is reduced to &quot;which movie to watch&quot; or whatever. It was also written before the Holocaust and it&#039;s an indictment of Nazi Germany but not on that basis.

Instead of going all idol-smashy Jacob appears to treat the idols with respect, and &quot;hid&quot; them under the oak near Shechem.<br><br>It appears to me that Jacob was not a Yahweh-one-ist. He does however worship Yahweh first among the gods and does not bring other gods into Yahweh&#039;s holy place, just as you would purify yourself before entering the Holy of Holies. This last part is my interpretation, but scholars have taken note that Jacob here has a much more relaxed attitude toward foreign gods/idols than you would find in the Exodus story.", "time": 1673922821, "resto": 14483007}, {"no": 14483089, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:35:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14483007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14483007</a><br>Didn&#039;t exist.", "time": 1673922918, "resto": 14483007}, {"no": 14483096, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:36:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14483089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14483089</a><br>thank you captain obvious", "time": 1673923014, "resto": 14483007}, {"no": 14483419, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)22:48:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14483089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14483089</a><br>Neither did Czech, Lech or Rus and you don&#039;t hear redditors rushing to disprove their existence", "filename": "images - 2023-01-16T214746.292", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 541, "h": 567, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673927284590813, "time": 1673927284, "md5": "La25JpbAvyMT2XHzg+XmoQ==", "fsize": 51620, "resto": 14483007}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14478954, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:06:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can you somehow prove that there is a real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist either via logical symbolic manipulation or science?", "filename": "1672371093816333", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3000, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673859976824584, "time": 1673859976, "md5": "hJnKwqJs55ejRszvKG6o7Q==", "fsize": 3701987, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "can-you-somehow-prove-that-there-is-a-real", "replies": 44, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 14478971, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:10:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "God is gay.
