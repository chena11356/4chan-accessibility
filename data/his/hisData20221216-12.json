When EIMI is not used as a copula it always describes a state and is the imperfect form, both which denote duration and not a punctiliar event.<br><br>&quot;I am (eimi) never has a punctiliar ending&quot;.\u2014Edward Goodrick; Hebrew and Greek", "time": 1671175523, "resto": 14332032}, {"no": 14332646, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)02:27:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14332498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14332498</a><br>He didn\u2018t use English, after all.

Churches stuck closer to Roman basilica styles, resulting in the Romanesque architerctural style which lasted for much longer in Italy. Wood buildings were rare and would have been mostly in the countryside and temporary, constructed by nomadic invaders. Brick buildings were common, with new medieval buildings using half timbered style, but much less so than anywhere else in Europe. Even in the countryside peoples houses were mostly built with brick or stones. A great surviving example is the Apulian trullo, a stone country house that can be built or demolished I a couple of days (in the past this was done to avoid paying property tax).

Understanding the cultural context will help. First, Jesus\u2019 mission was first to the people of the covenant, i.e., the Jews, who were awaiting the Messiah.

(Keep in mind though, this was more in the vein of America as the global leader rather than modern globalism.) Likewise, he supported intervention in the economy while McKinley didn&#039;t. McKinley was friendly to trusts and had no mind for increased taxation or regulation. Taft was essentially a hybrid between the conservative, pro-business wing of McKinley and the progressive wing of Roosevelt. And after interventionism became unpopular after WW1, along with Wilson having accomplished most of the progressive agenda, the country and the GOP returned to its (then) establishment roots, which were pro-tariff, low-taxes, moderate social conservatism, immigration restriction, non-interventionism and general pro-business attitudes, which is obviously similar to the Trump wing of the party today. And as progressive as he might have been, even Roosevelt had the same attitudes on immigration, trade and most social issues as the establishment GOP, if not further to the right in some circumstances.", "time": 1671149210, "resto": 14330063}, {"no": 14331739, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:35:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I miss when the GOP wasn&#039;t controlled by schizo evangelicals and Zionists.", "filename": "f90900220731f6098ca709f351ed2f51", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 268, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 34, "tim": 1671154527995807, "time": 1671154527, "md5": "OG1VVqIOE09lG7lMT6HQGw==", "fsize": 46202, "resto": 14330063}, {"no": 14331747, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Conservatives don&#039;t conserve anything and liberals don&#039;t liberate anything, I live in hell.", "time": 1671154721, "resto": 14330063}, {"no": 14331863, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)21:25:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14331473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14331473</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;somebody who wanted to expand American power, but largely in America&#039;s own sphere</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Guam, Hawaii and the Philippines </span><br>??", "time": 1671157555, "resto": 14330063}, {"no": 14332193, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:11:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14331739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14331739</a><br>*passes a military ordnance expelling Jews from Tennessee&quot;", "time": 1671163876, "resto": 14330063}, {"no": 14332356, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)00:11:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14330248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14330248</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Roosevelt and McKinley were the first international imperialists in US history.</span><br>Are you fucking insane", "time": 1671167497, "resto": 14330063}, {"no": 14332371, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)00:15:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14331739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14331739</a><br>The usa not having a conservative rural party, libertarian urban party and socialist labor party is a curse on the world.

(2018) analyzed 32 individuals from three Eneolithic cemeteries at Deriivka, Vilnyanka and Vovnigi, which Anthony (2019a) ascribed to the Dnieper\u2013Donets culture. These individuals belonged exclusively to the paternal haplogroups R and I (mostly R1b and I2), and almost exclusively to the maternal haplogroup U (mostly U5, U4 and U2). This suggests that the Dnieper-Donets people were &quot;distinct, locally derived population&quot; of mostly of Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) descent, with Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) admixture. The WHG admixture appears to have increased in the transition from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic. Unlike the Yamnaya culture, whose genetic cluster is known as Western Steppe Herder (WSH), in the Dnieper\u2013Donets culture no Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) or Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry has been detected. At the Vilnyanka cemetery, all the males belong to the paternal haplogroup I, which is common among WHGs. David W. Anthony suggests that this influx of WHG ancestry might be the result of EEFs pushing WHGs out of their territories to the east, where WHG males might have mated with EHG females.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dnieper-Donets males and Yamnaya males carry the same paternal haplogroups (R1b and I2a), suggesting that the CHG and EEF admixture among the Yamnaya came through EHG and WHG males mixing with EEF and CHG females. According to Anthony, this suggests that the Indo-European languages were initially spoken by EHGs living in Eastern Europe</span><br><br>Don&#039;t go to the Caucasus my sons, they will assimilate you....", "time": 1671162332, "resto": 14330550}, {"no": 14332216, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:15:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14332112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14332112</a><br>The Southern Paper, R-L23 is from CHG.

I don&#039;t think being a &quot;settler&quot; is an indicator of whiteness or not. I do, however, think being descendant of a settler is VITALLY important to the cultural and national identity of New World White People. The settler mythos, the drive for independence, the mythical richness of untamable wilderness, these are the some of the notions and folky ideas that separate us from White Europeans.", "time": 1671144751, "resto": 14327533}, {"no": 14331218, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Race Map00", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3276, "h": 2212, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1671145284588535, "time": 1671145284, "md5": "bjR0O7NnVmIf1hHeKhf2eg==", "fsize": 1333415, "resto": 14327533}, {"no": 14331250, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:10:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14331184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14331184</a><br>I think he just meant that the colonies, which only had europeans from a rather small geographic area, and drastically different native americans and africans, gave rise to the &quot;white&quot; identity as opposed to those other blacks and reds.

As usual you probably should take their assessment with a grain of salt, because they are classic liberals, look at the situation through a decidedly liberal lense, and advocate for liberal policies. But they make a persuasive case that it&#039;s all about the institutions, mang.<br><br>Their model is that societies can have either extractive or inclusive economic institutions and either exclusive or inclusive political institutions. Typically you get them as a set and the economic and political insitutions work in tandem. Which is to say that an extractive economy (which is geared towards exploiting the populace for the benefit of a small elite) is very likely enabled by an exclusionary political system (which is geared towards keeping everyone but a small elite barred from the decision making process). Likewise, an inclusive economy (which is geared towards allowing all people to pursue material success) is probably enabled by an inclusive political system (which lets all people participate in the decision making process).<br><br>Acemoglu and Robinson are of the opinion that the failure of so many African states is rooted in extractive/exclusionary institutions set up by the former Colonial powers. When the European empires left the continent, their institutions did not and merely were retooled to serve the enrichment of local elites instead of European elites. <br><br>Botswana, however, had the good fortune to take a different path. When the Brits annexed Botswana and were about to hand it over to the British South Africa Company for exploitation, three Tswana chieftains (pictured) travelled to London to plead to Queen Victoria that their country be turned into a protactorate and be allowed to preserve self-government for the most part.

They had so much momentum after capturing Nanjing, had they immediately marched North and captured Beijing too I think the Qing would have fully collapsed. Instead they just sat in Nanjing to make it their model capital, instead it became their tomb.<br><br>If you look at what happened historically once they actually tried to administer the territories they&#039;d conquered they were complete failures. Actual land reform was abandoned in favor of just shaking down landlords for payoffs. Taiping leaders appropriated absurd amounts of captured loot as their own booty while leaving everyone else in poverty. Barbarism was the rule of the day, with people being burned at the stake (or &quot;turned into a celestial lamp&quot; as they called it) simply for not bowing deeply enough when a Taiping leader walked by. Additionally common soldiers were banned from having sex, while the leaders had enormous harems. It was literally hell on Earth.

(2018) analyzed 32 individuals from three Eneolithic cemeteries at Deriivka, Vilnyanka and Vovnigi, which Anthony (2019a) ascribed to the Dnieper\u2013Donets culture. These individuals belonged exclusively to the paternal haplogroups R and I (mostly R1b and I2), and almost exclusively to the maternal haplogroup U (mostly U5, U4 and U2). This suggests that the Dnieper-Donets people were &quot;distinct, locally derived population&quot; of mostly of Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) descent, with Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) admixture. The WHG admixture appears to have increased in the transition from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic. Unlike the Yamnaya culture, whose genetic cluster is known as Western Steppe Herder (WSH), in the Dnieper\u2013Donets culture no Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) or Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry has been detected. At the Vilnyanka cemetery, all the males belong to the paternal haplogroup I, which is common among WHGs. David W. Anthony suggests that this influx of WHG ancestry might be the result of EEFs pushing WHGs out of their territories to the east, where WHG males might have mated with EHG females.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dnieper-Donets males and Yamnaya males carry the same paternal haplogroups (R1b and I2a), suggesting that the CHG and EEF admixture among the Yamnaya came through EHG and WHG males mixing with EEF and CHG females.

After November 1914 Ottoman policy towards the Greek population shifted; state policy was restricted to the forceful migration to the Anatolian hinterland of Greeks living in coastal areas, particularly the Black Sea region, close to the Turkish-Russian front. This change of policy was due to a German demand for the persecution of Ottoman Greeks to stop, after Eleftherios Venizelos had made this a condition of Greece&#039;s neutrality when speaking to the German ambassador in Athens. Venizelos also threatened to undertake a similar campaign against Muslims that were living in Greece if Ottoman policy did not change. While the Ottoman government tried to implement this change in policy, it was unsuccessful and attacks, even murders, continued to occur unpunished by local officials in the provinces, despite repeated instructions in cables sent from the central administration.

It faces limited threats from southern neighbours. To its east, it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily.<br><br>There is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines, would have enormous difficulty transferring forces from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines, would be able to move its forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully coordinated and initiate war simultaneously and deploy substantially, superior force on at least one front, Israel can initiate war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers might have.<br><br>There is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By the time ,it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be powerful enough to threaten Syria.

The single threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be managed if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was overrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided internally.<br><br>It is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers, which is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians, Syrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last group is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the Syrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt&#039;s interests are to the south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria is always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt adds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances, Egypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other.

The conquests of Israel occur when powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring force to bear that Israel cannot resist.<br><br>Israel therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger, more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel&#039;s military can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests (as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the consequences can be catastrophic.<br><br>Israel exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely independent state.
