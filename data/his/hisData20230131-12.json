However, almost immediately after Hellenic paganism went extinct in the 9th Century, we see as early as the 10th Century during the Macedonian Renaissance, a reclamation of the Hellenic identity, which would be furthered during the Palaeologan Renaissance some centuries later. Point being, the Hellenic identity was never entirely forgotten, just that the Christian identity was emphasised. As for Arvanites, yes being Orthodox, they were subject to the Rum Millet, but had already felt kinship with their fellow Orthodox prior to this, and would continue this into the revolution. The only reason they gradually abandoned their language was because their aims at incorporating other Christian Albanians in Albanian proper into Greece during the revolution failed, and they wanted to distance themselves from those still under Ottoman rule.", "time": 1675137144, "resto": 14552713}, {"no": 14555864, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:53:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14555861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14555861</a><br>Forgot the image.", "filename": "greeksettlement", "ext": ".png", "w": 1247, "h": 794, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1675137220189510, "time": 1675137220, "md5": "EgqMi+jLdh2o771zMTG5TQ==", "fsize": 95382, "resto": 14552713}, {"no": 14556709, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:15:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14555864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14555864</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Afro-greeks</span>", "filename": "1662231638325988", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 242, "h": 293, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675156528911300, "time": 1675156528, "md5": "1ipWZiyNzdfDNGQT2qfCjA==", "fsize": 11465, "resto": 14552713}, {"no": 14557112, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)07:06:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14556709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14556709</a><br>Thought this would get a reaction. <br>It&#039;s one village near Xanthi in Thrace, of about ~1000 people called Avato.

The whole purpose of these policies initially was to allow for a more business friendly environment such that the domestic firms that had stagnated and were losing ground to foreign competitors during the 1970s could be given the incentive and the capital resources to invest in new plant, equipment, and R&amp;D. However, many in hindsight would argue that the deregulation of financial markets, particularly the repeal of Glass-Steagall in the United States, and the opening up of countries to greater foreign investment and exchange of commodities and labor (via arrangements and institutions such as GATT, NAFTA, and the WTO, as well as changes in various countries&#039; immigration laws) only served to sever the connection that kept capital at home serving the nation and instead gave corporations free reign to seek higher dividends through the outsourcing of manufacturing operations to those areas with the lowest labor costs (i.e Southeast Asia and Mexico). This, of course, has meant the loss of many skilled jobs and a net reduction of human capital in those countries whose firms have exported their labor costs overseas, while a net inflow of foreign investment capital has meant a reduced reliance on domestic savings for start-up and expanding businesses. <br><br>On net balance, then, it seems that the neoliberal agenda has produced good and bad.

Neoliberal theorists like Friedman, Hayek, and others believed that the productive energies that had driven U.S. economic growth from the early 19th to the mid 20th century were being stymied by the disincentives of red-tape and legally imposed barriers to entry that prevented the innovation process resulting from competitive capitalism from taking place. Simply remove the bureaucratic bloat, introduce competitive pressures, and, boom, the economy would rebound like never before. <br><br>The issue is that rather than using those tax credits and easier legal climate to invest in new plant and equipment, most U.S. firms saw that the profit margin could be maximized in the short term by outsourcing most of their manufacturing operations altogether.<br><br>This is to say nothing of the financial deregulation, which has been disastrous to say the least.

Instead, we got the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the Community Reinvestment Act, and easy credit courtesy of the Federal Reserve.

As finite persons, we are limited in time, space, intelligence, and insight. But the transcendent and sovereign God sees the end from the beginning and providentially orders history so that His purposes are ultimately achieved through human free decisions. In order to achieve His ends, God may have to put up with certain evils along the way. Evils which appear pointless to us within our limited framework may be seen to have been justly permitted within God\u2019s wider framework. To borrow an illustration from a developing field of science, Chaos Theory, scientists have discovered that certain macroscopic systems, for example, weather systems or insect populations, are extraordinarily sensitive to the tiniest perturbations. A butterfly fluttering on a branch in West Africa may set in motion forces which would eventually issue in a hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean. Yet it is impossible in principle for anyone observing that butterfly palpitating on a branch to predict such an outcome. The brutal murder of an innocent man or a child\u2019s dying of leukemia could produce a sort of ripple effect through history such that God\u2019s morally sufficient reason for permitting it might not emerge until centuries later and perhaps in another land. When you think of God\u2019s providence over the whole of history, I think you can see how hopeless it is for limited observers to speculate on the probability that God could have a morally sufficient reason for permitting a certain evil.

Without a first cause, there would be no others. Therefore, the First Cause is God.<br>3. The Argument from Necessary Being: Because objects in the world come into existence and pass out of it, it is possible for those objects to exist or not exist at any particular time. However, nothing can come from nothing. This means something must exist at all times. This is God.<br>4. The Argument from Gradation: There are different degrees of goodness in different things. Following the \u201cGreat Chain of Being,\u201d which states there is a gradual increase in complexity, created objects move from unformed inorganic matter to biologically complex organisms. Therefore, there must be a being of the highest form of good. This perfect being is God.<br>5. The Argument from Design: All things have an order or arrangement that leads them to a particular goal.

Just as we see in the times of ancient Israel, the visible institution will often fall into varying degrees of idolatry and unfaithfulness to the Lord and His Covenant.

Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ\u2019s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort\u2014opposed as they are to our religion\u2014shall not be hung up in any church of Christ.

Some persons, however, find a difficulty in this faith; when they hear that the Father is God, and the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, and yet that this Trinity is not three Gods, but one God; and they ask how they are to understand this: especially when it is said that the Trinity works indivisibly in everything that God works, and yet that a certain voice of the Father spoke, which is not the voice of the Son; and that none except the Son was born in the flesh, and suffered, and rose again, and ascended into heaven; and that none except the Holy Spirit came in the form of a dove. They wish to understand how the Trinity uttered that voice which was only of the Father; and how the same Trinity created that flesh in which the Son only was born of the Virgin; and how the very same Trinity itself wrought that form of a dove, in which the Holy Spirit only appeared. Yet, otherwise, the Trinity does not work indivisibly, but the Father does some things, the Son other things, and the Holy Spirit yet others: or else, if they do some things together, some severally, then the Trinity is not indivisible. It is a difficulty, too, to them, in what manner the Holy Spirit is in the Trinity, whom neither the Father nor the Son, nor both, have begotten, although He is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.

When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light.

For the average Ottoman it wasn&#039;t too different from the average Christian Roman, especially in regards to religious rites and deities. Christians had already wiped out knowledge of the pre-christian religion, while increased overland trade meant stronger development of internal hinterlands. One might argue that all necessary preconditions for industrialization were present, especially with direct access to Chinese gunpowder. By comparison the West was an isolated, boggy, dead-end peninsula that was slowly being absorbed by Islamic culture anyway. <br><br>This only ended with Spain&#039;s rise and their expeditions across the Atlantic. The Ottomans had grown extremely complacent by this point, and their power structure prohibited necessary adaptation to the new competition. Spain then completely raped them economically, despite being a retarded dry shithole run by religious zealots, and Ottoman power would cease to be relevant until the American Civil War almost two centuries later (and even then that power was gone by 1900, laying the groundwork for the Empire&#039;s total destruction in 1917).<br><br>I mention that latter &#039;graph because it informs how the Ottoman Empire worked: trade. Traders especially Islamic traders made money. Islam was expanding in China with the Ugyhurs and even the Kahns embraced Islam. This, for all intents and purposes, was the future as the slavic tribes were slowly raped into submission. This began to end when the occupying Islamists used contractors -Muscovites- to collect tribute instead of adhering to Islamic Law. This gave rise to the Russian Empire which would ultimately crush the Ottoman&#039;s desired territories/expansion/market across the middle east and central asia. Factors resulting from this resulted in the 1980 Invasion of Afghanistan and Soviet support for socialism within India and China - a strategy that worked well prior to 1975.", "time": 1675149283, "resto": 14554439}, {"no": 14556475, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)02:23:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14556451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14556451</a><br><br>Also, you can see here perfectly why modern Turkey and modern Russia are so shit and unfixable, because they suffer from the same Ottoman heritage. The Ottomans were unable to industrialize (ask me about the industrial output of the ottoman empire prior to the first world war) for the same reasons Russia couldn&#039;t. However, Russia was slightly more industrialized due to Peter The Great, who enacted the reforms Turks needed to also do. The Ottomans didn&#039;t even take notice of the problem until the disastrous Crimean War - a war the Ottomans won, although with significant western assistance. With Napoleon in France, who enacted similar reforms to industrialize France in relation to the UK and Germany, this began a series of events that would kill both Empires in the same way they started: an extremely violent genocidal war that, ultimately, would be decided by western powers. By this point the west had formalized all their internal relations into the Peace of Westphalia, which prevented the Napoleonic Wars from wrecking a similar havoc on Western internal relations.<br><br>Going back to the start: The Roman Empire had similar conflict resolution mechanisms enabling pan-European and some pan-Asiatic trade. Most of this was done through marine shipping and waterways. The breakdown of such systems in the west permitted Ottomans increased, and more aggressive, expansion of such trade in the east (usually overland but not entirely) making them wealthy. Many were still farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, etc but a larger middle class developed and remained until discovery of the new world. The Ottomans were consistently wealthy until ~1600. Which, not coincidentally, was around the same time the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia was planned and setup in 1607. By this point all Western powers had navies whereas the Ottomans and Russians didn&#039;t.

During the same period, Jim Crow shit led many blacks to move north to the cities. So they became part of that city machine politics system. Since it was regional, southerners voted for their local Democrats while northerners for theirs. People back then didn&#039;t have mass media so it was a lot harder for geographically distant people to get mad over ideological purity. Meaning a racist white southerner and a black southerner-that-moved-north would just be on the same team during this period because of regional politics differences. Anyway, this is how the Democratic coalition ended up looking like it did by FDR&#039;s time. The Republicans on the other hand, who were much more ideologically-minded (anti-slavery and anti-polygamy) accomplished those ideological goals by the late 1800s, so they needed new ones. At first it was crap like gold vs. silver standard, but what happened once the other Roosevelt (Teddy) came on the scene was a push for progressivist politics. During the same time, other Republicans like Coolidge wanted more financial conservative practices. Think about it this way: during a time when the only people who had the luxury to give a shit about economic ideology were rich whites in the North, there was space for both sides in the same party, both the welfare-ish and the Wall Street Republican direction. So the Repubs were both because of this, and the Democrats were also both because of their strange coalition, which due to regional needs influenced corresponding ideology). Both parties had left and right wings during the early 20th century because of this. Since the usefulness of cities and immigrants grew for Democrats, and the Southerners didn&#039;t want to stick around with that anymore as the Dems&#039; ideology shifted to suit their main base, right-wingers fought to take over the GOP from moderates, for strategic victory", "filename": "Hope", "ext": ".png", "w": 220, "h": 333, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675146996363478, "time": 1675146996, "md5": "6un2DYUm+vgL3/Fkp7j6hA==", "fsize": 36569, "resto": 14554921}, {"no": 14556340, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)01:39:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Italians and Irish people were the first hispanics lol", "time": 1675147147, "resto": 14554921}, {"no": 14556409, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)01:58:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14555254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14555254</a><br>The only major similarity between Trump and Jackson is a obvious distance for due process when it didn&#039;t suite their agenda.

And the empire had been busy putting down more rebellions in the eastern satrapies and in the ongoing upheaval that lasted nearly 60+ years with the instability of Egypt. <br><br>The only thing we know for certain is the quality of early Persian cataphracts that were the nucleus of the late Achaemenid period army and their cavalry in general. Other than that, incompetent advisors, corrupt court officials, and an inexperienced king didn&#039;t really put the footing there to call the Achaemenids still &quot;strong&quot; in the face of a major external threat. But again, the Persian and Mede calvary did match the Greek/Macedonians equally and Alexander nearly died a few times in battle against them.", "time": 1675102920, "resto": 14553246}, {"no": 14553899, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)14:38:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14553600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14553600</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kublai was trying to stabilize things</span><br>Lmao he was the reason for its collapse", "time": 1675107480, "resto": 14553246}, {"no": 14553909, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)14:40:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14553600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14553600</a><br>See <a href=\"#p14553433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14553433</a>", "time": 1675107638, "resto": 14553246}, {"no": 14553911, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)14:41:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14553246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14553246</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Were the Mongols actually brutally efficient conquerors?</span><br>yes.<br>conquering is not the same as consolidating and administrating an empire.", "time": 1675107705, "resto": 14553246}, {"no": 14553917, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)14:43:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14553911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14553911</a><br>Modern academics bend themslves to claim that they were good at the latter too", "time": 1675107783, "resto": 14553246}, {"no": 14553922, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)14:44:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14553917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14553917</a><br>they really only bother when talking about the silk road", "time": 1675107887, "resto": 14553246}, {"no": 14553935, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)14:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14553246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14553246</a><br>Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate lasted relatively long, longer than the USA has existed.
