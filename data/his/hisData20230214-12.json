Clearly it was a revolution of a different kind than that aimed at by Marxists, but it was still politics of a revolutionary kind and as such clearly distinct from the politics of the so-called bourgeois parties (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats) and also the conservatives and conventional nationalists. Zitelmann demonstrates that Hitler himself made this distinction, clearly and explicitly differentiating himself from the conservatives and putting the Nazi party, the Communists, and the Italian Fascists as rivals but fellow revolutionary movements, opposed to the constitutional politics of the bourgeois parties. He saw himself as a revolutionary because the political project he envisioned was one of fundamental transformation, a radical reshaping of the German social order, economy, and society. His politics was therefore total\u2014encompassing every area of life, in the same way as communism\u2014and he argued explicitly that this derived from its being a comprehensive weltanschauung (world view). This he explicitly contrasted to the limited and rule bound politics of liberalism and social and Christian democracy, which meant that it was conducted in a different way, one neither bound nor limited by law. The last aspect of this revolutionary approach was that the transformation of society it aimed at involved novelty and the creation of something new and unprecedented. This went along with a fascination, shared by most leading Nazis, with technology and modernism. This was all in marked contrast to the politics of radical reactionaries, such as the so-called conservative Maurras revolutionaries in Germany, and the Action Fran\u00e7aise in France, who looked to a reactionary politics of restoration and counter-revolution.</span>", "time": 1676251966, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619853, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619606</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do Americans really think these these ideologies have any relation to each other?</span><br>They objectively do: they&#039;re all cartoonish losers.", "time": 1676251974, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619855, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:33:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619852</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;National Socialism was not a conservative ideology.</span><br>Correct. <br>It is unfathomable that anyone can ever think it was.", "filename": "graph", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 655, "h": 414, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1676252015896891, "time": 1676252015, "md5": "1+NsPNqxrznVEJ+YV5lD6g==", "fsize": 34419, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619899, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:49:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619630</a><br>a 60 year old using the incorrect term of the day does not make every conservative racist, shitposters on /pol/ does not make every conservatives racist, whatever cherrypicked poll you&#039;ll pull out your discord group does not make conservatives racist.<br>here&#039;s your (you), screencap this and give it to your gay discord group.", "time": 1676252952, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619930, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:56:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619816</a><br>I hate America so fucking much.

It was a mode of thought that guided not only the economic life of the country, but its spiritual as well, making work and enterprise a religious endeavor. Morality could be measured by material success. Virtue lead to hard work which lead to success which lead to material wealth, rendering a man&#039;s inner morality visible. It was a very simple mantra, as Wills points out many times, straight out of Horatio Alger. Indeed, the rise of Nixon may well have been the last gasp of that mantra before its collapse into a coma where it has remained for some 40 years, twitching from time to time (Reagan, Gingrich, Tea Party), but never truly awakening before being knocked cold again by another damn recession.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The lid came off the middle class in the &#039;60s, and Nixon was the silent majority&#039;s answer to putting it back on ...

This type of liberalism was found in the views of both parties up until the 1920&#039;s - both in Wilson and in Hoover (TR&#039;s view was quite distinct). But under the pressure of the Great Depression, these two views split apart, one going to the Republicans, and one going to the Democrats. The half that went to the Republicans (laissez-faire) linked up with the authoritarian troglodytes of the JBS, southern whites, the religious loons (hence, the alliance of Milton Friendman with the loons and racists who rallied behind Barry Goldwater).

They came into a land that was overwhelmingly Slavic as a warrior caste. Over 1000 years of warfare then snuffed out the warrior class.

Protestants literally cannot agree among themselves as to what constitutes pistis (faith) and erga (works).", "filename": "Nat-Latin-Mass-top-1-videoSixteenByNine3000", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3000, "h": 1687, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676322059978267, "time": 1676322059, "md5": "3aOTdIN8ZrQsYV1LksHuig==", "fsize": 1451978, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623404, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:16:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14622426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14622426</a><br>There&#039;s a lot of good protestants in this world but theirs is a made up, central European, religion that has unfortunately spread throughout the world; easily one of the worst things to ever come out of Europe.", "time": 1676322987, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623577, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:55:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14623404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14623404</a>", "filename": "Christ-or-Pope", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1168, "h": 1185, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676325327126726, "time": 1676325327, "md5": "UTC6L7v3dTCMd85Y7IKdEw==", "fsize": 225409, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623589, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:57:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14622768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14622768</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and I&#039;ll also conveniently ignore that Jesus Christ left us a Church</span><br>A church which for centuries didn&#039;t venerate relics, making the entire distinction pointless", "time": 1676325461, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623601, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:59:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14622619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14622619</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also protestant get rekt in debate constantly</span><br>lol<br>lmao even", "filename": "Gavin Ortlund", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 711, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676325553395250, "time": 1676325553, "md5": "FRUtfQh0XMOvFq6dSFi0qw==", "fsize": 28110, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623627, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:04:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14623166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14623166</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because protestanism is fucking stupid, they are like naturalist/materialists but at the same time blindly follow their own biases without any kind of historical method criteria</span><br>This coming from the people who argue that it doesn&#039;t matter if certain doctrines were invented centuries after Christ because &quot;development of doctrine&quot;", "time": 1676325854, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623720, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:23:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14623577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14623577</a><br>Why are protestants so averse to confession?", "time": 1676327008, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623750, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:30:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "apostolic succession<br><br>/his/ being aware of the definition for legitimacy", "time": 1676327422, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623753, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Seeing Catholics and Protestants shit all over one another is very entertaining", "time": 1676327487, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14623782, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:37:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14623341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14623341</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cYou shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

In the context of the Hebrew Bible i.e. the ancient Near East, it was thought that the gods would actually come to inhabit the idols they represent, hence they were treated as living things and great care was taken to preserve them (Jeremiah 10:9). We can see this clearly in the story of Bel in Daniel 14:3-6 (which you Prots conveniently dropped because of your Satanism) where the Babylonians literally thought their idol of Bel was eating the food offered to him (spoiler: he wasn&#039;t&#039;t, the priests of Bel came in at night to deceive the people). When a neighboring tribe or nation conquered another, the idols of that nation would be carried off as a symbol that the god of that victor nation had defeated the god(s) of the losing nation (Isaiah 46:2). We see this in 1 Samuel 5:2 after the Philistines captured the Ark and set it before their idol Dagon not understanding the power that acted through it (1 Samuel 5:4-12). By the way, in your understanding of idolatry you should consider the Ark an idol, after all the priest on the Day of Atonement would offer incense and sprinkle blood before the mercy seat (Leviticus 16:13-15), which by the way was between statue of two Cherubim that God commanded the Israelites to make (Exodus 25:18), in a Temple that had been constructed with artwork (1 Kings 6:29). When Catholics bow before images we bow not to the actual image or statue but to what it represents, bowing is not always done as an act of adoration (it certainly constitutes part of that but is not the same as it) it can be a sign of simple respect or veneration, as when Jacob bowed seven times when coming to meet Esau (Genesis 33:3).", "time": 1676335670, "resto": 14622426}, {"no": 14624292, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)19:48:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14623897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14623897</a><br><a href=\"#p14624021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624021</a><br><a href=\"#p14624290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624290</a><br>The main concern of the Bible against idolatry is for a few reasons: 1.

Any of them that have to do with Constantine&#039;s state church are just one fragment of a cult organization that was broken into lots of pieces not long after it was started. But since around the time of Nicaea II, in the 8th century I think, they have indeed mostly held to an abominable practice of idol worship. This is devilish and akin to the idol worshippers that Elijah encountered when dealing with the priesthood of Baal. Fortunately, the church has not fallen into that practice. These groups only cause the way of truth to be evil spoken of, they are only a slander of Christ&#039;s name. They have, in the past, persecuted the church, specifically for their stand on these very things like being against idols and similar teachings. There were times when an Inquisition was established to arrest and imprison people, contrary to what Christ Himself said. God&#039;s word says, in Romans 12:17, &quot;Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.&quot; And in 1 Thessalonians: &quot;See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.&quot; (1 Thess. 5:15).<br><br>No-where is there any time when the New Testament church of our Lord was commanded by Him to arrest, imprison, torture, or kill anybody for their differing beliefs. That is purely satanic and evil. Conversion by jihad/swordpoint is contrary to the Gospel of peace.

As impossible as this may sound, the book of Job claims that it is possible to have proof that God exists, by &quot;seeing God face to face&quot;. It is a seemingly contradictory thing, because it is said that seeing God face to face results in death, however everyone that has seen God face to face have somehow lived. That is because by seeing God face to face, the old faithless self dies, and the new faithful self is born, as Jesus said: &quot;I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again&quot;", "filename": "i find your lack of faith disturbing", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 639, "h": 354, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1676346861311802, "time": 1676346861, "md5": "Rsj0+Df6xKqF1Ku/DRu5DQ==", "fsize": 20933, "resto": 14624658}, {"no": 14624937, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:57:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624658</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is it that the book of Job is the most ignored book of the Bible</span><br>It was one of the first Bible stories Ive ever heard from watching South Park.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z7<wbr>afkc5CpU", "time": 1676347048, "resto": 14624658}, {"no": 14624944, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:58:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624658</a><br>I&#039;m reading it right now.

After that, God Himself speaks to Job out of the whirlwind from chapter 38 to the end, which is in effect an answer to Job&#039;s request.

One evening, while the monks were feasting, singing, and playing a harp, C\u00e6dmon left early to sleep with the animals because he knew no songs. The impression clearly given by St. Bede is that he lacked the knowledge of how to compose the lyrics to songs. While asleep, he had a dream in which &quot;someone&quot; (quidam) approached him and asked him to sing principium creaturarum, &quot;the beginning of created things.&quot; After first refusing to sing, C\u00e6dmon subsequently produced a short eulogistic poem praising God, the Creator of heaven and earth.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Upon awakening the next morning, Caedmon remembered everything he had sung and added additional lines to his poem. He told his foreman about his dream and gift and was taken immediately to see the abbess, believed to be St Hilda of Whitby. The abbess and her counsellors asked C\u00e6dmon about his vision and, satisfied that it was a gift from God, gave him a new commission, this time for a poem based on &quot;a passage of sacred history or doctrine&quot;, by way of a test. When C\u00e6dmon returned the next morning with the requested poem, he was invited to take monastic vows. The abbess ordered her scholars to teach C\u00e6dmon sacred history and doctrine, which after a night of thought, Bede records, C\u00e6dmon would turn into the most beautiful verse. According to Bede, C\u00e6dmon was responsible for a large number of splendid vernacular poetic texts on a variety of Christian topics.</span>", "time": 1676361176, "resto": 14625699}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14624556, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:14:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;is a terrible president</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people still worship him because he was \u201chandsome\u201d and got killed</span>", "filename": "04B4B1FD-5245-4E79-9E5A-0E5E8EF89921", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1419, "h": 1840, "tn_w": 192, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676340895239160, "time": 1676340895, "md5": "awrMDQ2nnErVL1c3FS8VgA==", "fsize": 2484548, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-a-terrible-president", "replies": 11, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 14624564, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:16:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624556</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is a terrible president</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people still worship him because he was \u201cugly\u201d and got killed</span>", "filename": "Abraham_Lincoln_O-77_matte_collodion_print", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2200, "h": 2835, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676341013973774, "time": 1676341013, "md5": "kohoFphzovy0NFgxCU3/bQ==", "fsize": 2781755, "resto": 14624556}, {"no": 14624566, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:17:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "people worship him because he created welfare", "time": 1676341025, "resto": 14624556}, {"no": 14624569, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:17:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624564</a><br>No way he was white , looks arab", "time": 1676341048, "resto": 14624556}, {"no": 14624615, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:30:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624564</a><br>He won a war, winning a war means you&#039;re at best an above average ruler", "time": 1676341803, "resto": 14624556}, {"no": 14624638, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:37:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624569</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is a Marfan Syndrome</span><br>Abraham Lincoln possibly had Marfan Syndrome.

There was also a Cuban habanera/contradanza influence. The big innovation in jazz was the jazz scale, which draws from common scales of Western European classical music (diatonic, whole-tone, octatonic, melodic minor modes), but allowing for the interpretation, repetition and improvisation central to jazz as a genre. Jazz was initially an urban phenomenon in the South - Dixieland jazz in New Orleans in the 1910s - but when the blues scale developed in the rural Deep South, it entered jazz and introduced the out-of-key &quot;blue note&quot; to an existing scale, notably the flat fifth addition to the minor pentatonic scale, and jazz was never the same again. New Orleans jazz travelled north to Chicago and New York with the First Great Migration in the 1910s, generation on generation. Cakewalk and ragtime developed on the way in places like St Louis, influenced by jazz, but when it reached New York it got sucked up into theatre music and Yiddish musical styles, which is the origin of Tin Pan Alley. After a generation, big band music was formed, and swing became the most popular American music genre for about 15 years (Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald).", "filename": "ezgif-3-25f3f21b77", "ext": ".gif", "w": 300, "h": 180, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 75, "tim": 1676223227120514, "time": 1676223227, "md5": "STWl7BRQNZS8OD+Un+sE/g==", "fsize": 2569178, "resto": 14616756}, {"no": 14617793, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)12:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14617789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14617789</a><br><br>Blues had been growing in the Deep South since the 19th century, arguably since the end of the Civil War. Initially, blues was literally just spirituals and slave songs, and many of the old blues standards are written in this style and come directly from those traditions. The lines are often sung following a pattern closer to rhythmic talk than to a melody, which is seen as something reflected in Igbo music. The four-beats-per-measure of the blues has been associated with the melodies of the Bambara people, and to a lesser degree, the Soninke people and Wolof people, but not as much of the Mandinka people. The original country blues coagulated in the Mississippi delta as Delta blues, which was heavily influenced by folk music. This is when country and blues were essentially bonded, and blues had a great effect on the birth of bluegrass. Robert Johnson was a master of the Delta blues, and was part of the transition from uncommercial to commercial blues, which saw it explode in popularity. As the Second Great Migration (starting in the 40s) saw Blacks coming out the Deep South, bringing the country blues to the Northern cities where jazz and swing were already dominating, the new synthesis and the popularisation of blues scales and chord progressions like the 12-bar-blues (most famous chord progression in popular music) began the birth of early rock and roll. One split off before rock and roll was &#039;rhythm and blues&#039; and doo wop, which was more swing and big band oriented.

So the left-wing militant groups emerged out of that.

It wasn&#039;t just wearing a Che t-shirt, they literally wanted to be like Che and start doing that in the U.S. or West Germany or Japan. The more radical students saw their success at shutting down campuses and their images being broadcast on TV, and they had been relatively successful at that, but confused that as a sign that revolution was imminent, and they narcissistically fell in love with themselves, that they were gonna be the leaders, and believe they could switch to militant tactics and people would automatically follow them. In fact, they destroyed what were fairly large coalitions for smaller, militant and cult-like groups which completely failed at making a revolution happen so RIP<br><br>https://youtu.be/vFzCQcHglFA?t=1362<wbr>8", "filename": "days-of-rage", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 647, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1676278743933998, "time": 1676278743, "md5": "HVXH5S/jWyt+QdO+ErDTfQ==", "fsize": 87299, "resto": 14621041}, {"no": 14621167, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)04:18:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Also if you wanna immerse yourself, watch La Chinoise, which was a Godard movie that came out in 1967, which is interesting because the big revolt in France happened a year after this movie was made.

The director was sympathetic to left-wing politics, but the students are just kids who are off in an ideological la-la land and have no real connection to the workers they want to represent.

This scene is interesting because they&#039;re talking about Maoist China being more True Communism because that&#039;s what the Americans fear, but they are missing a kind of obvious point which that Americans don&#039;t really care about the ideological purity of the nations they interact with, what they care about is their own profit, or the profit of their ruling class.

Which happened for a lot of a reasons. Mainly in my opinion was the changing demographic nature of universities. World War Two and the subsequent explosion of the middle class and new money in new industries made college available to the general public for the first time ever. The new generation of students didn&#039;t come from old money aristocracy and thus they were much more open to radical movements. Along with the fact that a university student has very little oversight and they were ripe to be swept up in the new left movements of the 60&#039;s. Another major reason was that most western students were pumped full of Cold War propaganda about the superiority of capitalist and western civilization but being exposed to the issues in the west, such as the civil rights or various conflicts shook their beliefs. <br>Skipping over the 60&#039;s and going to why they turned militant in the 70&#039;s is because they failed.

It&#039;s generally devoid of love. Every person dies, has to deal with illnesses and plagues, that further corrupts them away from what they were intended to be. People can sometimes rationalize this state of affairs away, despite how tragic it is, in the case of most people, but they are confronted with this directly in the case small children who have genetic deformities and they have a hard time explaining this way. But the reality is that every single death is tragic and not what God intended. The world is only this way because of sin. God determined to punish Adam and his offspring with death, and the whole world went with it into a fallen state because of sin. However, there is a time of judgement and reconciliation, where judgement is meted out at the end of all this.

Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine!
