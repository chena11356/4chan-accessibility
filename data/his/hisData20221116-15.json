Apparently such conduct often included adult male passivity. Two historians of the Late Empire who wrote after the triumph of Christianity expressed disgust that Germanic tribes practiced pederasty. Ammianus Marcellinus (c. 380 A.D.) mentioned the Taifales, among whom a boy continued in a passive relationship until he slew a bear or boar (Gothic Wars, 2.14). Procopius (c. 550) cited the Heruls, amongst whom youths remained douloi (slaves), presumably sexually available for an adult warrior, and fought without shields until they proved their courage (History, 31, 9. 5). Thus, even if the passage from Tacitus referred to homosexuals, other evidence shows that the Germans had no single rule of conduct or viewpoint about homosexuality. When the various tribes, having established kingdoms on Roman soil, put their legal customs into writing with the help of Christian clergy, only the Visigoths in Spain penalized homosexual acts. Whatever their attitude toward adult passives or shamans, neither German nor, for that matter, Roman religion or laws condemned pederasty as such. Even Bleibtrau-Ehrenberg, who carefully marshalled documentary evidence for prejudice against &quot;homosexuals&quot; from the earliest ages, was unable to find condemnations of pederasty before Christianity influenced the Germans, but of course before that time the tribes produced no written documents to record their opinions or practices.</span>", "time": 1668631940, "resto": 14201334}, {"no": 14201539, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:53:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14201455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14201455</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Truly a loving and logical god worth adoring.</span><br>God doesn&#039;t care if you find him worthy or not.

The undeveloped areas of Earth are usually undeveloped for one major reason : no water and no soil to grow crops.

You claim that there are three conscious persons in the trinity, each with its own will, correct? And you also claim that there is only one God, because all these persons share the same nature.

I personally think it&#039;s much more likely that Christian theology is the product of two incompatible things; one is biblical Judaism and two is Platonic philosophy.

The ERE had maintained close relations with the Bulgarian, Serbian, and Croatian states, but had never had the power to add their territories to that of the ERE, barring the rule of Basil II, the first and last post-Migration Era Roman Emperor to restore the Danubian border, but even that was temporary. During the Middle Ages, the South Slavic states were primarily sovereign, independent states, and sired the first imperial Slavic states, Bulgaria and Serbia. The only state that fits this narrative is Slovenia, even Croatia was independent and sovereign for the better part of its Early Medieval history, and would enter a personal Union with Hungary after the Battle of Gvozd Mountain. It goes without saying that Zeta, and its successor state, Montenegro, were never conquered by the Ottomans, and continued to exist as a sovereign state.<br><br>Furthermore, Southeastern Europe has repeatedly housed imperial states as early as the Macedonian Empire, and in the 14th century alone, housed three imperial states, Serbia, Bulgaria, and the ERE, or four, if you consider the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The premise that the peninsula is a &quot;tribal, wartorn shithole&quot; makes sense only if one ignores 99% of history, and focuses on the Yugoslav Wars, which ironically, were instigated by foreign, predatory powers taking advantage of Yugoslavia&#039;s temporary, but fatal, internal instability in the 1990s. Modern ethnic &quot;rivalries&quot; are entirely the product of late Ottoman-era ethnic policies and post-liberation-era Western designation of borders that were not compatible with the ethnic configuration of the peninsula.
