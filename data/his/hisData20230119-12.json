Jones, who is widely known to be a powerful speaker, is visibly fatigued. His tone is tired, but reeks of ersatz sincerity. His voice does not reach high volumes and he does not employ rowdy techniques; he does not want to ignite the crowd into a frenzy. Rather, he is attempting to calm them. In fact, the audience responds to his comments with applause and cheers, but his voice remains stable and controlled. The audience interjects with loud comments, but his mode of operation is unnervingly tranquil.<br><br>Gone are the excited qualities of his previous sermons, the likes of which can be compared to Southern Baptist preaching techniques. He has replaced agitating tactics with an approach that suggests peace and all-knowing authority. Toward the end of the tape, his voice is reminiscent of a father reading a story to his children before bed. As the children in the background of the tape cease crying and his final words, \u201cWe didn\u2019t commit suicide. We committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world,\u201d are said, we are left with only eerie meditation music playing.<br><br>Unfortunately, it is a well-documented truth that Jones\u2019 speech was effective, so effective that by the end of the tape, the entire audience performed the action that Jones wanted them to.

Similarly, the policy for several years of the press and law enforcement agencies to close their eyes to reports from People\u2019s Temple and Jonestown, is not something that can happen spontaneously. Someone got to them. Can it be believed that investigations were halted by Jones\u2019 humanitarian reputation? No, this can\u2019t be believed. The apparent contradiction between the very modern and complete medical services in Jonestown, and the repressive use of drugs, behavior modification and other extreme coercive techniques up to and including murder, may not be a contradiction at all. We see it every day in the U.S. penal system, and in state psychiatric hospitals. The supposition that the CIA was actively involved in the formation and running of Jonestown as an experimental modern-day penal colony maybe too frightening to entertain. But it explains a lot more about the contradictions and mysteries surrounding Jonestown than writing it off as the craziness of a would-be messiah. The drugs, for instance, did not just appear.

The IP theft by China dispute is actually secondary to all this. The real problem America has is that the CCP directly subsidizes many of their companies without reporting it like how the rest of the world does. In simple terms China acts like one big company, which gives its own export economy a huge advantage, but negates many of the actual advantages of global free trade that allow countries to specialise.<br><br>However, contrary to Chud narratives about a firstie vs. thirdie bloc, America and China largely already worked out many of differences as did the EU and China and trade will continue. The problem is HOW they worked it out: not through the WTO, but by leveraging sanctions and putting pressure where it hurts.

The left even knows this, hence the obsession with Anarchist Catalonia (the only example of their idea somewhat working in practice) The main difference though is that in pseudo-democracies like we have in the west, the people have the illusion that they are in control whereas in pseudo-communist ones they have an enemy to revolt against.

As Chronicon Sagornini of John the Deacon writes that with their horses and &quot;leather ships&quot; to attack first the cities from the coast, then also the city of Venice itself.[35] The &quot;leather ship&quot; here refer to an animal skin (goat, sheep, maybe cow) tied up to form something like a huge bota bag, filled with air, tied on their horses sides, which helped the warrior and his horse to float, with which the Hungarians and the warriors of other nomadic societies usually used to cross rivers.[36] They first attacked and burned the coastal towns like Equilio, Cittanova, Fine, Capo d&#039;Argine, then tying the filled animal skins to their horses, they crossed the waters of the Lagoon of Venice, and sacked the island town of Chioggia, which was a part of the Dogado (homeland of the Republic of Venice).[35] Then on the day of the martyrdom of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (29 June), on their &quot;leather ships&quot;, they tried to enter Rialto and Malamocco, but before they reached the islands, on the place called Albiola the doge of Venice Pietro Tribuno met them with the Venetian war fleet, forcing them to retreat.[35] Although they lost this unusual sea battle, the Hungarians achieved something what was never done by a land army: attacking islands lying in the sea. And although the attack from 29 June was unsuccessful, they succeeded in the attack on the island of Chioggia.</span>", "filename": "3F8BDA6D-02E3-4D30-B0D8-9816A1E9A488", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 209, "h": 174, "tn_w": 209, "tn_h": 174, "tim": 1674129184415632, "time": 1674129184, "md5": "w7w4Ta43psT/rSLsoyJ4EA==", "fsize": 22303, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "on-their-way-back-home-the-hungarians", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 14496633, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)06:56:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14496623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496623</a><br>So, they lost.

Stalin&#039;s goal was to consolidate Soviet power for generations to come. He wasn&#039;t your typical Latin American presidente-por-vida whose system falls apart as soon as he&#039;s deposed in a coup. Stalin knew perfectly that the USSR was a one of a kind experiment, and that it would have countless enemies that would work 24/7 to put it down, consciously and unconsciously. For example, the existence of a powerful Red Army was a threat to Soviet power - if the Army grew stronger than the Party, the USSR would end up as a military dictatorship in the best case, and a fragmented warlord wasteland like Mexico and China in the worst case. So Stalin made sure that the Red Army would always be in an inferior position to the Party by shooting all relevant commanders. And about old Bolsheviks, Stalin knew them well, he was aware tha he dealt with idealists in some cases (Berzi\u0146s), personal ambition in other cases (Kamenev) and finally pure omnicidal schizos (Trotsky). Stalin needed internal and external stability for the USSR to thrive, maybe to even exist. And those people were obvious obstacles in the path of Realpolitik and Socialism in One Country.

They could have been created only by immense design.</span><br><br>It is hard to address this sort of thing without having a conversation. But I can tell you what worked for me, and that is to pray. Pray to the God who may or may not exist. Ask for the gift of faith, of belief. Ask that you might see -- for that is what faith is analogous to.<br><br>In my own case, it took a few years for that prayer to be answered.

God isn&#039;t a he or a she or a being. God is like the sun or like light or energy or something like that. It&#039;s not a conscious being making anything do anything, nor does it know anything, it just is. It&#039;s called source and aliens an ghosts have told mediums in books and videos that there is more than one source but that everything in this universe comes from the same source. Freewill is the options to pick from the different plans you make. When we&#039;re planning our lives we don&#039;t have a set path, we give ourselves options. Instead of oe set path we give ourselves a set of paths to pick from in life. Your life plan looks like a tree when you make it. You start out being born at the root then each freewill decision leads to a different branch and a different outcome. We usually get our spirit guides mixed up with what we think is god. Like we&#039;ll have a near death experience and someone will show up talking to you floating in space an you&#039;ll come back like I met god!!! When it was just your guide. God doesn&#039;t talk to people and work with individuals because its not a being or a person. Your guide is always with you. Every one reading this has a spirit guide in their vicinity caring for them. After you finish your reincarnation cycle you become a guide. So you have to come here and learn to be human before you can be a guide or someone else&#039;s guardian angel an help them be human.

It\u2018s interesting to consider the real religious revolution that must have happened in Germany. How did Wotan Cultists managed to completely replace the Old Priestly Order and become revered as the new Priestly Class? We know Wotan is associated with language. So they either brought runes with them or discovered and adapted foreign writing systems as their own. They also probably brought other discoveries with them, since Wotan is a God of Sorcery and Trade. They must have quite impressed these Warrior-People the Germans. But Germanics were known to travel. And if you travelled in small groups or on your own, they could have even went to China or India. Germans intermarried with Scythians, so there were lots of ethnic cousins to visit. Really fascinating to think about some kind of one-eyed traveller from Germania traveling the entire world and bringing back discoveries with him, being revered as a God, but all religions only become religions after their Prophet dies, so he must have encouraged a lot of people to become Wotan Cultists, who would spread this religious revolution. I wish we knew more about this. People seethe at the possibility of travel in the ancient world. But Wotan is the god of travel, sorcery and mysteries. His German Priests might have ended up all over the world. Maybe India or China. I wonder what scientific advancements they gave the Germanic people.

Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga&#039;s camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners,[33] mostly by crucifixion and decapitation[34] with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek&#039;s teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as &quot;a very sweet and pleasing maiden&quot;, while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses.[35][36][37] The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that &quot;the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.&quot;[38] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga&#039;s but it came to nothing.[39][40][41]</span>", "filename": "Taiwan", "ext": ".png", "w": 1717, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673902383137808, "time": 1673902383, "md5": "iRRS8qd+zKjZKzcK7ObMYQ==", "fsize": 785060, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481483, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)15:56:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478876</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The very fact the two were engaged on the same level and the Chinese had to fight them for decades is an incredible embarrassment for the Chinese lol</span><br><br>Chinese didn&#039;t fight them for decades.

The first time they tried to land, they were forced away by bad weather, and one ship&#039;s crew was captured by the natives when it crashed into the beach. The natives killed most of the crew and sent them to Koxinga.[12] On July 5, the relief force arrived and engaged in small scale confrontations with Koxinga&#039;s fleet. On July 23, the two sides gave major battle as the Dutch fleet attempted to break Koxinga&#039;s blockade. A second, ultimately unsuccessful attempt at relief was mounted in October. The Dutch tried to bombard the Chinese position with their ships, but their shots were too high and missed their target, giving the Chinese gunners time to prepare and return fire. Meanwhile, the smaller Dutch ships engaged the Chinese junks, which lured them into a narrow strait with a false withdrawal. The Dutch ships were unable to get away as the wind had died and they were forced to paddle their boats, but the Chinese caught them and massacred the crew on board and used pikes to kill those who jumped overboard. The Chinese caught Dutch grenades in nets and threw them back at the Dutch. The Dutch flagship Koukercken ran aground right in front of an enemy cannon placement and was sunk. Another ship was stranded and its crew fled to Fort Zeelandia. The remaining Dutch fleet was forced to retreat with the loss of two ships, three smaller vessels, and 130 casualties.[25]</span>", "time": 1673903089, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481521, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:05:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481504</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chinese DIDN&#039;T LOSE A SINGLE SHIP </span><br><a href=\"#p14481512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481512</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chinese didn&#039;t lose a single ship</span><br><br>If you truly believe this you are not only a chinkshill, you truly are an utter imbecile lol<br><br>A portion of the Chinese vessels were smaller junks, to believe none of those were sunk is just fucking comedy.", "filename": "Capture", "ext": ".png", "w": 586, "h": 386, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673903110533936, "time": 1673903110, "md5": "MVEqv+xzaAczb83cAMO/FA==", "fsize": 396899, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481527, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:06:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481511</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; But Europeans don&#039;t boast about beating them,</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; because they aren&#039;t pissy pathetic little nationalistic frustrators.</span><br><br>/thread<br>/chinkshot<br>/chinkseethe<br>/itsover", "time": 1673903171, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481541, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:09:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481521</a><br><a href=\"#p14481527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481527</a><br>Chinese didn&#039;t lose any ships to enemy fire in the naval campaigns.<br><br>look at Dutch wikipedia you retard or Hans Putmans account of the battle.

The advantage of the junk rig was in its ease of handling and resulting reduced crewing requirement, together with its relatively low cost of construction. Owing to its simplicity, it was also easier to repair.

In 1642, Ming foundries merged their own casting technology with European cannon designs to create a distinctive cannon known as the &quot;Dingliao grand general.&quot; Through combining the advanced cast-iron technique of southern China and the iron-bronze composite barrels invented in northern China, the Dingliao grand general cannons exemplified the best of both iron and bronze cannon designs. Unlike traditional iron and bronze cannons, the Dingliao grand general&#039;s inner barrel was made of iron, while the exterior of brass.[1][12]</span>", "time": 1673978473, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14486128, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)13:02:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14484623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14484623</a><br><a href=\"#p14486092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14486092</a> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The resulting bronze-iron composite cannons were superior to iron or bronze cannons in many respects. They were lighter, stronger, longer lasting, and able to withstand more intensive explosive pressure. Chinese artisans also experimented with other variants such as cannons featuring wrought iron cores with cast iron exteriors. While inferior to their bronze-iron counterparts, these were considerably cheaper and more durable than standard iron cannons. Both types were met with success and were considered &quot;among the best in the world&quot;[13] during the 17th century. The Chinese composite metal casting technique was effective enough that Portuguese imperial officials sought to employ Chinese gunsmiths for their cannon foundries in Goa, so that they could impart their methods for Portuguese weapons manufacturing.[13] According to the soldier Albrecht Herport, who fought for the Dutch at the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, the Chinese &quot;know how to make very effective guns and cannons, so that it\u2019s scarcely possible to find their equal elsewhere.&quot;[14]</span><br><br><a href=\"#p14486081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14486081</a>", "time":

Three days later, the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal was taken and burnt to the ground. The royal family perished in the fire, while the grand prince retreated northward.

It was on his return voyage that Alboquerque attacked and destroyed the Arabian emporia at Ormuz, Muscat, etc. At Muscat the order was to put all the Arabs to the sword, both men, women and children, to spare none, save for the purpose of torture, in order to extort the secret of such hoards of gold and silver as the natives might possess. The noses and ears of the Arabs were cut off, and their bowels torn out. A Portuguese cabin-boy, armed with a match-lock, boasted of having killed in a day eighty Arabs, the limit of either his ammunition, or his strength to reload. The hoards and sepulchres were then robbed, and the pirates sailed away, leaving only death and desolation behind them. At Ormuz the resistance of the Arabs led to a parley, in which the native chief or governor was required to acknowledge fealty to the King of Portugal, and pay a tribute of 30,000 xerafins per annum.\u201c This being refused, a siege was commenced, in which the city sufall the horrors of thirst. Beginning at 10, the jar of water rose to 200 xerafins, and finally was not to be procured at any price. With the women and children around them dying from thirst, the stout hearts of the Arabs finally gave way, and Ormuz capitulated, only to suffer extinction from the sword. No quarter was given. The order was to kill all, except the cattle; and with their lances and swords dripping innocent blood, and their wallets filled with gold and silver, whose cost of production is claimed by the modern political economist to be a mere arithmetical problem, the Portuguese again hoisted their sails.</span>", "time": 1674076935, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14493292, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)16:25:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14493272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14493272</a><br>The Portuguese plundered and sacked the Arabian coast and wiped out the Mamluk fleet and Ottoman fleet and the Portuguese destroyed the Japanese at Fukuda bay.<br><br>All while the Portuguese were outnumbered by the Arabs, Mamluks, Ottomans and Japanese at a 100:1 ratio.<br><br>Meanwhile China was the only country to crush the Portuguese (who were not unarmed, not ambushed) when the Portuguese attacked and tried to set up a fort in China in 1521 but were driven off.

A non-Muslim Chinese had a concubine who was a Sayyid&#039;s daughter, ostensibly the woman was with him because of her poverty. Surkati regarded her situation as disgraceful so proposed that the Hadramis in the area donate money to her or that she be married by a non-Sayyid Muslim. His first suggestion was ignored and the second suggestion was denounced as forbidden by the Sayyid community (a non-Sayyid man did not match the Kafa&#039;ah for a Sayyid woman).

I&#039;m paraphrasing, but bad karma is a product of an infinitely more holistic &quot;cause and effect&quot;-style situation wherein whenever you&#039;ve disrupted, and damaged, the lives of people, animals, yourself, even nature (or society some might additional argue). <br>The feelings and actions that bring about bad karma can loosely determined by those motivated by anger, fear, hatred, lazyness, to name a few. To put this into context: you kick a dog that&#039;s annoying you, that&#039;s bad karma. You decide to not sweep the walk infront of your house and someone slips on it and falls on their bum- bad karma. Bad karma is created when you deliberately make the world a worse place. <br><br>Those are simple examples, but with karma it can get more complicated an intimate then that. Lets use your primordial caveman-type humanity as an example:<br>Thog lives in his cave and instead of sweeping the ashes out from his hearth, or carrying his trash to the &quot;shit pit&quot;; he&#039;s been throwing it in the back of his cave in a large pile. The more Thog does this the dirtier and more wretched his living conditions will be. This has both secular grounded consequences (Thog will increase his likelyhood to get sick or be infested with flies &amp; parasites), but is also an example of bad karma.

I would go so far as to say the Islamic Golden age had a bigger and more meaningful impact on non-muslims than Muslims today. The Muslims didn\u2019t capitalize on their success or add on to it, most of that work was later done by Europeans. Instead, alot of Muslims called alot of the ideals Kuffar, Takfired the scholars and intellectuals of the time, and look down on the golden age, unless it\u2019s to one-up the west or as a show of dominance of their old past. The ideals of Returning to a Pre-golden age Islam (see Al-Ghazali) as it was seen as haram to mix outside thought with Islamic ones, made Muslim push away the golden age ideals. This also leads to a chain of events of Muslims rejecting western inventions (ottoman empire ban of the printing press) and is arguably one of the reasons why (most) Muslim counties, along with other reasons, were and are behind compared to the western world, who took an add-on to the ideals of the Golden age and used them to their full advantage. <br><br>Just food for thought.

The first truth is, be as dispassionate as you can possibly be. Ambivalent towards everything. You may believe in god, that doesn&#039;t matter to me. What matters is how ambivalent, how dispassionate are you? Buddha taught a path. I do not subscribe to his path for many reasons. The first among them is this. He felt the need to create a religion. I do not feel that need. I would like many people as many as possible learning from me. But i would not go as far as creating a religion, because the truth doesn&#039;t need to be made into a religion. The truth is being dispassionate is the greatest blessing. No more quarrels. No more worries. Simple bliss. Now listen. Silence is better than words. Not teaching is better than teaching. Not thinking is better than thinking. However some things need to be done before i can rest. As soon as I&#039;m done with my meditation practice and achieve tranquil trance, i will be free. I will have achieved all my desires. And then, i will be able to experience true dispassion. Currently my path entails passion towards enlightenment. Whatever it means to achieve it. I don&#039;t follow Buddhism as stated, but Hinduism has interesting things to it and i might be satisfied with it soon enough. However i don&#039;t like the idea of consciousness. I would like to worship and practice more of a religion where God is not consciousness nor a being but just an essence that is immovable and passively inactive. That would be my dream. I have no supernatural revelations. No connection with the divine beside my own thinking. But my mind tells me there is a god. Does he exist as consciousness? Probably not. But as long as I&#039;m not able to achieve trance the ancient yogic masters are one step ahead of me. I want to ask you. Did you realize that you are Brahman? If yes, share your experience, try to put it in words. And maybe i will have a clearer picture of my own future.

Treachery.

A beautiful one, I might add. Hence why the CSA&#039;s constitution was a carbon-copy of the original with the sole exception of the (often-memed) prohibition against abolishing slavery. The North discovered a loophole the founding fathers never thought of. Because South Carolina&#039;s good faith when joining the Union was betrayed and since, with the Missouri Compromise dead and ensuing states up for grabs, any consent of the governed or way to alter or abolish the government had ceased, the state became naturally obligated to secede. The ridiculousness of the assumption of intellectual parity of the negro was merely the cherry on top.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lincoln</span><br>Lincoln was a free-soiler. He assumed slavery would die out if one limited any further expansion. This is correct, plantations had to expand due to degrading soil-quality (t. Karl Marx) and a growing slave population, but even if not, the North had the underground railroad and sleepy or treasonous state governors and judges. In light of Bloody Kansas and John Brown&#039;s treason, this was especially offensive to Southerners. The problem he just couldn&#039;t get rid off was the black population. Everyone and I mean everyone, except for post-racial, communist utopian 48er scum, was expecting racial strife if blacks were liberated. That&#039;s why Lincoln came up with the idea of colonial plantation. But viewing the cost of strife as outweighing the benefits of equal rights for the negro was tantamount to Northern capitulation.

The radio brought us the war news, and the adults were constantly trying to figure out for sure where Jimmy Stewart was serving, and how dangerous it might be. Radio was a practical thing to, it gave the daily prices for beef, poultry and hog bellies.

For people who already lived in large northern industrial cities, the present was sooty and dirty but otherwise manageable. Most people had homes and even if they had lost their retirement, total economic destruction didn&#039;t occur. The FDR economy was mediocre, and the auto industry had busted, but transportation was dirt cheap due to the glut of cars manufactured over the past twenty years. However there weren&#039;t a lot of places to drive them, which is how the rapidly expanding US Highway network came about. There was also the growing aviation industry, still young and not totally mature. For educated people there was many places needing employment, it was the rural and half-literate population that had trouble integrating into this new economy. The government was planning bigger, better regional industrial chains that would completely change how the country would operate.<br><br>Compare this to the South. The stock crash and Dust Bowl had completely wiped away much of northern Texas, communities erected there stopped existing. In central Nevada and eastern California, the Water Projects had successfully killed all the ranching by about this time. Newly aggressive Jim Crow laws and Mexico&#039;s Civil War meant huge waves of migration to the big cities, especially Los Angeles. People moving there in 1940 would live in slums but would witness the orchards be completely paved over and replaced with factories and later suburban housing. <br><br>Urbanization is a major key to all this as housing prices generally rose and real estate was a safe investment, war or not.

Death. Darkness. Chaos. I have found that these things are more naturally aligned with the universe than Life, Light, and Order. That&#039;s what the evil forces of today want. These three things. Illuminati. New world order. This world. Matter. Spirit is ultimately more yin than yang. The supreme spirit is more dark than the world he created. He created the world. That was a neutral act. He sustains the world. Neutral act. He destroys the world. A neutral, natural act. But what does he do? He brings tranquility to those that think of him and worship him with their mind. But this mind has to become occultistic and more in tune with secretiveness to receive the complete revelation. That is a dark act adding to the three one dark act. I imagine the supreme spirit as a dark spirit. His spirit that proceeds from him is without color. But i imagine his aura as a dark aura, a limitless void as an aura. I imagine the night of power, laylatul-qadr, as this spirit proceeding from him and bestowing power upon the words of muhammad. I think in that night, the supreme spirit brought a light being, angel jibreel, to the cave where Muhammad was. And the Quran was revealed. This book has a dark aura. The Kaaba is black. The black stone is black. The pantheons of pagan worship have dark spirits i think. The soul is black to me. Only consciousness and the light of God are white. Spirit is superior to consciousness. What people today don&#039;t get is the Nazis were the good guys yes. But not because they had such good order. It&#039;s because they had disorder. Darkness and chaos. Truth and honor are aligned with the supreme spirit. That is why today in this evil world, the most hated thing is Nazism. Because it is the political ideology most aligned with the supreme spirit. With the yin. With nature. And what do we see the enemies of Nazism do? Invert nature. Attack the beauty of nature. That is all.
