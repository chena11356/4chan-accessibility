It was based on the idea that industrialization of countries leads to more competition in existing markets which causes the exports of the nation in that sector to fall. While this doesn&#039;t go for every product (especially some luxury goods with a consumerist society and large amount of disposable income lessening the effect further) on many it certainly does. Take for example the whole creation of the rust belt in America. Especially back then nations still had a lot of protectionism. This mixture of economic competition and protectionism for domestic industry would lead to conflict (for example how Germans especially saw Britain in WWI as fighting mostly for economic reasons). This was then the argument used to creat Autharky. This way you would not be negatively effected by other nations industrializing with the exeption of some more competition in markets of luxury goods and unobtainable natural resources they still wanted to trade for, while at the same time creating a very strong internal market which would be far less influenced by economic crashes and more importantly economic warfare.

As for the Einsatzgruppen it is known that many members were traumatized by their own actions and that in the evenings they held parties and drank a lot to suppress the impressions of their own deeds.

In other words &quot;germanic&quot; includes the entirety of whomever occupied central Europe in some context or another. This is why roman era Germans are more genetically similar to modern day french than they are to modern Germans. It&#039;s because they absorbed a huge sum of protoslavic/slavic DNA after the migration era, which brought them to their relative intermediate position. Same goes for places like austria and the german areas of switzerland which were originally celtic and raetic, prior to their arrival. None of those celts or italians left. They were assimilated by the incoming germanic speakers, which is again why they don&#039;t plot the same as nords. You see it in their language too, which bears stronger influence from celtic, slavic and Italic. <br><br>This is contrary to the Roman policy of expulsion and extermination of northern tribes, such as what occurred with the gauls and germans. Ever question why bohemia refers to the lands of Czechia and not Northern Italy?

The process was the work of a well-defined era: the century from 1745 to 1845. Before 1745, the Highlanders and all their customs were disownedand despised by every articulate Scotchman. After 1845 the Highland takeover was complete. The voice of protest, and of historical truth, was often raised; but it was always powerless. Romanticism might lose its power; but then tourism and commercialism would take over its legacy, extending and vulgarising it in detail.

For these reasons, Korean patients with infertility issues will often travel to the Fertility Institute of Hawaii to seek services that can enhance conception, outside of the limited treatment modalities available in their home country.

The Spanish governor general was so scared that in 1663 he permanently withdrew every single Spanish soldier from the Maluku aka Moluccas island colony in modern day Indonesia, permanently losing Maluku forever (the Dutch later annexed it) and withdrew from Zamboanga on Mindanao for decades, exposing the Spanish to even more intensified Moro Muslim raids as he recalled the troops to defend Manila from the Chinese.

The Spanish folded to almost all his demands and admitted they were weak and both the Dutch East India Company and English East India Company said that Zheng Jing could overrun the weak Spanish defences in Manila if he attacked.

However, the Spanish officials in the colony could do very little except tolerate the extraterritorial interference and continue their policy of appeasement. Their well-armed but tiny garrison stood no match for the tens of thousands of soldiers Taiwan could muster in the event of armed conflict.194 In fact, by 1670, Zheng Jing and his officials were already seriously considering an invasion of the Philippines, and appeared, for all purposes, to be repeating the precedent set out by Chenggong toward the Dutch, until the outbreak of Rebellion of the Three Feudatories in 1674 put an end to their preparations.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The expeditionary force planned to attack Manila after the monsoon season, in early 1671.

It is said that his obsession with her clouded his judgement and led him to push for an aggressive war against Serbia, which ultimately resulted in the outbreak of World War I.

At the time of the 1960 election, the Washington DC press corps consisted of about 100 reporters and special correspondents. Most of them were Democrats and unfriendly to Nixon on principle, and the feeling was mutual. Reporters often brought out the worst in him and his demeanor around them made him come off as stiff, cold, and not entirely human. A lot of Nixon&#039;s speeches were filled with the corny sentimentalism (cf. the Checkers speech) that endeared him to Main Street but which the gilded lily press corps found nauseating. &quot;He was just so...icky, yucky, smarmy,&quot; said Mary McGrory of the Washington Post, while NYT correspondent Harrison Salisbury said that Nixon &quot;gave off a terrible, sleazy quality.&quot; To be honest there were many moments during the campaign when he came off as exhausted, disheveled, and running on autopilot. While many Republicans had a point about their candidate not getting fair press coverage, the idea that the problem wasn&#039;t one-sided did not occur to them.<br><br>Yet it was less anti-Nixon partisanship the press corps were guilty of than excessive adulation of his opponent.

I could go on about parenting, but basically most parents are retards who have little concern for giving their children an advantage. They simply don\u2019t have the intellectual capacity, or perhaps love for their children (maybe because they hate themselves, and see their reflection in their children), to consistently take an organized and proactive approach to child-rearing. Everything should be planned and weighed. What they eat, what they read, who they hang out with, their hobbies, everything. It should be obvious by now that the main objective is to make them more POWERFUL. Mentally, physically, socially, financially, emotionally, spiritually. They can always know more, exercise their brain more (Dual N Back improves working memory for adults, just imagine with children!), exercise more, eat good food, socialize, be more confident, have more options in the future, etc. This doesn\u2019t mean physically forcing them to do what you want. There are so many ways to incentivize constructive behavior, and it helps to establish that structure from the beginning. For example, if your child is used to only having one hour of video games per day, then you can simply reward them by increasing that time if they do some chore or productive task. Depending on the task, you shouldn\u2019t make it sound like a task, but rather something that benefits them of course. \u201cThis will make you smarter. More disciplined. I think you\u2019ll do really well if you practice.\u201d Etc. You as the parent always make the rules, you give and you take away. But most parents these days give nothing and take away nothing.

With no skills and no real social life. His sole &quot;genius&quot; consisted in pairing this nothingness of being with subconscious desires, fantasies and resentment of the German people, fueled by post-ww1 environment of poverty, chaos and instability. Hitler was nothing but an empty vessel for the projection of the worst resentments of German people. Hitler did not really exist, personally speaking, as a man, he was strictly a fantasy, a mythological placeholder for an expression of nation-wide desires and resentments. An event possible only in the specific constellation of the time and location at the very specific moment. Hitler is in effect a nothingness which spoke back consciously what the German nation thought unconsciously. Nobody with a real personality, a real self-determined entity could have accomplished that. Of course a Hitler could repeat, not in exactly the same way, but there is nothing that prevents something of that kind from happening in the future. Resentment, widespread poverty and chaos are breeding grounds for mass delusions and for radical fantasies. Hitler&#039;s specialty lies in the fact that we have perhaps never seen someone so capable of assuming every single national resentment and most vile fantasies as part of his personality. The capability lies in the fact that Hitler had no personality of his own, except for being that individual who took upon himself the yoke of the entire nation&#039;s evil fermentations. For a sovereign individual, something this radical is an impossibility, such taking up of mob hysteria is always paired with pragmatic detachment. Hitler certainly was pragmatic, but there was no real a &quot;behind the mask&quot; moment for the man, his &quot;ingenuity&quot; and &quot;magic&quot; lies in his and the mask being or becoming one and the same. It is an excellent study to realize how mass resentment and insecurity, gives rise to mass delusions and vile fantasies and how these can be weaponized.", "time": 1674532248, "resto": 14520004}, {"no": 14520206, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:54:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The guy lost the war", "time": 1674532460, "resto": 14520004}, {"no": 14520207, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14520194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14520194</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no skills</span><br>He created the most recognised, most powerful and most feared/hated symbolism in the western world.
