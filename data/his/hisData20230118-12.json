Should the Belgian king opt to stand with Germany, Wilhelm promised, the Belgians would gain new territories in northern France, and Wilhelm would reward the Belgian king with \u2018the crown of old Burgundy\u2019.

All these laws manage to do is to stigmatize consensual sexual relations, fuel mass hysteria, and imprison innocent people.<br><br>Some claim that the existence of AOC laws prevents instances of child rape or other forms of sexual impropriety, but there is no empirical data supporting the claim that AOC laws lower the rates of or prevent child rape from occurring.

Almost all scholars accepted this practice. If you own a person as property, obviously you&#039;re allowed to do whatever you want with your property. Obviously you weren&#039;t allowed to have sex with someone else&#039;s wife, because they are not your property. You weren&#039;t allowed to have sex with a free woman because she is not your property; she belongs to her father until married off.

Or the Emperor converting and basing his right to rule on divine right and much like some European royal houses like to claim they descended from classical hero\u2019s whom are then again claimed to be the descendants of the classical pagan gods. Or a combination of the two as the Shogun and Emperors line intermarry until there is a single successor of both. But decades of religious unrest and civil wars, first as conflicts with shinto and budists then internally as the reception of Catholicism would come with all sorts of local distortions that would lead to heresies. The extent of which would depend on how the transition from Shinto to Catholicism at the top is handled.

Italy, 5500 bc<br>One end protruded from the mud. It looked as if it could be the stern of a boat. What emerged from the mud, after several months of careful vacuuming in 1994, is the 35-foot-long dugout canoe that is now in the Pigorini. Three and a half feet across at the stern, tapering to two and a half at the bow, it was carved from a single massive oak trunk; along the rough and wavy floor, you can see the marks left by stone axes and adzes. (The Neolithic was the last period of the Stone Age, and metal tools didn&#039;t exist.) The boatwrights left four transverse stripes of oak, an inch or so high, at intervals along the floor. Those must have acted as ribs to strengthen and stabilize the canoe. Three trapezoidal blocks of wood with holes pierced in them were also found loose in the bottom of the canoe; they may have been used for fastening sails\u2014though the only direct evidence are a few small fragments of fabric found nearby. &quot;These people navigated up and down the Mediterranean,&quot; Fugazzola believes. &quot;They knew about sails.&quot; They may also have fastened two canoes together to make a catamaran, she says, with a deck of planks. With or without sails, as a catamaran or a monohull, there is no doubt the settlers&#039; canoe was seaworthy, not just lake-worthy. Several years ago, a team of Czech archaeologists led by Radomir Tichy built a copy of it, using replicas of Neolithic stone tools. They proceeded to sail their dugout nearly 500 miles along the Mediterranean coast, from Italy to Portugal. Head winds forced them ashore on occasion. High seas, Tichy recalls, once put them &quot;in a complicated situation.

A Civil War with Southern sympathizers hidden like little rats throughout the Union. As close as the Buchanan administration treacherous Southerners in the cabinet were sending intelligence to the Confederacy before the war. Working against the Union even came in the form of a woman before Gettysburg passing on the positions of union troops around a town to a Confederate general hidden under flowers. When the existence of the Union itself is in peril you cannot take chances. Both the Congress of the Union and Confederacy were more than willing to give the power to suspend habeas corpus. Lincoln himself never ordered any random man&#039;s arrest, power to do that was designated to military officers and to an extent Seward. This had to happen because they were the ones actually on the situation and Lincoln probably in a literal sense would not have had enough time to take on that burden himself in any remotely efficient manner. Any abuse of their individual power cannot be attributed directly to Lincoln, unless habeas corpus was not necessary to suspend in the first place (it was) or a radically different system of bringing the disloyal to justice should and could have been implemented. When Lincoln DID exercise his powers in cases concerning arrests he leaned toward leniency, like that time he told one of his generals (I can&#039;t remember which, Burnside?) to unsuspend a newspaper and warned against suspending again without better reason, or the time he intervened for a reverend to not be jailed.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but muh suspension without Congress</span><br>Congress wasn&#039;t in session and he needed to take action quickly.

Furthermore the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus is not explicitly said to be the power of Congress in the Constitution. It is implied it is by being in Article 1, but it&#039;s just slapped there unlike the other powers without being designated to Congress. In fact the wording doesn&#039;t specifically even give the power to anyone, it just says it restricts the power to suspend it to cases of rebellion or invasion when the public safety requires it. It is arguable that the men at the Constitutional Convention believed that it made sense to allow room for the president to suspend habeas corpus, since in situations requiring a decision to be made as soon as humanly possible when national security is threatened Congress may not even be in session, dispersed in their homes throughout the country.

Because of the founder effect, elite recruitment, and the general small size of the indoeuropean settlers compared to previous farmer groups (except in the British isles where few farmers survived indo European settlement, though these settlers were most likely also few in number and closely related) some haplogroups became dominant over others. This is also due to genetic drift and bottlenecks both prehistorical and historical (I.e war and plagues).

Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga&#039;s camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners,[33] mostly by crucifixion and decapitation[34] with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek&#039;s teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as &quot;a very sweet and pleasing maiden&quot;, while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses.[35][36][37] The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that &quot;the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.&quot;[38] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga&#039;s but it came to nothing.[39][40][41]</span>", "filename": "Taiwan", "ext": ".png", "w": 1717, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673902383137808, "time": 1673902383, "md5": "iRRS8qd+zKjZKzcK7ObMYQ==", "fsize": 785060, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481483, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)15:56:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478876</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The very fact the two were engaged on the same level and the Chinese had to fight them for decades is an incredible embarrassment for the Chinese lol</span><br><br>Chinese didn&#039;t fight them for decades.

The first time they tried to land, they were forced away by bad weather, and one ship&#039;s crew was captured by the natives when it crashed into the beach. The natives killed most of the crew and sent them to Koxinga.[12] On July 5, the relief force arrived and engaged in small scale confrontations with Koxinga&#039;s fleet. On July 23, the two sides gave major battle as the Dutch fleet attempted to break Koxinga&#039;s blockade. A second, ultimately unsuccessful attempt at relief was mounted in October. The Dutch tried to bombard the Chinese position with their ships, but their shots were too high and missed their target, giving the Chinese gunners time to prepare and return fire. Meanwhile, the smaller Dutch ships engaged the Chinese junks, which lured them into a narrow strait with a false withdrawal. The Dutch ships were unable to get away as the wind had died and they were forced to paddle their boats, but the Chinese caught them and massacred the crew on board and used pikes to kill those who jumped overboard. The Chinese caught Dutch grenades in nets and threw them back at the Dutch. The Dutch flagship Koukercken ran aground right in front of an enemy cannon placement and was sunk. Another ship was stranded and its crew fled to Fort Zeelandia. The remaining Dutch fleet was forced to retreat with the loss of two ships, three smaller vessels, and 130 casualties.[25]</span>", "time": 1673903089, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481521, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:05:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481504</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chinese DIDN&#039;T LOSE A SINGLE SHIP </span><br><a href=\"#p14481512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481512</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chinese didn&#039;t lose a single ship</span><br><br>If you truly believe this you are not only a chinkshill, you truly are an utter imbecile lol<br><br>A portion of the Chinese vessels were smaller junks, to believe none of those were sunk is just fucking comedy.", "filename": "Capture", "ext": ".png", "w": 586, "h": 386, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673903110533936, "time": 1673903110, "md5": "MVEqv+xzaAczb83cAMO/FA==", "fsize": 396899, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481527, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:06:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481511</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; But Europeans don&#039;t boast about beating them,</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; because they aren&#039;t pissy pathetic little nationalistic frustrators.</span><br><br>/thread<br>/chinkshot<br>/chinkseethe<br>/itsover", "time": 1673903171, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14481541, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:09:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14481521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481521</a><br><a href=\"#p14481527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14481527</a><br>Chinese didn&#039;t lose any ships to enemy fire in the naval campaigns.<br><br>look at Dutch wikipedia you retard or Hans Putmans account of the battle.

In 1642, Ming foundries merged their own casting technology with European cannon designs to create a distinctive cannon known as the &quot;Dingliao grand general.&quot; Through combining the advanced cast-iron technique of southern China and the iron-bronze composite barrels invented in northern China, the Dingliao grand general cannons exemplified the best of both iron and bronze cannon designs. Unlike traditional iron and bronze cannons, the Dingliao grand general&#039;s inner barrel was made of iron, while the exterior of brass.[1][12]</span>", "time": 1673978473, "resto": 14475188}, {"no": 14486128, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)13:02:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14484623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14484623</a><br><a href=\"#p14486092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14486092</a> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The resulting bronze-iron composite cannons were superior to iron or bronze cannons in many respects. They were lighter, stronger, longer lasting, and able to withstand more intensive explosive pressure. Chinese artisans also experimented with other variants such as cannons featuring wrought iron cores with cast iron exteriors. While inferior to their bronze-iron counterparts, these were considerably cheaper and more durable than standard iron cannons. Both types were met with success and were considered &quot;among the best in the world&quot;[13] during the 17th century. The Chinese composite metal casting technique was effective enough that Portuguese imperial officials sought to employ Chinese gunsmiths for their cannon foundries in Goa, so that they could impart their methods for Portuguese weapons manufacturing.[13] According to the soldier Albrecht Herport, who fought for the Dutch at the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, the Chinese &quot;know how to make very

The city fell after three days.[12] Alarmed by the news, Yuri II sent his sons to detain the invaders, but they were defeated and ran for their lives. Yuri II also fled Vladimir for Yaroslavl.[11] Having burnt down Kolomna and Moscow, the horde laid siege to Vladimir on February 4, 1238. Three days later, the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal was taken and burnt to the ground. The royal family perished in the fire, while the grand prince retreated northward. Crossing the Volga, Vladimir mustered a new army, which was encircled and totally annihilated by the Mongols in the Battle of the Sit River on March 4.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And the Tartars took the [Ryazan] on December 21...

And one thing that tells fascism apart from other systems like absolute monarchy, socialism, liberal democracy or theocracies is that fascism requires violence; to a fascist, violence is not a means to an end, it is the goal. They believe violence is inherently good. Fascism isn&#039;t an ideology. Fascism is a crime.", "time": 1673987292, "resto": 14484059}, {"no": 14486996, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:42:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14486742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14486742</a><br>To a degree, sure. But the issue was with the education itself. For example, the Nazis had completely revamped boys&#039; education, reducing time spent learning practical stuff in order to teach them sports and military skills. Hitler Youth was a big factor into that. Ditto for university. Less and less students went into complex fields and more into stuff with pure military applications because that was what the government wanted, not to mention the desire to rid themselves of Jewish teachers. If the Nazis had their way, long term, they would have been left with a far less intelligent population generation. <br><br>Likewise, you can also look at their treatment of well performing soldiers. If someone was really good at whatever their military capacity was, they&#039;d be given wide latitude to do what they want. Which makes sense, right? Except no, they should have been put in charge of training train in order to pass their skills on regular soldiers like the allies. Subsequently, the Wehrmacht NCO corps was strong, and had a wide degree of initiative whereas Western Allied combat formations were passive and slow (with the exception of paratroopers). But that was all localized at the unit. When these soldiers were inevitably killed at the front, the skills of the Wehtmacht as a whole was gradually whittled down. <br><br>But I think even the assumption is wrong even tackling it head on. How many times have Western militaries been defeated by some backwards illiterate farmers? Not too long ago, they released a guy from GITMO who as a child soldier for AQ threw a grenade and killed a special forces soldier. Million plus dollars of training and experience, killed by a 15 year old.

In its production the iron was mixed with glass and then slowly heated and then cooled. As the mixture cooled the glass would bond to impurities in the steel and then float to the surface, leaving the steel considerably purer. Carbon could enter the iron by diffusing in through the porous walls of the crucibles. Carbon dioxide would not react with the iron, but the small amounts of carbon monoxide could, adding carbon to the mix with some level of control. Wootz was widely exported throughout the Middle East (Damascus)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As early as the 17th century, Europeans knew of India&#039;s ability to make crucible steel from reports brought back by travelers who had observed the process at several places in southern India. Several attempts were made to import the process, but failed because the exact technique remained a mystery. Studies of wootz were made in an attempt to understand its secrets, including a major effort by the famous scientist, Michael Faraday, son of a blacksmith. Working with a local cutlery manufacturer he wrongly concluded that it was the addition of aluminium oxide and silica from the glass that gave wootz its unique properties.</span><br><br>I know you&#039;re baiting/trolling because you hate pajeets, but this is a cool read", "time": 1673979208, "resto": 14486125}, {"no": 14486186, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)13:13:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14486158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14486158</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;darkwitch calling anyone shitskin</span><br><br>is always you witchy, is your sister dating some american?", "filename": "darkwitchy-min", "ext": ".png", "w": 4500, "h": 3500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1673979221095493, "time": 1673979221, "md5": "2cezgoprHx41MHlRNSTa8Q==", "fsize": 1769592, "resto": 14486125}, {"no": 14486190, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)13:14:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14486161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14486161</a><br>runes were brought to italy by ancient germanic traders who taught the italians how to stop being 100% brown", "time": 1673979241, "resto": 14486125}, {"no": 14486197, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)13:15:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14486137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14486137</a><br>t.

There are some shapes like diamonds which endure forever. There are others shapes like leaves that wilt and fade. If something were to exist omnipotently eternally it has 3 options on shapes to endure the stresses of existence and self. The first is easy enough to think of, think of the most perfect stable shape and no matter how far you infinitely zoom in or out it looks exactly the same. The second is a shape that infinitely oscillates and as it changes from the 2 states, every shape that could ever exist (the nature of this eternity being partially finite just like the first) is brought into existence and then consumed ad infinitum.

Then the soul becomes pure. It needs to become pure to ascend to godhood. Consciousness will feel absolute bliss when this is achieved. But reincarnation will not be stopped by this. That is not the goal. The goal is bliss in this world. Then you die and return. The truth cannot be expressed with words. Whatever one does one has to see it as a part of the whole.
