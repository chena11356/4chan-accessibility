Seeing the terrible threat posed by this vile, ugly horde of attackers; with their broad faces, lidless eyes, and long flowing hair like that of women, the inhabitants were seized by great terror. Especially terrifying were the skilled and powerful archers, who rained down arrows like heavy hailstones, and, like savage and ravenous wolves, shamelessly threw themselves on the people and mercilessly cut them down on the squares and streets of the town. Their eyes did not distinguish between the fair, the handsome, or the young among men and women, nor the weak and helpless. They did not spare the lame nor the old. They did not even take pity on the children who hugged their slaughtered mothers and sucked blood instead of milk.

I think you can logically construct a monotheistic, all powerful God, but the main problem for Christians is their book. The scripture can easily contradict a logically coherent God, like the fact God acts like he doesn&#039;t know where Adam and Eve are in the garden, or that they&#039;ve already eaten the apple. Theologians get around this by not being literal readers, so the stories in the Bible are just allegories and shit.

This is taken to mean that the devil will never conquer the church, which is understood as the church defecting, or officially teaching false doctrine. This does not seem to be a natural reading of the text, however. To start with: what is a gate? A gate is a barrier of entrance, something that keeps things out (or in), essentially a defensive structure. The Catholic understanding of this verse rather construes this gate as something that is on the attack. But how does a gate attack? It makes more sense to understand the gate here as defensive, and the church as the offensive party, that the Church will overcome the gates of Hell. To give a modern analogy, one might say, &quot;The fortifications at Normandy shall not prevail against the Allies.&quot; Of course Hell in this verse is the Greek term Hades, the underworld.

The shaking dislodged a slab of rock about 800 m (2,600 ft) wide from the western face of Huascar\u00e1n&#039;s north peak, at an elevation of roughly 5,600 to 6,200 m (18,400 to 20,300 ft).[17]:83 The rockfall occurred almost immediately after the shaking began, with witnesses comparing the sound to a gunshot or explosion.[5]:279 The fall triggered an &quot;enormous dark cloud of dust&quot; which rapidly blocked the view from below.[5]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The rock fell some 600 m (2,000 ft) vertically[5]:302 before landing on Glacier 511 and sliding nearly 3 km (1.9 mi) down its surface, accumulating a large volume of firn snow as it went.[6] The initial ice-rock avalanche volume was at least 25 million m3 (33 million yd3), and grew rapidly in size as it fell down the steep Llanganuco valley, picking up large volumes of dirt, loose glacial moraine, water and uprooted trees. With area soils saturated near the end of the rainy season,[18] and the large amount of snow and ice scraped off the glacier surface,[5] the avalanche quickly liquefied into a fluid, fast-moving mudflow.[1]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The maximum volume of mudflow was as much as 50-100 million m3 (130 million yd3),[19] and it reached speeds of up to 435 km/h (270 mph).[1] Some debris projectiles launched ahead of the main flow may have exceeded 1,100 km/h (680 mph).[5] According to a U.S. Geological Survey report published the same year, the mudflow may have achieved its unusually high speed due to &quot;air-cushioned flow&quot;, a mixture of snow, ice and entrapped air that allowed the bulk of the material to essentially float over the ground.[1] The initial acceleration of the mass down the low-friction glacial surface was also a major factor, catapulting the material downhill at a much higher speed than if it had slid over bare rock or earth.[17]:84</span>", "time": 1669894061, "resto": 14262859}, {"no": 14263018, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)06:28:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14262859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14262859</a><br>2<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Yungay, people rushed outside after the earthquake hit; many flocked to churches to shelter and pray. Most buildings in the city were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake, though initial casualties were low compared to the mudflow that followed.[5] The mudflow struck Yungay, 13 km (8.1 mi) from the avalanche origin, an estimated 1 minute, 42 seconds after the earthquake began.[20]:163 Although the nearly 200 m (660 ft) hill of Cerro de Aira stood between Yungay and the Llanganuco valley, the mudflow struck the ridge at a high enough speed \u2013 some 170 km/h (110 mph) [5] \u2013 that part of it leapt over the crest, first destroying the villages of Shillkop, Aira and Ongo before descending upon Yungay.[5]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A large air blast preceded the debris flow, followed by a rain of boulders and large debris before the main, semi-liquid wave struck. The wind blast was &quot;strong enough to throw people to the ground and in some places to topple trees.&quot;[5] Giant rocks &quot;bounced and rolled&quot; towards Yungay, leaving huge craters in the ground and flattening buildings that had not been already destroyed by the earthquake. The mudflow itself was described by survivors as &quot;rolling&quot;, &quot;wavelike&quot; or &quot;a rolling confused motion.&quot;[5] Due to the speed of the flow, there was no time to evacuate. Practically every man-made structure in Yungay except a few on the outskirts were destroyed, and thousands of people were killed instantly.[1]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Casaverde described the scene: &quot;We heard a deep noise, different from the earthquake, but not so much so. It was coming from Huascar\u00e1n and we saw between the mountain and Yungay a giant cloud of dust. The quake had caused an avalanche. Part of Huascar\u00e1n was falling... You could see a giant wave of gray mud, about 60 metres (200 ft) high, about to hit the left hand side of the city. This wave was certainly not dust... The sky went dark. We looked around.

For example, he observed that loanwords should be eliminated in comparative studies, and also correctly put great emphasis on common morphological systems and irregularity as indicators of relationship.[11] A few years earlier, the Silesian physician Johann Elichmann (1601/1602\u20131639) already used the expression ex eadem origine (from a common source) in a study published posthumously in 1640.[12] He related European languages to Indo-Iranian languages (which include Sanskrit).[11]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The idea that the first language was Hebrew continued to be advanced for some time: Pierre Besnier (1648\u20131705) in 1674 published a book which was translated into English the following year: A philosophical essay for the reunion of the languages, or, the art of knowing all by the mastery of one.[13]</span>", "filename": "Indo-European_expansions", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2094, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1669908491993321, "time": 1669908491, "md5": "9QZOfQGOSZYzRhlokXDa5A==", "fsize": 2149364, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "its-interesting-to-me-that-protoindoeuropean", "replies": 6, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 1, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 14263881, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)10:45:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14263870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14263870</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Surely scholars in antiquity must have noticed that certain languages were extremely similar to each other but very different from certain other languages</span><br><br>They didn\u2019t.

He identified Greek, Germanic, Romance and Slavic language groups by comparing the word for &quot;God&quot; in various European languages. In 1710, Leibniz applied ideas of gradualism and uniformitarianism to linguistics in a short essay.[2] Like Scaliger, he rejected a Hebrew root, but also rejected the idea of unrelated language groups and considered them all to have a common source.[3]</span>", "time": 1669909891, "resto": 14263812}, {"no": 14263915, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)10:53:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14263812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14263812</a><br><a href=\"#p14263870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14263870</a><br><a href=\"#p14263881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14263881</a><br>That said, I&#039;m actually more interested that they connected origins to &quot;Scythian&quot;, basically Steppe region.
