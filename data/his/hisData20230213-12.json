Specifically they had a huge component of Scythians sarmatians and proto Slavs. Germanic peoples such as the gepids, goths, rugi, heruli, and others were known for their skill with cavalry. In fact the romans called these people Scythian rather than German because Germans weren\u2019t known to ride their horses into battle, rather dismount and form an infantry line before charging. These cavalry tactics were originally from eastern Iranian peoples but became reinforced by hunnic overlordship as for them the horse and horse based warfare was the most important thing in life. Even some \u201cwestern\u201d Germanic peoples like the longobards and Thuringians were introduced to these concepts, probably during the hunnic phase, as they became great cavalry peoples. Specifically we know the Longobards had either mixed hunnic kings, or kings in complete subjection to the Huns and their culture penetrated to the entire longobard society.

In July 1979 thousands of white rock fans rioted at Chicago\u2019s Comiskey Park at the now legendary Disco Demolition Night, burning disco records in what many since have described as an anti-black, anti-gay, anti-woman, reactionary uprising.

Bohemian polka has also had an influence in places like Texas. Western swing is like country-jazz, or jazz that became country. In the 1920s, the &#039;hillbilly&#039; music scene around Atlanta saw the introduction of the Hawaiian steel guitar and ukelele, and that&#039;s when country music truly came into existence as a genre distinct from bluegrass, blues and other American folk music. You also had jug bands and, in Louisiana, French-influenced Cajun and Creole music which led to things like zydeco and had an influence in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz.<br>You throw in the developments of Negro sprituals, gospel music, cakewalk/ragtime, New Orleans big band music, and you can piece together most of the history of American music.", "filename": "326535080_724034552404074_397460306135110975_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 653, "h": 653, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676222950454828, "time": 1676222950, "md5": "rzYRVEv6lLremQ5hbRyCsQ==", "fsize": 71537, "resto": 14616756}, {"no": 14617789, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)12:33:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14617762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14617762</a><br><br>Jazz is originally African American, and employed Black New Orleans and Cajun sounds, inspired by spirituals and hymns, also with the West African cross-rhythms and call-and-response style of work songs and field hollers, preserving the &#039;traditional sub-Saharan African harmony&#039; of African drumming, but in other polyphonic styles after the Black Codes outlawed drumming by African slaves. There was also a Cuban habanera/contradanza influence. The big innovation in jazz was the jazz scale, which draws from common scales of Western European classical music (diatonic, whole-tone, octatonic, melodic minor modes), but allowing for the interpretation, repetition and improvisation central to jazz as a genre. Jazz was initially an urban phenomenon in the South - Dixieland jazz in New Orleans in the 1910s - but when the blues scale developed in the rural Deep South, it entered jazz and introduced the out-of-key &quot;blue note&quot; to an existing scale, notably the flat fifth addition to the minor pentatonic scale, and jazz was never the same again. New Orleans jazz travelled north to Chicago and New York with the First Great Migration in the 1910s, generation on generation. Cakewalk and ragtime developed on the way in places like St Louis, influenced by jazz, but when it reached New York it got sucked up into theatre music and Yiddish musical styles, which is the origin of Tin Pan Alley. After a generation, big band music was formed, and swing became the most popular American music genre for about 15 years (Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald).", "filename": "ezgif-3-25f3f21b77", "ext": ".gif", "w": 300, "h": 180, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 75, "tim": 1676223227120514, "time": 1676223227, "md5": "STWl7BRQNZS8OD+Un+sE/g==", "fsize": 2569178, "resto": 14616756}, {"no": 14617793, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)12:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14617789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14617789</a><br><br>Blues had been growing in the Deep South since the 19th century, arguably since the end of the Civil War. Initially, blues was literally just spirituals and slave songs, and many of the old blues standards are written in this style and come directly from those traditions. The lines are often sung following a pattern closer to rhythmic talk than to a melody, which is seen as something reflected in Igbo music. The four-beats-per-measure of the blues has been associated with the melodies of the Bambara people, and to a lesser degree, the Soninke people and Wolof people, but not as much of the Mandinka people. The original country blues coagulated in the Mississippi delta as Delta blues, which was heavily influenced by folk music. This is when country and blues were essentially bonded, and blues had a great effect on the birth of bluegrass. Robert Johnson was a master of the Delta blues, and was part of the transition from uncommercial to commercial blues, which saw it explode in popularity. As the Second Great Migration (starting in the 40s) saw Blacks coming out the Deep South, bringing the country blues to the Northern cities where jazz and swing were already dominating, the new synthesis and the popularisation of blues scales and chord progressions like the 12-bar-blues (most famous chord progression in popular music) began the birth of early rock and roll. One split off before rock and roll was &#039;rhythm and blues&#039; and doo wop, which was more swing and big band oriented.

So the left-wing militant groups emerged out of that. It was kinda mutual, like some of the more radical students would think &quot;well, the Vietnamese are fighting capitalism and imperialism over there, so we should &#039;bring the war home&#039; and fight a revolution just like the Vietnamese.&quot; And then the cops have the same attitude, their brothers are fighting a war there and &quot;we&#039;re killing &#039;em over there, why not kill &#039;em here?&quot; <br><br>So it was rare in the U.S. for an anti-war protest at that time to not get into a physical confrontation with the cops. The students and young anti-system people were certainly willing to get into it with the cops, but the cops were willing to get into it too. People get radicalized and hardened by this experience. There were times when people would get killed by the cops in these confrontations, it started to resemble a war-like situation.<br><br>Part of it too is that they started to LARP as Che who was a big hero. It wasn&#039;t just wearing a Che t-shirt, they literally wanted to be like Che and start doing that in the U.S. or West Germany or Japan. The more radical students saw their success at shutting down campuses and their images being broadcast on TV, and they had been relatively successful at that, but confused that as a sign that revolution was imminent, and they narcissistically fell in love with themselves, that they were gonna be the leaders, and believe they could switch to militant tactics and people would automatically follow them. In fact, they destroyed what were fairly large coalitions for smaller, militant and cult-like groups which completely failed at making a revolution happen so RIP<br><br>https://youtu.be/vFzCQcHglFA?t=1362<wbr>8", "filename": "days-of-rage", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 647, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1676278743933998, "time": 1676278743, "md5": "HVXH5S/jWyt+QdO+ErDTfQ==", "fsize": 87299, "resto": 14621041}, {"no": 14621156, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)04:12:21", "name": "Chud Anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p14621136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14621136</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;radicalized and hardened by this experience.

It&#039;s a fictional story of a French Maoist student group and roughly based on a Dostoyevsky novel set in Russia in the 1860s during a period of radical political nihilism (think Nechayev).<br><br>The movie is insane. The director was sympathetic to left-wing politics, but the students are just kids who are off in an ideological la-la land and have no real connection to the workers they want to represent. You can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s just a LARP or if they&#039;re serious, because they take themselves way too seriously, and that&#039;s part of the humor. This scene is interesting because they&#039;re talking about Maoist China being more True Communism because that&#039;s what the Americans fear, but they are missing a kind of obvious point which that Americans don&#039;t really care about the ideological purity of the nations they interact with, what they care about is their own profit, or the profit of their ruling class.

Clearly it was a revolution of a different kind than that aimed at by Marxists, but it was still politics of a revolutionary kind and as such clearly distinct from the politics of the so-called bourgeois parties (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats) and also the conservatives and conventional nationalists. Zitelmann demonstrates that Hitler himself made this distinction, clearly and explicitly differentiating himself from the conservatives and putting the Nazi party, the Communists, and the Italian Fascists as rivals but fellow revolutionary movements, opposed to the constitutional politics of the bourgeois parties. He saw himself as a revolutionary because the political project he envisioned was one of fundamental transformation, a radical reshaping of the German social order, economy, and society. His politics was therefore total\u2014encompassing every area of life, in the same way as communism\u2014and he argued explicitly that this derived from its being a comprehensive weltanschauung (world view). This he explicitly contrasted to the limited and rule bound politics of liberalism and social and Christian democracy, which meant that it was conducted in a different way, one neither bound nor limited by law. The last aspect of this revolutionary approach was that the transformation of society it aimed at involved novelty and the creation of something new and unprecedented. This went along with a fascination, shared by most leading Nazis, with technology and modernism. This was all in marked contrast to the politics of radical reactionaries, such as the so-called conservative Maurras revolutionaries in Germany, and the Action Fran\u00e7aise in France, who looked to a reactionary politics of restoration and counter-revolution.</span>", "time": 1676251966, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619853, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619606</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do Americans really think these these ideologies have any relation to each other?</span><br>They objectively do: they&#039;re all cartoonish losers.", "time": 1676251974, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619855, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:33:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619852</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;National Socialism was not a conservative ideology.</span><br>Correct. <br>It is unfathomable that anyone can ever think it was.", "filename": "graph", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 655, "h": 414, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1676252015896891, "time": 1676252015, "md5": "1+NsPNqxrznVEJ+YV5lD6g==", "fsize": 34419, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619899, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:49:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619630</a><br>a 60 year old using the incorrect term of the day does not make every conservative racist, shitposters on /pol/ does not make every conservatives racist, whatever cherrypicked poll you&#039;ll pull out your discord group does not make conservatives racist.<br>here&#039;s your (you), screencap this and give it to your gay discord group.", "time": 1676252952, "resto": 14619606}, {"no": 14619930, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:56:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619816</a><br>I hate America so fucking much.

In the final round of the talks, the Japanese side accepted the weakness of its claim to Iturup and Kunashiri and agreed to settle on the return of Shikotan and the Habomai Islands, in exchange for a peace treaty. On October 19, 1956, in Moscow, the USSR and Japan signed the Soviet\u2013Japanese Joint Declaration. The Declaration ended the state of war between the Soviet Union and Japan, which technically had still existed between the two countries since August 1945, and stipulated that &quot;The U.S.S.R. and Japan have agreed to continue, after the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between them, negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty. Hereby, the U.S.S.R., in response to the desires of Japan and taking into consideration the interest of the Japanese state, agrees to hand over to Japan the Habomai and the Shikotan Islands, provided that the actual changing over to Japan of these islands will be carried out after the conclusion of a peace treaty.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Continuation of the deadlock is often attributed to the United States&#039; intervention in the negotiations, when US warned Japan that a withdrawal of the Japanese claim on the other islands would mean the U.S. would keep Okinawa and asserted that the San Francisco Peace Treaty &quot;did not determine the sovereignty of the territories renounced by Japan&quot;, but that &quot;Japan does not have the right to transfer sovereignty over such territories&quot;, although this attribution is problematic, since the decision to stand firm on demanding &quot;four island return&quot; (rather than following initial &quot;minimal requirement&quot; line of demanding only Shikotan and Habomai) was made by Japan long before the United States&#039; decision to &quot;morally support&quot; these claims.</span>", "time": 1676269935, "resto": 14619527}, {"no": 14620941, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)02:12:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14619527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14619527</a><br>I\u2019m more surprised they get along now.

History is strange and contingent like that though. You could as a Marxist view it that way, and I think that&#039;s the way you&#039;re supposed to view it, capitalism itself came into being over a long period of time that was &quot;inevitable&quot; in a sense but also really corkscrewed, like it basically failed to come into being when it &quot;should have&quot; in the 17th century because the feudal superstructure was still too strong even though a lot of the manufacturing and trade to make capitalism take off already existed.

If I had to say though, I think it&#039;s unappealing to a lot of people because it&#039;s difficult to shake the feeling that there&#039;s some greater powers at work in the universe. Too many atheists also seem to view the universe as limited not only by materialism, but by our current understanding. The universe is fascinating, it&#039;s sad that some people love playing up the &quot;nothing matters, you&#039;re just chemicals and you&#039;re going to cease existing&quot; side of things. The universe should be treated as fascinating and beautiful rather than mundane. I&#039;m not suggesting a God of the Gaps thing here. Just saying that some atheists make things sound much more boring than it actually are. There&#039;s so much still to discover and appreciate about reality.

It also feels like some atheists are burned by religious upbringing and have to emphasize the negative too.

By confessing the Spirit as he &quot;who proceeds from the Father&quot;, it affirms that he comes from the Father through the Son. The Western tradition expresses first the consubstantial communion between Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque). It says this, &quot;legitimately and with good reason&quot;, for the eternal order of the divine persons in their consubstantial communion implies that the Father, as &quot;the principle without principle&quot;, is the first origin of the Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is, with the Son, the single principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds.

But they are cutting corners and just not giving a shit because some expert told them so it \u201cmust be true\u201d because they wouldn\u2019t want to offend the guy vaccinating them with a death shot. America was founded by pioneers who were not experts in anything. They were just beleivers in God through Jesus Christ and that so happened to be at odds with the expert elite who ran the governments in Europe that they wanted to get away with. Gee, why would normal people want to get away from psychotic experts worshiping theirselves who believed the Jews\u2019 lies from Satan that no one else can have the Holy Spirit but them?

The X-ray dating method was applied to a sample of the TS consisting of a thread taken in proximity of the 1988/radiocarbon area (corner of the TS corresponding to the feet area of the frontal image, near the so-called Raes sample). The size of the linen sample was about 0.5 mm \u00d7 1 mm. We obtained one-dimensional integrated WAXS data profiles for the TS sample, which were fully compatible with the analogous measurements obtained on a linen sample whose dating, according to historical records, is 55\u201374 AD, Siege of Masada (Israel). The degree of natural aging of the cellulose that constitutes the linen of the investigated sample, obtained by X-ray analysis, showed that the TS fabric is as old as the seven centuries proposed by the 1988 radiocarbon dating. The experimental results are compatible with the hypothesis that the TS is a 700-year-old relic, as opposed by Christian tradition, under the condition that it was kept at suitable levels of average secular temperature\u201420.0\u201322.5 \u00b0C\u2014and correlated relative humidity\u201475\u201355%\u2014for 7 centuries of history.

The Shroud of Turin, however, is a forgery created in the 14th century, by an illiterate painter. It makes sense that he wouldn&#039;t know the intricacies of Yeshua&#039;s burial, as he&#039;d only ever heard of it in passing (if he&#039;d heard of it at all, most Europeans were completely illiterate about basic Christian theology up until relatively recently). He would have been privy to the basic European custom of having a single cloth covering the body (as his work, the Shroud of Turin, is), and unless he was attending Jewish funerary rites, would never know that Jews, including Yeshua, according to John, are not shrouded in the same manner. <br><br>This tipped the local Bishop off when a painter was claiming to have found Jesus&#039;s burial shroud (the Bishop, unlike the painter, had actually read the Bible). He had the painter imprisoned, and the painter confessed to his crime. The Bishop asked the Pope what to do with the Shroud, and the Pope said to sell it for cash. The Bishop did, and the rest is history. <br><br>The Shroud of Turin can&#039;t be Yeshua&#039;s burial shroud, otherwise you open up the Bible to scrutiny such that the supposed witnesses (the disciples) can&#039;t be trusted to get basic facts of Yeshua&#039;s life and death wrong.

Why did they do that?</span><br><br>You&#039;re probably thinking more of the Iraq War/GWOT<br><br>During Desert Storm, the standard issue US Military vest was the Kevlar-based PASGT, which was manufactured in M81 Woodland camouflage patterns, but there was also a Six Color Desert cover that could be worn over the standard vest. Most US troops in the Gulf War and later in Somalia were issued these overvests<br><br>During GWOT/Iraq however, the PASGT was in the process of being replaced by Interceptor Body Armor, which entered service in 1998. IBAs offered a significant improvement in protection over PASGT, such as being able to stop rifle-caliber bullets. However this came at the cost of making it a &quot;hard vest&quot;, meaning that it had to use steel plates instead of Kevlar and was not as flexible. In addition, the traditional ALICE and LBV webbing systems were replaced by MOLLE, velcro inserts that allow you to directly attach things like pouches, radios, and. canteens directly to the vest. As a result, the IBA cannot be worn with an overvest of any kind<br><br>Where does camouflage come into this? Well, for the first three years of its production run, the vast majority of IBAs to roll off assembly lines were in Woodland camouflage, with the expectation of being used in Europe, South America, Asia, or Africa. After 9/11, production of IBAs in DCU pattern were increased dramatically, but they weren&#039;t able to filter through the US Army&#039;s supply system in time for the Iraq War. In the twilight years of BDUs (2004-2007), IBAs in DCU pattern finally started to be issued in large numbers and continued to see service until they were superseded by IOTVs (made in Universal Crap Pattern and later Multiscam)<br><br>This was a less of a problem for the US Marine Corps, which by 2001 was already planning on replacing camouflage vests for a single coyote brown one and large numbers were already in service by 2003.", "filename": "W-Why is it called the &#039;&#039;Olympic Hotel&#039;&#039; if there&#039;s no Olympics here?!", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3840, "h": 1604, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1676267090832140, "time": 1676267090, "md5": "e9f/mqGZ5YatBkMLC/A2ig==", "fsize": 2330496, "resto": 14617855}, {"no": 14620765, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)00:46:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I like the Qatar Armed Forces uniform.
