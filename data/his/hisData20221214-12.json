There are very non-schizo theories that Islam was created a century after the supposed Mohammad unified Arabia. There&#039;s nothing in record of Roman or Persian histories in the 5th century of some powerful warlord uniting Arabia like you would expect for one thing. For another, when the Arabians came to power in Persia, they never changed the coinage until decades later, the coinage still had the face of the last Shah&#039;anshah Yazdegerd III. <br><br>The idea goes that the Arabs were used as mercenaries for the Persians, much as how the various Germanic races were Federatii for the Romans. In smiliar fashion to the Germanics, the Arabs took power when they realized the Persians would be too weak to stop them after the wars with Heraclius. Further, the Shah before the Arab takeover was a Nestorian Christian, and the idea is that Islam was created as an Arabification of the Nestorian faith with their own &quot;Messiah&quot; in Mohammed. If you don&#039;t know, the first depictions recorded of Mohammed show him carrying a cross on his back, and the name Mohammad merely means &quot;chosen one&quot; similar to the name &quot;Christ&quot;. You must ask, how would one&#039;s given name be &quot;chosen one&quot;, as opposed to the leaders of other Religions like Christ, who&#039;s given name was Yeshua, or the Buddha who&#039;s given name was Siddhartha Gautama.

My family was never very religious, church on Sundays, belonged to a specific denomination, but nothing like expecting us to go on mission trips or being raised to proselytize to friends and coworkers.

Read the bible a lot, prayed a lot, bible seemed stupid praying felt pointless, didn&#039;t feel anything, didn&#039;t notice anything, stopped bothering. As I got older I began to think more deeply than just reading the bible into logical considerations about religion and the implications of theology and realized that Christianity had some holes I couldn&#039;t reconcile and while other religions better patched said holes I didn&#039;t find them to really offer much proof beyond <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;14323860</span> &quot;we don&#039;t know therefore God&quot; which is nowhere near enough proof for me to dedicate my life to something.

The Americans joined with a fresh batch of troops who weren&#039;t exhausted from years of wartime, and an incredibly capable logistics system. It&#039;s not like pulling just the 4 million men into France to sure up the line, it&#039;s providing the 4 million men and an increase of logistics capabilities. More food, more ammo, faster resupply, more clothes, more wood and paper, more industrial equipment to make repairs, across the board. German supply lines having to shift all the eastern resources west was already a strain, but increasing industrial capacity to meet the renewed equipment in the western front is an absolute nightmare. <br>In World War 2, the Americans only got better at logistics and had more time to focus on building even more sophisticated supply lines.

On the other hand, German industry was extremely stretched thin at the time, so a slight break may have been catastrophic, and there had to be some truth to the idea of &quot;betrayal&quot;, since so many people believed in this and Hitler was easily able to capitalize with this idea.", "time": 1671019961, "resto": 14314555}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14314535, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)22:38:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Never once vetoed a bill</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Appointed multiple governments and ministers he despised because it was his duty as a constitutional monarch</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still gets labeled as \u201cle evil tyrant\u201d because his government imposed a tiny ass tax on the 13 colonies</span>", "filename": "1F6E97F1-FD12-4374-86FE-97E8751721F1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 620, "h": 954, "tn_w": 162, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670816282570509, "time": 1670816282, "md5": "mGnMGEZDV9BfsuPpzACSZw==", "fsize": 99345, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "never-once-vetoed-a-bill", "replies": 223, "images": 20, "unique_ips": 48, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 14314570, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)22:53:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14314535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14314535</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Closes the colonies&#039; ports</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Demands reparations from the entire colony for the acts of a handful of criminals</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Takes away the colonies&#039; charters and assumes direct control over colonial government with no local representation</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Limits town meetings to one per year to censor speech</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Extradites trials of British officials in the colonies to England </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Houses British soldiers in colonial homes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seizes colonial lands and gives them to French Quebec </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seizes the firearms of colonists needed for self-defense</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Provides no representation in Parliament for colonists</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also increases their taxes</span>", "time": 1670817214, "resto": 14314535}, {"no": 14314603, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)23:09:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14314570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14314570</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Closes the colonies&#039; ports</span><br>After they began rebelling<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Demands reparations from the entire colony for the acts of a handful of criminals</span><br>It was the responsibility of the colonial government to pay what was destroyed. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Takes away the colonies&#039; charters and assumes direct control over colonial government with no local representation</span><br>The Government of Massachusetts Act was the *only* time a colonial charter was altered (not repealed) in the entirety of George III&#039;s reign.

It was a solo attempt to avert the civil war evidently threatening between Britain and its colonies. Despite the opposition of many of his colleagues and supporters he offered conciliation, albeit with the simultaneous dispatch of more army and navy units to America and after legislation to prevent colonial trade and fishing until British control had been restored. His conciliatory propositions of February 1775 offered to renounce taxation of any individual colony which agreed to pay its costs of civil government and defence. This proposal, conceding no rights to the colonists and regarded in America as deliberately divisive, would probably have been unsuccessful even if fighting had not commenced in April 1775 before news of it arrived. Formal rejection by Congress in July 1775 did not deter North from offering it again in the Peace Commission sent to America in 1776, and North\u2019s intention was to enforce that arrangement on the colonies if Britain had won the war. North had shrewdly perceived that a return to the status quo was unrealistic, and his proposal was as far as British opinion would allow him to go.

I sometimes hear this opinion.</span><br>Before I get to it I want you to realise something that will help you later in the post. Genetic code is not computer code. A sequence of genes can be used to synthesise proteins in several different tissues leading to morphological differences in many organs. Computer code only does a particular thing when it&#039;s &quot;called in&quot; to so a particular thing.<br><br>Ok so imagine a group of people. If you measure their skulls, they will have certain range of cephalic index, probably spread along the bell curve. Living in certain stable environment, they maintain this spread because natural selection doesn&#039;t benefit either side of the curve. Now if you change the environment to benefit traits that coincide with let&#039;s say brachycephaly, brachycephalic people will have more children and the average will start shifting towards their side of the graph. The genes will also start accumulating, as in if 1/3rd of the population had some sequence A contributing to this shape of school and 2/3rd had B with only 1/6th having an overlap, this disproportionately high population growth will make this overlap more common, so it&#039;s absolutely possible for such shift to be relatively rapid and ironically enough - reversible.<br><br>The reason why brachycephalic skull shape is seen as &quot;unnatural&quot; is based on good observation but bad priors - domesticated animals tend to have more brachycephalic skulls than their wild ancestors, so clearly a brachy man is a domesticated man*. The bad prior here is that people assume that because this shift occured in some societies, this is not natural, but that&#039;s because they fundamentally don&#039;t believe humans naturally form societies and adapt them to different conditions and that&#039;s very silly.<br><br>*Mind you domesticated is not timid.

In the West Germanic ancestor of Old English, * walhaz meant \u2018foreigner\u2019, more specifically \u2018Roman\u2019, and even more specifically \u2018person of Celtic or Romance speech\u2019. The perspective here is that of a Germanic-speaking neighbour of the Western Roman Empire, living in what<br>are now the Low Countries and Germany. To him, his Roman neighbours would be culturally and linguistically clearly distinguishable from himself, being citizens of the Roman Empire and speaking either Latin or Celtic or<br>both. On the Continent, *walhaz survived into the later West Germanic languages as a term of reference to persons and areas of Romance speech. Old High German walh \u2018person of Romance speech/origin\u2019 and Dutch Waal \u2018Walloon\u2019 testify to that meaning. Place names containing the element *walhaz denote pockets in the Germanic-speaking world where Romance was spoken (e.g. Walchensee in Bavaria, Germany, and Waalwijk in North Brabant, Netherlands). A walnut (German Walnuss , Dutch walnoot ) is etymologically a nut from France. In Old English, *walhaz developed into<br>wealh. This retained the inherited meaning \u2018a foreigner, more particularly a pre-Anglo-Saxon inhabitant of Britain who spoke Celtic or Latin or both\u2019, but it is indicative of the social position of the British natives that in the<br>West Saxon dialect of Old English it acquired the new meaning \u2018(British) slave\u2019. The old feminine derivative of *walhaz , Old English w\u012bln &lt; *w\u012belen &lt; *wealh-\u012bn-, even exclusively means \u2018a female slave\u2019 and is likewise concentrated in the Saxon south of England. 6", "time": 1670935465, "resto": 14318903}, {"no": 14320199, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)08:19:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319710</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Welsh were also EXTREAMLY retarded when it came to succession.

Deep down, even if they have not had any spiritual experience of that nature, they still see Brahma and Vishnu and Shiva as they are. But they have been lied to by the priests. Trimurti were well known since vedic times, but it needed a Christian explanation. So that is how Trinity came to be. The cherry on top? Jesus Christ (a.k.a. Jesus Krishna) was not a Messiah, but a Bodhisattva. He came to teach the people some great lessons in spirituality and a path of enlightenment. But then the priests had to come and spoil it. And if you think the Catholic Church had a hard time with that, it is only because they did start the Catholic Church on the scam. It was always a scam. It was not just the Catholics. The Christians and the Jews have been at it. Just look at the current debates on how to put together some mythical character out of Jewish and Christian stories. Do not forget that Christianity started out as a religion of Hebrew descent. The Hebrews wanted to do some damage to the Greeks and the Roman Empire. So they created the stories of Jewish/Christian messiah. It was all a scam, of course, but the Christians had the advantage of being able to impose the scam upon whole nation, thanks to the invention of Christianity as a religion.

With the rise of Greek and Roman empires, the seizure of Egypt, and new advents in sailing, the Levant became far less important as you could bring luxury goods from India or China or Arabia oversea, across the Suez land-strait, and sail to any part of the Mediterranean for trade. It became more important in the Medieval period, similar to how it was during the 1st Dark Age, but after the Age of Exploration its value as an area decreased tremendously and now with global air and sea travel it&#039;s value is basically non-existent.

Big brain =/= smart, but it does give you something. I&#039;m laying in bed and don&#039;t have to paper- iirc despite having smaller brains overall, aboriginal australians had more developed occipital lobes and excelled at visual processing compared to European-descended controls. Similar results have been proven for the aforementioned polar peoples, who do actually have larger skulls than settled ones. That extra brain is doing something. However, not all domain-specific intelligence is equally useful. Domain-general IQ does correlate in other studies with cranial capacity. It would be interesting to see GWAS&#039;s that focus on the g factor or domain-general intelligence and then compare these mesolithic sapiens.

When looking at it as a dispute over slavery then clearly you can see where all those original fears came from, it was directly about the fact that the federal government had the authority to make slavery illegal, so the opposition to that authority became about constitutional &quot;liberty&quot; to be self-governing. But this ballooned into wild claims that the federal government was seeking to eventually dissolve the power of the states altogether, so that after the war the issue of slavery could be diminished and it could become about some much dearer right to self-governance. It becomes a great irony, then, that after the North conquered the south in a war it quickly brought the southern states back into the union and allowed them to build their little internal police states and continue to defend them in Congress as equals with the other states. The south continues to fret about liberty in its political culture, and usually take a very adversarial position in respect to the federal government, even though it is plainly obvious that this is the inherited cultural resentment for losing the Civil War and being unable to reconcile with the fact that so many people died and suffered for slavery. And that everybody tends to agree that the south was wrong for fighting for slavery. So the south has to endure the shame of being both losers and considered evil for what they did, and in order to suppress that feeling of shame they told themselves lies and filled themselves with resentment, and here we are today.

But the key would&#039;ve been to do it magnanimously, the North should&#039;ve spent a shitload of money redeveloping the south with an eye to making it prosperous again, but maintaining a state of emergency in which the south was politically neutered and not a major participant in the federal government. Only after re-engineering the south in the North&#039;s image could the south return to representation in the federal government. That would probably take several generations at least, and it would involve a lot more migration into the south too. The federal government found itself thrust into the role of empire, and it was in denial about it. The south&#039;s fears of a growing federal state were essentially made real by the fact they revolted and were outright conquered, but ironically the federal state didn&#039;t have the political will to meet the moment. The nation was no longer whole by the fact of the revolt, which was undertaken by a geographically bounded and rival national entity rather than a claimant to the federal state, so that fusing the constitution of the union states with the states of the former confederacy within such a short time span was like bringing a mortal enemy in and saying &quot;we are friends now, we live together. Let&#039;s share a bank account, here are the keys to the house&quot;. It was just irrational.

That means creatures which can go wrong or right. Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can&#039;t. If a thing is free to be good it&#039;s also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata -of creatures that worked like machines- would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they&#039;ve got to be free.<br>Of course God knew what would happen if they used their freedom the wrong way: apparently, He thought it worth the risk. (...) If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will -that is, for making a real world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings- then we may take it it is worth paying.", "time": 1670928020, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319761, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:42:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319759</a><br>well, i didn&#039;t expect that to explode formatting.<br>readable still. that&#039;s the simple answer.<br>if you want more, look into Augustine&#039;s &#039;de libero arbitrio&#039;", "time": 1670928123, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319762, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:42:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319759</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can&#039;t.</span><br>What was jesus?", "time": 1670928142, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319768, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319751</a><br>to explain it even further, God gave us the responsibility of making the right choice.<br>we can obey, and everything happens as it should, or we can not do so, and bring our own demise and harm others.<br>&quot;everything happening as it should&quot; includes freely choosing to do so.", "time": 1670928286, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319774, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:49:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319762</a><br>He was tempted.<br>with riches, with the whole world.
