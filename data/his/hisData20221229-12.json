just had to fortify its northern part and north western coast against Spanish and Portugese attempts at conquering lands, it also managed to maintain its presence on the East when it had to fight the Ottomans and Algerian Regency during late 18th century, but it never had or could maintain its Eastern Saharan borders, notably because those were just trade routes, no other state could attack Morocco, and Moroccan army only crossed these borders to conquer subsaharan kingdoms for slaves and gold, so only expeditionnary forces, but never stationnary presence. which truely signed an end to

Jesus wasn&#039;t homophobic, also he was the first socialist, etc.&quot;<br><br>It&#039;s just such a harsh shift in tone and strategy.

It was changed to a homophone meaning empty hand (\u7a7a\u624b) in 1935. The original use of the word &quot;karate&quot; in print is attributed to Ank\u014d Itosu; he wrote it as &quot;\u5510\u624b&quot;. The Tang Dynasty of China ended in AD 907, but the kanji representing it remains in use in Japanese language referring to China generally, in such words as &quot;\u5510\u4eba\u8857&quot; meaning Chinatown. Thus the word &quot;karate&quot; was originally a way of expressing &quot;martial art from China.&quot;</span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Karate began as a common fighting system known as te (Okinawan: ti) among the Pechin class of the Ryukyuans. After trade relationships were established with the Ming dynasty of China in 1372 by King Satto of Ch\u016bzan, some forms of Chinese martial arts were introduced to the Ryukyu Islands by the visitors from China, particularly Fujian Province. A large group of Chinese families moved to Okinawa around 1392 for the purpose of cultural exchange, where they established the community of Kumemura and shared their knowledge of a wide variety of Chinese arts and sciences, including the Chinese martial arts. The political centralization of Okinawa by King Sh\u014d Hashi in 1429 and the policy of banning weapons by King Sh\u014d Shin in 1477, later enforced in Okinawa after the invasion by the Shimazu clan in 1609, are also factors that furthered the development of unarmed combat techniques in Okinawa.[2]</span>", "time": 1672274918, "resto": 14389104}, {"no": 14389922, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:50:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14389757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14389757</a><br>yts sold their kids for brownie points", "filename": "images (13)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 491, "h": 625, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672275017303700, "time": 1672275017, "md5": "uLBAjJCket212t05Vkk9ag==", "fsize": 65626, "resto": 14389104}, {"no": 14389931, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:54:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14389908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14389908</a><br><a href=\"#p14389913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14389913</a><br><a href=\"#p14389919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14389919</a><br>If China has so many talented inventors why is it a smog filled shithole?<br><br><br>Why is Japan more prosperous and safe?", "time": 1672275258, "resto": 14389104}, {"no": 14389941, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:55:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14389770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14389770</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whites no longer have any power there.</span><br><br>Haha.

Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, paganism, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, and glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the classical. It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism. The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror and awe - especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical impromptu). In contrast to the rationalism and classicism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.", "time": 1672303536, "resto": 14390609}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14390678, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)23:28:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;when europeans were 30% of the global population you had people like kalergi and nietzsche freaking out and calling for a unified europe</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when europeans are 8% of the global population you have people saying europe shouldn&#039;t be unified </span><br>Why come?", "filename": "Graf_Richard_Nikolaus_von_Coudenhove-Kalergi_%281894%E2%80%931972%29_~1930", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 572, "h": 758, "tn_w": 188, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672288131488476, "time": 1672288131, "md5": "VqNHqPMCD59vCu03Uq06rQ==", "fsize": 304031, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "when-europeans-were-30-of-the-global-population", "replies": 19, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 14390844, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:10:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14390678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14390678</a><br>Poor kalergi<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Born hapa</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;White nationalists believe you want to genocide the white race because of a shitty pamphlet you wrote.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your dream of pan europeanism got bastardized into a crude mockery</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mostly forgotten</span>", "time": 1672290650, "resto": 14390678}, {"no": 14390850, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:12:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The europe is a cancer that kills the soul and sucks life from it.<br>I abhor it and i have always abhored it.

The trial testimony that resulted from such methods was often contradictory and vague on all details except for the assertion that the abuse had occurred. Although the initial charges in the McMartin case featured allegations of Satanic abuse and a vast conspiracy, these features were dropped relatively early in the trial, and prosecution continued only for non-ritual allegations of child abuse against only two defendants. After three years of testimony, McMartin and Buckey were acquitted on 52 of 65 counts, and the jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges against Buckey, with 11 of 13 jurors choosing not guilty.

There was also a significant pro-Allied and especially Communist feeling in the country, which rendered their military chain of command largely without any integrity or reliability. It was too vulnerable to Allied intelligence operations and subterfuge, as was demonstrated during the Operation Torch landings in 1942.

From that point, many French paramilitary units fought against the Allies on numerous occassions. One major example of this was during the Allied capture of Lyon, but fighting persisted through numerous townships and cities. This fighting, as opposed to foghting that occured in northern France, was much more frequent and was entirely via para-military forces instead of regular Vichy military.

What Buddha argues is that people naturally equates the notion of selfhood with the soul/Atman (doesn&#039;t exist). But not only does the notion of soul doesn&#039;t exist here, but also the notion of a selfhood rests upon very shaky foundations if at all. The monk Nagasense&#039;s argument about Chariot/Wheels is a classic pre-sectarian Buddhist take. The Buddhist argument is that there&#039;s no hidden soul (permanant or otherwise) + the notion of a selfhood thats made up of composite ideas like your memories/body/name/consciousness/se<wbr>nsations are merely a stream of everchanging phenomena all together and thus that too (as a reified replacement for soul) is a fiction. <br><br>A buddhist notion of the mind is a person&#039;s mental activities like memories, personalities, dispositions, habits, thoughts, sensations, consciousness from the physical senses, and the consciousness of the mind that which can filter these. Karma is the notion of a person&#039;s person&#039;s habits/dispositions/memories built up over the lifetime. When a person dies, the karma of a person influences the next birth&#039;s dispositions/habits/memories. Ofcourse the next birth will offer new chance to change the karma as well and depending on how the new life is led, the karma can change completely or change slightly. <br>The point of nirvana/enlightenment/buddhism is to loosen the karma so that by the end of your life, there&#039;s no more strong dispositions/habits to influence the next birth. The chain of karma finally ends at that. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wait does that mean I can remember past lives?</span><br>Only with high degree of mental development/cultivation.

By contrast, Iran under the Qajar dynasty practically unchanged in its political and societal organization (particularly the influence of the clergy) from the Afsharid and Safavid dynasties which preceded it, and was only ruptured into change by the end of that century, pressured by encroachment from foreign powers and the need to defend against them internally (Tobacco Boycott, Constitutional Revolution), culminating in the seizure of power by Reza Shah in 1921 and his reforms thereafter.<br><br>(but Ataturk being a war hero who saved Turkey from ostensible colonization definitely helped, whereas Reza Shah was a generic military officer-turned-strongman)", "time": 1672293509, "resto": 14387942}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14390974, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:56:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ugh", "filename": "132D5057-3992-410C-8D34-2C4D5C26E9BD", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 1334, "tn_w": 140, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1672293418272176, "time": 1672293418, "md5": "Khe6xyUy+t7+KgQPJ343iQ==", "fsize": 152547, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ugh", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14390812, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:04:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why did Hawaiian sugar production collapse?", "filename": "8359DCC3-B549-476E-9A3C-9104F0AE4C62", "ext": ".png", "w": 350, "h": 236, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 168, "tim": 1672290296718002, "time": 1672290296, "md5": "mN02xB8TvVyuVZtfP8Ww2w==", "fsize": 36964, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-did-hawaiian-sugar-production-collapse", "replies": 8, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 14390813, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:05:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14390812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14390812</a><br>His is a retard board and will give economic reasons.", "time": 1672290318, "resto": 14390812}, {"no": 14390828, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:07:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14390813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14390813</a><br>Give us your reasoning then, oh enlightened schizo.

The dialectical-materialist philosophy had always been too abstruse for him. From instinct rather than consciousness he had been a staunch rationalist. The distinction between the Marxist and the rationalist is of some importance. Contrary to an opinion widespread in Anglo-Saxon countries, Marxism is not at all rationalist in its philosophy: it does not assume that human beings are, as a rule, guided by rational motives and that they can be argued into socialism by reason. Marx himself begins Das Kapital with the elaborate philosophical and historical inquiry into the \u2018fetishistic\u2019 modes of thought and behaviour rooted in \u2018commodity production\u2019 \u2013 that is, in man\u2019s work for, and dependence on, a market. The class struggle, as Marx describes it, is anything but a rational process. This does not prevent the rationalists of socialism describing themselves sometimes as Marxists. But the authentic Marxist may claim to be mentally better prepared than the rationalist is for the manifestations of irrationality in human affairs, even for such manifestations as Stalin\u2019s Great Purges. He may feel upset or mortified by them, but he need not feel shaken in his Weltanschauung, while the rationalist is lost and helpless when the irrationality of the human existence suddenly stares him in the face. If he clings to his rationalism, reality eludes him. If he pursues reality and tries to grasp it, he must part with his rationalism.</span><br>-- Isaac Deutscher", "filename": "00IsaacDeutscherD8", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 370, "h": 291, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 98, "tim": 1672271621429430, "time": 1672271621, "md5": "8VqYxGuMgvG2uaIe2vXRHg==", "fsize": 14669, "resto": 14389632}, {"no": 14389731, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:03:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14389694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14389694</a><br>Also another essay of his I liked. &quot;The Ex-Communist&#039;s Conscience.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ignazio Silone relates that he once said jokingly to Togliatti, the Italian Communist leader: \u2018The final struggle will be between the communists and the ex-communists.\u2019 There is a bitter drop of truth in the joke.

The force of the European disillusionment with Napoleon was almost equally uneven and capricious.

But a man like Beethoven remained under the spell of Bonaparte for seven years more, until he saw the despot drop his republican mask.

He greeted the sound of French guns at Valmy as the opening of a new and better epoch, and he saw through Napoleon\u2019s follies.

His aloofness, in these as in other matters, gained him the reputation of \u2018the Olympian\u2019; and the label was not always meant to be flattering.

It describes a situation wherein all the large privately-owned economic institutions (corporations, industry cartels and the like) are brought into collusion with the government and become part of the apparatus of the State&#039;s economic planning via associations which are called &quot;corporations&quot; in fascist parliance, which are essentially modernized versions of the medieval guild system and of which there is only one per economic sector. Additionally, private ownership and ability to do business become contingent on service to the State. Thus, while ownership of the means of production (the stuff used to produce other stuff) remains in private hands and continues to be operated with a for-profit objective, ultimate control is exercised by the State. Fascist governments also exercise further control over the economy via methods such as price-fixing. The fascist economic system is in keeping with the ideology&#039;s totalitarian nature, where no other institution can be allowed to rival the State in power and influence. This quality also leads to a hostility toward labor unions and other organised worker groups, with such institutions typically being repressed and dissolved. Mussolini&#039;s Italy did in fact see the creation of new trade unions following the dissolution of the old ones: these new unions were owned and operated by the State, with very little advocacy on workers&#039; behalf. Ultimately economics in fascism is usually a secondary concern; they claim the &quot;Third Position&quot; on the issue between capitalist and communist.

Although ownership remains private in the fascist system, many classical-liberal critiques of fascism have argued that &quot;ownership without control&quot; is a senseless, inherently illogical notion, and that fascism is economically indistinguishable from state socialism and therefore is a variant of state socialism. Some observers do note the presence of state subsidies and intervention and provisions for citizens in fascism, but they see this not as socialism but an example of herrenvolk democracy, a system where a form of equality among an in-group exists with the acceptance of inequality of all other groups in relation to itself. The word herrenvolk is German for Master Race. Members of the master race are equal among their ethno-national identity and as such worthy of benefits and state support, but only if they accept that those who are not members of the Master Race are second-class citizens at best, or subhuman at worst (untermenschen).
