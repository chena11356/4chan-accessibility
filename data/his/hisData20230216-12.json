Indians did human sacrifice too, including children. However what Indians do after the westerners come is they become spiritual westerners. Bongs came in when they haven&#039;t done human sacrifice for at least 11 hundred years at the time and had obvious disgust to it, so Indians like you now talk about Germanics performing human sacrifice. They came in when all sorts of constitutional thought was popular, so Indians pretend that they wuz that but decided its spiritually empty so they gave it up(Gandhi), similarly for capitalism, abolition of slavery etc. About the only thing liberal Indians pretend to not have had before the westerners came was caste system, probably because it was the one thing India has kept from their own history, although unofficially.<br><br>Now how did Europeans talk about things like human sacrifice? An extreme Catholic, Joseph de Maistre in his St. Petersburg Dialogues(dialogue 7 or 8 iirc) mentions how the example of an Indian woman who sacrifices her child to some god against her deepest desires because the custom commands it. Instead of agreeing for cultural relativism, the Count(a figure in the dialogues being self insert of the author) argues that this in fact shows that the customs of this woman are guided by a feeling that God exists and you have to submit to him. That they didn&#039;t have Christianity to show them the true way of performing sacrifice(through communion), doesn&#039;t mean that what they do is wicked to the core.<br><br>The very epitome of evil westerner had more understanding for historical Indians than liberal Indians today.

But even this cannot be: in the first place, because atmosphere is not susceptive of such accidents. Secondly, because these accidents are not where the atmosphere is, nay more, the atmosphere is displaced by the motion of these species. Thirdly, because accidents do not pass from subject to subject, so that the same identical accident which was first in one subject be afterwards in another; because an accident is individuated by the subject; hence it cannot come to pass for an accident remaining identically the same to be at one time in one subject, and at another time in another. Fourthly, since the atmosphere is not deprived of its own accidents, it would have at the one time its own accidents and others foreign to it.

Now a million bucks sounds like a lot of money to NEETs, but in fact being a millionaire is pretty typical in the West if you&#039;re upper-middle class and own a couple of homes, while it&#039;s common enough for middle class people to have a quarter million or half a million, mostly invested in their home. It&#039;s actually a pretty good metric to check how many people are living comfortably.<br><br>So how many millionaires does Russia (pop ~150 million) have? It seems it has 350k or so. Sounds like a lot! But let&#039;s see how they compare to other countries.<br>Well, Denmark (pop 6 million) beats it slightly at 385, Belgium (pop 11 million) has 590k, and Sweden has 610k, meaning it has close to double the amount of millionaires compared to Russia despite having only 10 million people. All of this is thanks to Northern Europe&#039;s low GINI coefficient, meaning there&#039;s a strong middle and upper-middle class and relative few ultra-rich or ultra-poor people. Just to make sure, we can look at a country with a GINI more comparable to Russia, like Mexico: 320k millionaires among 130 million people, pretty similar to the Russian ratio.<br>Meanwhile Italy has more than 4 times more millionaires than Russia. That&#039;s right, there&#039;s close to 1.5 million millionaires in Italy, a country of 65 million people. There&#039;s over 2 millions of them in Australia, a country of less than 30 million people. There&#039;s some 3.4 million of them in Japan: a country with a bit less pop than Russia has 10x more millionaire. Can you guess how many millionaires the US has?

Therefore, garments had to adhere as strictly as possible to the standard parameters that gave these pieces an eminently imperial character; however, it has also been pointed out that one of the political strategies of the Inka state was to coordinate the diversity of the peoples, with their different cultures, languages, and traditions, without trying to homogenize them completely. The Inka promoted diversity and allowed local groups to produce material culture and conduct local ritual behavior in ways that represented their ethnic identity [14, 42]. In short, the relationship between the state and local communities was a dialectical process that varied from region to region and village to village, depending on the pressure exerted by the state and the receptivity of local groups [40, 43]. In our opinion, these historical contexts would have generated the conditions for local weavers to introduce morphological, technological, and stylistic features with low visibility, attributes which did not radically transform the imperial character of these iconic objects that represented the state.&quot;<br><br>there&#039;s still a level of assimilation involved - the state did have a lot of control over its subjects, especially compared to another empire like the aztecs for example. but they certainly organized the imperial structure around ethnicity.

Heaven and free will<br>If Heaven has free will then God is capable of creating a world of eternal bliss with no suffering, that also has free will, yet doesn\u2019t do that<br><br>If Heaven lacks free will then free will isn\u2019t particularly valuable. We will spend eternity with no free will anyways, our short lives with free will is working towards this as a goal. Religion portrays Heaven as a reward, something desirable, so it is admitting that an eternity of bliss with no free will is preferable over a short life filled with suffering with free will.<br><br>3. Degree of evil<br>God can create an exact replica of our current world, but make one heinous evil impossible to commit, like rape. We would still have free will and live in an objectively better world<br><br>If you object and say that isn\u2019t free will, the rebuttal is God decides what is or isn\u2019t possible.

We have sources from 19th century England that put the typical age of menarche there at 14-17 years old - this is higher than for young women today because of changes in diet and nutrition. Indeed, amenorrhea is common amongst malnourished women (it&#039;s most prevalent amongst women with eating disorders in the modern era) and it&#039;s not difficult to imagine young women living in a literal desert backwater town having the kind of diet that would lead to late menarche.<br><br>Given how unreliable and politically motivated the sources in the Aisha-was-a-child-bride hadith are, I wouldn&#039;t take that as justification for child marriage either. If I were a Hanafi Imam or Qadi, I would consider it mandatory for the bride to consent to the marriage contract by signing it herself (this is the established position within that school). She would obviously be in no position to consent to such a contract as a child nor would she be in a position to consummate her marriage at that point either (an important element within any marriage contract). As a consequence, I wouldn&#039;t consider any marriage contract to be valid until the bride is an adult. It&#039;s difficult to set a specific age for that. Marriageable age laws and age of consent laws in Europe tend to put that threshold between 14 and 18 - that&#039;s the range I&#039;d be looking at myself.

Park&quot; citing &quot;Forzados y reclutas: los criollos novohispanos en Asia (1756-1808)&quot; gave a higher number of later Mexican soldier-immigrants to the Philippines, pegging the number at 35,000 immigrants in the 1700s,[8] in a Philippine population which was only around 1.5 Million, thus forming 2.33% of the population.[9] As a result, German ethnographer Fedor Jagor, using Spanish censuses, estimated that one-third of the island of Luzon, which holds half of the Philippine population, had varying degrees of Spanish and Latin American ancestry.[10] Corroborating these Spanish era estimates, an anthropological study published in the Journal of Human Biology and researched by Matthew Go, using physical anthropology, concluded that 12.7% of Filipinos can be classified as Hispanic (Latin American mestizos or Malay-Spanish mestizos), 7.3% as Indigenous American, African at 4.5% and European at 2.7%. Thus, as much as 20% of those sampled bodies, which were representative of the Philippines, translating to about 20 million Filipinos, can be physically classified as Latin American in appearance.", "time": 1676537665, "resto": 14636609}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14635972, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)22:51:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Man protected by THE abrahamic God;", "filename": "ezgif-1-ba955422fe", "ext": ".gif", "w": 280, "h": 280, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676519476160707, "time": 1676519476, "md5": "RUI9XvmPhNpJFtV0Hswrpw==", "fsize": 3705579, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "man-protected-by-the-abrahamic-god", "replies": 5, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 14635978, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)22:52:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Man &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;protected&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; by the Hindu &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;gods&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;", "filename": "1662706306473", "ext": ".gif", "w": 480, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676519523567880, "time": 1676519523, "md5": "Ae6IfeMbEy+ZukQQDORQ+Q==", "fsize": 2006421, "resto": 14635972}, {"no": 14636095, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)23:15:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Theres a reason why Indians are slaves of Arabians, not the other way round", "time": 1676520945, "resto": 14635972}, {"no": 14636267, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)00:06:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14635978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14635978</a><br>is he ok?", "time": 1676523985, "resto": 14635972}, {"no": 14636823, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)03:45:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14635978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14635978</a><br>Yes.

But after the 1856 rebellion race mixing became frowned upon, as the government - not unreasonably - laid part of the blame for inciting the rebellion on efforts to Anglicize and Christianize the locals.

Relations between British soldiers and Muslims also weren&#039;t unheard of but that varied from place to place. Affairs between upper caste Hindus and British soldiers were practically non-existent since the horrendously rigid caste rules prevented anything but the most formal interactions between the two. Another thing to consider is the period, most of this took place before the 1800s when rules weren&#039;t as rigid and soldiers were expected to serve for decades. An East India company officer would serve for 10 years, be allowed to return home to settle his affairs and get married for 3 and then come back, but it was a hard sell for women since it was quite often a one way trip, something which changed with steamships later. Racial attitudes shifted later and the British wanted to avoid creating a mixed population in India like what happened in the new world so important positions and job opportunities were slowly restricted for Eurasians. <br>Eventually strict controls were placed on British soldiers who would interact far less with Indians after the revolt of 1857 than they had before.<br>Even before the revolt the British soldiers most likely to form long-term relationships with Indian women, mostly low caste, were pensioners. These were soldiers who were injured or judged to be permanently sick, but who hadn&#039;t completely served their time yet.

Prior to his conversion, he, and the majority of the Principality of Kastrioti, had been Orthodox, since before this, Byzantine Greek, and other Orthodox Albanian states held more power and protected them from Catholic Venice and the Catholic Albanian states. <br>The main difference with Albania and its neighbours though, was an eventual recognition of their ethnicity over their religion as the primary unifier. This did not occur until after Greece had achieved independence, and the Arvanites, an Orthodox Albanian population which had migrated south into Attica and become more Hellenized, sought to absorb Albanians into the Greek state.<br><a href=\"#p14635649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14635649</a><br>This is also correct, however the Islamization of Albania was greater than these other regions.

Some were massacred, others turned in muhacir migrating to the Ottoman Empire or Turkey, where they&#039;ve been thoroughly Turkified, to the point where&#039;s there&#039;s an estimated 5mil Albanians in Turkey, dwarfing those in the traditional lands.

Forest and spring, boulder and grotto were for them filled with sacred life; from the summits of their lofty mountains blew the storm-winds of the gods (it was not from lack of a &quot;feeling for nature&quot; that one did not climb their peaks!), and tempest and hailstones threatened or clashed furiously in the play of battle.

A simple injection is now all it takes to wire up a brain. A diverse team of physicists, neuroscientists and chemists has implanted mouse brains with a rolled-up, silky mesh studded with tiny electronic devices, and shown that it unfurls to spy on and stimulate individual neurons... The next steps will be to implant larger meshes containing hundreds of devices, with different kinds of sensors, and to record activity in mice that are awake, either by fixing their heads in place, or by developing wireless technologies that would record from neurons as the animals moved freely... When Lieber presented the work at a conference in 2014, it \u201cleft a few of us with our jaws dropping\u201d, says Yuste... There is huge potential for techniques that can study the activity of large numbers of neurons for a long period of time with only minimal damage, says Jens Schouenborg, head of the Neuronano Research Centre at Lund University in Sweden, who has developed a gelatin-based \u2018needle\u2019 for delivering electrodes to the brain...&quot; <br><br>Rand corporation&#039;s video on &quot;Internet of Bodies&quot;, an evolution of &quot;Internet of Things&quot;:<br>https://www.rand.org/multimedia/vid<wbr>eo/2020/10/29/what-is-the-internet-<wbr>of-bodies.html<br><br>Article on nano neural mesh.

In this way: the known and famous atheists Voltaire and Rousseau, and other materialists like them, had printed and published various works, consisting, God preserve us, of insults and vilification against the pure prophets and great kings, of the removal and abolition of all religion, and of allusions to the sweetness of equality and republicanism, all expressed in easily intelligible words and phrases, in the form of mockery, in the language of the common people. Finding the pleasure of novelty in these writings, most of the people, even youths and women, inclined towards them and paid close attention to them, so that heresy and wickedness spread like syphilis to the arteries of their brains and corrupted their beliefs. When the revolution became more intense, none took offence at the closing of churches, the killing and expulsion of monks, and the abolition of religion and doctrine: they set their hearts on equality and freedom, through which they hoped to attain perfect bliss in this world, in accordance with the lying teachings increasingly disseminated among the common people by this pernicious crew, who stirred up sedition and evil because of selfishness or self-interest.", "filename": "1-french-revolution-1795-granger", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 881, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 244, "tim": 1676507314689447, "time": 1676507314, "md5": "gC7jePIhtSo2qBoSqMF91g==", "fsize": 276767, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "muslim-account-of-the-french-revolution", "replies": 7, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 14635230, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)19:28:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14635227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14635227</a><br> It is well known that the ultimate basis of the order and cohesion of every state is a firm grasp of the roots and branches of holy law, religion, and doctrine; that the tranquility of the land and the control of the subjects cannot be encompassed by political means alone; that the necessity for the fear of God and the regard for retribution in the hearts of God&#039;s slaves is one of the unshakeably established divine decrees; that in both ancient and modern times every state and people has had its own religion, whether true or false.

It should be noted that by being in a city like Baltimore, Douglass was granted a number of liberties that helped in his pursuit that would not have been afforded to him at his old home on the Eastern Shore. Though his master Hugh forbid him to read, Douglass used Baltimore\u2019s streets as his classroom.

His work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence; and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us. This he did by surprising us. He seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly, if he could do it secretly. He always aimed at taking us by surprise. Such was his cunning, that we used to call him, among ourselves, &quot;the snake.&quot; When we were at work in the cornfield, he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, &quot;Ha, ha! Come, come!&quot; His comings were like a thief in the night. He appeared to us as being ever at hand. He was under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window. He would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to St. Michael&#039;s, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching every motion of the slaves. Again, he would sometimes walk up to us, and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the house to get ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and there watch us till the going down of the sun.</span>", "time": 1676511883, "resto": 14634049}, {"no": 14635590, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)20:51:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14634049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14634049</a><br>Fake.

Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken in body, soul, and spirit.

I spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times I would rise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul, accompanied with a faint beam of hope, that flickered for a moment, and then vanished. I sank down again, mourning over my wretched condition. I was sometimes prompted to take my life, and that of Covey, but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear.

The sight of these always affected me powerfully.

Hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan, Eli was turning, Smith was feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. The work was simple, requiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused to such work, it came very hard. About three o&#039;clock of that day, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as held down by an immense weight.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the treading-yard. On hearing the fan stop, he left immediately and came to the spot where we were.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I had by this time crawled away under the side of the rail-fence, hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun. He came to the spot, and, after looking at me awhile, asked me what was the matter. I told him as well as I could, for I scarce had strength to speak. He then gave me a savage kick in the side, and told me to get up. I tried to do so, but fell back in the attempt. He gave me another kick, and again told me to rise. I again tried, staggered and fell. Mr. Covey took up the hickory slat and gave me a heavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and the blood ran freely; and with this again told me to get up. I made no effort to comply, having now made up my mind to let him do his worst. In a short time after receiving this blow, my head grew better. Mr. Covey had now left me to my fate. At this moment I resolved, for the first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his protection. In order to this, I must that afternoon walk seven miles. I watched my chance, and while Covey was looking in an opposite direction, started for St. Michael&#039;s.</span>", "time": 1676514546, "resto": 14634049}, {"no": 14635752, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)21:36:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14635522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14635522</a><br>So Covey was there all alone with his slaves, armed ONLY with a whip, and no one ever escaped?
