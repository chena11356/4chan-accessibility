But when she came to the avodah zarah of Peor, she asked [one of] the priests, &quot;How do you worship this one?&quot; He said, &quot;You eat and drink laxatives and defecate in its face.&quot; She said, &quot;I would rather be sick again than to worship avodah zarah like this!&quot;.&quot;</span>", "filename": "1668183228964-0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 450, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670634863644639, "time": 1670634863, "md5": "cer8uWjZgN9L5OJ/Sa+T5g==", "fsize": 18863, "resto": 14304313}, {"no": 14305082, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:20:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14305053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14305053</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Gemara then reports that the highest level of Baal Peor worship was, sadly, demonstrated by a Jew:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;But the Jews were not that way...

In contrast, there was Baal Maon (Bamidbar 32:38), a god of dwelling places, and Baal Bris (Shoftim 8:33), a god of the union of people. There was also Baal Zevuv (Melachim II 1:2), apparently a god of decay to whom they would turn in times of illness and inquire of him about life and death.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;And there was also Baal Peor, a god of shamelessness, who was worshiped by giving brazen prominence to the most bestial aspects of human life. Hence, Hoshea says: &quot;They came to Baal Peor and dedicated (va&#039;yinazru - from the same root as &quot;nazir&quot;) themselves to shamefulness&quot; (Hoshea 9:10) - [that is to say, they] sanctified/designated themselves for shamefulness.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The cult of Peor is an illustration of the type of Darwinism that glories in man&#039;s descent to the level of the beast, where, stripping himself of his Divinely-given nobility, he comes to regard himself as merely a highly-developed animal</span>", "filename": "1667184393207268", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 562, "h": 600, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670635326104871, "time": 1670635326, "md5": "njd8PehsDZI8MYlowyywDw==", "fsize": 31528, "resto": 14304313}], "last_modified": 1670635326}, {"no": 14305046, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "and then I saw the incubators and the plastic shredder and", "filename": "nayirah-kuwait", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 416, "h": 302, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 181, "tim": 1670634800255501, "time": 1670634800, "md5": "jwB6V2raIOr3LzStqqfiEQ==", "fsize": 27594, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "and-then-i-saw-the-incubators-and-the-plastic", "replies": 2, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 14305083, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:20:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Nayirah testimony was false testimony given before the United States Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990, by a 15-year-old girl who was publicly identified at the time by her first name, Nayirah.

In that sense paid workers tend to be more effective, but when the tasks are just unskilled and unpleasant work slaves often proved better. Mining for example was incredibly dangerous to the point many societies used slaves and convicted criminals for the bulk of the labor in what was basically a death sentence. Cash crops as well involve a lot of backbreaking work and the small profits per acre mean workers can only be paid a pittance.Even today America brings in many migrant workers willing to work in conditions and for prices most Americans would turn up their noses at. Slavery proved a huge boon over other forms of labor like indentured servitude to these plantations. Not only could you work people, but you could buy and sell them, making even more money. <br>However once labor becomes more skilled, slavery starts to become less efficient.

High government officials, however, planned to have him killed in secret. In the pre-dawn hours of the following morning, a group of soldiers took Nichiren to a place called Tatsunokuchi, on a beach near Kamakura. But just as they were about to carry out the order to behead him, a brilliant object appeared in the sky. As Nichiren described it later, \u201cA brilliant orb as bright as the moon burst forth from the direction of Enoshima [a small island off the shore], shooting across the sky from southeast to northwest.\u201d The soldiers, terrified, abandoned their attempt. This incident is known as the Tatsunokuchi Persecution.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This event is extremely significant in the context of Nichiren\u2019s lifetime teachings. He mentions it in The Opening of the Eyes, written in 1272, where he states: \u201cOn the twelfth day of the ninth month of last year, between the hours of the rat and the ox [11:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.], this person named Nichiren was beheaded. It is his soul that has come to this island of Sado and, in the second month of the following year, snowbound, is writing this to send to his close disciples.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The passage may be interpreted as follows: Nichiren as an ordinary person died, while the soul of Nichiren as the Buddha survived. This is a figurative indication that he had cast off his provisional identity or role as an ordinary person and revealed his true identity as the Buddha.

The way the Christian worldview accounts for itself is that God made man to be communicative and to communicate with Him, so the means by which He has spoken to man is by inserting Himself into this process of communication, which He is able to do without fail. Those whom He predestined to salvation then at the appointed hour receive the gift of the Holy Spirit who awakens them to God&#039;s truth and gives them certainty that this is the word of God, which then informs them of all this. Now, the way we may show that this is true is that if denied, the very ground of rational discourse itself is ultimately denied with it, because the natural man has perverted both his common sense and his sense of the divine away from his creator and into idolatry, which cannot vindicate them. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what if the Vedas are correct and only the hindus are worshipping the correct ones?</span><br>I can prove Hinduism to be false", "time": 1670623627, "resto": 14299254}, {"no": 14304353, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)17:22:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14299254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14299254</a><br>Anyone properly studying biology would be well aware about mystery that is emergence of biological life.

Herodotus, who is considered the first historian, was an ancient Greek who lived a generation after the Greco-Persian war. He was concerned about what would happen once living memory of the war was gone, so he just kind of went out and interviewed people about it, and whatever other stories they wished to tell him. He also traveled to the surrounding nations and wrote extensively about them as well. If you read his book you can see that he came up with a notion of ordering information based on the reliability of the speaker, and the plausibility of their statement, cross-referencing it with other things he knew. Primary accounts from people who personally witnessed events were the most reliable, then you move down to second hand stories, legends, and myth. So it&#039;s always been a problem, the best you can do is mitigate it by trying to aggregate sources, and understand the context in which they were written.<br><br>This is particularly a problem for ancient history, because of the small number of sources that survive. There&#039;s a nice essay about this in the Cambridge Illustrated History of China. The author talks about how in a history book that&#039;s a civilizational survey, people have an expectation that it&#039;s going to start at the beginning, and move chronologically from ancient times to the present. But so many of the sources we have about ancient times were written by people in later eras, so were colored by the politics and culture of that period. Even sources that are more close to the events described may be political propaganda from when they were written, and intentionally downplay what actually happened to further a particular political agenda unique to that moment in time. Just remember that people are the same, the same emotions and desires that everyone has today existed as a constant of human history.", "time": 1670615130, "resto": 14303372}, {"no": 14303688, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)14:46:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;i mean just look at ww2, tons of stuff in their that&#039;s hidden from the masses or narratives that are switched up.</span><br>For instance?", "time": 1670615191, "resto": 14303372}, {"no": 14303708, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)14:53:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "most of history is deformed and you are taught from a western point of view<br><br>you are practically ignorant of what the chinese, indians and americans did", "time": 1670615630, "resto": 14303372}], "last_modified": 1670615630}, {"no": 14303130, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)12:23:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the first railroad in Brazil was completed in 1854</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the first railroad in Portugal was completed in 1856</span><br>Any more examples of colonies surpassing their colonizers?<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timel<wbr>ine_of_railway_history", "filename": "Wojak neutral face", "ext": ".png", "w": 645, "h": 773, "tn_w": 208, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1670606614776547, "time": 1670606614, "md5": "3Yp40d0tf5tUeXmSHiuw4Q==", "fsize": 11661, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-first-railroad-in-brazil-was-completed-in", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 14303425, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)13:33:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14303130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14303130</a><br>Cuba also had railways before Spain (1837)", "time": 1670610810, "resto": 14303130}, {"no": 14303699, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)14:49:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14303130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14303130</a><br>Portugal literally never had an industrial revolution.

The narrow road represents viewing them as a blessing which helps you find the truth. It&#039;s a narrow road because it&#039;s sort of like your mind is crammed full of enemies and the road through is kind of hidden inside all that mess. It&#039;s kind of like an autostereogram.

Or like that image which can be perceived as either two faces or one vase, it&#039;s really one image, but there are two ways to perceive it. But autostereograms are a better analogy. You could say the narrow road opens up as a gateway through the enemies, but it was the enemies all along, just your perception changed. I think of it as kind of dodging the bullets in the Matrix. Your enemies are the bullets. The narrow road is narrow because your mind is full of enemies and there are tiny invisible holes in that blanket which you pass through.
