A scholar lecturing with her[30] chastised their &quot;distinguished [Harvard] audience [because] every question asked about Sartre concerned his work, while all those asked about Beauvoir concerned her personal life.&quot;[31] Beginning in 1929, Beauvoir and Sartre were partners and remained so for 51 years, until his death in 1980.[32] She chose never to marry and never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, write and teach, and take lovers.[33] She lived with Claude Lanzmann from 1952 to 1959.[34]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perhaps her most famous lover was American author Nelson Algren.

Years after they separated, she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring.[36]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Beauvoir visited Algren in Chicago, Art Shay took well-known nude and portrait photos of Beauvoir.

His major conflict with Hoster was probably over siding with the rebels but he did end up fighting for his family before basically cutting all ties to his brother. Hoster is a massive opportunist who wanted the best marriages for his daughters. Did you know he wanted Jaime to marry Lysa and let him stay over for a while but Jaime was too busy fanboying Brynden and begging him for war stories since he was a war hero.

Having less than 1% of your population in the military is realistic. <br>Medieval Europe was more fractured and had smaller armies just like Westeros before it unified and even well into the 2nd century of Targaryen rule.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jason Lannister only had 1000 knights </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tywin had a bit less than 10,000</span><br>Those gains were almost all due to military advancements thanks to the relative peace and stability of the Targaryen dynasty. This is why they&#039;re able to have so many well trained soldiers. Is George slightly off what could&#039;ve been possible? Of course he&#039;s not perfect. He has arrows reaching men at the top of the wall and makes mistakes with travel time/distance and trebuchets, westeros should have several dialects amongst the smallfolk at the very least but the best we get is accents referenced in the books.

That was D&amp;D. In the books it&#039;s completely different. Stannis had 16,400 cavalry and 4,600 infantry whilst KL had 7-8k. He needed to rush to KL and take it before the Tyrells, Starks or Lannisters could fuck up his plan. Marching his infantry would waste time so he put them all on his 200 ships and rode with his cavalry to KL. His cavalry actually arrived early despite Tyrion sending his clansmen to do a little guerilla warfare. Once he reached the Blackwater, Stannis began building rafts and preparing arrows for the battle. His plan was to land his infantry first at the River Gate, and use them to protect his cavalry crossing the river on the rafts and distract attention away from the King&#039;s Gate which Stannis would then begin to ram. He did. Now some of his knights in the queue decided to skip it by crossing the mess of broken ships clogging the river, wounded Tyrion and dropped their morale to near zero. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The hound ran away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The hand is good as dead</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The king is hiding between his mother&#039;s legs</span><br>They retreated and were going to lose the battle. Once Stannis&#039; cavalry has fully crossed the river, the two gates would fall and he&#039;d take the city. There were mutinies, the Lord Commander of the City Watch was murdered by his own men.<br>But then the Lannister/Tyrell forces come to the rescue hitting Stannis in the rear and forcing a retreat to the shore where the only ships that weren&#039;t destroyed landed.<br>This battle makes complete sense. The only think I guess you can complain about is the size of the Tyrell army but that&#039;s due to the geography/history of the Reach. <br><a href=\"#p14611746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14611746</a><br>You do realise most of the ships are merchant ships?

Idk where I heard the 1000 Volantene ships number but after a quick skim read and Google search I found only 300-500 for the Volantene fleet. With the 1:5 ratio of the Redwyne fleet that&#039;s only 50-83 warships. The Ironborn have 1,000 ships but the 100 warships went to Meereen with Victarion leaving 900 longships which are much smaller than your average ship. Most of these were probably constructed very recently for the sole purpose of war. The Ironborn don&#039;t just chill with 1000 ships during peace times. <br><a href=\"#p14611837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14611837</a><br>They still fight for their lord/city.

Plus these merchant ships are manned by men of the Arbor. You think they&#039;re going to abandon their own families? These merchants probably also have tax cuts by being officially part of the merchant fleet which is a major benefit for the small price of the occasional war in which the Redwyn fleet has never been fully destroyed. In fact I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve ever suffered any losses since Aegon&#039;s conquest. Not during the conquest, Faith Militant uprisings, the Dance, Regency, Dornish wars, Blackfyre rebellions and Roberts Rebellion. A massive tax cut for the rare chance of war in which you&#039;re pretty safe is a tiny price to pay. So they probably have a fiscal incentive, duty to their lord and loyalty to their literal family. Taxes, fear of punishment and the loss of your kin is enough of a motivation for almost all men.

What saith history?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It seems that in the early centuries of Christianity no distinctive dress was adopted by ecclesiastics. Many indications point to this conclusion ... The most explicit testimony is that afforded by a letter of Pope Celestine in 428 to certain bishops of Gaul, in which he rebukes them for wearing attire which made them conspicuous, and lays down the rule that &quot;we [the bishops and clergy] should be distinguished from the common people [plebe] by our learning, not by our clothes; by our conduct, not by our dress; by cleanness of mind, not by the care we spend upon our person&quot; (Mansi, &quot;Concilia&quot;, IV, 465). In the East it would seem to have been the custom for ascetics and philosophers, whether Christian or not to affect a special habit, but the Christian clergy generally did not profess asceticism in this distinctive way, and were content to wear the birrus (byros) like the laity about them. ... &quot;If any man&quot;, says [the Council of Gangra (340)], &quot;uses the pallium [cloak] upon account of an ascetic life, and, as if there be some holiness in that, condemns those who with reverence use the birrus and other garments that are commonly worn, let him be anathema&quot; (Hefele-Leclercq, &quot;Hist. des Conc.&quot;, I, 1037). At the other extremity of Christendom the documents that survive concerning St. Patrick and other early Celtic bishops present them to us as habitually dressed in the casula (chasuble), which was at that time not a distinctively liturgical attire, but simply an outer garment commonly worn by the humbler classes.</span><br><br>https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04<wbr>419b.htm", "time": 1676010196, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606516, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:24:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14606510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606510</a><br>Point me to any father in the first 500 years of the church who supports the cultic veneration of man-made images.", "time": 1676010295, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606527, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:28:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14606478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606478</a><br>Why do you think all their arguments eventually boil down to an appeal to authority lol", "time": 1676010519, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606544, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:33:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14605219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14605219</a><br>That&#039;s a Vatican II Roman Catholic church, not a Protestant one.<br>Who are you fooling?", "time": 1676010815, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606559, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:39:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14606485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606485</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Please stop calling us Protestants, the proper term is Reformed Catholic.</span><br>Apostolic succession?<br><br><a href=\"#p14606478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606478</a><br>The church is as the church does.

The earliest mention of icons painted by Luke is found in a work called On the Veneration of Holy Images by Andrew of Crete, who died in the first half of the 8th century \u2014 an iconophile writing at the beginning of the Iconoclastic controversy. An oft-quoted and supposedly earlier mention in the history by 6th century writer Theodore Anagnostes of an icon painted by Luke and sent from Jerusalem to Pulcheria (Byzantine Empress: died 453) is found in 13th-century manuscripts of the history. But it is absent in earlier manuscripts from the early 11th century. That is a very strong indication that this story of a Marian icon painted by Luke was added much later to the original text. In a very well-researched book \u2014 Icons and Power: the Mother of God in Byzantium (Pennsylvania State University, 2006), Bessera V. Pentcheva writes: \u201cThe myth was invented in order to support the legitimacy of icon veneration during the Iconoclast controversy [8th and 9th centuries]. By claiming the existence of a portrait of the Theotokos painted during her lifetime by the evangelist Luke, the perpetrators of this fiction fabricated evidence for the apostolic origins and divine approval of Images.\u201d</span><br><br>https://russianicons.wordpress.com/<wbr>2011/10/27/another-icon-myth-icons-<wbr>painted-by-st-luke/", "time": 1676044701, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14607808, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)10:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14607800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14607800</a>", "filename": "guinefort", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1283, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676044763358676, "time": 1676044763, "md5": "CrHmYpXUCEU9HyTrNghl+w==", "fsize": 323391, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14607816, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)11:01:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Richard Price, Catholic priest and historian,<br>The Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea (787) :<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The real problem for the iconophile case lay elsewhere \u2013 in the poverty of support for their cause even in the golden age of the fathers.

Nevertheless, the topic of Britain&#039;s opposition to Germany predominantly comes from two avenues. Britain entered the war not out of outrage concerning Belgian neutrality in spite of that being the official story used to rev up the public. Oone needs to only look at how the Entente violated Greek neutrality during the war to see the hypocrisy of such a sentiment and if that isn&#039;t enough, one only needs to examine the illegality of Britain&#039;s blockade of German. Rather, Britain&#039;s prime reason for joining the war was to prevent the fall of France as a major power owing to British balance of power politics. If it wasn&#039;t Belgium, Britain would have construed another Casus Belli in response to German actions such as if Germany&#039;s High Seas Fleet bombarded the northern French coast. The primary benefit Britain got out of defeating Germany - which speaks to the second reason they had for entering the war - was usurping an economic rival. I won&#039;t go into the statistics now but Lloyd George outright announced his glee at the German merchant marine having been torn from them. <br><br>All in all, I wouldn&#039;t focus predominately on condemning Britain but Russia when creating a defense of Germany&#039;s actions. There was an understandable need for Germany to back Austria-Hungary whose aims for the Balkans were fundamentally conservative, despite Hotzendorff&#039;s warmongering behind the scenes, in contrast to Russia which wanted to shake up the Balkan status quo so as to further their influence and bring themselves ever closer to taking the Turkish straights. Russia was mentioning their designs on Turkey before the Turks even joined the war showing that the Balkan troubles of the early 20th Century were the result of Russia&#039;s century-long quest to gain power in the Black and Mediterranean Seas.", "time": 1676046550, "resto": 14607805}, {"no": 14607975, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)11:41:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14607927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14607927</a><br>It also must be stated that while some in the German military did want a preventive, others, such as the Kaiser, were looking only for a localized conflict in the Balkans - perhaps merely an occupation of Belgrade to force Serbia to comply with Austrian terms. The Kaiser even gave his Chief of Staff, Von Moltke, a stroke by delaying the invasion of Luxembourg after the British dishonestly implied there was a possibility that they and France might practice neutrality. The fact that Russia began mobilizing first in secret, in contrast to Germany, showcases a desire to use said mobilization to foremostly prepare for conflict rather than forcing opposing powers to back down. Russian support was also instrumental in encouraging Serbia to take a more belligerent stance in response to the Austrian demands with the idea that they wholeheartedly conceded to most Austrian points being a myth which resulted from the clever usage of diplomatic doublespeak. See the attached excerpt from Christopher Clark&#039;s The Sleepwalkers to gain a better understanding of the nature of Serbia&#039;s response to the Austrian ultimatum.

But China was never really &quot;restored&quot; after Qin Shi Huang, per se. The various dynasties were all different from each other, from different regions and cultures and formed a kingdom to encompass the region of &quot;China&quot;. What happened was that basically over time the Mandate became the driving force behind wanting to acquire Chinese territory, not the belief that this territory is a nation to be formed.<br><br>Rome couldn&#039;t be formed for two reasons:<br>1. The full extent of the territories was never recovered, thus nobody who claimed to be the Roman Emperor had any legitimacy and was dismissed since everyone wanted to be the Roman Emperor and every king in Europe tried to derive his legitimacy from Rome.<br>2. Rome conquered various civilizations that had already well established cultures of their and amny of them even had thousand of years of history. You can&#039;t just erase that.

The Robber&#039;s Cave study, Asch conformity experiments, Milgram shock tests, all of these were the basis of what eventually became Deindividuation Theory. Essentially the ideas got summed up into what Zimbardo &quot;tested&quot; in the prison study, the idea that being part of a group means a weakening/loss of inhibition and pressure to continually one-up each other demonstrating commitment to the group. As you can imagine, that can lead to some fucked up shit.<br><br>But it&#039;s important to point out that these early theories were only half right. BBC has a redo of the Prison experiment run in part by one of the researchers who demonstrated the limits of deindividuation theory, his basic idea was that these effects go both ways. If you can get people to act in horrific ways while they&#039;re acting the part of &quot;soldier&quot; you should also be able to get the opposite effect if they think they&#039;re part of something prosocial. And they do! For example, if you dress people up in nurse costumes before doing the shock tests, they are significantly less willing to hurt other people. The general consensus today is the SIDE model, essentially something that takes the lessons of early Deindividuation theory and reconciles them with a more context-based approach.<br><br>The mistake is to think these effects are bound up in specific ideologies or arguments, they aren&#039;t. You can get deindividuation effects, good and bad, from completely arbitrary things like what artist people prefer, colors, and coinflips. What matters about an ideology/crowd is what the established norms for it are. So if you have a norm of killing the other guys, like most militaries do, it can drift into killing indiscriminately.<br><br>Basically, in very broad terms, slippery slopes are real in this context.

Most development in Ethiopia occured after the Italians left, becaude they were only around for 5 years and were too bust fighting.

The initial rioting in Minneapolis caught both campaigns completely by surprise and the Dem-aligned media even darkly warned at first about &quot;Russian bots&quot; (lol) being behind the unrest. This was the very immediate reaction. There was also a longer-running school of thought among the liberal political class that it could be bad, or should just be peaceful (which I agree with, I don&#039;t support rioting) because Trump would exploit the unrest to win with a &quot;law and order&quot; message. So, you the media quickly pivoting to emphasizing &quot;peaceful protesters&quot; and blaming Trump for pouring more fuel on the fire, which, let&#039;s admit, he did. <br><br>Like.... a lot of 4chan posters didn&#039;t like that Trump didn&#039;t just shoot the crowds, but he was tweeting threats to do so, which just emboldened people (that&#039;s why if you&#039;re gonna shoot, then just shoot, you bastard, don&#039;t just blab about it, especially if you&#039;re the president). That was a clever and sly move, to blame Trump for the riots while supporting &quot;peaceful protesters&quot; (which, let&#039;s admit, most were if you look at the numbers of people who protested).<br><br>But anyways, Trump&#039;s people tried to do this line about the radical left and... ni...ni... NIGGERS causing chaos (!!!), but that&#039;s a line that Nixon played in 68, not in 72.

The biggest expense was probably a textbook. And you could probably have him pay for itself at 12 already if you sent him to work (doesn&#039;t have to be a mine but even apprenticeships). This already substantially lowers the cost of having children. And finally, by 16-18 he was almost grown up and could be expected to find his own career and go on. And that was it.

And that&#039;s is without the aid of an extended family to support you in most cases. But why is this? Because the requirement for success is much much higher today than it was in the past. 150 years ago, to be considered successful you had to have any job. Once you were out at 18 with some literacy, you would be considered average or even slight above average. But nowadays, if you don&#039;t have university level education, with the right job that also has a high salary and/or a good opportunity for promotion, you are considered to be failing in some way.<br><br>This leads to 2 different rearing strategies then from now. Back then, quantity was far more crucial. Getting a bunch of people out, some who may not be idiots and most would succeed in some way would effectively allow you to reproduce the fastest.

Even in those societies, taxes above 20% would be unthought of because of how likely it was to get an uprising and how heavy they weighted on the citizens. Modern man has allowed himself to be taxed to an extent that none of his ancestors would have found acceptable or even sustainable. And that&#039;s just considering the monetary side. People have less general resources and kids are added to that list of possible expenses. It pushes people to search for higher income jobs as well to get the socially acceptable lifestyle which adds to the loop I stated in the previous comments. And that&#039;s not all. Now the government is heavily involved in the private affairs of the family like never before.

You will still lose the ability to produce children after 45, and the mortality rate was never that low in any society, so there was no issue in that regard. And people still eventually die.
