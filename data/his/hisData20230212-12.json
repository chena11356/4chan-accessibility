If I had to say though, I think it&#039;s unappealing to a lot of people because it&#039;s difficult to shake the feeling that there&#039;s some greater powers at work in the universe. Too many atheists also seem to view the universe as limited not only by materialism, but by our current understanding. The universe is fascinating, it&#039;s sad that some people love playing up the &quot;nothing matters, you&#039;re just chemicals and you&#039;re going to cease existing&quot; side of things. The universe should be treated as fascinating and beautiful rather than mundane. I&#039;m not suggesting a God of the Gaps thing here. Just saying that some atheists make things sound much more boring than it actually are. There&#039;s so much still to discover and appreciate about reality.

It also feels like some atheists are burned by religious upbringing and have to emphasize the negative too.

His major conflict with Hoster was probably over siding with the rebels but he did end up fighting for his family before basically cutting all ties to his brother. Hoster is a massive opportunist who wanted the best marriages for his daughters. Did you know he wanted Jaime to marry Lysa and let him stay over for a while but Jaime was too busy fanboying Brynden and begging him for war stories since he was a war hero.

Having less than 1% of your population in the military is realistic. <br>Medieval Europe was more fractured and had smaller armies just like Westeros before it unified and even well into the 2nd century of Targaryen rule.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jason Lannister only had 1000 knights </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tywin had a bit less than 10,000</span><br>Those gains were almost all due to military advancements thanks to the relative peace and stability of the Targaryen dynasty. This is why they&#039;re able to have so many well trained soldiers. Is George slightly off what could&#039;ve been possible? Of course he&#039;s not perfect. He has arrows reaching men at the top of the wall and makes mistakes with travel time/distance and trebuchets, westeros should have several dialects amongst the smallfolk at the very least but the best we get is accents referenced in the books.

That was D&amp;D. In the books it&#039;s completely different. Stannis had 16,400 cavalry and 4,600 infantry whilst KL had 7-8k. He needed to rush to KL and take it before the Tyrells, Starks or Lannisters could fuck up his plan. Marching his infantry would waste time so he put them all on his 200 ships and rode with his cavalry to KL. His cavalry actually arrived early despite Tyrion sending his clansmen to do a little guerilla warfare. Once he reached the Blackwater, Stannis began building rafts and preparing arrows for the battle. His plan was to land his infantry first at the River Gate, and use them to protect his cavalry crossing the river on the rafts and distract attention away from the King&#039;s Gate which Stannis would then begin to ram. He did. Now some of his knights in the queue decided to skip it by crossing the mess of broken ships clogging the river, wounded Tyrion and dropped their morale to near zero. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The hound ran away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The hand is good as dead</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The king is hiding between his mother&#039;s legs</span><br>They retreated and were going to lose the battle.

The only think I guess you can complain about is the size of the Tyrell army but that&#039;s due to the geography/history of the Reach. <br><a href=\"#p14611746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14611746</a><br>You do realise most of the ships are merchant ships?

Idk where I heard the 1000 Volantene ships number but after a quick skim read and Google search I found only 300-500 for the Volantene fleet. With the 1:5 ratio of the Redwyne fleet that&#039;s only 50-83 warships. The Ironborn have 1,000 ships but the 100 warships went to Meereen with Victarion leaving 900 longships which are much smaller than your average ship. Most of these were probably constructed very recently for the sole purpose of war. The Ironborn don&#039;t just chill with 1000 ships during peace times. <br><a href=\"#p14611837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14611837</a><br>They still fight for their lord/city. Why would the merchant ships of the Arbor not defend the Arbor? Anyone who&#039;s a coward and doesn&#039;t fight for his side would be punished once the war is over. Plus these merchant ships are manned by men of the Arbor. You think they&#039;re going to abandon their own families? These merchants probably also have tax cuts by being officially part of the merchant fleet which is a major benefit for the small price of the occasional war in which the Redwyn fleet has never been fully destroyed. In fact I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve ever suffered any losses since Aegon&#039;s conquest. Not during the conquest, Faith Militant uprisings, the Dance, Regency, Dornish wars, Blackfyre rebellions and Roberts Rebellion. A massive tax cut for the rare chance of war in which you&#039;re pretty safe is a tiny price to pay. So they probably have a fiscal incentive, duty to their lord and loyalty to their literal family. Taxes, fear of punishment and the loss of your kin is enough of a motivation for almost all men.

These groups are tolerated at best by the leadership and will NEVER hold leadership positions, and the average Catholic either doesn&#039;t know about them or thinks they are crazy.

This is how Babylonian worship and symbolism became mixed with what we know as Orthodox Judaism. I believe that the Hebrew people after Christ would become Christians or deny Christ and perhaps some became modern Jews, but I&#039;m not certain. I do believe that many of the Palestinians today are from the biblical Jews that eventually converted to Islam. Regardless, what we know as Judaism and it&#039;s evil roots existed there among the people during the time of Jesus and they were influential in putting him to death, completely separate from Roman political aspect. Some how this satanic, baphomet worshipping Babylonian religion spread north into the Kharzas down the line. But It&#039;s not just the Jews because we know that the royal families that began the Templars took on this religion at a secret level. This would eventually rebrand among different societies. You have the eastern Khazars and what we know as the Jewish race today and their connection with freemasonry. But you also have the Spanish Jews and their connection with the Jesuits which were a Christian rebranding of this same religion and it&#039;s connections with Talmud in how they view heretics. I believe the Jesuits have completely corrupted the Catholic Church to it&#039;s current ashiest control of the west in DC, London, and Rome. I think of them as the &quot;right wing&quot; side of their control. This includes fascist liberal ideals. Then you have the &quot;left wing&quot; control through Jews and freemasonry. This is your communist wing. I believe that they play both sides and use both sides as scapegoats for people that go too deep.

During the Industrial revolution huge numbers of people moved from rural agricultural communities and work into the cities to take jobs in the factories.

One of the best responses they had to control and reduce the spread of cholera though was to make sure that people were boiling their drinking water with a leaf that releases a natural antiseptic solution when placed in boiling water (tea leaves, in case that wasn&#039;t clear). <br><br>The only place to acquire tea leaves on the scale needed was the Chinese Empire, who refused the proposed free trade deal and insisted on forcing all foreign merchants to trade with an imperial monopoly (the Hong) who set prices well above market rates.

She had the slave tortured; she herself pricked her with pins. What was the motive for her cruel behavior? Was it jealousy? No, it was lesbianism. Madame Strogonoff was an unconscious lesbian; she was actually inclined to love the beautiful slave whom she tortured. If someone had made Madame Strogonoff aware of her true feelings and reconciled her and her victim, they might have become passionate lovers. But remaining unaware of her lesbian impulse, the princess was overcome by a counterpassion, a subversive tendency. She persecuted the person who should have been the object of her pleasure. . . .</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The suffocation of minor manias or extra-manias has the same bad consequences. If a man born to be a hair-plucker or a heel-scratcher in love is not able to satisfy his mania, if he is thwarted and mocked at by those to whom he reveals his penchant, he will succumb to other, harmful manias. Everyone has heard about Julius Caesar\u2019s amusing mania: he wished to be the wife of all husbands. Today Caesar could not satisfy such a penchant without being subjected to jeers from all sides.

Say you want to worship the Norse gods, what do you do? A historically attested practice is to build a H\u00f6rgr, a small cairn of stones, and to pour offerings of water, beer or sacrificial blood over it. The more esoteric practices may be mostly lost to us, but we can have a reasonable idea of what some of them entailed. Sei\u00f0r was probably a shamanic practice which may have involved spinning (as in spinning yarn, not like a dervish) in a trance-like state as a means to effect magical change. Galdr involved performing magical chants. Carving bindrunes involves combing runes into a monogram where the letter-meaning, the symbology and numeric value of the runes used creates a magical formula. There are also modern rituals created by neopagans like the Hammer Rite and runic divination.

The spirit is never referred to by name except a footnote which names it Yeshu, but this might have been post hoc.

You will find that looking this good requires living a lie. And living a lie means you don&#039;t exist in reality. What doesn&#039;t exist in reality becomes Division. Whatever is Divided from what is real is telling a false story about what is really going on in the world.<br>These Liars come forth and tell everybody that they LOVE the world. God said whoever loves the world is His enemy.<br>JESUS CHRIST did not love the world. He loved the sinners. Two very different definitions at work there. <br>One of God&#039;s Commandments was to be IN the world, being effected by reality, temptations, and even sin. If you are already in there being effected by it, then you already know that your flesh can&#039;t survive in the death chamber of reality. Or you are one of those suicidal liars who denying they are a frog. There is only one way in to heaven, and that is by accepting that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Messiah, the Christ, and God&#039;s only Son, and there is none righteous, no, not one, and Jesus&#039; blood washing you white as snow for your sins is the only way a rotten sinner can be holy and righteous, even in sin. But this means you can&#039;t go on Twitter and run pedo apps like Grindr, I don&#039;t know why modern christians are running child sex trafficking like it is legal. But I guarantee you it isn&#039;t just christians. All religions, including the most holiest nation on earth of God, the Israel, is sunk in spiritual darkness and corruption, so these are really evil and bad times we live in, where darkness literally flourishes and is only JUST NOW being punished after getting so many companies and corporations and deceiving everyone that they are good and holy and trustworthy.
