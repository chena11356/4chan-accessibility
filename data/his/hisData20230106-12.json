By 1781, &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; had turned from being an insult to being a song of national pride.[16][17]</span><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanke<wbr>e_Doodle", "time": 1672947632, "resto": 14425447}, {"no": 14425717, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)14:41:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "KYS", "time": 1672947715, "resto": 14425447}, {"no": 14425765, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)14:51:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14425447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14425447</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How accurate is pic rel?</span><br>It&#039;s pretty retarded.

These I seized with my own hands and put them to death by thrusting them into the pit, that not even any memory of their destruction might still linger amongst us.

Two examples of this occur when he went to Mathew the tax contractor&#039;s house and gave him an audience; and the second one the Bible mentions was the Marriage of Cana, where his mother acted as the caterer (Who did the wine merchant&#039;s go to complain about serving the good wine last?) The reason &quot;st.&quot; Paul&#039;s theology became the orthodox version because the Roman State first stole its counterculture, tolerated it, shaped it, endorsed it, standardized it, and then made it mandatory as the only allowed State religion, and vigorously persecuted dissenters.

They provide nothing themselves like the peasants and skilled tradesmen, nor do they keep society functional like the royal officials and church, nor do they protect society like the nobility and soldiers. Their only goal in life is the accumulation of more wealth and as such they form a class of parasites whose interests are often contrary to the interests of the crown. They are not tied to the land because, for the most part, their job requires them to be nomadic and rootless. They have no culture, for the most part, because their job requires them to live among others and adopt their customs to do business. They are greedy so they try to get out of contributing to the country when called upon.

For the Court had much to offer: not only places in the households of nobles, and even, with luck, in the palace, but places also in the proliferating bureaucracy of the Spanish Monarchy. The only drawback to service as a royal official was that it required a modicum of education; but, over the course of the years the expansion of the educational establishments of Castile had amply catered for this need.

Again since we know that mental events occur in the brain - brain activity can be seen through medical imaging or testing, like with an electroencephalogram (EEG), where they stick electrodes on your head.

Currently have a highly paid job as a management consultant. Prospects are excellent. The idea was to leave and complete an MBA at a good business school, then enter a more highly-paid firm doing strategy consulting.<br><br>I\u2019m struggling. My performance is good and I\u2019ve been promoted, but internally I\u2019m struggling to reconcile my wealth to my faith. Jesus\u2019 words throughout the Bible consistently warn against wealth, with Mark 10:21 just one example. Some may argue that the young man in that passage didn\u2019t have to give up his wealth, and only could have to go a step further - to be perfect. Yet in Matt 5:48 we are urged to strive for perfection.<br><br>my faith was kindled and fanned by books like the Imitation of Christ - books that stress rejection of the world and embrace of the cross. <br><br>Last year I applied to be a detective in London. I have always felt a desire to work in the police, and was a uniformed \u2018beat cop\u2019 for almost 2 years previously. The Met have a direct-entry detective route for applicants with a good degree and qualifications. I\u2019ve been offered the role.<br><br>My salary would drop by around 75%. Right now I can work from home any day I want; in the police that would never be an option.

Whatever you do, do it for God. <br>I was working a regular job and then I joined the military. I personally feel that being a soldier is the most Christian thing that I have ever done. Copping is similar in the way it deprives you, it involves also a large amount of self sacrifice. Whereas living a comfortable life making a lot of money...what sacrifice is that? You already know the answer to this question, you are just convieniently ignoring it because you want an easy life.

Having a decent one who loves God can make a huge difference for some people, whether civilian or police or whatever. <br>At any rate, you can always just do it for now and maybe stop doing it later if you really feel that you would serve God better doing something else.

He is best known for his political treatise The Prince (Il Principe), written in about 1513 but not published until 1532. He has often been called the father of modern political philosophy and political science. For many years he served as a senior official in the Florentine Republic with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is also important to historians and scholars of Italian correspondence. He worked as secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power. After his death Machiavelli&#039;s name came to evoke unscrupulous acts of the sort he advised most famously in his work, The Prince. He claimed that his experience and reading of history showed him that politics have always been played with deception, treachery, and crime. He also notably said that a ruler who is establishing a kingdom or a republic, and is criticized for his deeds, including violence, should be excused when the intention and the result is beneficial to him. Machiavelli&#039;s Prince has been surrounded by controversy since its release. Some considered it to be a straightforward description of the evil means used by bad rulers; many read in it evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power. Even into recent times, some scholars, such as Leo Strauss, have restated the traditional opinion that Machiavelli was a &quot;teacher of evil&quot;. The term Machiavellian often connotes political deceit, deviousness, and realpolitik. Even though Machiavelli has become most famous for his work on principalities, scholars also give attention to the exhortations in his other works of political philosophy.", "time": 1672995876, "resto": 14427781}, {"no": 14428286, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)04:11:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;reads 2 books in 21 days</span>", "time": 1672996317, "resto": 14427781}, {"no": 14428440, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)05:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14428286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14428286</a><br>But you&#039;re illiterate.

The policy dates back to Stalin, and while he didn&#039;t trust the Lithuanian SSR to hold such a strategic piece of land as the Kaliningrad Oblast, when Khruschev offered it, it was denied so as to not tie in Lithuania like the other SSRs, whereas when Crimea was offered to Ukraine, it was accepted, and here we are today. <br>If the Russian Federation tried to hold on to Ukraine militarily after Ukraine had declared independence, we&#039;d see something like the Yugoslav Wars but on an even greater scale because that&#039;s essentially what happened there, attempting to former internal borders turned international to better reflect ethnic realities (and aspirations).", "time": 1672991344, "resto": 14427067}, {"no": 14428240, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:51:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14427920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14427920</a><br>you need to be schizo to understand this gargling mess", "time": 1672995113, "resto": 14427067}, {"no": 14428249, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:54:01", "name": "daymonklotz@insta", "com": "<a href=\"#p14428240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14428240</a><br>schizo nigger retqrd psychosis hinging .5b death on this nigger down<br><br>murder all<br><br>murder alex middleton brother fb.com/michimichi21 ratirl.ttv<br><br>last in line of schixo tranny down aut eugrnocided line", "time": 1672995241, "resto": 14427067, "trip": "!!FLpRDrVK71V"}, {"no": 14428356, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)04:38:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14427067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14427067</a><br>According to the Soviet constitution the SSR&#039;s were autonomous and had the right to secede if they voted for it. <br>Gorbachev was retarded enough that he actually started following Soviet laws. <br>It&#039;s of course ridiculous that Russia such vast stretches of land in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, where there was hardly any independent spirit, instead of just the Baltic Republics, but the bullshit republics set up by Stalin came game back to bite them in the ass big time.", "filename": "main-qimg-91a140196e53cc3cefc12694b6f1cc6b-lq.jfif", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 602, "h": 612, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672997898966035, "time": 1672997898, "md5": "L3nuX5FQcvMcp9Y3AWdlcA==", "fsize": 54462, "resto": 14427067}, {"no": 14428364, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)04:41:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14428356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14428356</a><br>And Chechens didn&#039;t get to leave just because they didn&#039;t have an SSR, even though they are way more different from Russians than Ukrainians are.", "time": 1672998093, "resto": 14427067}, {"no": 14428394, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)04:52:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14427067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14427067</a><br>Khrushchev was essentially the Duke of the Ukraine and when he ascended the throne he furnished Ukraine with a lot of territory and Crimea.

Particularly, the predominance of collective burials, the scale of which, was previously seen only in the Neolithic. To study kinship of those MBA societies and to test whether the re-emergence of those old traditions was a result of genetic shift or social changes, we generated and analyzed 91 genomes from individuals associated with EBA and MBA from modern day Poland and Ukraine. Our results indicate that while EBA people in East-Central Europe were most likely direct descendants of the preceding populations, the MBA populations were formed by an additional admixture event involving a population with relatively high proportions of genetic component associated with European hunter-gatherers. Additionally, our data shows that MBA collective burials contained numerous individuals related to each other, and the prevalence of close kinship among adult male descendants over adult female suggests that patrilocality was dominating form of marriage arrangements in these societies.</span><br>Found it.", "time": 1672904531, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423666, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:48:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423660</a><br>Was this HG-admixture from females if haplogroups weren&#039;t changed?", "time": 1672904907, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423670, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:50:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423659</a><br>Maybe there&#039;s more HG in Baltic CWC, also GAC isn&#039;t the same as LBK.", "time": 1672905030, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423678, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:53:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423670</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GAC isn&#039;t the same as LBK</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more HG in Baltic CWC</span><br>The Baltic ones have more WHG, but not EHG, and less ANF than the others, and GAC there have more WHG too while LBK/Barcin have not.

It was here that Richard set his eyes on 15 year old Shirley Malone, who was attending the fair with her parents. A pretty girl, blonde, and just starting to look like a woman, Shirley resembled Carolyn and Richard became smitten with her. Shirley&#039;s parents let her go off with Richard by herself around the fairgrounds and when it was time to go home, the two promised to see each other again. Shirley lived in Dallas, though in a more middle class section of town.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The two started sneaking out together in the next few weeks. Inexperienced and trying to prove his manhood, Richard introduced Shirley to alcohol. The two would get sloshed, go to partially completed houses, and have sex in them. After just three weeks of dating, Shirley was dumbfounded to learn that she was pregnant. It might have been inevitable; in the innocent early 1960s, most teenagers had no sexual education and barely understood the consequences of the act. After breaking the news to her family and Richard&#039;s, the response was typical of the era; well now you two have no choice but to tie the knot, hopefully soon and before Shirley was visibly pregnant. Arrangements were quickly made and they wed in a cheap ceremony.</span>", "time": 1672954166, "resto": 14424932}, {"no": 14426234, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)16:46:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Richard could have been in a good position to support his new family, if his drinking and temper didn&#039;t get in the way. As Shirley&#039;s pregnancy developed, Richard started to be turned off by her. She&#039;d been his perfect virginal teen love interest when they started seeing each other, but now he just saw her and their baby as parasitic creatures trying to leech off of him. One evening, after work, Richard came home to find his wife curled up in bed. He undressed and got on top of her. Shirley awoke and to his dismay said she didn&#039;t feel like it tonight. Richard was angered immensely; she&#039;d never turned him down before. He began hitting her and slapping her, and despite her frantic protests that he was going to hurt the baby, he pinned her down and had intercourse with her.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The honeymoon was pretty much over from that point onward; Shirley became cold to Richard and tried to avoid being alone with him. Since she wouldn&#039;t voluntarily have sex with him, he simply took it by force. Shirley had nowhere to run to; her parents wouldn&#039;t take her back and she had no means to support herself. Carolyn and Mary were also thoroughly useless as emotional support. He began skipping work at the bottling plant and drinking more heavily, and also using pills.

Carolyn and Mary wouldn&#039;t say where she was hiding, and Richard was haggard and not in the best shape after his jail sentence so unable to use physical force to get information out of them other than learning about his daughter&#039;s birth.

He proceeded to tie her up, blindfold her, ransack the house for valuables, and rape her. The whole time, he was extremely polite and thanked her for her cooperation. Virginia called police after he left, but they had little information to go on and no clue who this guy could be. She was confused more than scared.

She seemed like such a sweet grandmotherly woman, hardly the vicious whore he wanted to destroy, and he wondered why he ever did it in the first place. A week later, he was at a bar called Frank&#039;s Place when a female bartender. Mary Pierce, cracked a joke he didn&#039;t like. He stormed out of the place. The fact that she shared a name with his mother was doubly galling to him. As Richard sat down by a pig shed outside the bar, Mary came outside and wanted to apologize.

The powerful blow from his fist had ruptured Mary&#039;s hepatic artery. She tried to yell something but could only emit a few gasps.

He secretly hoped Martha could be a surrogate mother to him, but all his attempts at affection were greeted with a blank stare.

For one thing it doesn&#039;t exist on a legal basis (Japan is technically a Chinese-style Empire, not all Daimyo have noble titles/ranks, most of the ranking Nobles meanwhile all live in Kyoto with the Emperor), it purely rests on the military power of a daimyo. For another, by the 1400s, Feudal Domains are centralized: the supreme authority is the Great Daimyo to whom lesser Daimyo &amp; their subjects owe their complete allegiance to. A vassal of a lesser Daimyo is also loyal to the Great Daimyo. Daimyo therefore aren&#039;t like European Dukes or Counts, but wield the power of Kings.

Puritans are massively overrated in terms of how much they shaped broader American culture. Puritans had the run of Mass Bay colony for like a few decades early on. That&#039;s it. They were then completely overwhelmed by immigrants from other denominations. Even here in Mass itself where people like to blame Purtians for so-called &quot;blue laws,&quot; the fustiness of law and custom is much more accurately attributed to later religious movements and political institutions in New England history. The whole US has been through a number of religious movements, revivals, awakenings etc. that had more profound impact on national culture and lingering influence since the Puritan days.
