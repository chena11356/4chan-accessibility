Politics and economics were interlinked. The most divisive political debates during the perestroika period were about the distribution of economic resources. Gorbachev came to embrace political reform in large part because the Communist Party structure proved so resistant to economic efficiency. Where the Soviet Union diverged from China, it was because powerful interest groups obstructed Gorbachev\u2019s policies. The military and KGB staved off serious budget cuts until the final year of perestroika by threatening and eventually launching a coup to protect their privileged position. The farm lobby tenaciously opposed letting individual farmers lease land. Industries ensured that their subsidies were not cut. The energy industry was only partially cleaned up; the Soviet gas industry\u2014today called Gazprom\u2014survived perestroika basically unscathed, and even now faces only limited pressure to act efficiently. By some estimates, Gazprom today squanders billions of dollars each year in waste and corruption. The gas industry was not spared from demands for increased efficiency out of ignorance or ideology; it was spared because it was too powerful to touch.", "time": 1669570093, "resto": 14245718}, {"no": 14246118, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:29:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14246115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14246115</a><br><br>The influence of interest groups was particularly relevant to the most significant divergence between the Soviet Union and China: fiscal and monetary policy. By the late 1980s, balancing the USSR\u2019s budget was impossible. Interest groups demanded fat subsidies, and Gorbachev struggled to resist. Soviet leaders knew that the blank-check credits given to farms and industries caused debilitating shortages and threatened skyrocketing inflation. By 1991, food supplies in urban areas, even in Moscow, were at a dangerously low level, as inflation wreaked havoc with supply chains and distribution networks. Key politburo leaders\u2014from liberals such as Gorbachev to Stalinists like Yegor Ligachev\u2014understood that a rapid expansion of the money supply caused shortages in official stores and inflation on the black-markets. They disagreed, however, about how to restrain growth in the money supply. Gorbachev wanted to slash spending on subsidies and the military, but he feared the political consequences\u2014and interest groups successfully opposed many cuts.", "time": 1669570154, "resto": 14245718}, {"no": 14246122, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:30:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14246118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14246118</a><br><br>Gorbachev would have preferred to coopt the interest groups, but most rightly sensed that a market economy held few benefits for them. Collectivization and decades of subsidies had left the Soviet agricultural system so far from efficient practices that even today, a quarter century after the reintroduction of capitalism, Russian farms are still struggling to adjust. Farm bureaucrats and agricultural workers were right in concluding that market reforms held few potential benefits for them. The military, too, saw no point in reform. They already had access to top technology, and their funding levels were already sky high. Moreover, military leaders genuinely believed that the Soviet Union needed high defense spending to stave off a capitalist assault. Many industries, too, realized that their production processes lagged far behind Western countries, even as their labor costs were significantly higher than poor Asian producers. They, too, rightly sensed that capitalism offered as much risk as reward. It is hardly surprising that these groups all sought to subvert Gorbachev\u2019s efforts at reform.<br><br>They often succeeded. It was no secret Gorbachev did not wield absolute power in the Soviet Union, or that interest groups were able to delay or derail reforms. \u201cWe are much more entrenched in conservatism than the Chinese,\u201d Fedor Burlatsky explained to a journalist in 1987. Compared to China, economic interest groups in the Soviet Union were more powerful and more vigorously opposed change. In China there was no agricultural lobby that opposed decollectivization; instead, Chinese peasants actively fought for control over their farms. Chinese industries, like those in any country, pushed for subsidies and government support, but manufacturing played a smaller role in China\u2019s economy and politics than in the Soviet Union, so industries were unable to undermine change.", "time": 1669570215, "resto": 14245718}, {"no": 14246124, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:30:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14245718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14245718</a><br>pic related<br>/thread", "filename": "1519209978653", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 567, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669570227319885, "time": 1669570227, "md5": "6YDM7Zp8YlNFVyedczH+WA==", "fsize": 50296, "resto": 14245718}, {"no": 14246129, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:31:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14246122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14246122</a><br><br>Most importantly, Deng Xiaoping faced no threat from the security services.

China\u2019s army received 10% of industrial investment in the late 1970s, but less than 6% by 1986. The immense power of the Soviet military and KGB meant that such a move in the USSR was inconceivable. Gorbachev was unable to seriously cut the military budget.

Pentecostal and Charismatic churches can be traced back to Wesleyan Holiness churches and influences from Anabaptists and Pietists, ultimately resembling Casper Schweinkfield in their belief in a transdenominational church and an emphasis on the spirit of Christ existing in a general way in religion over the rigidly defined sacraments and physical presence of Christ in the Eucharist. However, the emphasis on being \u201cspirit-led\u201d goes beyond Schwenkenfield to resembling Hans Denck and Thomas M\u00fcntzer, and harkens back to the Montanists as I mentioned in <a href=\"#p14245594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14245594</a>.", "time": 1669564223, "resto": 14242599}, {"no": 14245744, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)10:58:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Protestants shouldn&#039;t have adhered to pure iconoclasm.

Of course God is capable of that whether it happens gradually, which is the usual case, or whether it happens suddenly. And it\u2019s within the will of God, and so it is our duty primarily to pray for that end, and at the same time to merely keep alive the Catholic Faith so that\u2019s its visible to all.

In fact I struggle to think of almost any modern examples of this. As someone who was raised atheist and has always been irreligious, I personally find the Christian tradition (particularly Catholicism and Orthodoxy) very interesting and meaningful, but there&#039;s too much just blatantly absurd shit for me to ever believe in it.
