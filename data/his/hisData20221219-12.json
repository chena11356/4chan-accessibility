With defunded welfare and other social services many just die, some might leave. Luckily, few have kids. The intergenerational fertility rates are abysmally low, &quot;necessitating&quot; further immigration.

Asylums are not nice places, not particularly effective places, and not particularly cost efficient places. In theory, you let most people out of the asylums and put them into supported housing and, if necessary, on welfare. Then if they&#039;re recovering they can build something of an independent life. In practice, the funding was there for the health system and isn&#039;t there for public housing or welfare.<br>Think in British terms for a moment to illustrate the dilemma: You move patients from NHS asylums to council housing and social care. The NHS is very politically popular, has a strong principle of being free at the point of need, and is assured of an okay budget, while councils tend to be associated with waste, incompetence, and the stupid unfair council tax that nobody likes paying. It&#039;s almost certainly cheaper and more humane to care for people in their own homes, but you can&#039;t really do a neat transfer from the asylum budget to the care in the community budget. Instead, you add additional expenditure requests on to the local council&#039;s budget - and the council will do the absolute legal minimum, if not lower, because the mentally ill and the disabled aren&#039;t a powerful voting bloc and you&#039;re more likely to lose re-election over reduced bin collection in the suburbs than you are to one or two extra homeless on the high street. (Also, the council is free to charge for social services - unlike the NHS.)<br><br>Worse yet, these reforms were discussed for a long time but only implemented under Thatcher, for whom controlling government spending was a high priority. So as well as not being able to reallocate the money effectively, you also run into the problem that everyone, everywhere is facing budget cuts.

Naturally the Brahmin caste (highest) would be composed of white, European-like people who praised their own kind and denigrated outsiders. This is what I was led to believe. The Mahabharata corresponds to an archeological time frame, the \u0100ry\u0101varta during the late Vedic period (ca. 1100-500 BCE). This massive epic centers on an equally massive war between two powerful kingdoms who are related by blood. The characters in this story are said to be royal, of high status and power. Almost all of this epic describes, in detail, the battles and events that occurred during the Kurukshetra war. As I\u2019m reading, I come across two main characters: Arjuna and Krishna. Arjuna in particular is considered one of the greatest mortal warriors on earth. He comes from a long line of warriors and kings. <br><br>So imagine my surprise when I read that Arjuna had dark brown skin. This is written explicitly in the Mahabharata and also the Bhagavad Gita. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Dark in complexion, youthful in years, of curly locks, exceedingly handsome mighty car-warrior, of broad chest and long arms, possessed of the tread of an infuriated elephant, of eyes of the colour of burnished copper and like those a chakra, that brother of thine enhances the fears of foes.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Reft of diadem, the dark complexioned and youthful Partha looked beautiful like a blue mountain of lofty summit.</span><br><br>These are two distinct accounts of Arjuna\u2019s appearance. His eyes are described as a dark brown, his hair is curly and black, and his skin is not just brown, but darker than most.

In contrast, for paternally inherited Y-chromosome variation each caste is more similar to Europeans than to Asians. Moreover, the affinity to Europeans is proportionate to caste rank, the upper castes being most similar to Europeans, particularly East Europeans. These findings are consistent with greater West Eurasian male admixture with castes of higher rank. Nevertheless, the mitochondrial genome and the Y chromosome each represents only a single haploid locus and is more susceptible to large stochastic variation, bottlenecks, and selective sweeps. Thus, to increase the power of our analysis, we assayed 40 independent, biparentally inherited autosomal loci (1 LINE-1 and 39 Alu elements) in all of the caste and continental populations (\u223c600 individuals). Analysis of these data demonstrated that the upper castes have a higher affinity to Europeans than to Asians, and the upper castes are significantly more similar to Europeans than are the lower castes. Collectively, all five datasets show a trend toward upper castes being more similar to Europeans, whereas lower castes are more similar to Asians. We conclude that Indian castes are most likely to be of proto-Asian origin with West Eurasian admixture resulting in rank-related and sex-specific differences in the genetic affinities of castes to Asians and Europeans.</span>", "time": 1671448031, "resto": 14346456}, {"no": 14346810, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:09:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In other word: a predominantely male population of pale skins invaded India.

It was the most horrible task and the most awful assignment that any organization could receive: the solution of the Jewish question. I want to say a few words on the matter to this group with complete candor. It&#039;s good that we had the hardness to exterminate the Jews in our territory. Don&#039;t ask yourselves how difficult it would have been to carry out such an order, even though, as soldiers, I might say you would understand. But thinking critically as German soldiers, you can see that the order was essential. Because we wouldn&#039;t have been able to withstand the aerial bombing if we had had the Jews in our cities. I am also convinced we would not have been able to hold the Lemberg front of the Generalgouvernement if the big ghettos in Lemberg, Krakau, Lublin, and Warsaw had still been there. We cleaned out the last one, the big ghetto in Warsaw, in summer 1943. In Warsaw there were 500,000 Jews. I tell you this number confidentially. It took us five weeks of street fighting. Just the same, I want to answer a little question that surely you must have. The question is, of course you had to kill the adult Jews, I understand that, but how could you do the same to the women and children? So I have to tell you something: The children will be grown one day. Do we want to be so improper that we say, no, no, we&#039;re too weak to kill children. Our children can deal with them. Our children will fight that one out. But the Jewish hate, small today, will be big tomorrow, and the grown avengers will attack our children and grandchildren, who will then have to deal with them. I am convinced that this will be the case even if Adolf Hitler does not survive. No, we cannot shirk our responsibility to kill all the Jews.

Himmler said that it was beyond his power; he was not the F\u00fchrer and Adolf Hitler had expressly ordered it. I asked him whether he was aware that history would one day point to him as one of the greatest murderers on record, because of the way in which he had exterminated the Jews.

It is therefore desirable that many of them must pay with their lives for this.

This destructive role of the Jew has in a way a providential explanation.

But in more ways than one Odin is an inversion of Jesus, especially in regards to sacrifice. Christ committed to the cross to save us from our nature in a sense, the final scapegoat, Rene Girard talks about this at length. Very much worth reading or looking into, Christians love him because he helps them rationalize still going to church, Nietzschean people and libruls love him for building off Nietzsche and themes of great literature.<br><br>Anyway, Odin demands sacrifice, human sacrifice in particular because his vision for man is that of the warrior. Odin doubles down on our nature as men and says that it can be made perfect, all his sons like Baldur and Thor are reflections of this. To Odin the warrior is perfect, especially the best warrior. I won&#039;t even speculate on Ragnarok because some think it is just a Norse or Icelandic equivalence of Semitic tier judgement day events. But the difference in Odin and Jesus&#039; sacrifice relates back to many pre-Christian themes, the &quot;master morality&quot; Nietzsche talked about and how it was ultimately overcame all throughout the world via guilt, hesitation, reflection, etc. in these people who were the &quot;masters&quot;.

Hitler was a butthurt German manlet and National Socialism as a system is just boilerplate European socialism with added racial laws. The Allies only got involved for self-serving and cynical economic reasons and didn&#039;t actually care about the Jews though.

This change is not accompanied by an increase in the percentage of those who support the one-state solution in which Palestinians and Israeli Jews enjoy equal rights. To the contrary, support in the current quarter for this one-state solution has also dropped. These findings point to the possibility that the change in attitudes toward the political settlement with Israel reflects a hardening of public attitudes signifying less willingness to compromise. This hardening of attitudes can also be seen in the significant rise in support, in the West Bank, for a return to armed intifada.

The big tl;dr here is that at the time the book was written (1860s), the Calvinists were claiming that the Netherlands were Christianized in the 1500s by Calvin. They used this as a justification for a bunch of bullshit regarding philosophy that doesn&#039;t really matter here, just that because Christianity has a STARTING DATE in the Netherlands, certain things are justified. The Libertarians/Libertines (this is a translation of Dutch term, it doesn&#039;t quite mean what either of those terms mean in English), meanwhile, argued that actually, because Yahweh had been around since Creation, man had never really not been Christian. The problem is that they lacked scriptural evidence to support this theory. The Oera Linda book is one of these.<br><br>It posits that the ancient Dutch people (circa 3000BC) practiced a form of trinitarian monotheism in line with (Protestant) Christian beliefs. We know that this wasn&#039;t the case. Firstly, 3000BC, the Netherlands would be inhabited by NHG and PIE peoples, neither of whom would speak Old Frisian. Well, no, it&#039;s not really Old Frisian, it&#039;s a sort of mangled pseudo Old Frisian, which is actually a descendant of PIE, but it&#039;s not PIE. It also is very clearly a constructed language, because the author fucks up how such a language would work CONSTANTLY. Secondly, as others have mentioned, the religion of the so called ancient Dutch is just wrong. They would have been polytheists worshiping a deity called Dyeus Phter (literally, in 3000BC he still would have been called that) among a vast array of other Gods and Goddesses, rather than the singular-yet-tridentine monotheistic Goddess (Feminine).", "time": 1671405227, "resto": 14343329}, {"no": 14345247, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)18:24:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14345216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14345216</a><br>Thirdly, and this goes back to the language, it&#039;s obviously concocted because the text not only uses words from non-IE sources (like &quot;marktje&quot;, meaning market, which ultimately comes from an Etruscan root), but it also uses words from OTHER IE languages that couldn&#039;t have existed at the time. The text argues that the Frisians came from the Himalayas (not the steppe, so we can see that this text is just flat out invented as we KNOW where the ancestors of the Dutch were in 3000BC), but the word used is an obvious archaization of &quot;Himalaya&quot;, which is ultimately from Sanskrit (Hima + alaya = lit. snow house). If the ancient Frisians left there in 3000BC, why are they using a word to refer to their home that wouldn&#039;t be invented until over two thousand years later by an entirely separate people? We can actually constructed a Proto-Germanic cognate to &quot;Himalaya&quot;, it would be &quot;*gimaz *slima&quot;, lit. &quot;winter slime&quot;, which would enter Old Frisian as &quot;gimslim&quot;.

This horde roamed the great Eurasian Steppe for centuries, migrating back and forth from east to west. Some of them stayed in the Carpathian Basin and the surrounding mountains, while the majority kept going back to the Asia. During this migratory period, they came in contact with various other steppenigger tribes and other Asiatic peoples, and their language started to get influenced by those they came in contact with, thus all the Turkic and Persian loanwords. They also kept establishing proto-states, with it&#039;s location constantly shifting towards the west. Then they finally came into the Carpathian Basin which was ripe for conquest, as it was a largely ungoverned and uncivilized territory stuck between the Western and Eastern civilizations. They quickly subdued the then indigenous Slavs and other such mongrels, then went on to raid across the continent in both directions. They were promptly stopped by the Franks and the Byzantines, and half of them took up Christianity and massacred the other half who wanted to remain pagan, so there went half of their original gene pool. From that point on they started mixing with the remaining Slavs and newly arrived Germans, especially after the Mongols wiped out most of what remained from the Asiatic gene pool. This was also true for their language, with Latin also added to the mix. And this is how it pretty much stayed for the remainder of their history. Now they are genetically a Germanic and Slavic mixed people group sprinkled with some regressive Asian genes. You can still spot a couple of them with slanted eyes and generally Asian features, but it&#039;s becoming more and more rare.

However, everything has an intended meaning. Sometimes a passage written later (or even much later) chronologically gives the perfect light to understand the first reference, and it really does seem to have all come from the same mind, as it really is God&#039;s own word confirming itself (like it says in Eccl. 12:11, &quot;The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.&quot;) Some of this definitely requires you to read deeper and have help from God while you do it to really see how it truly comes together. It requires multiple readings. But the more you study it the more you will see that the whole work, from Genesis to the end of Revelation is from the same Maker. Not only does it describe how the world works, but it bears all the marks of being part of the same plan that was determined from eternity past, and it&#039;s progressively revealed in a magnificent way that again bears the marks of something that is divine, something that is increasingly apparent to me. There is a lot of symmetry and parallels to be found, types and foreshadowings of things, and there is a level of depth to it, and any human work by contrast to this, including works written by cultists that claim to be as important as the Holy Bible, just pales in comparison and seems really really shallow.<br><br>Also it seems like people who read it with the wrong spirit are always thrown off by it, they never really seem to get it, like it was designed to only be understood by God&#039;s people.

We becomes brides in marriage to the bridegroom, and plurality returns to unity, just as this lower realm is an imperfect image that is a plurality of that more complete and perfectly eternal unity, that is, the rotation of the Trinity, so too we can participate in the love of this rotation and become one, making the inner like the outer, the upper like the lower, the male and female as a total one. This is the Kingdom of God, his messianic reign and subjugation of all the powers and authorities that inhabit the air. Quickly will all things be consumed in the fire of his love, when the quick and the dead shall be raised to either eternal life or eternal damnation in the energy of God&#039;s love.
