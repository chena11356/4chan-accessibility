Part of what seemed to happen is that the Shah treated the communists to be his biggest threat, which benefited the clergy when the revolution happened. There were a lot of young religious students (often sons of bazari merchants) in a country with a very well-organized clergy that&#039;s unique in the Islamic world. So there&#039;s a spontaneous uprising and the Islamists are the best organized and best positioned to take advantage of it in terms of seizing control of the machinery of the state, and then Iraq invaded which forced a compression of the new regime due to national defense reasons and the communists got ACK-ed in that period.<br><br>The clergy was also part of the Shah&#039;s system in a sense. The Shah was &quot;religious,&quot; in a way, he was Muslim and undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca, though he exacerbated divisions between the state and the clery by trying to build a modern and secular nationalist identity for the country; that is being a citizen of Iran rather than a member of a particular religion or language or tribal group. That was rather successful, Iranians today have a strong Iranian identity. But he also tried to reign in the clery&#039;s powers, and they were traditionally responsible for handling Muslim religious affairs, and they didn&#039;t like that.<br><br>There was also a revolt in Mecca in 1979 against the Saudi rulers by Islamists. That armed uprising was defeated, but it had the effect of moving Saudi Arabia to the religious right as the Saud family sought to stabilize their rule, so that was a watershed year. This is a cyclical phenomenon in the Middle East, you have officially pious Muslim rulers but they become corrupt and decadent there&#039;s a religious revolt.

Every ideology presents itself as a way to build a strong country, and communism was appealing to African countries looking to break away from European colonialism because the anti-imperialism was built into the ideology from the start. It&#039;s like Vietnam and China and Cuba. It also helps to centralize power and have a planned economy to do the basic industrialization. They also overlapped with pan-African ideals of creating a unified socialist Africa.

Let&#039;s not overstate it though, a lot of the governments were more like left-wing nationalists who looked at the USSR and China as counterweights, and you&#039;d get loads of money and weapons as long as you claimed you were a Marxist, and in some cases, if the Soviets and Cubans particularly liked you, they&#039;d send advisors and soldiers to help you out.<br><br><a href=\"#p14318317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14318317</a><br>I think Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania were the most competent African socialist leaders.

They began to be called Christians as it says in Acts, and that name has been with them ever since. However, there have been various sects that have split off from the truth over time, resulting in heresies like non-trinitarian groups, gnosticism, and Judaism (and yes, I&#039;m aware the above groups do overlap each other). Even later, a group that joined itself to Constantine formed, and that became the formative basis of the state church. During the middle ages, these persecuted the church while pretending to be the church, and taking the name of Christian to themselves, and trying to take credit for writing the Bible, giving themselves credit for everything, while ignoring God and persecuting believers. They also gave various derogatory names to the church, among which was the term &quot;rebaptizandi&quot; or &quot;rebaptizers,&quot; because the church didn&#039;t participate in infant baptism. They were very envious of the church and accused them of various things as an excuse to imprison and persecute. There were many other names they gave them over the ages, such as &quot;Petrobrusian,&quot; &quot;Henrician,&quot; &quot;Leonist,&quot; and &quot;Vaudois&quot; / &quot;Waldensian,&quot; all of which were meant to cast the church as &quot;heretics.&quot; They were also lumped together with other groups under terms such as &quot;Donatists&quot; and &quot;Albigensians&quot; and were wrongly treated by the state church as being interchangeable with gnostics. Eventually, they began to call the church &quot;anabaptists&quot; again. This name was taken and shortened to &quot;baptist&quot; some time later. Finally, one other sect appeared around 1527, a group that actually called itself &quot;anabaptist,&quot; which is not to be confused with the above.", "time": 1670914692, "resto": 14317656}, {"no": 14319239, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)02:12:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319210</a><br>Also, just as a secondary reference, here is an encyclopedia entry from the Edinburgh Encyclopedia to back up this brief description.", "filename": "32128c92b", "ext": ".png", "w": 614, "h": 368, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1670915531417907, "time": 1670915531, "md5": "O/M6YrKoTS23ygJy3kxteQ==", "fsize": 389699, "resto": 14317656}, {"no": 14319252, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)02:18:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319239</a><br>And here is a Reformationist writer making a connection between the anabaptists of his day and an ancient group of Christians more than 1000 years earlier.", "filename": "32128c92a", "ext": ".png", "w": 698, "h": 378, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1670915930935190, "time": 1670915930, "md5": "0SlWEdXC0UAvIykKp0THAg==", "fsize": 425931, "resto": 14317656}, {"no": 14319275, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)02:25:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319252</a><br>I guess I should end by saying that this is a demonstration of what Christ tells us in Matthew 16:18, which is about how the gates of hell shall not prevail against His church.<br><br>&quot;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&quot;<br>- Matthew 16:18<br><br>&quot;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
