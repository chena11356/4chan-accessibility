This all came to a head in the late 1500s with the Nine Years War (not to be confused with the continental war of the same name) which ended with the collapse and exile of the remaining Gaelic order in Ireland. England then spent the 1600s consolidating their rule by confiscating land en masse and placing it in the hands of colonists.

They were just stuck hunting and gathering in the worst environments known to man, the ones which are hostile to civilization and isolated from the rest of the world.

Cleaver viewed blacks as sexual supermen, envied by whites and too often rejected by uppity black women. And, like Huey Newton, he argued that the most genuine \u201crevolutionaries\u201d were those who were most oppressed: black prison inmates and gangbangers\u2014an idea that appealed strongly to white radicals yearning for a taste of black authenticity. Unlike Stokely Carmichael, Cleaver embraced white radicals, who adored him.</span><br><br>And this despite Eldrige having written explicit accounts on raping black women for practice and later on white women as a means of political battle. This excerpt is from his prison diaries:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To refine my technique, I started out by practicing on black girls in the ghetto\u2014in the black ghetto where dark and vicious deeds appear not as aberrations or deviations from the norm, but as part of the sufficiency of the Evil of the day\u2014and when I considered myself smooth enough, I crossed the tracks and sought out white prey. I did this consciously, deliberately, willfully, methodically.... Rape was an insurrectionary act. It delighted me that I was defying and trampling upon the white man\u2019s law, upon his system of values, and that I was defiling his women\u2014and this point, I believe, was the most satisfying to me because I was very resentful over the historical fact of how the white man has used the black woman. I felt I was getting revenge.</span>", "filename": "1671281264032185", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3300, "h": 2550, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1672097920295805, "time": 1672097920, "md5": "EssxXB25svQeWzimFTR/wA==", "fsize": 744640, "resto": 14377010}, {"no": 14379805, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)18:38:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14379692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14379692</a><br>Also yeah on the &quot;not treated as heroes&quot; part.

The Senate, the People of Rome (later Constantinople), and the Army. Technically the Army was the most important one to have since it could threaten the other two, but even then most emperors sought senatorial approval, even in the Late Empire, and they also tried to rally the people of the capital behind them. The only way for a person to bypass this was for an emperor to raise them up to the position of co-emperor. This was done quite often in the Late empire, and Byzantine period as a means of effectively governing a large empire, and ensuring stability once an emperor died, and usually a son, or relative was chosen, but not always.

Rightly so, this seemed to Theodore to be a sign of his father&#039;s anger at him. In consequence, being concerned, he searched his mind for any possible offence, and he went nervously to find his father in private. As soon as his father saw him, he immediately became angry with Theodore and reproached him for the inappropriateness of his attire: &#039;What good do you think you have done for the Romans,&#039; he said, &#039;when you pour their blood into these completely unnecessary entertainments? For do you not know that both the blood of the Romans and these clothes of gold and silk are to be used in their service, since both belong to them? We must display their riches through the splendour of our clothing on the arrival of embassies sent by foreigners; for the riches of the emperor reflect the riches of the people.

The name in particular is a shortened form of the term &quot;anabaptist&quot; which was given to the baptists as a form of derision around the 16th century, although a similar name was used against them in Justinian&#039;s laws and before that in Honorius&#039; laws where they were called &quot;rebaptizandi&quot;. This name carries the same signification as the later term &quot;anabaptist.&quot; See Imperatoris Theodosii codex: Book 16, Title 6 and Codex Justinianus Book 1, Title 6 for that reference.<br><br>Meanwhile, the anabaptists today generally refers to groups descended and related to the &quot;Swiss Brethren&quot; who followed the Schleitheim Confession of 1527.

Archangel means \u201cchief angel.\u201d And since the term \u201carchangel\u201d occurs in the Bible only in the singular, never in the plural, this suggests that there is only one such angel. <br><br>Moreover, Jesus is linked with the office of archangel. Regarding the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Thessalonians 4:16 states: \u201cThe Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel\u2019s voice.\u201d Thus the voice of Jesus is described as being that of an archangel. This Scripture therefore suggests that Jesus himself is the archangel Michael !", "time": 1671992102, "resto": 14373675}, {"no": 14375032, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)13:17:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14373675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14373675</a><br>yeah....", "filename": "bab", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 296, "h": 297, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671992255171344, "time": 1671992255, "md5": "5HzBjnx2Gzkabp19GXf/aA==", "fsize": 19606, "resto": 14373675}, {"no": 14375041, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)13:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14375024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14375024</a><br>I will not argue with you about this again.

Thats not realy impressive Honestly the spanish army of 8,000 could have also conquered the capital in three weeks. The reason Korea army was so bad was because.<br>1. 200 years of peace. In 1400s Korea had 30,000 professional soldiers, 100,000 conscription during war time and 300,000 conscription if the situation got worse. However by 1592 korea had 8, 000 professional soldiers and 140,000 conscription soldiers when things got worse. Even this is not correct. The 8000 professional soldiers were used total for four seasons. Meaning there were only 2000 active professionals soldiers during each season. Meanwhile most of the conscription were also fake. Before the war a minister looked up the names of each conscription soldiers and found out 50% of those names were names of mountain, dogs, dead people and non existent names. And most of the conscripted soldiers never learned to battle.<br>2. No experience. Heres the list of what korean generals ordered. A. Use pillows and blankets to block guns. B. Build fortress out of snow C. Plants seeds to stop the Japanese advancements... Basically most of the generals had no experience so your average total war player would have been better generals.<br>3. Japanese speed. According tp korean record pusan to capital takes about three weeks if your walking. Japan basically walked faster than your average Korean going to the capital.
