Moreover, paganism was less suited than Christianity to endure persecution since the efficacy of idolatrous pagan worship was tied closely to its visible symbols and its rituals. These symbols and rituals, as Gibbon notes, while useful in translating the abstractions of religious belief into a more concrete object of worship, are also vulnerable.</span>", "time": 1673169742, "resto": 14436405}, {"no": 14438424, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)04:23:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14436405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14436405</a><br>Demiurge being a violent caveman once more", "time": 1673169791, "resto": 14436405}, {"no": 14438430, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)04:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14438261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14438261</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paganism can exist without Christianity</span><br>That&#039;s implying paganism is a single continuous belief system, which is not.

Quite cheerfully, even in 1924, the Fascist Govi in the Critica Fascista (one of the theoretical organs of the Italian Fascist Party) could say: \u2018Fascism is clear in its negative programme, but it is not clear in the least what is its programme in positive innovations.\u2019</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In his early days, when he was preparing for his first bid for power, Hitler in a speech made in 1923 declared: \u2018Let us first begin to rule, then the programme will come quite by itself.\u2019 \u2013 a statement that would be received with roars of laughter in any Socialist or Liberal conference. But four years later he was saying significantly: \u2018The people want no programmes.

The transition from feudal to capitalist society lasted approximately 400 years. The changeover from a horse to a horsepower civilisation has been going on for over a hundred years with all the changes and stresses in social structure that intensified mass production brings. The big jump that has now to be made is the changeover from an individualistic to a collective, from an anarchic to a planned economy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fascism is the political form of one of the stages in this transition, that stage in which we now are. All the antagonistic and contradictory tendencies are somehow united in it. All the elements that feel the necessity of change, but want everybody to be changed except themselves and their own group, can project their wishes into the Fascist party, and find nothing there that is rigidly opposed to their wish phantasies. It is usual to reproach Hitler because he promised to everybody (except Jews) anything they wanted. Why reproach a leader for doing what his party exists to do? It is the strength of Fascism that it can take all the contradictory elements into itself. It is the weakness of Fascism, as of any other essentially reactionary system, that it attempts to solve these contradictions and can only do so on the basis of war preparation.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/subject/fa<wbr>scism/conze-wilkinson/ch21.htm", "filename": "z", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 406, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 101, "tim": 1673159965233982, "time": 1673159965, "md5": "DDoQWCkz8nLiE9M2KJMuIg==", "fsize": 54483, "resto": 14436916}, {"no": 14438071, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)01:40:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14438065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14438065</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Minor Contradictions in Fascism: Owing to the general contradictions within Fascism a number of minor contradictions exist. There is the inevitable struggle between the policy of preserving the \u2018old\u2019 middle classes, their local status and independence, and the desire for a plan which would make superfluous many functions that the old middle class performed. There is the contradiction between the attempt to lower the standard of the workers, dictated by the capitalist elements in Fascism, and the war preparations which need a reasonably contented working class. There is the incompatibility of autarchy and conquest of foreign markets: between the return to the village economy and war. The return to the village means the extinction of the heavy industry which is indispensable to the needs of the militarists. To see only one side of these contradictions as real, and to assume that the other is there for window-dressing purposes, makes it impossible to understand Fascism and the necessary zig-zaggery of Fascist policy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is the Leader who keeps together and maintains the equilibrium between the contradictory elements and groups. Therefore each Fascist party has one thing at least in common... a leader. Hence the fanatical loyalty to his person, and the theatrical over-advertisement of the man. A myth grows round him. The conviction spreads that whatever seems confusing or disappointing will somehow be solved when the Leader has time to give it his personal and magical attention. This belief in the magic powers of a leader, a hero-king, a warrior-Messiah, goes far back into the history of the race. Both Mussolini and Hitler have realised this. They tolerate no rivals to their divinity.</span>", "time": 1673160026, "resto": 14436916}, {"no": 14438104, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)01:52:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14438071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14438071</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is the purpose of this book to show that while Fascism has all these features of the gang, the dictatorship, the sadistic tyranny, these are only part of the whole picture, that Fascism is not an accident, but is the inevitable product of a specific set of circumstances. Fascism has only triumphed when other ways of getting out of the mess of the postwar world have been tried. Just as the first World War was a way of trying to solve the contradictions of prewar capitalism, so the second World War will be the way forced by Fascism to get out of the mess in which already the Fascist countries are involved.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Only by understanding the conditions that inevitably produce Fascism in a country can the correct method be evolved for avoiding it in one\u2019s own, presuming, that is, that the people are prepared to pay the price for avoiding it. For as we shall show in detail, these expedients, war and Fascism, are attempts to avoid the challenge of a planned economy. The breakdown of individualism, the collapse into chaos of that economic system on which the whole liberal outlook on life was based, is the dominating factor in our period. No propaganda, no spread of ideas with which any policeman can deal, but the relentless pressure of the products of the machine has smashed the foundations of laissez-faire. Mankind, solidly set on the land, can exist through any political chaos. That has been proved over and over again. But the Machine Age must be planned. The complicated machine that civilisation has become cannot be left to the blind forces of nature, or the anarchy of uncontrolled competition.</span>", "filename": "564564564545654", "ext": ".png", "w": 439, "h": 595, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673160720299427, "time": 1673160720, "md5": "lVjYvJcT/5zrHRN7eTmexg==", "fsize": 356510, "resto": 14436916}, {"no": 14438304, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14436916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14436916</a><br>Read &#039;&#039;Doctrines of Fascism&#039;&#039;<br>Then &#039;&#039;Philosophy of Fascism&#039;&#039; followed by &#039;&#039;Origines and Doctrine of Fascism&#039;&#039;<br>after all that you can get into the ontological basis for fascism like Giovani Gentile&#039;s &#039;&#039;Theory of the Pure Act&#039;&#039; and then you are set.", "filename": "\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430_2023-01-08_091846045", "ext": ".png", "w": 268, "h": 268, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673165961725435, "time": 1673165961, "md5": "12k0fn2OGzDXHSEL+5ZASQ==", "fsize": 84841, "resto": 14436916}, {"no": 14438333, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:39:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14438304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14438304</a><br>Is it true that German National Socialism doesn&#039;t have much in common with Italian Fascism?", "time": 1673167173, "resto": 14436916}, {"no": 14438346, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:43:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14438062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14438062</a><br>And he&#039;s correct and virtuous therein, requiring the support of all ethical people.

I&#039;ve found God. Here i will describe him for you so you can share in my contentment with this knowledge. God is passive. Absolutely passive. He does not think about us, he does not interact with us, he does not care about us. We are here alone. He didn&#039;t create, doesn&#039;t uphold, will not destroy anything. The best thing you can do in your spiritual life is become like him. Since he is God, he must be the wisest and oldest being that exists. Therefore you should emulate him. Meditate and fast and thereby train your mind to become so passive and disengaged that you are completely free of any internal actions. What i mean is, be as if you weren&#039;t there. Just a play. Play the game of life. All of life is a play to God. And it should be to us too. Because again he is the wisest being and should be emulated. My entire life revolves around this life, not the afterlife. Dispassion towards everything, even towards God, is my goal. God doesn&#039;t care about me, so neither should I care about him. I simply acknowledge that he exists for my own good. And for my own good i want to think about him and contemplate him. He also should be worshipped because that brings serenity and joy. Detachment from religious dogmas and knowledge that God exists so that one is able to worship him correctly and truthfully is all that is needed to be happy. Anything else comes and goes. But this stays. God gets nothing from my worship. I get something in return, but not by his action. He is passive. He can be worshipped when praying to Shiva, Buddha, or to the father, Allah, Adonai, it doesn&#039;t matter. As soon as one realizes that the passive God is the true God, one becomes enlightened to the fact and can worship to the full extent and with real power. So.
