Adam and Eve also weren&#039;t exiled only by Yhvh but by a divine council - this will be relevant later. Later, Yhvh becomes the god of the Jews, while other nations worship other gods, who are just as real and have comparable powers (Exodus is full of examples to this, i.e. the Egyptian priests can perform similar miracles like Moses).<br><br>In the ancient Middle-East, all nations worshipped their own gods, the Philistines had Baal, the Assyrians had Ashur etc. These were demonic entities that demanded things like child sacrifice. Most of the Old Testament is about the Yhvh&#039;s people, the Jews defeating the people of these other gods. This caused the other gods to lose power, while Yhvh&#039;s power increased. By the end of the OT Yhvh is the only god in the region still standing as the Assyrians, Hyttites, Babylonians etc. are destroyed (except for the god of the Persians, but there is evidence that Zoroastrian also worship an aspect of the Abrahamic god, i.e. Cyrus the Great was declared a Messiah, and the 3 wise men from Persia honored Jesus).<br><br>So by the time the New Testament starts, the pagan gods (demons led by Satan) have been exiled to hell but still have some influence over people&#039;s souls. This is because the original sin and its punishment, mortality was divised by the divine council, so they still hold a shared dominion over people&#039;s souls. But then, Yhvh incarnated as a human so he can be killed and go to hell. There he took away the divine power Satan and his demons, which gave him the ability to nullify original sin on his own. Now Yhvh is the one God of the world and has full control over the afterlife and pretty much everything else.", "time": 1670250170, "resto": 14280009}, {"no": 14283423, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)11:00:02", "name": "Dirk", "com": "<a href=\"#p14282941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14282941</a><br>What&#039;s your objective standard for justice?", "time": 1670256002, "resto": 14280009, "trip": "!!hGWqjxceevY"}], "last_modified": 1670256002}, {"no": 14280200, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)18:22:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/OC/ - Orthodox Christianity", "com": "Let&#039;s discuss Orthodoxy, its traditions, and it&#039;s historical significance<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Catholics, Protestants, demon worshipers, and atheists can kindly ignore this thread and go somewhere else to argue about their beliefs</span>", "filename": "1_GhngA0BrFdo0ZYEn6pbPXA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1098, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 171, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670196127562837, "time": 1670196127, "md5": "E80ghp1pP2T3Vo8L5hXtDQ==", "fsize": 466792, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "oc-orthodox-christianity", "replies": 46, "images": 6, "omitted_posts": 41, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 14283147, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:36:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14283034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14283034</a><br>They weren\u2019t anti self defense you retard.

This development arose through recognition by the Greeks of the strong relation between athletics, education and health.

Physical training and maintenance of health and strength were the chief parts of children&#039;s earlier education. Except for time devoted to letters and music, the education of young men was solely conducted in the gymnasium, where provisions were made not only for physical pedagogy but for instruction in morals and ethics. As pupils grew older, informal conversation and other forms of social activity took the place of institutional, systematic discipline. Since the gymnasia were favorite resorts of youth, they were frequented by teachers, especially philosophers.Philosophers and sophists frequently assembled to hold talks and lectures in the gymnasia; thus the institution became a resort for those interested in less structured intellectual pursuits in addition to those using the place for training in physical exercises.<br><br>The main difference was that education was democratic in ancient Greece vs. Christians granting &quot;degrees&quot; to make sure the wrong people don&#039;t get educated<br><br>p.s. literacy rates were much much higher in antiquity<br><br>In summary: Christianity purposefully dumbed down the population of Europe.

The earth he has dug out forms a breastwork in front and at the side to act as an additional cover. If a tank drives over such a trench the soldier has a 50% chance that it will do him no harm. At any moment the soldier may be ordered to advance again and, shouting at the top of his voice, will rush ahead. If he is not ordered to advance, he digs in deeper and deeper. At first his trench can be used for firing in the lying position. Later it becomes a trench from which to fire in the kneeling position, and later still, when it is 110 centimetres deep, it can be used for firing in the standing position. The earth that has been dug out protects the soldier from bullets and fragments. He makes an embrasure in this breastwork into which he positions the barrel of his gun. In the absence of any further commands he continues to work on his trench. He camouflages it. He starts to dig a trench to connect with his comrades to the left of him. He always digs from right to left, and in a few hours the unit has a trench linking all the riflemen\u2019s trenches together. The unit\u2019s trenches are linked with the trenches of other units.

Funny how four different attempts from four different groups on four different skulls all look similar isn&#039;t it?<br><br>However, not all WSH looked like these, some were more gracile especially later on. The idea that gracile features in modern Euros all come from EEF is dumb as it ignores selection pressure of the past 5000 years! gracile types existed in WSH because they were part CHG. The robust type is more from EHG and this kind is also common in Nordic types today hence why the Nordic race is objectively the strongest on earth today (Iceland, Sweden and Britain always produce the strongest men winners).", "filename": "yamnaya beard", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 470, "h": 600, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670237920752533, "time": 1670237920, "md5": "ij642n59t6dgCF2COVQl8w==", "fsize": 46046, "resto": 14279104}, {"no": 14282812, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:39:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14279227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14279227</a><br>they look like the average slavic village drunkman", "time": 1670243942, "resto": 14279104}], "last_modified": 1670243942}]}, {"page": 8, "threads": [{"no": 14251020, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)13:17:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can trains now be considered communist since only commies seemed to care about trains after the 50s?", "filename": "thatll-buff-out", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1120, "h": 602, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 134, "tim": 1669659464242538, "time": 1669659464, "md5": "QakPp3RYqwj0xwHKImzl6g==", "fsize": 225472, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "can-trains-now-be-considered-communist-since-only", "replies": 266, "images": 111, "omitted_posts": 261, "omitted_images": 109, "last_replies": [{"no": 14279929, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14277743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14277743</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And the USSR has eliminated wasteful competition, saving everyone money.

Founded from an initiative of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers&#039; Parties, WPC emerged from the bureau\u2019s worldview that divided humanity into Soviet-led &quot;peace-loving&quot; progressive forces and US-led &quot;warmongering&quot; capitalist countries. Throughout the Cold War, WPC operated as a front organization as it was controlled and largely funded by the Soviet Union, and refrained from criticizing or even defended the Soviet Union&#039;s involvement in numerous conflicts. These factors led to the decline of its influence over the peace movement in non-Communist countries. Its first president was the French physicist and activist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie.
