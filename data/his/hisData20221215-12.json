Cabanagem, the biggest popular revolt in Brazilian history and the only one that managed to seize and remain in power for a period of time, faced Portuguese domination and was against the majority of whites who, in general, were the rich and rulers and formed a dominant minority. The population of Par\u00e1 was 119,877 inhabitants at the time, of which 32,751 were indigenous, 29,977 were black slaves, 42,000 were mestizos. The White minority was 15,000, over half of them Portuguese</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many black slaves led the Cabanagem. Arms in hand, they demand that Angelim, the third white Cabano leader, formally abolish Slavery. Directed by former slaves, such as Negro Patriota, Diamante, Felix, Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o and Beliz\u00e1rio, they defend the rupture with the Brazilian Empire and a Free Black Republic, like Haiti. In this sense, Cabanagem was, in our history, something similar to the revolution led by slaves in Haiti (1791-1804), in addition to black slaves, there were indigenous and poor mestizos peasants who fought against Slavery, large estates and Genocide. In the top leadership of Cabanagem was a minority of white bourgeois and slave owners who were dissatisfied with the neglect abandonment of the Province of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 by the Empire, who promised the mestizo, indian and black cabanos Equality and Freedom</span>", "filename": "1663705401031", "ext": ".png", "w": 1672, "h": 1508, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1671076084952316, "time": 1671076084, "md5": "tHV/9NIxZK3N+HbNIHE97g==", "fsize": 546228, "resto": 14326229}, {"no": 14327715, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:49:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14327710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14327710</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cabanagem was the bloodiest civil war in Brazil and, most likely, in all of Latin America.

Cabanos entrusted their desires for freedom and better days to other whites landowner leaders, slave owners and bourgeois, as were the three Cabano governments. They were betrayed by all of them. For this reason, the counterrevolution led by the regency government based in Rio de Janeiro was particularly cruel and decimated almost 50% of the population that lived in the great Amazonian floodplains at the time. The Mura ethnic group was practically decimated: there is talk of 21,000 dead in Cabanagem.

Yet somehow we have no written script during the middle ages even though we had several before.<br><br>It&#039;s mind-boggling how this reset could have happened. There&#039;s genetic evidence such as a bottle neck over 2000 years ago in the Y chromosome haplogroups. At least 10,000 years of existence as a separate ethnic group but all men descend from a handful around 1AD? Several written scripts found but no one remembers them?There&#039;s no fucking way a city written in the periplus of the erythraean sea such as bosaso is now fully occupied by people descended from 1 guy around a few centuries ago.

My family was never very religious, church on Sundays, belonged to a specific denomination, but nothing like expecting us to go on mission trips or being raised to proselytize to friends and coworkers.

Read the bible a lot, prayed a lot, bible seemed stupid praying felt pointless, didn&#039;t feel anything, didn&#039;t notice anything, stopped bothering. As I got older I began to think more deeply than just reading the bible into logical considerations about religion and the implications of theology and realized that Christianity had some holes I couldn&#039;t reconcile and while other religions better patched said holes I didn&#039;t find them to really offer much proof beyond <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;14323860</span> &quot;we don&#039;t know therefore God&quot; which is nowhere near enough proof for me to dedicate my life to something.

His wisdom should have prevented him from going down the wrong path. His story painfully illustrates the failures of supplanting God\u2019s wisdom with man\u2019s prudence. Solomon got caught up in his prudence and thought that he could do it all himself and for himself. He could make marriages, deals, and compromises that were easiest in the moment and that he judged to be fine. From the Garden of Eden, man has been tempted to place his prudence above God\u2019s commands. Using our reason, we tell ourselves that we are breaking God\u2019s small commands in search of a greater good. Certainly God will understand because if I eat this fruit, I will know good from evil and be like Him. Or if I marry this ungodly queen, I will be allied with her country and assure peace. Such ideas are the work of the Devil in our minds. Men lack the foresight to be able to predict the next second, much less see the effects of their actions years down the road. They only lie to themselves when they compromise with perfection in the claim of greater justice for the future. Man\u2019s prudence should never abridge God\u2019s wise justice.<br><br>This lie is the temptation of prudence\u2014man\u2019s reason that is uninspired by God. It is the virtue of putting our judgment ahead of God\u2019s. It seems and is reasonable. It makes perfect sense to a man to deny God to save one\u2019s own life. After all, a dead man cannot help the poor, or preach the word. A quick denial of God will get me out of this situation and leave me free to serve Him tomorrow. Or perhaps one man, Churchill, would make a deal with the Devil to win a war.

Deep down, even if they have not had any spiritual experience of that nature, they still see Brahma and Vishnu and Shiva as they are. But they have been lied to by the priests. Trimurti were well known since vedic times, but it needed a Christian explanation. So that is how Trinity came to be. The cherry on top? Jesus Christ (a.k.a. Jesus Krishna) was not a Messiah, but a Bodhisattva. He came to teach the people some great lessons in spirituality and a path of enlightenment. But then the priests had to come and spoil it. And if you think the Catholic Church had a hard time with that, it is only because they did start the Catholic Church on the scam. It was always a scam. It was not just the Catholics. The Christians and the Jews have been at it. Just look at the current debates on how to put together some mythical character out of Jewish and Christian stories. Do not forget that Christianity started out as a religion of Hebrew descent. The Hebrews wanted to do some damage to the Greeks and the Roman Empire. So they created the stories of Jewish/Christian messiah. It was all a scam, of course, but the Christians had the advantage of being able to impose the scam upon whole nation, thanks to the invention of Christianity as a religion.

They had so much momentum after capturing Nanjing, had they immediately marched North and captured Beijing too I think the Qing would have fully collapsed. Instead they just sat in Nanjing to make it their model capital, instead it became their tomb.<br><br>If you look at what happened historically once they actually tried to administer the territories they&#039;d conquered they were complete failures. Actual land reform was abandoned in favor of just shaking down landlords for payoffs. Taiping leaders appropriated absurd amounts of captured loot as their own booty while leaving everyone else in poverty. Barbarism was the rule of the day, with people being burned at the stake (or &quot;turned into a celestial lamp&quot; as they called it) simply for not bowing deeply enough when a Taiping leader walked by. Additionally common soldiers were banned from having sex, while the leaders had enormous harems. It was literally hell on Earth.

I sometimes hear this opinion.</span><br>Before I get to it I want you to realise something that will help you later in the post. Genetic code is not computer code. A sequence of genes can be used to synthesise proteins in several different tissues leading to morphological differences in many organs. Computer code only does a particular thing when it&#039;s &quot;called in&quot; to so a particular thing.<br><br>Ok so imagine a group of people. If you measure their skulls, they will have certain range of cephalic index, probably spread along the bell curve. Living in certain stable environment, they maintain this spread because natural selection doesn&#039;t benefit either side of the curve. Now if you change the environment to benefit traits that coincide with let&#039;s say brachycephaly, brachycephalic people will have more children and the average will start shifting towards their side of the graph. The genes will also start accumulating, as in if 1/3rd of the population had some sequence A contributing to this shape of school and 2/3rd had B with only 1/6th having an overlap, this disproportionately high population growth will make this overlap more common, so it&#039;s absolutely possible for such shift to be relatively rapid and ironically enough - reversible.<br><br>The reason why brachycephalic skull shape is seen as &quot;unnatural&quot; is based on good observation but bad priors - domesticated animals tend to have more brachycephalic skulls than their wild ancestors, so clearly a brachy man is a domesticated man*. The bad prior here is that people assume that because this shift occured in some societies, this is not natural, but that&#039;s because they fundamentally don&#039;t believe humans naturally form societies and adapt them to different conditions and that&#039;s very silly.<br><br>*Mind you domesticated is not timid.

Anyone dealing with western thought in the 20th century in any serious way, even these analytic people who went out of their way to dismiss him, should just accept that Heidegger is the formative influence who started a revolution of thought in the 20th century. If you know anything about the history of thought in the 20th century, then you know Heidegger was formative. I would call it the ontological revolution. All these trends you see, everyone you know of, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Lacan, Aleksandr Dugin, Alexandre Koj\u00e9ve, Nick Land, Slavoj Zizek, postmodernists, object-oriented ontology, all that stuff comes from Heidegger. I&#039;m not a dogmatic Heideggerian, I just acknowledge Heidegger initiated some kind of revolution in thought, and I am dealing in that area. I don&#039;t agree with Heidegger&#039;s conclusions. He didn&#039;t really have any conclusions anyway.<br>Heidegger himself has elements of eastern philosophy, he rejects the notion of a subject approaching and acting upon the world from the outside. For Heidegger, human existence means already being in the world, everything already has a meaning, and a subject is only a certain form a human existence takes when this being-in-the-world breaks down. It&#039;s like with tools, their primary existence is in their use (Zuhandenheit), they only become dead objects (Vorhandenheit) when they break down.

People have an inability to cope when it comes to their history regardless of what country you are from. Americans will never accept their government&#039;s wrong doing towards natives, blacks, Spanish etc. Brits will never accept their colonial past. Russians wont take responsibility for circassian genocide, Turks wont accept Armenian genocide, so on and so forth.<br><br>In the case of Napoleon it depends on whether you are English or French, he is often wrongly glorified in France and wrongly vilified in England. The reality is a mixed picture, he wasn&#039;t much worse than the other kings of Europe. However he shook up their system of doing things in Europe. after wars, government usually made some type of two way concessions. A trade for one piece of land or another. Napoleon was very unyielding and unconceding. It doesn&#039;t help that after the 1802 treaty of Amiens the British also didn&#039;t follow up on the promises and they continued to occupy Malta. To summarize, he levied huge war reparations on his enemies and imposed crushing treaties that basically guaranteed the future &quot;rebellion&quot; of states like Prussia an Austria. He forced Tsar Alexander, who genuinely liked Napoleon, into open war due to his ability to maintain the continental blockade (a position that was impossible to explain to Russian elites and hurting Russia&#039;s economy as well as rest of Europe. Finally, he invaded Spain for no reason at all, other than the fact that the government there had some instability and infighting between royal family members. To summarize, Napoleon was very brutal and opportunistic, which doesn&#039;t make him much different than other rulers in history. Most of these politic methods he learned in Corsica ( Corsican culture had a very brutal way of maintaining political control through dominant families) and then later the French revolution.", "time": 1671062902, "resto": 14326264}, {"no": 14326922, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:20:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The standard American history class that covers the French revolutions usually just says something along the lines of &quot;yeah this guy took over the French army in Italy and curbstomped, then he fucked off the Egypt for reasons and his men shot the face off the Sphinx, then we went home and crowned himself emperor instead of the pope or bishop or whomever.&quot; <br>Then they generally don&#039;t clarify on the Napoleonic wars themselves aside from the chaos in Russia, his first exile to Elba, then his return and Waterloo.<br>Basically any nuance is lost and everything is painted with broad strokes, but that&#039;s what we get for being Burgers.<br>He&#039;s not seen as a Hitler or Stalinesque person, just an ambitious man.", "filename": "You will never be the man hugging Napoleon&#039;s leg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1574, "h": 1177, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671063619456931, "time": 1671063619, "md5": "g2D5Ru+RDj5d6cJWBA5wYw==", "fsize": 510486, "resto": 14326264}, {"no": 14327784, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14326312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14326312</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the average person </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believes Napoleon was a real person</span>", "time": 1671078248, "resto": 14326264}, {"no": 14327793, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:27:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14326264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14326264</a><br>People know Napoleon as the short guy who tried to conquer the world because he was a manlet.<br><br>That\u2019s all.", "time": 1671078467, "resto": 14326264}, {"no": 14327814, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:38:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14326493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14326493</a><br>They sure regretted that in the Great War.

Since the river was in flood, the French threw a bridge of boats across it, covered by artillery fire that prevented the Spaniards from disturbing the operation. Having established the bridge, the French made camp, preferring to postpone the advance towards Naples to the following spring. The army, too numerous to stay in the same camp, was divided and several battalions were dispersed in the surrounding villages. The Spaniards, taking advantage of the winter mists and the division of the French army, on December 28, on the advice of Bartolomeo d&#039;Alviano, threw another bridge of boats, thus seizing the unguarded and poorly defended camp. The route that followed was catastrophic for the army of Louis XII: the sentinels noticed the attack too late and the commanders, caught off guard, did not have time to organize an effective defense and so they turned to flight, pressed by the Italian and Spanish cavalrymen.[1]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bayard then, armed with sword and spear, placed himself in the middle of the bridge, challenging him alone about 300 or 400 Spanish men who, although numerous, could not even make him retreat.

The rider replied &quot;Seven feet of English ground, as he is taller than other men&quot; (implies that both Hardrada and his army will be killed and buried on English soil). Then he rode back to the Saxon host. Hardrada was impressed by the rider&#039;s boldness, and asked Tostig who he was.

The story is that this axeman cut down up to 40 Englishmen and was defeated only when an English soldier floated under the bridge in a half-barrel and thrust his spear through the planks in the bridge, mortally wounding the axeman.[16]</span>", "time": 1671072224, "resto": 14327222}, {"no": 14327522, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:45:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aviators who became an ace in one day:</span><br><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;The four Luftwaffe pilots that all made Triple Ace in a day (15+ kills over any number of sorties within a single day) - Emil Lang, Hans-Joachim Marseille, August Lambert, and Hubert Strassel.

In the West Germanic ancestor of Old English, * walhaz meant \u2018foreigner\u2019, more specifically \u2018Roman\u2019, and even more specifically \u2018person of Celtic or Romance speech\u2019. The perspective here is that of a Germanic-speaking neighbour of the Western Roman Empire, living in what<br>are now the Low Countries and Germany. To him, his Roman neighbours would be culturally and linguistically clearly distinguishable from himself, being citizens of the Roman Empire and speaking either Latin or Celtic or<br>both. On the Continent, *walhaz survived into the later West Germanic languages as a term of reference to persons and areas of Romance speech. Old High German walh \u2018person of Romance speech/origin\u2019 and Dutch Waal \u2018Walloon\u2019 testify to that meaning. Place names containing the element *walhaz denote pockets in the Germanic-speaking world where Romance was spoken (e.g. Walchensee in Bavaria, Germany, and Waalwijk in North Brabant, Netherlands). A walnut (German Walnuss , Dutch walnoot ) is etymologically a nut from France. In Old English, *walhaz developed into<br>wealh.

What about one of the biggest example of Rome still in use today: Citizenship. In the times of Heron of Alexandria (c. 10 \u2013 about 70 CE), the first fire engine was constructed. Emperor nero created the unit called Vigiles, the first use of firefighting units. The Romans brought lawmaking to perfection, they were the creators of the first comprehensive legal system, and modern legal terms come from their times. Roman numbering was used and universalized. the introduction of a leap year every 4 years, which was 1 day longer. This calendar was valid in Europe until the end of the 16th century, and in some countries even up to the 20th century. We also adopted the Latin alphabet from the Romans. The Roman legal system included a criminal court system with lawyers and juries so people accused of crimes could defend themselves. Witnesses could be called to give witness testimony. Cope as much as u want but Roman architecture is a massive intellectual achievement In architecture, new solutions and elements were introduced, such as barrel vaults and domes.<br>Therms were built, i.e. sports and recreation centres, where steam and water baths were located. There were swimming pools, bathtubs and showers. The drainage system was improved, with which sewage was carried out. Public chalets were built for the first time.<br><br>The Romans were also building excellent roads. Roman roads had a thick layer of stone pavement, providing stability and resistance to load. They were aimed to be straight lines and that is why they were often mountainous. Roman roads have been the main arteries of European transport for many centuries \u2013 even today many roads run along their routes.<br>The Romans also used war machines (Greeks as well) to win battles. The Roman army was the most efficient and effective fighting force of the time and the logistics behind that are an intellectual accomplishment.", "time": 1671075699, "resto": 14326636}, {"no": 14327701, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14327690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14327690</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they did a bunch of laws, a bunch of ornamented mudhuts and a bunch of goyslop entertainment centers.</span><br><br><br>Yeah... this is not an achievement for a empire that lasted like 1 thousand years and included over 23 countries from the modern world", "time": 1671075886, "resto": 14326636}, {"no": 14327702, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:45:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14327571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14327571</a><br>The Golden Age of Roman poetry (c. 70 BCE \u2013 14 CE) produced such memorable writers as Virgil, Horace, Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid.

The Lebor Gab\u00e1la purports to be an account of how the Gaels descend from Adam through the sons of Noah and how they came to Ireland. The idea that the Irish Gaels came from Hispania may be based on the similarity of the names Iberia and Hibernia and the names Galicia and Gael.[3] Medieval pseudo-historians made similar claims about other nations based on their names.[4] A similar story about a monk who voyaged to a marvelous island he saw from the top of the tower of Brigantia was written in the first years of the eleventh century in Galicia. The story, preserved in two 14th-century manuscripts, is known as Trezenzonii de Solistitionis Insula Magna (&quot;Trezenzonius&#039; Great Island of the Solstice&quot;).[5] His son was Bile, who was in turn the father of Milesius (also called M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine, soldier of Hispania or Spain), said to be the ancestor of the Irish people.</span><br><br>GG, germanic tribes were enemies of Celts, Caesar He intervened in Gaul using the German harassment of the Gauls as an excuse.

There are very non-schizo theories that Islam was created a century after the supposed Mohammad unified Arabia. There&#039;s nothing in record of Roman or Persian histories in the 5th century of some powerful warlord uniting Arabia like you would expect for one thing. For another, when the Arabians came to power in Persia, they never changed the coinage until decades later, the coinage still had the face of the last Shah&#039;anshah Yazdegerd III. <br><br>The idea goes that the Arabs were used as mercenaries for the Persians, much as how the various Germanic races were Federatii for the Romans. In smiliar fashion to the Germanics, the Arabs took power when they realized the Persians would be too weak to stop them after the wars with Heraclius. Further, the Shah before the Arab takeover was a Nestorian Christian, and the idea is that Islam was created as an Arabification of the Nestorian faith with their own &quot;Messiah&quot; in Mohammed. If you don&#039;t know, the first depictions recorded of Mohammed show him carrying a cross on his back, and the name Mohammad merely means &quot;chosen one&quot; similar to the name &quot;Christ&quot;. You must ask, how would one&#039;s given name be &quot;chosen one&quot;, as opposed to the leaders of other Religions like Christ, who&#039;s given name was Yeshua, or the Buddha who&#039;s given name was Siddhartha Gautama.
