What I mean by that is the overwhelming majority of major Religions and Religious institutions across Eurasia, and even a little bit of North Africa, are all influenced by the omnious &amp; mysterious Proto-Indo-European Mono-Mythology. <br>Hindu, Celtic, Druidic, Greek, Norse, Slavic/Finnic, (shit, even Shintoism a little bit) all have varying degrees of Indo-European&#039;ness in terms of tropes, concepts of good and evil, nature, pantheons, and ritual. They&#039;re obviously all &#039;different&#039;, but you hopefully get what I mean when I say they all follow very similar packages of ideas and narratives. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s coincidental. <br><br>Meanwhile Judaism has really managed to cut the fat to try and remove as much of that foreign influence as possible and remain consistent.

Many get over the difficulty of describing it by the expedient of denying it, or at least ignoring it; but the whole point of it is that it was something that was never quite eliminated even when it was ignored. They are obsessed by their evolutionary monomania that every great thing grows from a seed, or something smaller than itself. They seem to forget that every seed comes from a tree, or from something larger than itself. Now there is very good ground for guessing that religion did not originally come from some detail that was forgotten because it was too small to be traced. Much more probably it was an idea that was abandoned because it was too large to be managed. There is very good reason to suppose that many people did begin with the simple but overwhelming idea of one God who governs all; and afterwards fell away into such things as demon-worship almost as a sort of secret dissipation. Even the test of savage beliefs, of which the folk-lore students are so fond, is admittedly often found to support such a view. Some of the very rudest savages, primitive in every sense in which anthropologists use the word, the Australian aborigines for instance, are found to have a pure monotheism with a high moral tone. A missionary was preaching to a very wild tribe of polytheists, who had told him all their polytheistic tales, and telling them in return of the existence of the one good God who is a spirit and judges men by spiritual standards. And there was a sudden buzz of excitement among these stolid barbarians, as at somebody who was letting out a secret, and they cried to each other, \u2018Atahocan!

Possibly the old god stood for an old morality found irksome in more expansive moments; possibly intercourse with demons was more fashionable among the best people, as in the modern fashion of Spiritualism. Anyhow, there are any number of similar examples. They all testify to the unmistakable psychology of a thing taken for granted, as distinct from a thing talked about. There is a striking example in a tale taken down word for word from a Red Indian in California, which starts out with hearty legendary and literary relish: \u2018The sun is the father and ruler of the heavens. He is the big chief. The moon is his wife and the stars are their children\u2019; and so on through a most ingenious and complicated story, in the middle of which is a sudden parenthesis saying that sun and moon have to do something because \u2018It is ordered that way by the Great Spirit Who lives above the place of all.\u2019 That is exactly the attitude of most paganism towards God.

Chapter 1 is a general narrative of God&#039;s creating all that fills the earth, sea, and sky. It is an account that establishes God a prior to anything that can be seen by the human eye, and wholly sovereign over its disposition; He is not merely a participant. Its partially polemical intent explains the broad scope of coverage in days of creation. The narrative reaches its climax, of course, is God&#039;s creating man on the sixth day and His resting on the seventh. And everything that He made was good.<br><br>Chapter 2 picks up at this pivotal juncture, the creation of man, and narrows its focus so as to describe in detail God&#039;s purpose in making mankind in His own image. The flora described in Genesis 2 is specifically those species related to man&#039;s function as a cultivator and steward of God&#039;s bounty; the language is specific in its usage and not general, just as the passage as a whole concerns itself with God&#039;s relationship with man as opposed to the whole of Creation. Hence, to equate Chapter 2 with Chapter 1 as though they were meant to be competing accounts, rather than complementary, is a mistake at the very outset. Both Boice&#039;s commentary and Keil and Delitzsch&#039;s more scholarly tome both cover this in detail. <br><br>The appearance of &#039;contradictions&#039; is not enough to substantiate true variance or discordance within the overall text.

You now bring in Middle Platonism&#039;s interpretation of that where some element of divinity has to witness itself, and out of this the Mind of God is born, and from the Mind of God, creation.<br><br>So, if creation proceeds from God, and God is the consequence of an emanation of divinity in self-reflection, then the form of creation must have its parallel in the form of God.<br><br>On the one hand, obviously creation starts with divinity attempting to know itself. So the first necessary element of creation is the Platonic ideal, the prototype of all possible forms, which descend from higher order archetypes. This is spirit, and it&#039;s why mortal, fallen man can still posses enough &quot;spark&quot; of divinity to know and recognize the divine in order to be saved by it.<br><br>The archetype or prototype of divinity is matched with the &quot;real ideal&quot;, the final and eternal actual perfect harmony of full divinity in full variety, fully realized.<br><br>Allegorically, Sophia is the mother who yearns for a child, while the child is not born and is not known, the yearning is divine mystery which knows a thing when it doesn&#039;t exist, and thus causes it to be.<br><br>This is the great power of Sophia, and represents her proximity to the ineffably divine. It gets a vulgar parallel in the Catholic immaculate conception doctrine, which attempts to imagine mortal creation without mortal sin.<br><br>In between is the process of becoming, time and space.<br>God is One, but existence has three necessary parts, so the One is Three.", "time": 1675295117, "resto": 14561619}, {"no": 14565296, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)18:53:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14564336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14564336</a><br>With this steelman, I&#039;d HAVE to agree with Arianism in SPITE of acknowledging the trinity.<br>The nuance is that Jesus is the Son of Logos.

In fact, it would demand far more concrete evidence to demonstrate the points that you&#039;ve heretofore asserted; evidence that would irrefutably prove that the Old Testament and the Pentateuchal books are adhoc compositions. Frankly, I doubt that such definitive evidence exists. The higher critics had their heyday with JEPD hypotheses, only to have their head spin when their same methods yielded embarrassing results when applied to their own authorial works. <br><br>Your burden of proof falls upon you.", "time": 1675292360, "resto": 14564150}, {"no": 14566098, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)22:02:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14564150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14564150</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;El Shaddai</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Titty God</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Betel</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;virgin God</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elyon</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Highest God (classically)</span><br>But if you read what the actual usage of the words related to it, they all come down to childish/young/etc. So the actual meaning isn&#039;t the &quot;Highest God&quot;<br>but young/child god<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elyon</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Young God</span><br><br>Reminder, the actual Almighty God is a virgin girl in Hebrew Bible.

Barbarossa committed 153 divisions; and while not all of them were fighting every day of the operation, on any given day quite a lot of them were. German tonnage movement requirements were in the tens of thousands. Napoleon&#039;s quartermasters couldn&#039;t move anything close to that. And EVERY army of WW2 stuck to railroads whenever it could, and the ones that had to stray from them for any reason ran into problems almost immediately. Reliance on the Via Balbia made invading out of Libya and into Egypt a fucntional impossibility, and it also doomed the British to overextension and crushing defeat in the aftermath of Compass and Crusader, for all of their greater mechanization. The single biggest thing stopping the rout of German forces in France in August and September 1944 was the Transportation plan&#039;s damage to railroads that hobbled the Anglo-American forces. Soviet doctrine called for engineering units to build railroads to support advances if there weren&#039;t any nearby ones to appropriate. The Japanese offensives into China ran into immediate and remarkable difficulties once they seized the railroad networks up and down the east coast and tried to push west into far less developed territory.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Railroads only help when you&#039;re actually near them</span><br>meant that WW2 armies stayed near railroads, at least when they wanted to concentrate into meaningfully large formations.", "time": 1675226346, "resto": 14558962}, {"no": 14561243, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:52:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Communism has better morale and production bonuses.", "time": 1675227161, "resto": 14558962}, {"no": 14561285, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:11:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14560657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14560657</a><br>/k/ is definitely edgy. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;/k/ is moderate </span><br>lol<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Edgy totalitarians are now identified with Moscow and /k/ hates the Russians. </span><br>Being totalitarian =/= being edgy, liberals can be edgy when talking about killing whites and shit like that.", "time": 1675228299, "resto": 14558962}, {"no": 14561358, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:46:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14561285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14561285</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Being totalitarian =/= being edgy</span><br>I kinda feel that real totalitarians aren&#039;t edgy.

The problem is that I don&#039;t know what his worship was like, but only his mythos.<br>The most famous one says that at the beginning of time there were two beings in the world, Tup\u00e3 and Jurupari, Tup\u00e3 was &quot;a kind of saint, a moral summit, devoted to doing good, who had very few followers&quot; and Jurupari was &quot;the incarnation of the devil who dedicated himself to partying, dancing, drinking, music and pleasure, who was followed by many people&quot;. Tup\u00e3 was jealous of Juripari and on an unlucky day he decided to burn him in a bonfire, so women followers of Jurupari came to collect his ashes, but instead they found a palm tree that they felled and used to make flutes that reproduced Jurupari&#039;s voice. Women used these magic flutes at parties where they got drunk and danced erotically with men. The Sun sent Jurupari to be reborn on Earth through a virgin and he became a lawgiver very similar to Moses among the natives who transformed their matriarchal society into a patriarchal one. So only men could use Jurupari&#039;s magic flutes.<br>As I like Mesopotamian/Canaanite/Egyptian/Gre<wbr>co-Roman and Afro-Caribbean Paganism, I wanted to syncretize with that to fill this empty, but I also have the option of choosing Abrahamic Satanism because the Jesuits demonized Jurupari.

One other team in the class built upwards as fast as they could. They would go straight up from wherever they were, and if one part started to slouch or tip over they&#039;d fix that part and then go back to going straight up. Our team made sure that everything was solid; we had a good, consistent, repeatable design of cubes with cross beams. We wouldn&#039;t built the next layer unless the current layer was strong. The other team was the first to 2 feet, then the first to 3 feet, then the first to 4 feet, but at some point the fact that their entire tower was half measures meant that they couldn&#039;t add anything to the top; regardless of what they added to the top, their entire everything was too weak to just reinforce one or two parts of it. The best way for them to make progress was to throw everything away and start over from scratch. So our team was the first to 5 feet.<br><br>Von Braun&#039;s personal mission was to colonize Mars; the official mission of the US space program was to land a manned mission on the Moon. The mission of the Soviet space program was to beat the US space program at everything.<br><br>The US had smaller (in terms of size and weight) nukes than the Soviet Union did. This meant that the US ICBMs were much smaller than Soviet ICBMs. When it came to converting ICBMs into space science vessels, the Soviet Union were already a step ahead. The R-7 was an enormous ICBM. So Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin, etc were all launched on R-7s.<br><br>The US knew they&#039;d need a large crew and some sort of orbital rendezvous to make a moon landing work. So they built the larger Gemini mission that could support two people. 1/2", "filename": "main-qimg-4ef78eee416cf8e47c1bd41c875a265d-lq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 602, "h": 1680, "tn_w": 44, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675287062371585, "time": 1675287062, "md5": "st12A0F8eLfhQ1cspbVvFw==", "fsize": 161513, "resto": 14560797}, {"no": 14564501, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:32:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14564497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14564497</a><br>The Soviet Union wanted to beat the US to a multiple crewed mission, so they took their single person R-7, removed a bunch of stuff (including some essential life support systems) and put another person in it. The USSR did beat the US to that milestone. The US mission was a stepping stone but not a milestone; the Soviet mission was a milestone but not a stepping stone.<br><br>The US had to learn how to rendezvous two spacecraft in order to make the moon mission work. So they set out to start doing that. The Soviet Union wanted to beat them, so they launched one R-7 to orbit, waited for the orbit to line up with the ground station, and launched another R-7 into an identical orbit. They were able to get within 3 miles of each other, at which points their orbits diverged; bada bing, bada boom, rendezvous! US beaten. But the US needed to actually connect them together. Remember the larger Gemini capsules? It also had substantially more fuel for maneuvering. So Gemini 6 and 7 were able to maneuver to within a few feet of each other and stay there for 20 minutes. Gemini 8 had the docking adapter and was able to actually connect to another spacecraft.<br><br>The US knew they&#039;d need an absolute monster of a rocket to land on the moon, so they started designing the F-1 engine in 1957 and the Saturn V in 1962. The engine and the rocket were absolute fucking monsters, totally in excess of the needs of the time. The US hadn&#039;t even launched a thing into orbit in 1957 when the F-1 first hit the drawing board. The Soviets didn&#039;t see the need for a rocket that big; there was no milestone for &#039;big rocket&#039; to beat the Americans to, and the R-7 was fine, so they didn&#039;t build one.<br><br>By 1965, it was clear that the next milestone after rendezvous was the moon, so focus turned to that. The US was already almost done building the Saturn V.

For the true statement of the case is rather as follows. The things of which we have direct consciousness are mere phenomena, not for us only, but in their own nature; and the true and proper case of these things, finite as they are, is to have their existence founded not in themselves but in the universal divine Idea. This view of things, it is true, is as idealist as Kant\u2019s; but in contradistinction to the subjective idealism of the Critical philosophy should be termed absolute idealism. Absolute idealism, however, though it is far in advance of vulgar realism, is by no means merely restricted to philosophy.

In some of the slides shown to subjects, the model was clothed; in others, he or she was nude. The slides were accompanied by audio recordings. The recordings paired with the nude models described an imaginary sexual interaction between the model and the subject. The recordings paired with the pictures of clothed models described the model engaging in neutral activities (e.g., swimming). To measure sexual arousal, changes in the subjects&#039; penis volume were monitored while they watched the slides and listened to the audiotapes.

Natives feared that their dead would linger about the village, inflicting disease and misfortune unless appeased with loud and expressive mourning. To draw the bereaved out of their agony and to encourage dead spirits to proceed to their afterlife, neighbors staged condolence rituals with feasts and presents. The best present of all was a war captive meant to replace the dead.<br>To appease grief, to restore power, and to build their own status, Iroquois warriors conducted &quot;mourning wars&quot; in which they sought prisoners from their enemies. The chiefs distributed the prisoners to grieving matrilineages, whose elder women decided their fate: Adoption or death. The matrons usually adopted women and children, who were more readily assimilated. Captive men more often faced death by torture, especially if they had received some crippling wound. Inflicting death as slowly and painfully as possible, the Iroquois tied their victim to a stake, and villagers of both genders and all ages took turns wielding knives, torches, and red-hot pokers systematically to torment and burn him to death. The ceremony was a contest between the skills of the torturers and the stoic endurance of the victim, who manifested his own power, and that of his people, by insulting his captors and boasting of his accomplishments in war. After the victim died, the women butchered his remains, cast them into cooking kettles, and served the stew to the entire village, so that all could be bound together in absorbing the captive&#039;s power. By practicing ceremonial torture and cannibalism, the Iroquois promoted group cohesion, hardened their adolescent boys for the cruelties of war, and dramatized their contempt for outsiders.&quot;<br>What the fuck why does no one talk about this", "time": 1675305408, "resto": 14565858}, {"no": 14566702, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)00:42:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "protip: most book about AMERICAN ie USA colonies concern themselves with the New England &amp; Chesapeake areas only as that&#039;s where Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston would all happen<br><br>books about mexico&#039;s colonization is either short/brief about spain being retarded (it was) or is a big long epic about the catholic church written by the clergy to justify their existence<br><br>Canadian colonial history is cringe just like all of Canada, and French Canada is very upset that they have to be apart of Canada and is being colonized by anglos right now", "time": 1675316551, "resto": 14565858}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14564485, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:29:21", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Would Germany have won WW1 if America didn&#039;t get involved?", "com": "Let&#039;s be honest.

Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ\u2019s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort\u2014opposed as they are to our religion\u2014shall not be hung up in any church of Christ.

Regarding the early patristic evidence, we should take several things into account:<br><br>a.) They have an overarching concern with distinguishing Christians from pagans, which ceased to apply after several centuries. The early total condemnations of images have to be reconciled with slightly later fathers such as Gregory the Great who advocate for at least a didactic use of images.<br><br>b.) In some of the condemnatory texts, such as Epiphanius, Eusebius, Origen, we find an appeal to common practice, that images are forbidden and disallowed by all Christians. From the archaeological evidence we can tell this is not true. We have the catacomb paintings, the house church at Dura-Europos, etc. Some of these figure were well-traveled and well-educated so why would they make this claim? The situation ends up being rather strange on account of this.<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1675286450, "resto": 14552991}, {"no": 14564459, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:21:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14564453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14564453</a><br>(cont.)<br>2. On account of point 1., I would argue that the use of images thus falls into a category we can label as &quot;unclear&quot; or &quot;disputed.&quot; To elaborate,<br><br>a.) We can make a comparison to the canon of scripture. The status of the deuterocanonical books was not settled by any patristic consensus, and we can find fathers who disallow them from the canon, or from the canon proper (as a rule of faith). The matter was left to lie until being definitively settled at Trent due to the provocation of the Reformation.<br><br>b.) I say &quot;unclear&quot; because the creation of images of Christ and the saints, which we know did occur at early dates, is an act of veneration in itself. We paint or sculpt those whom we wish to honor, and we can remember them through reference to their image. And an image of someone is understood in some sense as being representative of their person. Unless motivated by iconoclastic destruction or some unique motive, one would understand the destruction of an image as an act of disrespect to the one depicted, for example. It is but one step from here to understand an act of homage paid to an image to indicate that one honors the prototype.<br><br>(2/3 -- will need one more post, apologies)", "time": 1675286510, "resto": 14552991}, {"no": 14564464, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:22:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14564459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14564459</a><br>(cont.)<br>c.) I would thus say that the veneration of icons, at least in the sense that Nicaea II has been received by the Latin Church, is incipient within the creation of images of Christ and the saints. As the concept is incipient, it can thus be a legitimate place of development rather than reversal of course. And the early objectors can be understood contextually, or ignored in their erroneous statements, as the matter was forced to be clarified due to the provocation of iconoclasm. This incipient element also allows the acceptance of Nicaea II&#039;s claim of the ancient veracity of the practice, and that it is not a novelty.<br><br>d.) No such thing can be said for homosexuality, which has a fully developed teaching against it, accepted clearly and universally through the history of the church, which rules out any form of the practice; any development can only occur from what is incipient within it, and thus any &quot;development&quot; into acceptance of the practice could only signify contradiction.<br><br>(3/3)", "time": 1675286571, "resto": 14552991}, {"no": 14564467, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:23:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14564242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14564242</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t know how you can make a move such as</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The early church did not venerate icons and condemned it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and condemned it</span><br><br>I disagree with the latter half of your premise.<br><br>There was no consensus in the early Church respecting the condemnation of the veneration of icons, and much of the supposed evidence advanced in support of that thesis does not make out the case, as explained here <a href=\"#p14559196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559196</a>.<br><br>As for the first half of your premise - &quot;The early church did not venerate icons&quot; - nor is that clear.

Their apologies against paganism ironically refute Catholics and Orthodox regularly on images, even often showing the insight that images are not themselves \u2018gods\u2019, but merely a means of worshiping said gods. You\u2019re right to point out that in practice it is indistinguishable in these churches today from Hinduism. I imagine in India in some places on one side of the street they\u2019ll be worshiping images of Kali and on the other side, the Catholics will be praying to \u2018the Queen of Heaven\u2019 and her statues in almost identical forms. Degenerating from the pure apostolic Christianity into debased idolatry lessens the true separation of Christianity from these false religions, but sadly the temptation is always there, and man wants to set up idols and intercessors and pantheons, slicing up God\u2019s sovereignty into little fiefdoms of saints and pushing God into the background. I even recently spoke with a Catholic IRL who said he doesn\u2019t \u2018bother\u2019 God with many requests and just goes to the saints instead. I was shocked.

The moral law applies to individuals, for example &quot;thou shalt not kill,&quot; &quot;honor thy father and mother,&quot; and &quot;thou shalt not covet&quot; from the Ten Commandments are examples of these.<br><br>The civil law are laws that have certain defined penalties attached. So the part of the law where penalties such as stoning or some other penalty are applied are the &quot;civil law.&quot; For instance, the death penalty for being a sodomite, and forcing a man who fornicates with a woman to marry, would be examples of this.<br><br>Sometimes the two are intertwined, for instance the part in Leviticus that says, &quot;Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.&quot; This statement is part of the moral law. But the part where it prescribes the punishment for this, saying they shall be stoned, is the civil law. So basically the moral law is something you are expected to follow individually, and the civil law is the part that the government should enforce, such as executing sodomites and the like. The purpose of the moral/civil division is pretty obvious, because you don&#039;t just go around accusing someone of a crime and then appoint yourself as the judge, jury and executioner. That part has to be enforced by a righteous government. Neither the moral law nor the civil law are changed by the New Testament, only the ceremonial law is handled differently (not technically abolished), since Christ Himself fulfills that now (c.f. Col. 2:16-17), ever since He lived a perfect life in accordance with the entire Law and didn&#039;t break a single rule even once, thereby fulfilling it.", "filename": "1661488424687854", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 168, "h": 250, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675297033806058, "time": 1675297033, "md5": "Oyw0YZdkeH/xgYJxw1nRVA==", "fsize": 4779, "resto": 14560442}, {"no": 14565494, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)19:30:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14563579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14563579</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s fat that is made as an offering to God.</span><br>But it&#039;s not just from the animals that are actually being sacrificed to God, it&#039;s all the fat from any of those animals, even those that died in the wild.
