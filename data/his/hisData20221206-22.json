Nearly all crimes are handled by the states. The portfolio of what the federal government can legislate on is limited by article 1 of the constitution, and so is mostly related to interstate financial crimes, crimes directly against the us government, and other interstate crimes like smuggling. But the federal criminal docket is quite small compared to that of the states.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How did America end up with a legal system with this quirk</span><br>It&#039;s called federalism, and it&#039;s something we&#039;ve had since our founding. In 1789 when our constitution was ratified, each state already had well developed judiciaries, with their own laws and traditions that differed from one another, sometimes quite significantly. So partly not wanting to change that, and partly out of a desire to avoid making the federal government too powerful, it was decided to create a two tiered court system with separate state and federal courts. In 1868, right after the civil war, the constitution was changed so that something called the due process clause applied to the states. Essentially this gave the federal government more power to declare state laws or court decisions unconstitutional, and we have something called the supremacy clause, which means when a federal and state law say opposite things about the same issue, the federal law will control.

That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon.

There are some reports that Hitler became a member by this or that fashion, but if he was a member, he never attended any of the meetings. His apparent non-presence also doesn&#039;t jive with the idea that this was a group he was really tried to get into, although knowing Hitler&#039;s autism he could have been so offended by rejection that he would work hard to get in only to never show up once he did, as a slight against the Thule Society for their original rejection, but again there is no evidence for this. Months after Hitler joined the DAP, he signed the death sentence of the Thule Society by forcing out Karl Harrer from the DAP. But again, there is no reason to believe this was motivated by being rejected from the Thule Society, and the more obvious explanation is that this is Hitler making a cynical power play like he always did.<br><br>I&#039;m not even sure why you want to bring this up again - it&#039;s not like an occult society consisting of 2,000 members at its peak is the arbiter of who is working class.

And of course, the spike in the 20th century due to industrialization and Tetraethyl lead.<br><br>20th century Americans had 1000 times more lead in their bones than their ancestors. Studies of baby teeth have revealed that even Lead exposure well below the level considered safe resulted in delayed learning, decreased IQ and increased behavioural problems. And there&#039;s a broad consensus on the part of everybody except the lead industry and its spokesmen that lead is extremely toxic at extremely low doses. Follow up studies showed that those with higher levels of lead in their baby teeth were many times more likely to fail out of high school.<br><br>Globally, lead is believed to be responsible for nearly two thirds of all unexplained intellectual disability. According to a study published in 2022, more than half of the current US population, that&#039;s 170 million people were exposed to high levels of lead in early childhood. Those born between 1951 and 1980, are disproportionately affected. In aggregate lead caused a loss of more than 800 million IQ points. The world is less intelligent today because of leaded gasoline.

In these forms of communication there is usually a whole array of doctrines, ranging from the lowest level, what is merely the pope\u2019s opinions [1], to the highest level, which is solemn magisterium. In the encyclical Casti Connubii Pius XI spoke mostly about exhortations to virtue in married life. But when it came to artificial birth control, he made a solemn statement, condemning the practice.

Soon after, Layla was forcibly married to another noble and rich merchant belonging to the Thaqif tribe in Ta&#039;if.

People still used horses to get around, cavalry was still important in warfare, soldiers still fought by lining up in columns, marching forward in brightly coloured uniforms and firing single-shot weapons at each other.<br><br>It made me wonder, did people in the 1920s feel more distant from the 1860s than we do from the 1960s?

Robert Croskey, recently discharged from the Army, and Retious Phifer, were charged with assaults on white women. When word went out that a lynch mob was forming, a civilian got on the phone with Governor Thomas Kilby, who ordered the prisoners transfered to Wetumpka State Prison for safekeeping.

Divide &quot;Eastern Roman Empire&quot; from &quot;Byzantine&quot; Its the Arab Conquests. It was a rapid and near total replacement of damn near everything. Religion, Ethnicity, Territory, Population, Culture, How the government worked, How the military worked, How the people saw themselves, etc. and was also apparent enough in its own time that we start seeing that other states start claiming they are Roman successor states and getting away with it. The switch from Republic to Principate pales in comparison. <br>When I say religion I don&#039;t mean Pagan to Christian. Before the Arabs you had a polity of which huge chunks, maybe even half, were monophysites. And that tension will inform almost every action the State makes if your basis of legitimacy is being the one true empire of the one true religion. Ethnically it turned an Empire that was multinational into something that was essentially Anatolian. And before you point out say the Macedonian Dynasty, no the Severans not being full blooded Romans did not make the Principate no longer Roman either. Culturally and governmentally it did indeed mean massive changes. The loss of the other big urban centers like Antioch and Alexandria made Constantinople part of a Unipolar system. Even during the height of the Principate Rome (the city) could not have dreamed of being so central. And them not being strong enough to do anything about guys like the HRE is part of my point. I&#039;d say an Empire that loses any real ability to maintain exclusive claim to being the sole legitimate successor state isn&#039;t the same state. The very fact the Charlemagne could make that claim in a chunk of imperial territory just as large as the east and get a critical mass of people to say &quot;Yeah sure you&#039;re the Emperor&quot; is itself damning.", "time": 1670366644, "resto": 14288818}, {"no": 14290473, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)17:46:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying the Greek Empire (byzantium) was Roman</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying the fucking Turk empire was Roman</span><br>Yikes at this thread", "time": 1670366767, "resto": 14288818}, {"no": 14290492, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)17:52:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14290412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14290412</a><br>It&#039;s like if you travelled back in time to 1st century Germany as a modern German and were like &quot;ah yes, my ancestors&quot;.

These people experienced luxuries like electricity, tractors, increase of agricultural production and food surplus that didn&#039;t exist under the Tsars and previous regimes.", "filename": "stalin2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 258, "h": 195, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1670361698152689, "time": 1670361698, "md5": "GzpTJJACbHBARsGO1/xiqw==", "fsize": 13712, "resto": 14290133}, {"no": 14290170, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:23:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDf<wbr>UyFXLXWw", "time": 1670361804, "resto": 14290133}, {"no": 14290210, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:32:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5i<wbr>9k7s9X_A", "time": 1670362369, "resto": 14290133}], "last_modified": 1670362369}, {"no": 14290153, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:20:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Warren your losing your memory.", "filename": "th.jpeg-13", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 355, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1670361649514456, "time": 1670361649, "md5": "CMuMf7bxFcjX8RaXaPMdjw==", "fsize": 22565, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "warren-your-losing-your-memory", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1670361649}, {"no": 14290107, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:09:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "cavalry speed", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cCavalry is useful before, during, and after the battle.\u201d </span><br>The uses of cavalry were threefold: reconnaissance and screening during the advance to battle, shock and mobility in combat, and exploitation and punishment against a defeated enemy.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWithout cavalry, battles are without result.\u201d</span><br>Most importantly, as he understood it, cavalry was the arm that allowed for decisive victory, because it was the cavalry that would run down and exploit a compromised enemy army.

The Corps System: The organization of Napoleon\u2019s army into self-sufficient combined arms corps allowed the army to disperse and travel on independent lines of advance. This made the army both faster, by distributing it on many different roads, and more ambiguous by disguising its intentions.<br><br>2. The Officers: By dispersing his corps, Napoleon also by definition dispersed his command system. [...] This was a monumental step towards a recognizably modern command and control system and professional officer corps. At the apex of this system were Napoleon\u2019s famed Marshals.<br><br>3. The roads and towns of Europe: The Grande Armee was able to move at great speed thanks to the density of the roads and settlements throughout Europe. The road system allowed for not only the rapid travel of the main bodies of men, but also communication between the dispersed units via messengers on horseback. Furthermore, the population density allowed the army to move without supply chains by requisitioning food from local civilians as they passed through. <br><br>-<br><br>How does this apply to 5th-gen warfare?", "filename": "napoleon-skirmishers", "ext": ".png", "w": 1209, "h": 887, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 183, "tim": 1670360947415581, "time": 1670360947, "md5": "e/h5QIrME2mB4+vvUBIRRg==", "fsize": 106312, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cavalry-speed", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1670360947}, {"no": 14290066, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:02:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are East Asians and Africans admixed with Erectus?<br><br>Are the only real Adamic lineages Europeans and MENA?", "filename": "pep", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 799, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 199, "tim": 1670360537372698, "time": 1670360537, "md5": "rIDiscobM7SShr58CuUeNQ==", "fsize": 96056, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "are-east-asians-and-africans-admixed-with-erectus", "replies": 3, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 14290072, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:03:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14290066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14290066</a><br>Adamic?<br>It is make believe.", "time": 1670360615, "resto": 14290066}, {"no": 14290093, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:06:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Adam might have been white, but Ham confuses and complicates the matter.

Most of the neopagan discourse you see on stuff like this tends to lean towards the interpretation that Judeo-Christian monotheism was a threat to the rest of humanity because it sought to deprive them of their gods in pushing the supremacy of the One True God. One strain of the neopagans hate Christianity etc. basically for this reason, because it preaches extreme religious intolerance and proselytizing compared to the perennialist view of the pagans i.e. &quot;They identified Zeus with Jupiter, The semitic God Baal with Saturn, and the Celtic Mapon with Apollo.&quot; <br><br>With that said, I don&#039;t really think it&#039;s easy to argue that Greco-Roman civilizations were really progressive because they did still have chattel slavery (even though I forgot about the stoic opposition) whereas chattel slavery of co-religionists was more or less slowly undermined by Christians in Europe since the end of Rome. Maybe if Christianity had never come, the stoics would have outlawed it? I don&#039;t know. What we see in history though is that slavery was legally exterminated by Christians who were outraged that for example Southern African-Americans had been Christianized and yet they were still held in bondage.
