I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s anyone out there that denies the existence of that. I breathe right now because my biological impulses compel me to do so. You would say that my purpose for breathing is those same biological impulses. I don&#039;t think anyone has any objection to that statement. The fundamental difference in that scenario would be how we interpret &quot;life has no meaning&quot;. If you boil purpose and meaning down to &quot;you have an onus to do something&quot; then you&#039;re absolutely correct in saying anyone continuing to breathe has it. Anything denying that is absolutely insane because it&#039;s demonstrable by anyone doing anything ever. But no one is denying that in the first place.<br>To elaborate on my point about a relativistic view on purpose and meaning (ex: we create our own &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;meaning&quot;) being pragmatically identical to nihilism - compare it to an &quot;objective&quot; purpose or meaning.<br>Objective meaning:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You/everyone HAS a purpose or meaning that you are supposed to fulfill </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You ought to alter your behavior to fit it</span><br>Relativistic meaning:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You/everyone creates their own &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;reason for living&quot; based on their own desires</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does not necessarily need to alter behavior to achieve purpose/meaning, can simply decide on a different one</span><br>Nihilism:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does not believe in objective meaning and rejects the idea that they need a personal meaning</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does not need to alter behavior</span>", "time": 1669001411, "resto": 14218370}, {"no": 14218984, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)22:31:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14218418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14218418</a><br>Aye cunt fuckin hate them fuckin champagne socialists<br>cunts get boolet simple as", "time": 1669001506, "resto": 14218370}], "last_modified": 1669001506}, {"no": 14218827, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:27:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Macedonian Empire = R Macedonian aristocracy ruling over Jtrash (Greeks, Persians, etc.)", "filename": "J2-Y-DNA-Haplogroup-Map-J2-M172-Map-J2-Haplogrubu-Haritasi-v3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 648, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 135, "tim": 1668997678673468, "time": 1668997678, "md5": "9X1bcV3i/PcCx9mwagiEtg==", "fsize": 504878, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "macedonian-empire-r-macedonian-aristocracy-ruling", "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 14218870, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:49:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14218827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14218827</a><br>R1a or R1b?", "time": 1668998952, "resto": 14218827}, {"no": 14218960, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)22:19:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14218870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14218870</a><br>R1A", "time": 1669000769, "resto": 14218827}, {"no": 14218966, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)22:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14218960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14218960</a><br>Based.

I can give Tooze credit for tying a link for laying a link between foreing currency reserves running out and taking Austria and Sudetenland which is quite interesting. once again however he ignores Germany intentionally lowerd exports (thus having less forgein currency) in an attempt to appease and befriend Britain. This was because Hitler though that if they exported a lot England would see them as an economic threat and thus be more antagonistic.

Virtually none were left by the time the Red Army liberated Lviv in July 1944.

The Jewish community of Strasbourg was marched out to the town square, stripped naked, and robbed of any money or valuables they were carrying. A handful converted to Christianity and were spared from execution. Some of the more attractive Jewish women as well as a number of children were spared from burning and involuntarily baptized. It is recorded that at least one woman was saved from the flames by a wealthy citizen of Strasbourg, baptized, and sent to a convent in the Rhine River Valley where he provided her a stipend to live on. It may also be that many of the victims were hanged or beheaded to spare them the agony of roasting alive. Although contemporary accounts speak of 2,000 Jews burned, this may be an exaggeration as it is not believed that the Jewish population of Strasbourg at this time was greater than 300.[9]</span>", "filename": "dsc6545", "ext": ".png", "w": 681, "h": 585, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 107, "tim": 1668998801285179, "time": 1668998801, "md5": "8pxXx2R1zHMsUepdEV9kWQ==", "fsize": 437011, "resto": 14218304}, {"no": 14218875, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:53:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14218867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14218867</a><br>so basically Jews were selling goyim their leftover scrap meat because fuck you, goyim and people be pissed, right?", "time": 1668999197, "resto": 14218304}, {"no": 14218886, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:57:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14218867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14218867</a><br>Why are people such retarded coomers?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ok you&#039;re a 9/10 qt with huge Khazar milkies we&#039;ll let you live</span>", "time": 1668999422, "resto": 14218304}, {"no": 14218948, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)22:16:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14218867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14218867</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews get massacred for not being stingy ENOUGH</span><br>and then anti-semite niggers be like &#039;so you just think they were kicked out and killed for no reason huh&#039;?", "time": 1669000610, "resto": 14218304}], "last_modified": 1669000610}, {"no": 14218701, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)20:43:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why did he run for a 4th time if he knew he was dying?

Georgia (1972) the Supreme Court ordered states to suspend the use of capital punishment until sentencing guidelines were improved upon. The case originated when a mentally disturbed black man named William Furman committed a home invasion in Savannah, Georgia in 1967. Although his intent had merely been to rob, he accidentally shot the owner of the home while fleeing, resulting in his death. Furman was charged with 1st degree murder and sentenced to death after a one day trial.<br><br>The Court consolidated Furman with two other cases, Jackson v. Georgia and Branch v. Texas, and in a contentious ruling voted 5-4 that capital punishment as currently used by the states infringed on the 8th and 14th Amendments. No proper opinion was written concerning the case, merely a one paragraph summary about the death penalty&#039;s non-constitutionality. Justices Douglas, Stewart, and Brennan wrote that death penalty statutes were applied &quot;arbitrarily&quot; and often showed a strong racial bias against black men, particularly in the South. Such deliberate racial bias would violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, Stewart wrote that racial bias in sentencing could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead he argued that the arbitrary use of capital punishment was injust and immoral.<br><br>Justices Brennan and Marshall believed capital punishment was a vestige of a ruder time and did not belong in the more enlightened modern age.
