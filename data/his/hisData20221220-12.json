This is why when the Bishop is ordained, he is ordained under the Gospel. As the Fathers say, this means that the people shall obey the Bishop on one condition \u2013 that the Bishop obey the Gospel. But when the Bishop does not obey the Gospel and does not do according to the Holy Canons, then the clergy and the people are not obliged to obey the Bishop. In the event of a dilemma because of a contradiction between the Gospel and the bishop\u2019s teaching, \u2018we must obey God rather than human beings!\u2019 (Acts 5:29) And then heroic clergymen and monks, even ordinary lay people\u2026 then every clergyman and lay person has the right and the obligation to say those things which the Bishops dare not say either because of cowardice, or a worldly spirit, or misapprehension. Whenever the pulpits were silent, simple and humble monks and people, men and women, supported Orthodoxy... Therefore, each clergyman is not a slave of his hierarch, but is only obligated to obey his Bishop when that Bishop is a contender in the holy struggle.\u201d</span><br>\u2014 St. Paisios", "filename": "FEF61251-D6DB-4E3F-B3EF-34F734896739", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1064, "h": 1412, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671505864421255, "time": 1671505864, "md5": "Ep7LIYkKcCNF7iBh/wEUcw==", "fsize": 234157, "resto": 14339590}, {"no": 14350839, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350771</a><br>(1) Stalin doesn\u2019t even have a halo in that image, so he isn\u2019t a saint, (2) the ROC doesn\u2019t say Stalin is a saint or publicly venerate him, (3) just because someone makes an icon doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s officially sanctioned by the Church or even representative of it", "time": 1671506727, "resto": 14339590}, {"no": 14351004, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:33:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350671</a><br>I&#039;m confused about how God is so great, and being pious should save you, yet it was so easy for Muslims to smash them and convert them.

But capitalism constantly creates large amounts of inequality, and ever since it has become globalized, it has created inequality on a global scale, so this forces defenders of capitalism to assume entire nations are meritless. How can entire nations of people have no merit? Naturally, this leads them into believing things like white supremacy. There&#039;s a reason why racism, chauvinism and Eurocentric are closely related with right-wing economic views.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Defining the superiority of a nation according to biological or ethnic characteristics is the practice of reactionary, bourgeois ethnology. Arguing that national characteristics are defined by racial characteristics, bourgeois ethnologists classify people according to skin colours, namely white people as a \u201chigher race\u201d and coloured people as a \u201clower race\u201d. They say that only a \u201chigher race\u201d can create advanced civilization. The reactionary ethnological doctrine has been used by imperialists as an ideological instrument for their policy of racial discrimination and obliteration of nations. Imperialists still use the bourgeois ethnological doctrine as an instrument to justify their domination over other nations, to spread national nihilism, the idea of subservience to great powers and the idea of dependence on foreign forces among the people of colonial, dependent countries and the people of the third world, and to obstruct their national independence and independent development.</span><br>-- Kim Jong Il", "filename": "FFOvd_QUUAIsCIa", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 954, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671532056871355, "time": 1671532056, "md5": "yOckLQdajeaLCOSMTrGv/w==", "fsize": 142766, "resto": 14351537}, {"no": 14351802, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:10:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14351561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14351561</a><br>This, he is the faggot that if not created championed all the globohomo shit we see today like no religion, no culture, no nationality, and no ethnicities", "time": 1671534620, "resto": 14351537}, {"no": 14351827, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:21:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14351802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14351802</a><br>Marx was critical of religion because he believed it was a cope for living in shitty conditions, and people coping too much with their poor conditions might not actually try to fix it or improve anything. Religious people can often believe their suffering is acceptable because they&#039;ll be rewarded in the afterlife. That\u2019s why Marx compared religion to opium, because drug addicts usually are just people trying to cope with their extreme poverty and low living standards, but it also has the effect of causing them to remain in extreme poverty and not do much of anything to fight it, because all the suffering will go away when you die and go to live in a magic paradise.<br><br>Of course, this doesn&#039;t describe all religious people or &quot;religion = bad,&quot; since it&#039;s religion is a broad thing and not all of them even believe in that.

It was the most horrible task and the most awful assignment that any organization could receive: the solution of the Jewish question. I want to say a few words on the matter to this group with complete candor. It&#039;s good that we had the hardness to exterminate the Jews in our territory. Don&#039;t ask yourselves how difficult it would have been to carry out such an order, even though, as soldiers, I might say you would understand. But thinking critically as German soldiers, you can see that the order was essential. Because we wouldn&#039;t have been able to withstand the aerial bombing if we had had the Jews in our cities. I am also convinced we would not have been able to hold the Lemberg front of the Generalgouvernement if the big ghettos in Lemberg, Krakau, Lublin, and Warsaw had still been there. We cleaned out the last one, the big ghetto in Warsaw, in summer 1943. In Warsaw there were 500,000 Jews. I tell you this number confidentially. It took us five weeks of street fighting. Just the same, I want to answer a little question that surely you must have. The question is, of course you had to kill the adult Jews, I understand that, but how could you do the same to the women and children? So I have to tell you something: The children will be grown one day. Do we want to be so improper that we say, no, no, we&#039;re too weak to kill children. Our children can deal with them. Our children will fight that one out. But the Jewish hate, small today, will be big tomorrow, and the grown avengers will attack our children and grandchildren, who will then have to deal with them. I am convinced that this will be the case even if Adolf Hitler does not survive. No, we cannot shirk our responsibility to kill all the Jews.

When one pulls out a tooth, one does it with a single tug, and the pain quickly goes away. The Jew must clear out of Europe. Otherwise no understanding will be possible between Europeans. It&#039;s the Jew who prevents everything. When I think about it, I realise that I&#039;m extraordinarily humane. At the time of the rule of the Popes, the Jews were mistreated in Rome. Until 1830, eight Jews mounted on donkeys were led once a year through the streets of Rome. For my part, I restrict myself to telling them they must go away. If they break their pipes on the journey, I can&#039;t do anything about it. But if they refuse to go voluntarily, I see no other solution but extermination. Why should I look at a Jew through other eyes than if he were a Russian prisoner-of-war? In the p.o.w. camps, many are dying. It&#039;s not my fault. I didn&#039;t want either the war or the p.o.w. camps.

Now for the first time they will not bleed other people to death, but for the first time the old Jewish law of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, will be applied. And \u2013 world Jewry may as well know this \u2013 the further these battles [of the war] spread, the more anti-Semitism will spread. It will find nourishment in every prison camp and in every family when it discovers the ultimate reason for the sacrifices it has to make.

Estimated some 500,000 Jews left Germany for Palestine during the 30s. There&#039;s also a reason it&#039;s called &quot;Final Solution&quot;, in that it was really the last resort. There were plans to deport Jews to Palestine or Madagascar after the final victory for instance. My own perspective is that Hitler was too preoccupied with what was going on in the war itself to know or care about what was going on in the camps, he did leave all that to his Armaments Minister Speer. Speer himself likely didn&#039;t understand how bad the conditions of the camps reached by 1944, as the camps were administered under the SS led by Himmler. Himmler himself was not only administering the camps, but also administering various Reichsprotektorates, the military administration of the east, and the Waffen-SS which fought on the front lines. As for the camps themselves, they were administered by various SS leaders including Reinhard Heydrich. The Holocaust, broadly defined as just targeting Jews in general, began with foreign volunteer SS divisions who were used as an occupation force, such as Romanian SS, generally annihilating Jewish settlements in the east. More narrowly defined as extermination within the camps themselves, there is not much evidence for some centrally planned operation. In my view the Holocaust was a decentralized operation carried out by many different actors. If Hitler had any knowledge of it, it would be something similar to how the StG-43 was created, where he wasn&#039;t really thinking about it. His &quot;signing off&quot; could be as simple as Himmler telling him &quot;we&#039;re going to start killing the Jews&quot; and Hitler saying &quot;yes it&#039;s ok&quot; and then going on with war business.

The British army and Allied Commission in Austria supplied him with documents. By January 1947, however, Benedikt came under suspicion and by July 1947 was implicated in illegal immigration. British intelligence paid too much attention to the anti-Zionism of religious Jews, and misunderstood the force of the human problem in DP camps.

The emancipation of the peasants in Georgia, his native land, took place in 1865, only fourteen years before his birth. The customs and habits of the environment in which he grew up bore deep and still fresh imprints of serfdom. This is certainly one of the clues to his character. Remember that in this country serfdom had virtually withered away by the end of the fourteenth century. By British standards, Stalin ought to be regarded as a man in whom the fourteenth and the twentieth centuries have met, socially, politically and psychologically. In this respect he has, more than any other Russian leader, been representative of the social outlook of Russia, in which the two centuries did coexist side by side until recently. This was certainly one of the chief reasons why he was so successful in the struggle against so many rivals and also why his deeds so often appear to us to be so incomprehensible.</span>", "time": 1671535978, "resto": 14351563}, {"no": 14351872, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:34:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14351866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14351866</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He spent his formative years, from fifteen to twenty, at the theological seminary of Tiflis, as a student of divinity. Long after he had become a confirmed atheist, the theological influence on his mind was still overwhelming. It still is. It was that influence that in a sense predestined him to introduce the dogmatic, quasi-theological element into socialism. While he was studying divinity he became a revolutionary. I have been lucky to come across a complete dossier of the Tsarist political police, describing the political atmosphere in that seminary over a good many years. The dossier was published by the Transcaucasian Communist University in 1930; but it has remained almost unknown. It contains a full confidential report on a political revolt of the students of the seminary which took place just before Stalin\u2019s entry. The students staged a strike, demanding that they be taught Georgian literature \u2013 this was a Georgian challenge to the Russian authorities \u2013 and that several unpopular tutors be removed from the seminary. Teaching was suspended, police occupied the students\u2019 living quarters and the lecture halls. Eighty-seven undergraduates were expelled from the seminary altogether. Among the organisers of the demonstration was a certain Mikhail Tskhakaya who later became a friend of Lenin and a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee. The seminary was famous for the rebellious mood of its pupils, which at first expressed itself in Georgian patriotism, directed against the Russians, and then simply in socialism. I found in the reports of General Yankovsky, the head of the police at Tiflis, a most valuable glimpse of a spiritual ferment which could not but affect the young Stalin.</span>", "filename": "s1200", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 689, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1671536042972238, "time": 1671536042, "md5": "GtvB19qxIS7cZhsAbEWrCg==", "fsize": 1654970, "resto": 14351563}, {"no": 14351876, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:35:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14351872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14351872</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some of you may perhaps ask for the political moral of my book.

Celtic and Germanic romanticism spread among the plebs while our upper class WASPs were rubbing elbows with British Imperialists. Theodore Roosevelt mentions this anti-English and anti-imperialist sentiment being wide spread among the plebs in reference to the Boer War. Roosevelt himself initially sympathized with his fellow Dutchmen in South Africa, but he soon realized he was more culturally similar to the Briton than he was the Afrikaner. Most plebs never have a chance to come to this realization for some reason.", "time": 1671498914, "resto": 14347882}, {"no": 14350471, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)20:49:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14347882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14347882</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wine or cheese</span><br>that&#039;s why people say americans have no culture", "time": 1671500969, "resto": 14347882}, {"no": 14350730, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350471</a><br>I\u2019m confused, are you saying that food is not an aspect of culture?", "time": 1671504836, "resto": 14347882}, {"no": 14350809, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:14:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m sure this thread will be chocked full of nuanced and thoughtful discussion on this rarely examined topic!", "filename": "EnRtAomXMAAMnX0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671506094092403, "time": 1671506094, "md5": "DgADt1jHk1PeezLjQvwCzQ==", "fsize": 43363, "resto": 14347882}, {"no": 14350818, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:15:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14348755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14348755</a><br>Sense of humor", "filename": "74435651c382f77ff46ab5e9ea18161a.320x240x1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 320, "h": 240, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671506146828700, "time": 1671506146, "md5": "gKdodEFaRN0TGMQUnsn0Gw==", "fsize": 12055, "resto": 14347882}, {"no": 14350823, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:18:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Also agreeing that soccer is boring.", "time": 1671506313, "resto": 14347882}, {"no": 14350828, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:19:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350321</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Celtic and Germanic romanticism spread among the plebs</span><br>I&#039;d actually contend that this came much later, like post WW2.

The big tl;dr here is that at the time the book was written (1860s), the Calvinists were claiming that the Netherlands were Christianized in the 1500s by Calvin. They used this as a justification for a bunch of bullshit regarding philosophy that doesn&#039;t really matter here, just that because Christianity has a STARTING DATE in the Netherlands, certain things are justified. The Libertarians/Libertines (this is a translation of Dutch term, it doesn&#039;t quite mean what either of those terms mean in English), meanwhile, argued that actually, because Yahweh had been around since Creation, man had never really not been Christian. The problem is that they lacked scriptural evidence to support this theory. The Oera Linda book is one of these.<br><br>It posits that the ancient Dutch people (circa 3000BC) practiced a form of trinitarian monotheism in line with (Protestant) Christian beliefs. We know that this wasn&#039;t the case. Firstly, 3000BC, the Netherlands would be inhabited by NHG and PIE peoples, neither of whom would speak Old Frisian. Well, no, it&#039;s not really Old Frisian, it&#039;s a sort of mangled pseudo Old Frisian, which is actually a descendant of PIE, but it&#039;s not PIE. It also is very clearly a constructed language, because the author fucks up how such a language would work CONSTANTLY. Secondly, as others have mentioned, the religion of the so called ancient Dutch is just wrong. They would have been polytheists worshiping a deity called Dyeus Phter (literally, in 3000BC he still would have been called that) among a vast array of other Gods and Goddesses, rather than the singular-yet-tridentine monotheistic Goddess (Feminine).", "time": 1671405227, "resto": 14343329}, {"no": 14345247, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)18:24:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14345216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14345216</a><br>Thirdly, and this goes back to the language, it&#039;s obviously concocted because the text not only uses words from non-IE sources (like &quot;marktje&quot;, meaning market, which ultimately comes from an Etruscan root), but it also uses words from OTHER IE languages that couldn&#039;t have existed at the time. The text argues that the Frisians came from the Himalayas (not the steppe, so we can see that this text is just flat out invented as we KNOW where the ancestors of the Dutch were in 3000BC), but the word used is an obvious archaization of &quot;Himalaya&quot;, which is ultimately from Sanskrit (Hima + alaya = lit. snow house). If the ancient Frisians left there in 3000BC, why are they using a word to refer to their home that wouldn&#039;t be invented until over two thousand years later by an entirely separate people? We can actually constructed a Proto-Germanic cognate to &quot;Himalaya&quot;, it would be &quot;*gimaz *slima&quot;, lit. &quot;winter slime&quot;, which would enter Old Frisian as &quot;gimslim&quot;. The *sley- root in PIE means &quot;that which lays&quot;, so in PG it came to refer to a mucus layer, but in PII it came, with an agent suffix, to mean &quot;that around which people are&quot;. <br><br>But, they would be speaking PIE in 3000BC anyways, so it should be something like &quot;*ghimosleyos&quot; (you can see where PG and PII diverge in that word, which is really neat). And... It&#039;s not. But, hey, the author forgot that Old Frisian was a synthetic language, meaning that he frequently drops the grammatical suffixes and instead uses Modern Dutch grammar, so, he&#039;s literally not speaking PIE in several senses of the word.", "time": 1671405899, "resto": 14343329}, {"no": 14345536, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)20:16:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14345216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14345216</a><br><a href=\"#p14345247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14345247</a><br>The problem here is that you hinge your argument on the state of things in 3000 BC.

Ein Sof may be translated as &quot;unending&quot;, &quot;(there is) no end&quot;, or infinity.[1] It was first used by Azriel (c. 1160 \u2013 c. 1238), who, sharing the Neoplatonic belief that God can have no desire, thought, word, or action, emphasized by it the negation of any attribute. Of the Ein Sof, nothing (&quot;Ein&quot;) can be grasped (&quot;Sof&quot;-limitation). It is the origin of the Ohr Ein Sof, the &quot;Infinite Light&quot; of paradoxical divine self-knowledge, nullified within the Ein Sof prior to creation. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the first act of creation, the Tzimtzum self &quot;withdrawal&quot; of God to create an &quot;empty space&quot;, takes place from there. In Hasidic Judaism, the Tzimtzum is only the illusionary concealment of the Ohr Ein Sof, giving rise to monistic panentheism. Consequently, Hasidism focuses on the Atzmus divine essence, rooted higher within the Godhead than the Ein Sof, which is limited to infinitude, and reflected in the essence (etzem) of the Torah and the soul.</span><br><br>For the word of the Lord is right and true;<br> he is faithful in all he does.<br>5 The Lord loves righteousness and justice;<br> the earth is full of his unfailing love.<br><br>6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,<br> their starry host by the breath of his mouth.<br>7 He gathers the waters of the sea into jars[a];<br> he puts the deep into storehouses.<br>8 Let all the earth fear the Lord;<br> let all the people of the world revere him.<br>9 For he spoke, and it came to be;<br> he commanded, and it stood firm.", "filename": "einsof-1", "ext": ".gif", "w": 382, "h": 305, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1671504008622684, "time": 1671504008, "md5": "4LDRoxCxw7ljt1hnxOaQXA==", "fsize": 7018, "resto": 14349085}, {"no": 14350690, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:41:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350684</a><br>Without form.", "time": 1671504103, "resto": 14349085}, {"no": 14350696, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:44:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350684</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;13Then Moses asked God, \u201cSuppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, \u2018The God of your fathers has sent me to you,\u2019 and they ask me, \u2018What is His name?\u2019 What should I tell them?\u201d 14God said to Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM.

Some of them stayed in the Carpathian Basin and the surrounding mountains, while the majority kept going back to the Asia. During this migratory period, they came in contact with various other steppenigger tribes and other Asiatic peoples, and their language started to get influenced by those they came in contact with, thus all the Turkic and Persian loanwords. They also kept establishing proto-states, with it&#039;s location constantly shifting towards the west. Then they finally came into the Carpathian Basin which was ripe for conquest, as it was a largely ungoverned and uncivilized territory stuck between the Western and Eastern civilizations. They quickly subdued the then indigenous Slavs and other such mongrels, then went on to raid across the continent in both directions. They were promptly stopped by the Franks and the Byzantines, and half of them took up Christianity and massacred the other half who wanted to remain pagan, so there went half of their original gene pool. From that point on they started mixing with the remaining Slavs and newly arrived Germans, especially after the Mongols wiped out most of what remained from the Asiatic gene pool. This was also true for their language, with Latin also added to the mix. And this is how it pretty much stayed for the remainder of their history. Now they are genetically a Germanic and Slavic mixed people group sprinkled with some regressive Asian genes. You can still spot a couple of them with slanted eyes and generally Asian features, but it&#039;s becoming more and more rare.

There are so many ethnic groups (kalash for example) who have significant steppe ancestry but very low amounts of steppe paternal lineages. Of course there are examples of the opposite as well. In Europe, I notice that most of Western Europe (and much of Central Europe) has really high percentages of steppe yDNA, usually above 70%. Yet their steppe autosomal is less than 40% in most regions according to the latest Reich and Lazaridis data from the past few years. Iberia by far has the most brutal sex bias. Scandinavia surprisingly has high levels of I1, which is very analogous to the high levels of H1a1 among Indians today even in Brahmin castes. Other than I1 in the north and some E clades in the balkans, Europes Mesolithic and Neolithic yDNA was violently replaced by steppe. It is what it is<br><br>Archeology also backs this up. Pottery for example shows a very gradual transition from late Harappa to the Vedic age. This is a dead giveaway that there wasn\u2019t a violent conquest like what happened in Europe.

(\u2026) The Abbasids in the eighth and ninth century sought to integrate the peoples under their authority, and the Arabization of the administration was one of the tools.[20] Arabization gained momentum with the increasing numbers of Muslim converts;[16] the ascendancy of Arabic as the formal language of the state prompted the cultural and linguistic assimilation of Syrian converts.[21] Those who remained Christian also became Arabized;[20] it was probably during the Abbasid period in the ninth century that Christians adopted Arabic as their first language; the first translation of the gospels into Arabic took place in this century.\u201c<br><br>Admittedly this excerpt speaks of Syria, not Palaestine, but it\u2018s idiotic to assume that Palaestine would have been exempt from this process.

They stream to our countries based on very intentionally false de-facto ad campaigns about prosperity, comfort, and the lives possible here. Then they get worked like dogs being paid less and encouraged to take a standard of living far below what was advertised. Many of them take this Hobson&#039;s choice because it&#039;s still marginally better than life back home. They may have taken huge loans or made other sacrifices to come. Hard to have mobility when you&#039;re locked in like that. Western economies then squeeze the 10-20 best years of their labour productivity (20&#039;s to 30&#039;s) out of them and then dump them. With defunded welfare and other social services many just die, some might leave. Luckily, few have kids. The intergenerational fertility rates are abysmally low, &quot;necessitating&quot; further immigration. Each new wave helps move society below the top percentile in lock step downwards in material comfort and financial security. Women also contribute because of their aforementioned social manipulability. It&#039;s very easy to make them debt slaves and tell them they have become masters of their own destiny.", "time": 1671392136, "resto": 14341694}, {"no": 14344678, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)16:07:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14344251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14344251</a><br>Why the fuck do you even live with someone like that?

I do not know of any natural process by which they can reliably be reversed, but God is able to free them from it, if He wills. Homosexual desire is a product of sin, usually the sin of the individual but in I think very rare cases the sin of a molester or of Adam. The bible says that because they did not see fit to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, so that their men put away the natural use of the woman and burned in their lusts for one another, and even their women exchanged natural affections for those which are against nature. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Telling him his thoughts will also send him to hell for those thoughts all is extremely cruel.</span><br>Maybe it&#039;s cruel, but is it true?

My mother walked in and saw me naked rubbing my penis against my sisters panties. I tried using logic and reasoning with her, but she started HITTING me! I told her that I am a kid and you can not do that to me and threatened to call the cops, she said &quot;Please do, you are 19 and you do these DISGUSTING things and now you are threatening to call the cops on me??&quot;<br>I took my car, clothes and I drove away, now I am sitting in a forest somewhere far away crying my eyes out.

It is necessary for China and the United States, two major economies, to sort out crucial issues together, like global warming, pandemics, and nuclear weapons. Our fates are tied together. There is no choice but to get along. Yet relations have been falling apart. After Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan, in addition to launching new military exercises that could lead to deadly errors and escalation, China broke off talks with the U.S. about climate change, among other matters. The climate crisis is the perhaps most important issue facing the world, a major emergency, and now the two leading powers in the world can\u2019t even discuss how to solve it. This is the road to disaster. The U.S. needs to stop needlessly stoking conflict, think about how things look from the Chinese perspective, and work sincerely to understand and collaborate with a country of 1.4 billion people we have to share a planet with. This does not mean one must be an apologist for China\u2019s wrongdoing, or that its human rights abuses should not be taken seriously. It means that the U.S. must cease to consider global control a \u201cvital interest\u201d and must accommodate and respect the interests of others.
