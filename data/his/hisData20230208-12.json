So the universe&#039;s cause, we must conclude at last, can lie neither inside nor &quot;outside&quot; it.

Why do people look for causes? They do so in order to influence things, since if you know what caused something and you want e.g. to destroy that thing, all you need to do once you know its cause is destroy that (or change it, if you just want to change the thing, and so on). There is no other reason to search for causes: a man who didn&#039;t want to change anything in the world wouldn&#039;t need them; he wouldn&#039;t even have invented the concept. As for those who claim to study things out of a desire for &quot;disinterested contemplation&quot;, they too want to change something: they want to change themselves from a condition of boredom to one of no boredom, and that&#039;s why they study things and hence their causes, since, seen aright, all that studies are concerned with are the causes of things, because that&#039;s what study is: our attempt to &quot;understand&quot; and thereby shape the things around us.<br>But you don&#039;t want to change merely the things around you, you want to change the entire universe, including therefore yourself and all the rest of us! \u2014 that&#039;s why you are asking us for the universe&#039;s cause! At which point the only answer you will get from us is, &quot;If you want to change yourself dude go right ahead, that&#039;s your business, but if you want to change the rest of us you&#039;ll have to go over our dead bodies, because we like ourselves just fine the way we are, thankyouverymuch&quot;.<br>So why can&#039;t you find the universe&#039;s cause?

Govern he cannot, without correcting, reforming, renovating (hence we say that the beginning of re- generation consists in the abolition of what is ours); in like manner, he cannot govern without moving, impelling, urging, and restraining. Accordingly, all the actions which are afterwards done are truly said to be wholly his. Meanwhile, we deny not the truth of Au- gustine\u2019s doctrine, that the will is not destroyed, but rather repaired, by grace\u2014the two things being perfectly consistent\u2014viz. that the human will may be said to be renewed when its vitiosity and perverseness being corrected, it is conformed to the true standard of right- eousness and that, at the same time, the will may be said to be made new, being so vitiated and corrupted that its nature must be entirely changed. There is nothing then to prevent us from saying, that our will does what the Spirit does in us, although the will contributes nothing of itself apart from grace. We must, therefore, remember what we quoted from Augustine, that some men labour in vain to find in the human will some good quality properly belonging to it. Any intermixture which men attempt to make by conjoining the effort of their own will with divine grace is corruption, just as when unwholesome and muddy water is used to dilute wine. But though every thing good in the will is entirely derived from the influence of the Spirit, yet, because we have naturally an innate power of willing, we are not improperly said to do the things of which God claims for himself all the praise; first, because every thing which his kindness produces in us is our own (only we must un- derstand that it is not of ourselves); and, secondly, because it is our mind, our will, our study which are guided by him to what is good.", "filename": "chad", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 700, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675822085437777, "time": 1675822085, "md5": "fxU/2P7i3exPPQf6N7K/ow==", "fsize": 73669, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hence-it-appears-that-the-grace-of-god-as-this", "replies": 7, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 14595354, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)21:17:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is this James White or Calvin?", "time": 1675822646, "resto": 14595317}, {"no": 14595459, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)21:40:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595317</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any intermixture which men attempt to make by conjoining the effort of their own will with divine grace is corruption</span><br>Such &quot;conjoining&quot; cannot be avoided.

I have no doubt that there were some who did believe this but she goes as far as saying its the underbelly of western culture and it goes back to the roman times. One example she cites is Homer&#039;s The Odeyssey where a 13-16 y/o tells his mother to shut up. This is &quot;to silence woman&quot; for her and not just a bratty teen.

Since this is totally non-reciprocal, it&#039;s not an interaction. In the Hindu schools of Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya, the mind and intellect are made out of the subtle elements (tanmatras) which are capable of interacting causally with the physical world, experience takes place when this intellect and its workings receive or are bathed in the light of Brahman&#039;s awareness which itself stays unchanged.

By including mind in the real of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy, and are thereby able to directly initiate bodily motions. And, conversely, material objects are able to have genuine mental effects, as required by normal accounts of, say, the flow of information involved in perceptual awareness of the environment. The representational content of sensory experiences, such as those which attend perceiving the blueness of the sky or the pungent flavor of espresso, can now be treated as straightforward consequences of the physical environment&#039;s causal impingements upon the mind. </span><br>https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portal<wbr>files/portal/28892783/Schweizer_con<wbr>sciousness_and_space_1.pdf", "time": 1675786871, "resto": 14591004}, {"no": 14593148, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)11:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14593111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14593111</a><br>the universe is not an object, and oneness is a human concept, a mathematical abstraction. <br><br>If you are saying something is &quot;one&quot;, that always means there is some other &quot;one&quot; which is not the first one / they are not each other.

His work in cooperation with the workers he employs is based not on mutual services rendered, but on the common work done for the nation. The employer&#039;s position as leader does not therefore mean that he is master in his own house and can do what he likes. It means rather that he is responsible for what his firm does for the community. The employer is bound to his workers by the fact that they are all participating in the labour of the nation. The essence of this cooperation lies in social honour, which means performances of duty, and respect for every kind of work. To offend against this principle of honour is to infringe the order of things embodied in the Labour Organization Act. The form given to the Works Community necessitates that it should be self-governing. The organ of this self-government is the Mutual Trust Council, which consists of the leader of the firm and members elected by the workers. Its task is above all to assist in the drawing up of the works regulations, to see that suitable measures for protection against accidents are taken, and to strengthen mutual confidence.</span><br><br>German Law and Legislation by Dr. Erich Schinnerer, University of Berlin, Published by Terramare Office, Berlin, 1938 pages 20-21", "time": 1675763704, "resto": 14592032}, {"no": 14592237, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:56:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Labour Trustees are supported in their work by the German Labour Front, which is the community of all working Germans.

There is also the case of an employer who did not allow the workers to do their jobs in peace and quiet, but was continually bothering them and urging them on with abusive language. An employer was condemned for an offence against honour because he refused to have the sick children of a worker taken to hospital in a neighbouring town in accordance with the doctor&#039;s instructions; he said he wished to spare his horses. His action in this case was not an insult to honour within the meaning of the Criminal Code, but an offence against the honour due to every member of the working community. In connection with the disturbance of industrial peace the following offences have been dealt with: the provoking of labour disputes; demonstrations against the employer by misrepresentation; undermining of confidence in cooperation among the workers so as to disturb the proper working of the firm.

A fair fight. No sucker punches, you meet at an agreed location at an agreed time and fight with witnesses present. The fight ends when the other guy stops fighting back or is clearly beat. You shake hands after and go about your day having either proven your relative social dominance in the physical arena or accepted your relative inferiority. Witnesses are present so you can&#039;t cope, lie and deny it later on if you lost. That&#039;s how fights usually went with white guys. Black guys jump you if you beat them fair and square because they&#039;re usually incapable of accepting their new lowered status. Surprisingly Asians are the most emotional and primal in fights. They scream the loudest, their facial expressions are the most tense and they get all teary eyed and act like a schizo on their period on the rare occasions they do fight. I guess it takes a lot for them to act out violently, they&#039;ve basically got to almost break as a person. Wannabe alpha white guys who&#039;s actions are ironically feminine also behave the same way as blacks so I guess it&#039;s the higher estrogen levels to blame for the whole chimp out tactic. Generally with white guys the tension leaves pretty fast but blacks keep minor grudges for an eternity.<br>I know this isn&#039;t about race, there&#039;s one black guy who behaved how I would when he got into a fight but he was a really high IQ. The general idea is that you need a variety of traits together which really amount to a decent level of human decency to understand that your enemy despite your personal squabble is still a person that usually should be respected. I once lost a fight and got put to sleep. I woke up to the guy putting an ice pack on my head and offering me water.<br>When you go into war you go with the hope that if you are ever caught, that you would be treated with respect and cared for and with that belief you&#039;d do so to your enemy combatants.

Nothing can be more corrupting, nothing more destructive of all those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot. When this corrupting passion once takes possession of the human mind, like the love of gold it becomes insatiable. It is the never-dying worm in his bosom, grows with his growth and strengthens with the declining years of its victim.

Hence to avoid misfortune it was a common practice among victorious succeeding Dynasties to enfeoff members of the previous dynasty with an honorary rank &amp; title, with their main jobs being the maintenance of their imperial tombs &amp; altars of their dynasty to keep the spirits of previous kings/emperors happy.", "time": 1675827620, "resto": 14595403}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14595330, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)21:11:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does nobody really know what happened during the dark ages?", "filename": "l-intro-1647291897", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675822277010902, "time": 1675822277, "md5": "JEp8SnILa9MGOBDs1qeNFg==", "fsize": 142683, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-nobody-really-know-what-happened-during-the", "replies": 11, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 14595337, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)21:12:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595330</a><br>Pretty much, you can count the written sources for each historic region on one hand.", "time": 1675822350, "resto": 14595330}, {"no": 14595392, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)21:25:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595337</a><br>Really?

There was a tradition of torturing defeated soldiers that was engraved in Herero culture, a tradition they practiced on both their rival tribesmen in the past and Germans in the heat of the revolt. Stories of such atrocities serve to enrage the German public and soldiers alike and contributed to the brutal response of said soldiers. Even the order to not to harm women and children by Samuel Maharero - a product of his Christian background rather than Herero culture - was obeyed but intermittently by Herero forces. It&#039;s worth noting that Von Trotha also pronounced a similar order - which he later seemed to backtrack back and forth on and was seemingly justified by some at home after the war as a result of Herero women following warbands to mutilate German corpses and the like - which once again his forces somewhat sparingly obeyed. <br><br>With that said, German colonialism certainly did possess a brutal face for a time with the reprisals certainly being draconian. However, this would later be reversed following the German elections of 1906, an election in which colonial issues played a major role in the results. Following these elections, German East Africa, in particular, entered something of a golden age with governors of the German Colonial Office - from Dernburg and Schnee - practicing quite paternalistic policies which had a positive impact on the living standards of natives and colonial revenue alike even if some of these policies, such as outlawing forced labor and curtailing whipping, were to the dismay of planters. According to author Charles Miller, &quot;on the basis of its achievements in medicine and agriculture alone, the German presence in East Africa seemed more than justified&quot; by the eve of the First World War.", "time": 1675821079, "resto": 14586930}, {"no": 14595274, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)20:55:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595260</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There was a tradition of torturing defeated soldiers that was engraved in Herero culture</span><br>Feather niggers were like this, some of the most brutal savages in history especially Comanches and we&#039;re supposed to feel sorry that they all died from disease", "time": 1675821318, "resto": 14586930}, {"no": 14595283, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)20:57:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;ISIS destroys Roman temples</span><br>Retards can\u2019t be trusted with ancient relics", "filename": "5E83EEFB-9BA1-4155-A6F4-6A65A1AD1FC7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 1098, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1675821452940568, "time": 1675821452, "md5": "1SbRQpHaCpsuFfNryrL6qQ==", "fsize": 340395, "resto": 14586930}, {"no": 14595285, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)20:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595274</a><br>They were called savages for a reason.
