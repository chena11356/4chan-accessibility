Now in this island of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and several others, and over parts of the continent, and, furthermore, the men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya within the columns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This vast power, gathered into one, endeavoured to subdue at a blow our country and yours and the whole of the region within the straits; and then, Solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence of her virtue and strength, among all mankind. She was pre-eminent in courage and military skill, and was the leader of the Hellenes. And when the rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone, after having undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed over the invaders, and preserved from slavery those who were not yet subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within the pillars. But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.</span><br><br>Plato, Timaeus/Critias", "time": 1674558951, "resto": 14515246}, {"no": 14521235, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:16:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14521218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14521218</a> <br>[Cont.]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where is it</span><br>See OP&#039;s top right pic, roughly the size of Anatolia (which Greeks called Asia).<br><br>We have never dug there.

Africa was only carved up in like 1880 while there had been European settlements in the Americas since the late 1500s. The initial European settlement of the Americas also coincides with the reformation/counterreformation and religious wars in Europe, which gave an incentive to the various kingdoms to exile dissident sects to the new world. By the 1880s this isn&#039;t the case anymore and the European countries are nation states trying to industrialize their economy to the fullest extent. This means keeping their citizens within its borders as skilled workers in factories, and extracting resources like wood, iron, coal, rubber and oil from colonies to fuel that economy. Another factor is that African societies had much denser populations and the disparity in technology between the two wasn&#039;t as big as that between Europeans and Indians.

Here follows how it was historically referred to:<br>395 AD &quot;Eastern Roman empire&quot;: Theodosius the great divided the empire between his two sons. The term &quot;Eastern empire&quot; is accurate considering that the Notitia calls it the &quot;pars orientalis&quot;.<br>476 AD &quot;Roman empire&quot;: the Western Roman empire is disbanded by Odoacer, who sends the imperial regalia to Zeno. Some people have misinterpreted this event as a sort of &quot;barbarian&quot; conquest of Rome. In reality Odoacer considered himself a part of the Roman empire, I.E. Italy didn&#039;t stop being part of the Roman empire. The only thing that changed here is that the subdivision between West and East ceased. Thus, going forward, there was just one empire with its capital in Constantinople.<br>497 AD &quot;Eastern Roman empire&quot; (?): Theodoric the great received the imperial regalia back from Constantinople. We can&#039;t know for sure, but it&#039;s possible that the division of Western and Eastern empire was resumed, with Theodoric named as Western Roman emperor.<br>533 AD &quot;Roman empire&quot;: Justinian&#039;s war with the Vandals asserted the notion, in Constantinople, that the territories in the West had been taken away from the Roman empire by barbarian usurpers. Thus, if the idea of Western and Eastern empire was indeed resumed under Theodoric&#039;s reign, that was taken down for good under Justinian. We can be sure that from this point onward, the peoples of Western Europe referred to the empire of Constantinople as the Roman empire.<br>797 AD: with the death of Constantine VI, murdered by his own mother, Irene, arises the controversy over the legitimacy of this polity. The people of Constantinople would continue to refer to their realm as the &quot;Roman empire&quot; until 1453, while the Westerners would start calling it the &quot;Greek empire&quot;.<br>Choose yourself which view is better, but this is when the division starts, not with Heraclius or the death of Justinian.", "filename": "Roman empire map 600 AD", "ext": ".png", "w": 1368, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 61, "tim": 1674517756792211, "time": 1674517756, "md5": "1EwJDr70n+cAGqzCS2mn5Q==", "fsize": 1708968, "resto": 14515475}, {"no": 14519490, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)19:04:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14519441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14519441</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;until 1453</span><br>Self proclaimed roman naming is irrelevant by post-1204.", "time": 1674518683, "resto": 14515475}, {"no": 14519553, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)19:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14515656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14515656</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Byzantines called themselves Romans</span><br>Romania confirmed true heir to the empire, Ave Ceau\u0219escu!", "time": 1674520080, "resto": 14515475}, {"no": 14519589, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)19:41:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14515656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14515656</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;as he was a Frank</span><br>The emperors in Constantinople were Greek.

The situation, with its origin traced back to the Meiji period, came with both geopolitical and military consequences leading to Japan&#039;s involvement in World War II. The IJA/IJN rivalry expressed itself in the early 1930s as the &quot;strike north&quot; (Hokushin-ron) and &quot;strike south&quot; (Nanshin-ron) factions. The goal of both factions was to seize territories which possessed the raw materials, especially petroleum, which Japan needed to sustain its growth and economy, but which it did not possess itself. The strike north faction advocated the taking of the natural resources of Siberia, by way of Manchuria, a scenario in which the prime role would be taken by the Army, the strike south faction advocated the taking of the oil-rich Dutch East Indies, a scenario in which the Navy would predominate.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In order to further their own faction, relatively junior officers resorted to the assassinations of members of the rival faction and their supporters in government. With both factions being opposed to the peace faction, this period has become known as the era of &quot;government by assassination&quot;. Insubordination by the Kwantung Army led first to the occupation of Manchuria, and later the Second Sino-Japanese War following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. However, at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, any farther expansion northwards into Siberia was shown to be impossible given the Soviet superiority in numbers and armour.</span>", "time": 1674507098, "resto": 14518640}, {"no": 14518666, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:52:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14518640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14518640</a><br><a href=\"#p14518660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14518660</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With the loss of Army prestige that followed the failure of the Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts, the Navy faction gained the ascendency, supported by a number of the powerful industrial zaibatsu, that were convinced that their interests would be best served fulfilling the needs of the Navy, thus paving the way to the Pacific War.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The rivalry between the IJA and IJN also saw both services developing air arms; the Army creating its own amphibious infantry units and running ships and submarines, including submarine chasers and aircraft carriers; and the Navy creating its own infantry and marine paratroopers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Significant examples of this rivalry include the Japanese Navy taking several weeks to inform the Army of the disastrous results of the Battle of Midway, and the IJA and IJN deliberately sabotaging each other during the Guadalcanal campaign.</span>", "time": 1674507160, "resto": 14518640}, {"no": 14518673, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:53:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14518640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14518640</a><br>their army was in China and every time they tried to border incursions they got completely owned", "time": 1674507233, "resto": 14518640}, {"no": 14518678, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:55:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14518651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14518651</a><br>But this would\u2019ve meant that Japan never fights the British in south east asia, thus eliminating a force that could\u2019ve been used for the fighting the Soviets, the British of which were not obliged to fight for?", "time": 1674507303, "resto": 14518640}, {"no": 14518685, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:55:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14518640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14518640</a><br>This was debated in Japanese inner circles.", "filename": "Rise and Fall of the Japanese Empire Pgs 87-88", "ext": ".png", "w": 1763, "h": 852, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1674507351837159, "time": 1674507351, "md5": "IUh6THhP304Lf/LW1pBneg==", "fsize": 334688, "resto": 14518640}, {"no": 14518702, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)16:01:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14518685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14518685</a>", "filename": "Rise and Fall of the Japanese Empire 89-90", "ext": ".png", "w": 1766, "h": 841, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 59, "tim": 1674507692294786, "time": 1674507692, "md5": "u/JyOuebX918vwJsLvUW3Q==", "fsize": 252934, "resto": 14518640}, {"no": 14518759, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)16:19:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Because they were stupid but not insane.

There is an authentic version that makes a mention of adultery in the context; however, it was perhaps only the conjecture of the man reporting it.

Al-Bukhari whose formal conditions this narration does not fulfill quoted it in his Sahih only to mention a happening of pre-Islamic times.</span><br>Basically, some guy saw some monkey throwing stones at some other monkey, and the adultery part was added in later.

With no skills and no real social life. His sole &quot;genius&quot; consisted in pairing this nothingness of being with subconscious desires, fantasies and resentment of the German people, fueled by post-ww1 environment of poverty, chaos and instability. Hitler was nothing but an empty vessel for the projection of the worst resentments of German people. Hitler did not really exist, personally speaking, as a man, he was strictly a fantasy, a mythological placeholder for an expression of nation-wide desires and resentments. An event possible only in the specific constellation of the time and location at the very specific moment. Hitler is in effect a nothingness which spoke back consciously what the German nation thought unconsciously. Nobody with a real personality, a real self-determined entity could have accomplished that. Of course a Hitler could repeat, not in exactly the same way, but there is nothing that prevents something of that kind from happening in the future. Resentment, widespread poverty and chaos are breeding grounds for mass delusions and for radical fantasies. Hitler&#039;s specialty lies in the fact that we have perhaps never seen someone so capable of assuming every single national resentment and most vile fantasies as part of his personality. The capability lies in the fact that Hitler had no personality of his own, except for being that individual who took upon himself the yoke of the entire nation&#039;s evil fermentations. For a sovereign individual, something this radical is an impossibility, such taking up of mob hysteria is always paired with pragmatic detachment. Hitler certainly was pragmatic, but there was no real a &quot;behind the mask&quot; moment for the man, his &quot;ingenuity&quot; and &quot;magic&quot; lies in his and the mask being or becoming one and the same. It is an excellent study to realize how mass resentment and insecurity, gives rise to mass delusions and vile fantasies and how these can be weaponized.", "time": 1674532248, "resto": 14520004}, {"no": 14520206, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:54:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The guy lost the war", "time": 1674532460, "resto": 14520004}, {"no": 14520207, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14520194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14520194</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no skills</span><br>He created the most recognised, most powerful and most feared/hated symbolism in the western world.

And what is the life like for the Japanese immigrants? So, could you talk about who are these people who are coming over from Japan? Where do they come from in Japan, and how many people are we talking about?<br><br>And at some point, they met procurers, who talked about nice things of America: job opportunities or a chance to have an American education or marry rich landowners in California, who turned out to be peasants or hired hands who forced them into prostitution. I also found that not all women were unaware of what kinds of work they would do in their destinations. Some women had already sold sexual services to local foreigners in Yokohama working as servants in the houses of Chinese merchants. Others worked in brothels and dance halls, catering to foreign sailors and merchants. And in that process, they became familiarized with foreigners and Western cultures, which influenced their decision to follow masters or procurers to the American West.<br><br><br>TERAMI-WADA, MOTOE. \u201cKarayuki-San of Manila: 1890-1920.\u201d Philippine Studies, vol. 34, no. 3, 1986, pp. 287\u2013316.

to seek treatment at the Fertility Institute of Hawaii, due to the restrictions on certain services in their home country. In Korea, there is a shortage of sperm donors; the law dictates that only one donation is permitted from every male. As such, for patients that need to rely on the use of donor sperm, the quantity of donors to choose from is quite limited. Egg donation and surrogacy are also not allowed in Korea. For these reasons, Korean patients with infertility issues will often travel to the Fertility Institute of Hawaii to seek services that can enhance conception, outside of the limited treatment modalities available in their home country.

Using PGS, couples can ensure that their embryos are chromosomally normal prior to embryo transfer with IVF. While anyone can use PGS in order to ensure that only chromosomally normal embryos are transferred during an IVF cycle, PGS is often used for older couples who have an elevated risk of chromosomally abnormal embryos. Likewise, couples with a history of miscarriages often utilize PGS to decrease the risk of miscarrying.<br>Reception Desk<br>Jamie in Embryology<br>Embryology All Staff<br>Embryology<br>Asian Themed Conference Room<br>Doc-at-Microscope-o<br>[SHOW SLIDESHOW]<br>Pre-implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) for Family Balancing is illegal in Korea.<br>PGS not only confirms that the chromosomal compliment of an embryo is normal but also determines the gender of an embryo. Once PGS is completed, couples are allowed to choose the gender of the normal embryos transferred in order to ensure family balancing.<br>Donor Sperm In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycles<br>The use of anonymous sperm donors is difficult to the restrictions in Korea. Therefore, many couples will travel outside of the country to the U.S. where donors exist in larger numbers, to assist them in family building.

His own good pleasure is the cause of their election, their conversion, their repentance, and their receiving the benefits of Christ&#039;s atonement (i.e. justification, adoption, sanctification, glorification). <br><br>Regardless of whether God chooses to extend that grace, man is still held accountable for his sin and unbelief. Why? Because God is sovereign over all Creation and those beings that inhabit His world and partake of its blessings are obliged to render unto their Creator that which He demands; namely, the exercise of righteous living and fruitful stewardship over the earth. The conscience of man acts even when there is no formally promulgated law, and serves as a binding witness against us when we transgress it. Thus, all men are culpable before God and owe Him satisfaction for the offense to His Holiness that our sin constitutes. <br><br>Bottom line? Grace is God&#039;s discretionary exercising of favor towards objects of mercy prepared for in advance. Wrath is the consequent outworking of God&#039;s immutable justice towards all those who hear the gospel call and reject His command for them to repent. The strawman that usually prevails in these discussions is one in which man is wholly neutral and dearly wishing to be saved and God arbitrarily acts to prevent that. But the Scriptures teach that apart from the intervening action of God in giving man a new heart and a new spirit, man is unwilling to depart from his sin and consequently suppresses the truth of Christ.

In previous eras, history would more or less reset with every new king/ruler/monarchy as major wars would almost always successfully destroy all previous records. This is why our understanding of the pre-modern world is so patchwork and based off church texts, as the western church wasn&#039;t itself a target for war until the renaissance when literacy and printing were increasingly commonplace.

It&#039;s much easier to just erase large parts of history this way as there is no central authority or shared appreciation for writing as there is in the west.<br><br>For example how many records of Soviet computers were kept? The best records outside of the Lenin Institute were bombed by Russia in Mariupol. Thus, much of Soviet computing history has been lost - or at least the parts that Russia won&#039;t censor. Same for the Vietnam War, records concerning which would have been destroyed by the Nixon Admin had Daniel Ellsberg not leaked them. Or perhaps the entire history of Labor and Socialism in America, which is kept alive through hobbyists and lawyers as the government does not recognize it as a subject worth of study.", "time": 1674514735, "resto": 14515934}, {"no": 14519236, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:00:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14519220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14519220</a><br><br>Just as a qualification: most people would rightfully claim China&#039;s language is itself a historical document that tells protects the Chinese peoples&#039; historical story, but this is a cultural story and not actual records of confirmed real-world events.
