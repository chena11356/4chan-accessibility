Having a Christian mother or father or grandmother is seen as an issue that needs to be overcome, blacks don&#039;t care about that since they also have the Christian family at home.<br><br>Thirdly, black converts often have children out of wedlock and baby mommas from their pre-Islamic life and it&#039;s seen as normal to smoke weed and have tattoos and women etc before your Islamic life.

It was not long after high school that she decided to start calling herself &quot;Patricia&quot; as she had never liked her birth name, and because her birthday fell on March 17, St. Patrick&#039;s Day. By 1934, Pat had saved a decent enough nest egg to head back to California, where she enrolled in college and paid tuition with assorted jobs including working as a clerk in the fashionable LA department store Bullocks. Because of her good looks, she was sometimes employed as a cosmetics demonstrator, and a movie extra for $6.50 a day--almost $140 in 2022 dollars. Pat had a single speaking line in the MGM film &quot;Becky Sharp&quot;, although it didn&#039;t make it into the final edit of the movie.</span>", "time": 1673841020, "resto": 14475717}, {"no": 14477765, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:50:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14475717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14475717</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ruined American politics forever and damned the country to stagnancy</span><br>Thanks Dick.", "time": 1673841048, "resto": 14475717}, {"no": 14477768, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:51:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14477765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477765</a><br>yes, LBJfag, we all know what you think", "time": 1673841093, "resto": 14475717}, {"no": 14477854, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)23:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graduating USC with honors in 1937, Pat got hired as a teacher at Whittier Union High School for $1,800 a year--a very cushy salary in Depression-era America.

With a rapidly aging population, Japan can either actively pursue immigration policies that will boost the foreign-born population in the country, terminate the vicious cycle, and replenish their greying population with young immigrant workers, or they can maintain the status quo of letting immigrants stay for only a couple of years and expect their population to dwindle to around half of its current size in 2100, with the vicious cycle perpetuated ad infinitum.33 If the latter were to happen, Japan\u2014already in its third decade of economic stagnation with its gross domestic product per capita having shrunk for the past twenty years\u2014can expect to see a multitude of problems including: a lack of young workers to pay into the top-heavy pension schemes (it is estimated that around thirty-six percent of Japan\u2019s population will be aged sixty-five and up) and food insecurity that threatens the extinction of \u201can estimated 896 Japanese cities, towns, and villages.\u201d34 Allowing for more immigration in Japan is not just for the sake of creating a multicultural society; it is so that the Japanese can abandon embarrassing, antiquated racist sentiments of nihonjinron; it is so that they can address their demographic crisis; it is so that they can avoid enduring further economic drawbacks associated with a disproportionate aging population.</span>", "time": 1673821931, "resto": 14473842}, {"no": 14476176, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:33:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14474261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14474261</a><br><a href=\"#p14474156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14474156</a><br><a href=\"#p14475167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14475167</a><br><a href=\"#p14474283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14474283</a><br><a href=\"#p14475047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14475047</a><br>Every referendum on immigration directly has been near unanimously opposed by the titular nation of wherever the referendum takes place.<br><br>ALL immigration is done undemocratically against The Will of The People and anyone who supports immigration should be deported.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yeah but</span><br>Dont care<br>Didnt ask<br>Country is not for sale,<br>Dont care how much you want to &quot;add&quot; its not for sale, not on the table.<br>&#039;my&#039; group conquered it, paid for it, and its ours.", "time": 1673821983, "resto": 14473842}, {"no": 14476207, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:39:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14475663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14475663</a><br><a href=\"#p14476045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14476045</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mass Somalians and Mexicans are just like the Irish and Germans from 150 years ago </span><br>Such a transparent false equivalency fallacy that it has to instead be malicious.", "time": 1673822364, "resto": 14473842}, {"no": 14476211, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:40:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14476207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14476207</a><br>Yes they are.

People talk mostly about immigrants because you can literally see them walking around, but most of the stuff we&#039;re using (if you live in the United States) or wearing on our backs is made in poor countries. So this cheap labor force is a globalized cheap labor force but I think it&#039;s pretty obvious that it has helped create a pretty high level of consumer abundance in rich countries like the U.S., which, from standard-American Costco or Ikea shopper, hasn&#039;t been entirely negative.<br><br>But there&#039;s also a critique (usually this comes from the left) that the global finance system is arranged in such a way to keep wages artificially suppressed in poor countries, which contributes to the immigration to rich countries, and those immigrant workers also supply remittances to poor countries and which, if they were withdrawn, would cause some of these countries to basically collapse in unrest.

Ponda stopped his car and then all hell broke loose.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;They [people] stormed out of their houses and they really wanted to burn the car, they pushed me out of the car and started beating me up,&quot; Ponda recalled. The mob went on to steal all his equipment which he had in the car.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Luckily a police car passed by. &quot;That was my salvation. If the police had not passed by, they would have burnt me alive or set my car on fire,&quot; the DW correspondent said. &quot;You can not prove who did it,&quot; Ponda added. In and around Mombasa, mob justice happens very often.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even politicians are not spared. In April, a furious crowd dragged Nigerian lawmaker Bukalo Saraki to a marketplace in the capital Abuja. The mob ripped off his clothes and hurled insults at him. The reason for the attack is that messages had been circulating on social media claiming the senator had illegally enriched himself.</span>", "time": 1673830687, "resto": 14474479}, {"no": 14476936, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)20:11:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14476839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14476839</a><br>Did it work?

The founding fathers envisioned a nation of literate, rational, God-fearing people who would support his fellow man as a matter of course. Naturally, working under this assumption, they limited the powers of government as much as they could. This included muzzling law enforcement by affording accused people every possible protection, and protecting citizens from even being frivolously accused or otherwise harassed by police in the first place. <br><br>The average American, however, had a considerably narrower view of the world. He might support the idea of giving his fellow man the benefit of the doubt and affording them every protection possible, as long as they were white. The minute you talk about extending these privileges to black people, goodwill and brotherly love goes out the fucking window. Oh sure, some were committed enough to their ideals to not care about race, but the average American cared a hell of a lot about race.<br><br>If you want a one word answer for why the American justice system became harsher, why police brutality became the norm, why prisons became massive cottage industries, it&#039;s this: niggers. Why do police need automatic weapons and armored vehicles? Why do relatively minor offenses carry lengthy prison sentences? Why is it considered acceptable for a policemen to viciously beat anyone he decides to arrest?

But as Bruce Cumings eloquently explains, for the Asian world the Korean War was a generations-long fight that still haunts contemporary events. And in a very real way, although its true roots and repercussions continue to be either misunderstood, forgotten, or willfully ignored, it is the war that helped form modern America\u2019s relationship to the world.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With access to new evidence and secret materials from both here and abroad, including an archive of captured North Korean documents, Cumings reveals the war as it was actually fought. He describes its start as a civil war, preordained long before the first shots were fired in June 1950 by lingering fury over Japan\u2019s occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. Cumings then shares the neglected history of America\u2019s post\u2013World War II occupation of Korea, the untold stories of bloody insurgencies and rebellions, and the powerful militaries organized and equipped by America and the Soviet Union in that divided land. He tells of the United States officially entering the action on the side of the South, and exposes as never before the appalling massacres and atrocities committed on all sides and the \u201coceans of napalm\u201d dropped on the North by U.S. forces in a remarkably violent war that killed as many as four million Koreans, two thirds of whom were civilians.</span><br><br>https://youtu.be/aVCuku3Ldi0<br>https://youtu.be/ba3dgDUtE9A<br>https://youtu.be/6KCBH2QVLok", "filename": "9780812978964", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 292, "h": 450, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673845506232400, "time": 1673845506, "md5": "E7zKJU+V2Dem6t5nKooHzw==", "fsize": 47210, "resto": 14477748}, {"no": 14478342, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)00:32:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478236</a><br><a href=\"#p14478258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478258</a><br>Will check these out anon.", "time": 1673847158, "resto": 14477748}, {"no": 14479309, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:51:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14477748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477748</a><br>https://centropr-archive.hunter.cun<wbr>y.edu/centrovoices/chronicles/puert<wbr>o-rican-soldiers-korean-war-battle-<wbr>chosin-reservoir", "time": 1673869880, "resto": 14477748}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14478774, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:13:01", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Real Schizo hours", "com": "My favorite historical Schizo theory is that Cleopatra Selene II was the true mother of Jesus, thus making Antony and Cleopatra his grandparents.", "filename": "Cleopatra Selene II Bust", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1673856781606253, "time": 1673856781, "md5": "gsw2fgDxp2p1BpqV4w2oCQ==", "fsize": 88757, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "real-schizo-hours", "replies": 5, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 14478781, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:15:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "jfk&#039;s wife was a communist spy she has clearly ural asiatic features", "time": 1673856902, "resto": 14478774}, {"no": 14478788, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478781</a><br>did she also kill him?<br>Also does somebody need to be form the steppe to be a communist?", "time": 1673856994, "resto": 14478774}, {"no": 14478941, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:02:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478774</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Real Schizo hours</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cleopatra Selene II was the true mother of Jesus</span><br>more realistic than official church narrative", "filename": "1548414350759", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673859771416939, "time": 1673859771, "md5": "SQFbsOazi9nBOOA0M5RJmA==", "fsize": 67537, "resto": 14478774}, {"no": 14478949, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:04:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478774</a><br>Did you come up with this conclusion because you saw a list of two famous people who lived at around the same and decided that they had to be connected somehow?", "filename": "1612723690516", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 578, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673859884555138, "time": 1673859884, "md5": "rFTkIZB50puM5mfP8fzuCw==", "fsize": 2094860, "resto": 14478774}, {"no": 14479308, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:51:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478941</a><br>because it is the undisputable truth.<br>OP is only slightly homosexual. he might turn straight if he stops claiming it to be schizo - on /his/ nonetheless.", "filename": "followcrumbs", "ext": ".png", "w": 1039, "h": 1565, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673869876995646, "time": 1673869876, "md5": "SI4ddZH1GaD7VJEThdWnag==", "fsize": 674968, "resto": 14478774}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14478954, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:06:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can you somehow prove that there is a real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist either via logical symbolic manipulation or science?", "filename": "1672371093816333", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3000, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673859976824584, "time": 1673859976, "md5": "hJnKwqJs55ejRszvKG6o7Q==", "fsize": 3701987, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "can-you-somehow-prove-that-there-is-a-real", "replies": 15, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 10}, {"no": 14478971, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:10:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "God is gay.

The opposite is true from Buddhist pov.<br><br>For Buddhists, the question of consciousness revolved around &quot;what is consciousness&quot;? The acceptable answer is that which is accessible/aware, but more sufficiently its awareness of something. So to be conscious to be a Buddhist is to be aware of something, whether its apple, your car, the post that you&#039;re wriging, the monitor/screen you&#039;re staring at, a bird, etc. Its always in relation to a object within a mind. So a Buddhist would say a conscious person can never find consciousness alone, as that would defy the very definition of consciousness. So is there a need for consciousness as a separate indivisible thing? There isn&#039;t in Buddhism because the notion of consciousness requires an object in the mind and the &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;conscious of the object&quot; is one and the same. There&#039;s also the subconscious mind that Buddhists go into, which is basically the basic personalities/habits/heuristics of the mind that you&#039;ve grown accustomed to that influences your decision making. But they&#039;re also not seen as indivisible units, but rather force of mental habits that linger on in the mind to influence your actions/behaviors that are different from waking conscious moments. <br>With that, the Buddhist enlightenment is one of clearing the mind of faulty heuristics such that lingering thoughts/habits (karma) do not form at all in the background. <br><br>I wonder if that means an enlightened mind has full control over consciousness such that subconscious mind doesn&#039;t play any role at all or subconscious mind plays very weak role as their model suggests either a very easy breaking down of habits or not even forming any habits.", "time": 1673808083, "resto": 14471670}, {"no": 14474897, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:47:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14474852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14474852</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So a Buddhist would say a conscious person can never find consciousness alone, as that would defy the very definition of consciousness.

W. L. Hime (Gunpowder and Ammunition, 1904) says, the invention of gunpowder was impossible until the properties of nearly pure saltpetre had become known. The honour, however, has been associated with two names in particular, Berthold Schwartz, a German monk, and Friar Roger Bacon. Of the former Oscar Guttmann writes (Monumenta pulveris pyrii, 1904, p. 6): &quot;Berthold Schwartz was generally considered to be the inventor of gunpowder, and only in England has Roger Bacon&#039;s claim been upheld, though there are English writers who have pleaded in favour of Schwartz. Most writers are agreed that Schwartz invented the first fire-arms, and as nothing was known of an inventor of gunpowder, it was perhaps considered justifiable to give Schwartz the credit thereof. There is some ambiguity as to when Schwartz lived. The year 1354 is sometimes mentioned as the date of his invention of powder, and this is also to be inferred from an inscription on the monument to him in Freiburg. But considering there can be no doubt as to the manufacture in England of gunpowder and cannon in 1344, that we have authentic information of guns in France in 1338 and in Florence in 1326, and that the Oxford MS. De officiis regum of 1325 gives an illustration of a gun, Berthold Schwartz must have lived long before 1354 to have been the inventor of gunpowder or guns.&quot; In Germany also there were powder-works at Augsburg in 1340, in Spandau in 1344, and Liegnitz in 1348.<br><br>Roger Bacon, in his De mirabili potestate artis et naturae (1242), makes the most important communication on the history of gunpowder.

The words of this anagram are (chap. II): &quot;Item ponderis totum 30 sed tamen salis petrae luru vopo vir can utri 1 et sulphuris; et sic facies tonitruum et coruscationem, si scias artificium. Videas tamen utrum loquar aenigmate aut secundum veritatem.&quot; Hime, in his chapter on the origin of gunpowder, discusses these chapters at length, and gives, omitting the anagram, the translation: &quot;Let the total weight of the ingredients be 30, however, of saltpetre... of sulphur; and with such a mixture you will produce a bright flash and a thundering noise, if you know the trick. You may find (by actual experiment) whether I am writing riddles to you or the plain truth.&quot; The anagram reads, according to Hime, &quot;salis petrae r(ecipe) vii part(es), v nov(ellae) corul(i), v et sulphuris&quot; (take seven parts of saltpetre, five of young hazel-wood, and five of sulphur). Hime then goes on to show that Bacon was in possession of an explosive which was a considerable advance on mere incendiary compositions. Bacon does not appear to have been aware of the projecting power of gunpowder. He knew that it exploded and that perhaps people might be blown up or frightened by it; more cannot be said.

It documents incendiary projectiles containing low-nitrate gunpowder,[23] which were launched from catapults or lowered down from city walls onto besiegers.[24] Examples of these incendiaries include the &quot;swallow-tail&quot; incendiary (\u71d5\u5c3e\u70ac; yanweiju) and the flying incendiary (\u98db\u70ac; feiju). The swallow-tail incendiary was made of straw tied together and dipped in fat or oil. Chinese soldiers defending a city under siege would light the incendiary and lower it onto any wooden structure of the invading army to engulf it in fire. The flying incendiary visually resembled the swallow-tail incendiary, but was lowered using an iron chain from a swape lever installed within the walls of the city.[24] The book also describes an &#039;igniter ball&#039; used in warfare and for finding the firing range. The Wujing Zongyao stated the following:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Wujing Zongyao&#039;s first recorded gunpowder formula used in these bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%.[34] The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine.[35] Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.[1]</span>", "time": 1673840860, "resto": 14474728}, {"no": 14477743, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:48:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14477713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477713</a><br>carbon is still used in bronze metal work. stop trying to be smart you retarded chink animal.", "time": 1673840887, "resto": 14474728}, {"no": 14477744, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:48:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14477726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477726</a><br>If you are white and interested in China, you would also be interested in Turks, Russians, Arabs, Indians out of curiosity in non-Western civilization.

In 1642, Ming foundries merged their own casting technology with European cannon designs to create a distinctive cannon known as the &quot;Dingliao grand general.&quot; Through combining the advanced cast-iron technique of southern China and the iron-bronze composite barrels invented in northern China, the Dingliao grand general cannons exemplified the best of both iron and bronze cannon designs. Unlike traditional iron and bronze cannons, the Dingliao grand general&#039;s inner barrel was made of iron, while the exterior of brass.[1][12]</span>", "time": 1673846262, "resto": 14474728}, {"no": 14478303, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)00:18:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14478279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478279</a><br><a href=\"#p14478297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14478297</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The resulting bronze-iron composite cannons were superior to iron or bronze cannons in many respects. They were lighter, stronger, longer lasting, and able to withstand more intensive explosive pressure. Chinese artisans also experimented with other variants such as cannons featuring wrought iron cores with cast iron exteriors. While inferior to their bronze-iron counterparts, these were considerably cheaper and more durable than standard iron cannons. Both types were met with success and were considered &quot;among the best in the world&quot;[13] during the 17th century. The Chinese composite metal casting technique was effective enough that Portuguese imperial officials sought to employ Chinese gunsmiths for their cannon foundries in Goa, so that they could impart their methods for Portuguese weapons manufacturing.[13] According to the soldier Albrecht Herport, who fought for the Dutch at the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, the Chinese &quot;know how to make very effective guns and cannons, so that it\u2019s scarcely possible to find their equal elsewhere.&quot;[14]</span><br><br>Technology doesn&#039;t come in a package.

It&#039;s either 1. Contamination of the amounts of uranium or lead. 2. Inheritance of lead or 3. Accelerated decay rates. It&#039;s one of the three, it&#039;s not none of them. One of those three is the cause of the old age dates, because we already know the earth isn&#039;t old. Again you&#039;re assuming that you know for a fact that nothing at all disturbed the data you&#039;re looking at. You&#039;re assuming that the uranium lead decay you&#039;re analyzing has not been affected in any way at all and you don&#039;t know that. It&#039;s probably the third one, accelerated decay rates. Polonium radiohalos form in granite in a matter of days but require billions of years of uranium decay. Something must have accelerated the rate of uranium decay for those polonium halos to form. The halos can&#039;t form slowly, it has to be rapid, they form in a matter of days or they can&#039;t form because the crystals &quot;snap back&quot; from the damage done by the alpha particles being shot out of it. If they crystal is allowed time to snap back then the halos don&#039;t remain as damage, but if lots of alpha particles are shot out of the crystal very quickly then the crystal doesn&#039;t have time to snap back and the halos form and remain. So the halos are there and that means they formed in a matter of days but require millions or billions of years of uranium decay so obviously the rate of decay was accelerated by something, like a flood.", "time": 1673865276, "resto": 14472870}, {"no": 14479270, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:21:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14477567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477567</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this post</span><br>Further proof you don&#039;t know about radioactive decay you fucking idiot", "time": 1673868069, "resto": 14472870}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14477936, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)23:13:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any history and h7manitez about Thugs Bunny saying &quot;myendeintssusimsgrimdingevemwgilei<wbr>sleep&quot;?", "filename": "1673761737595024", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 628, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 245, "tim": 1673842388292102, "time": 1673842388, "md5": "jFbq0Bhsd6vNRpj2k4RvzQ==", "fsize": 212742, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "any-history-and-h7manitez-about-thugs-bunny", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 14478469, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)01:17:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bumb", "time": 1673849864, "resto": 14477936}, {"no": 14479269, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:20:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "best thread on /his/", "time": 1673868019, "resto": 14477936}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14474370, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)12:16:04", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Why is nonviolence always used as a metric for progress among modern historians?", "com": "Events of mass violence, or even disruptive events such as the black plague, leave things immeasurably better for the people that survive the aftermath.

Where I live, in some areas, when the Orthodox community first migrated, they were poor, and at least two churches I can think of were built by the community, and are essentially beautified garages. The community did the best they could with the resources available and many don&#039;t even notice today. That said, they went to some efforts to make it more aesthetically pleasing, not because of a divine command, but largely due to the Orthodox view on church architecture and design, in that it should feel warm, and welcoming, with the colour and icons used in a manner so as to make one feel apart of God&#039;s community and in His embrace, demonstrating His benevolence. This is also why domes are typically used too, aside from just looking neat. <br>These preferences on design differed to Western tastes and views, as they largely opted for high vaunted ceilings so as to make one feel God&#039;s majesty and demonstrate the power distance between Him and us.

My response is that the assertion there&#039;s no evidence is absurd and the claim you reject it because of this supposed lack of evidence is false. Because of the nature of man as God designed it it is impossible to not know that God exists, because God has shown it to them, and if God wills that a man should know something there is no power in heaven or on earth or under the earth which can prevent him from knowing it. He can make himself afraid of Cartesian evil demons all he likes, he will not be able to stop knowing that he is a creature of God. Because of this innate knowledge that is obvious to all of us we can&#039;t help but take that knowledge into account in all our reasoning with all our reasoning presupposing that this God exists. You&#039;re doing it right now. That the Christian God exists is the most basic and fundamental presupposition of the assertion that there is no evidence for God. It is obvious that the God of Abraham who revealed Himself in scripture is this true and living God, because no other god is anything like the God we know exists, who is omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient.

The custom was retaken by the Russian worker\u2019s movement at the end of the 19th century, in contrast to the custom imposed by the Czarist regime, where subjects and subordinates had the obligation of kissing the hands of the nobility and aristocracy. By putting the greeters on equal footing, the worker\u2019s greeting became a symbol of equality, fraternity, and solidarity, being incorporated in the etiquette of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and being used as an expression of unity amongst the working class.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the October Revolution, the ritualization of the gesture was consolidated, turning it into a protocol greeting between members of the soviet government\u2014even if the adhesion wasn\u2019t entirely consensual, at first.

Being more reserved, the socialists of Asian countries adopted a modified version, exchanging the three kisses for three hugs.

Such a notion is pernicious both for its barbarism and for its distortion of God. Do we really think that God is so small that He is bound by our rites, the rites He has given us? God is sovereign, and He will have mercy on whom He has mercy and judgment on whom He has judgment (Romans 9:15).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We can talk about sin and guilt in three ways. First there is primordial sin, the sin of Adam. We understand this not in terms of inherited guilt, but in terms of a fallen world. Primordial sin introduced sickness, suffering, evil, and death into God\u2019s perfect creation (1 John 5:19; Romans 5:12). We are born into Adam\u2019s sin in that we are born into a fallen world. But without our participation, there is no guilt. Second, there is generational sin, which we see in terms of specific propensities to sin. A child of alcoholics, for example, will inherit not the guilt of his parents but the tendency to sin as they did, or other sins associated with this generational heritage. Again, we do not have to submit to this sinful heritage, we do not have to carry it on ourselves. Finally, there is personal sin, the stuff we do ourselves, whether as perpetuation of the general fallenness of this world, the generational fallenness of our parents or surroundings, or as the invention of sins of our own. A person becomes guilty when they personally sin. A child is not guilty until they make sin a personal decision, either consciously or unconsciously.</span>", "time": 1673849096, "resto": 14465554}, {"no": 14478450, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)01:08:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14465581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14465581</a><br>Thy shall not kill or something", "time": 1673849285, "resto": 14465554}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14477467, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)21:53:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "itt: images to give you schizophrenia", "filename": "neoplatonic_cosmology", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 872, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673837618289822, "time": 1673837618, "md5": "wtmUkPFNqD6ujsxbvww/Ew==", "fsize": 437781, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "itt-images-to-give-you-schizophrenia", "replies": 3, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 14477529, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:10:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "More like gnosis", "filename": "FD9F736E-6640-4351-810A-2827117CFAD7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2448, "h": 3264, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673838638751450, "time": 1673838638, "md5": "R4eoQ5Wao/iA+7omwAiQrA==", "fsize": 1585217, "resto": 14477467}, {"no": 14477544, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:13:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14477467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477467</a><br><a href=\"#p14477529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477529</a><br>Makes sense to me", "filename": "elephant", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1186, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673838792499483, "time": 1673838792, "md5": "G8x4OdJeJ2KikVVZrPwGBA==", "fsize": 286897, "resto": 14477467}, {"no": 14478444, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)01:05:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14477529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14477529</a><br>what a way with words, to say literally fucking nothing with no meaning other than atheism bullshit", "time": 1673849130, "resto": 14477467}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14477056, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)20:37:50", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Muslims/Jews dont eat pork because of the success of the First Crusade.", "com": "Muslims and Jews don&#039;t eat pork because of the success of the First Crusade , as well asanti-White and anti-European sentiments. <br><br>Pork was eaten through out the Middle East up until the 11th century.

Meanwhile, extreme nationalism &quot;is the ideological tendency to absolutize one&#039;s national values, place one&#039;s nation at the highest position in the entire value system, and go to the point of exaggeration and xenophobia ... considers his own nation above all else and causes damage to other peoples.&quot; Therefore, extreme nationalism easily leads to isolation, partiality, selfishness, against the trend of international cooperation, association and integration, and can even promote the tendency of war and aggression.

Since the end of the Cold War, especially after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, nationalism has grown increasingly strong, not only in countries that organize state power according to the principle of centralization, but also proliferated in some countries following federalism, the principle of decentralization.

This is likely to appear when there is a lack of consensus on views and methods of protecting territorial sovereignty and national security. In the past time, hostile forces have taken advantage of the people&#039;s patriotism to incite opposition, protest or have mixed reactions on social networks. If such situations continue to occur, it will cause social distraction, fail to promote genuine patriotism and be the basis for giving rise to extreme nationalism.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Second, avoid the risk of recurrence and resolutely fight against secessionist nationalism. The current territory of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is the result of labor, production and struggle over thousands of years of nation building and defense, associated with the birth and development of the nation state. As a sovereign country, with defined territorial borders and a member of the United Nations, radical nationalist forces have not yet given up their plots and activities. Therefore, along with strengthening measures to consolidate and protect independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, the great national unity bloc is an uncompromising struggle against extreme nationalism and separatism.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In short, in the context of the strong rise of nationalism in the world today, Vietnam is inevitably affected.
