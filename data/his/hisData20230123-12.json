Black people were frequently sold away from their loved ones, resulting in permanent and heartbreaking separation. Children were often taken from their parents and sold to other plantations, never to see their families again. This practice was used to exert control over enslaved people, and to break their spirits.<br><br>Blacks were also subjected to brutal physical abuse. They were whipped, beaten, and raped. They were forced to work in dangerous and unhealthy conditions, with little rest or food. Many enslaved people were forced to work in the fields, where they were exposed to the hot sun and disease. They were also forced to do dangerous and grueling work, such as building levees or working in mines.<br><br>African-Americans were denied basic rights and freedoms. They were not allowed to marry without permission, and they were not allowed to own property or to vote. They were not allowed to educate themselves, and they were not allowed to worship as they chose.

We shall thereby render an inestimable service to a humanity tormented for thousands of years by the Jews.

About 99 per cent of them are eastern Jews [Ostjuden]. A more rigorous regime is now to be applied to these Jews.

But all this won&#039;t avail the Jews anything. The Jewish race has prepared this war; it is the spiritual originator of the whole misfortune that has overtaken humanity.

The Hungarian state is permeated with Jews, and the F\u00fchrer did not succeed during his talk with Horthy in convincing the latter of the necessity of more stringent measures. Horthy himself, of course, is badly tangled up with the Jews through his family, and will continue to resist every effort to tackle the Jewish problem aggressively. He gave a number of humanitarian counterarguments which of course don&#039;t apply at all to this situation. You just cannot talk humanitarianism when dealing with Jews. Jews must be defeated.

Of course, if brutal, this is a consistent solution. Because we must take on the responsibility of entirely solving this question in our time.

The thing is unlike these weird leftists who would be happy to take your car away and force you into public transport, all I want to do is add the freedom of choice. I want people to be able to choose whether or not they want to drive. If its a 5 minute walk to a friend&#039;s house, I want there to be a pavement you can walk on that feels comfortable. I used to cycle everywhere when I was a kid and I didn&#039;t need any bike lanes but parents would feel a lot happier if there were pedestrian only paths and bike lanes that their kids could use. If it&#039;s a massive 6 lane road I wouldn&#039;t want my kid crossing it. Before I got my car and after bikes stopped being cool or convenient since I was going to parties several miles away, public transport became handy. As long as you&#039;re in a nice area outside of peak hours it&#039;s very comfy. However I understand when people say they dislike feeling like they&#039;re in a can of tuna. It gets packed during rush hour. Some areas aren&#039;t nice and it&#039;s a lot safer in a car than it is in the black part of town. However if your journey is far faster and cheaper in a train that&#039;s quiet that you&#039;d only use during non peak hours, it&#039;s a sweet deal. That works for some people. One of my commutes a few years back was 20 minutes from my place next to the station to central London. The train journey was 12 fucking minutes and only 1 stop. The train came exactly when I needed it to. The actual journey by car would take 40 minutes. Buses are also great for the elderly because it gives them autonomy despite their inability to go places themselves by foot, bike or car due to their health.<br>If things aren&#039;t built around cars, a lot more stuff will become within walking distance. I drive but not everyday. Sure I&#039;ll use my car for any large physical purchased but I can get the milk by foot. I&#039;ve lived in the states before and unless you&#039;re in NYC or the fucking city centre it&#039;s impossible.", "time": 1674458726, "resto": 14512124}, {"no": 14516023, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)02:45:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14515533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14515533</a><br><a href=\"#p14515540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14515540</a><br>Oh I believe in universal access but not universal coverage. Everyone should be free to choose who they want to give their money to for whatever services they require as long as its legal. Basically just the free market. What I don&#039;t believe is a right is this idea that you can demand products and services from society because you did the simple act of existing. Charity exists for those who truly need it but most of the lower class can use fraternal societies to pool resources together. That shit worked so well doctor&#039;s begged the government to basically regulate them out of existence. Its cheaper than the taxes you&#039;d pay and you get better services within the free market. Why wouldn&#039;t you want that? Same for housing. The main issue are the stupid zoning laws, restrictions on construction work and people who can&#039;t make decent financial decisions. If you want to live in a shoe box because it&#039;s a 5 minute walk from Wall Street go ahead but that&#039;s your choice. Some places are only fucked because the government let the floodgates open on the border both with physical people and money. Australia is a prime example of that. Chinese people are buying houses and apartments, increasing vacancy rates, and there&#039;s millions of people coming in. Simple supply and demand. Without Asian immigration alone Australians wouldn&#039;t have these ridiculous housing prices and people lining up around the block for apartment viewings.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rip to my aussie bros</span><br>Long story short no matter which way you cut it, it&#039;s not a right to demand people to give you shit, you&#039;re not their lord in a manor, and it doesn&#039;t even benefit society.

We are all raised liberal. Most Islamic countries follow liberal laws and liberal constitutions, which inherently go against most Islamic values. Even Iran&#039;s odd situation comes from having Islamism merged with popular democracy. <br>I personally think the biggest political problem facing us is that we still haven&#039;t figured out what a centralized Islamic state actually looks like. Islamic states in the past were extremely decentralized, with the judges coming from the local community and the law being applied locally according to local circumstances and culture. However, this fell apart once European states started centralizing and fielding much larger armies fed by a much more organized workforce. They did this at the cost of Christianity, but it still worked in a material sense. For us, it&#039;s been a constant push-pull. The secular states get pushed towards Islamism, and the Islamic states get pulled towards secularism. In both cases, neither party knows what they are even arguing for.<br>As for Islamic values, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll agree with anything I say until I fix the issues within the Ummah itself.

They also oddly focus excessively on law and politics rather than philosophy and mysticism, which turns people off further. I can see you&#039;ve been the victim of such evangelizing as well.

You would have to ask one.<br><br>But the &quot;full revelation&quot; of Christ is a tall order. At the end of John&#039;s Gospel he writes:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</span><br>John 21:25<br><br>Does it follow from this that the NT is not the &quot;full revelation&quot; of Christ? Yes, at least in that limited sense that John states.
