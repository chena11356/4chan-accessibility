They might just have to hold their ground and be on the defensive to win, while the other side has to extend into dangerous territory and expose themselves more to the elements of attrition. So even if one has excellent logistics to help avoid an all-out catastrophe, and even if one has a far greater force than the other side, one can still lose to attrition anyway. Things like winter weather and disease can still ravage a force, regardless of supply lines. We saw this for instance in the Crimean war, which saw massive attrition to disease, the horrendous result of which led to much more focus by the Europeans on medical attention being available on future battlefields. The fact that newspapers at the time were beginning to be able to report on battlefield conditions to the rest of the world relatively quickly, probably also spurred this development.<br><br>So, applying this to the example of Vietnam, we can see that the gorillas just had to outlast an opponent who was strategically unwilling to escalate the conflict beyond a certain point.

This isn&#039;t directly taught in Scripture, and the evidence regarding Jesus&#039;s brothers can, at least linguistically, be understood either way. There are prophetic elements that can come to bear, e.g. Eze. 44:2, but they are not directly applied to Mary in the text. Also there is the intertexual implication of Mary as the antitype of the Ark of the Covenant, e.g. in Luke, which would render Mary as having at least some sort of inviolability, I would think. But is applying those concepts to Mary legitimate? I think it is, because if you don&#039;t the situation becomes problematic. Mary&#039;s perpetual virginity is understood to be threefold, which is that she was a virgin before, during, and after giving birth to Christ. So the miracle of the Virgin Birth has a great fullness than simply referring to the act of conception. Her virginity before birth is not disputed. Her virginity during birth means that Christ was not just conceived by a miraculous means, but also born by one, as his birth did not injure his mother but left her virginity physically intact. If this was not the case, then it means Christ&#039;s birth destroyed Mary&#039;s physical virginity, which is too impious to seriously consider. Most don&#039;t consider this, though, I think, when they reject perpetual virginity -- so I&#039;m not making an accusation of impiety to anyone. But this is a legitimate concern that gives license to read the texts differently, in a manner that is piously concerned with not imputing such a thing to God and his mother.

Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Extant biographies of Epaminondas universally describe him as one of the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: &quot;Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone.&quot; Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas&#039;s military record: &quot;For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Cicero eulogized him as &quot;the first man, in my judgement, of Greece</span>", "filename": "1650092580534", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 249, "h": 249, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672390738927363, "time": 1672390738, "md5": "ntDsZKvPraAhTZddx0ixdg==", "fsize": 41916, "resto": 14395496}, {"no": 14395752, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:00:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14395496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14395496</a><br>Fuck off.", "filename": "1654026784822", "ext": ".png", "w": 956, "h": 3414, "tn_w": 35, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672390854669419, "time": 1672390854, "md5": "jQFzoPKjhoOlqhqMc6n8NQ==", "fsize": 871385, "resto": 14395496}, {"no": 14395771, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:12:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14395752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14395752</a><br>The Laws is not a collection of actual Greek laws but Plato&#039;s opinions on what they should be.

Charon of Chalcis\u2014so says Carystius in Historical Notes--had a beautiful boy who was devoted to him. Alexander remarked on his beauty during a drinking bout hosted by Craterus.

Two of the mummies were found to belong to the Western European Y-chromosomal haplogroup R1b1a1b and the Southern European Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1b1a1b2a4b5a and mtDNA haplogroups L3h1 and N5, common in Northern Africans and Middle Easterners, respectively.

They found that the Y-chromosome haplogroup of the family was R1b, which originated in Europe and which today makes up 50\u201390% of the genetic pool of modern western Europeans. The mitochondrial haplogroup was K, which is most likely also part of a Near Eastern lineage. The profiles for Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III were incomplete and the analysis produced differing probability figures despite having concordant allele results. Because the relationships of these two mummies with the KV55 mummy had previously been confirmed in an earlier study, the haplogroup prediction of both mummies could be derived from the full profile of the KV55 data. The 20th Dynasty pair of Ramesses III and his son were found to have the haplogroup E1b1a, which has its highest frequencies in modern populations from West Africa and Central Africa, but which is rare among North Africans and nearly absent in East Africa.[20] Genetic analysis indicated the following haplogroups:</span><br><br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA<wbr>_history_of_Egypt", "time": 1672362736, "resto": 14393472}, {"no": 14394638, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)20:17:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14394593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14394593</a><br><a href=\"#p14394616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14394616</a><br>Cephalic index.

Both Moscow and Constantinople act a little too papal &quot;first without equals&quot; but lately bishops are more willing to deal with Constantinople than Moscow.

During World War II the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China sought to undermine the Soviet presence in Xinjiang and retake the province from Soviet control. The Kuomintang worked with the Hui Muslim Ma Clique warlord of Qinghai, Gen.

On the one hand, they opposed Japanese incursions into northeast China and the rise of Japanese militarism in the area, in part because of their sense of a longstanding friendship with China. On the other hand, most U.S. officials believed that it had no vital interests in China worth going to war over with Japan. Moreover, the domestic conflict between Chinese Nationalists and Communists left U.S. policymakers uncertain of success in aiding such an internally divided nation. As a result, few U.S. officials recommended taking a strong stance prior to 1937, and so the United States did little to help China for fear of provoking Japan. U.S. likelihood of providing aid to China increased after July 7, 1937, when Chinese and Japanese forces clashed on the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing, throwing the two nations into a full-scale war. As the United States watched Japanese forces sweep down the coast and then into the capital of Nanjing, popular opinion swung firmly in favor of the Chinese. Tensions with Japan rose when the Japanese Army bombed the U.S.S. Panay as it evacuated American citizens from Nanjing, killing three. The U.S. Government, however, continued to avoid conflict and accepted an apology and indemnity from the Japanese. An uneasy truce held between the two nations into 1940.<br><br>The United States was the main supplier of the oil, steel, iron, and other commodities needed by the Japanese military as it became bogged down by Chinese resistance but, in January, 1940, Japan abrogated the existing treaty of commerce with the United States.

Wu worked on the Manhattan Project, where she helped develop the process for separating uranium metal into uranium-235 and uranium-238 isotopes by gaseous diffusion. She is best known for conducting the Wu experiment, which contradicted the hypothetical law of conservation of parity. This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics, and earned Wu the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978. Her expertise in experimental physics evoked comparisons to Marie Curie.

The reason why covnersion between stalinism and trotskyism is seen as such a threat is that there was a geopolitical reality behind these labels, as in it signifies that are you a friend or an enemy of the Soviet Union. On the other hand as OP shows no such reality is present in all abrahamic schisms. Furthermore, in the case of stalinists and trotskyists the actual contents of the ideology weren&#039;t that important to the hate, and one could essentially be a trotskyists while remaining in the good graces of stalinists, by merely identifying as such, as it was a pure friend-enemy identifier. However, in the case of abrahamic religions while there often are geopolitical realities behind schisms, at the level of the average person these schisms behave as fights of pure doctrine.

I also like Psalm 18 a lot, since it appears basically twice in the Bible, see 2 Samuel chapter 22 and compare. We learn that David wrote Psalm 2 according to Acts 4:25 and that&#039;s a really good one. Psalm 110 was written by David and it is one of the most quoted in the New Testament (along with 118). Psalm 32 - also by David - is a good example of a Psalm with the Gospel message in it. Psalm 37 is a passage that many including myself find very calming, which is also another one of these Psalms. Psalm 72 is a good one about Solomon and about a righteous king in general, which was dedicated by David to Solomon. Psalm 131 and 133 are nice short Psalms by David, and I have always suspected that Psalm 132 was written by Solomon and arranged to be between these two, maybe as sort of a dedication to king David.<br><br>Psalms 25, 34, 37, 111, 112 and 145 are all acrostic and ascribed by the Bible to David. The other major acrostic Psalm is 119, which actually has 22 groupings of verses eight verses long, where all eight verses start with the same letter in Hebrew - although that one is unascribed. Other Biblical writers have also used acrostics, such as in Proverbs 31:10-31, and the first four chapters of Lamentations.", "filename": "Raised_Nun_in_Judges_18.30", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 323, "h": 169, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1672390581466143, "time": 1672390581, "md5": "OLqQUdLQI5o4m49KH1n3ww==", "fsize": 20994, "resto": 14393386}, {"no": 14395754, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:03:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14393386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14393386</a><br>that faggot didn&#039;t write any of them retard<br><a href=\"#p14394792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14394792</a><br>https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.<wbr>htm", "time": 1672391017, "resto": 14393386}, {"no": 14395851, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:39:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u201cHe maketh the wars to cease unto the end of the earth, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder, he burneth the chariot in the fire.\u201d<br>Psalm 46:9, Bible, King James V (KJV) version (accept no substitutes).", "time": 1672393181, "resto": 14393386}, {"no": 14395881, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:46:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14395754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14395754</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh historical critical method</span>", "time": 1672393609, "resto": 14393386}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14395879, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "&amp; Humanities", "com": "What phenotype is pic related?<br><br>I have a rather unique face and always struggled to find which phenotype i am most similar to.<br>Then i met this girl i briefly dated and the moment she saw me for the first time uttered &quot;wow you looks a lot like this actor from Sherlock!&quot;, but with better hairline as i am much younger.

BUT it served a greater purpose because almost all of these punishments were also to establish Israel as a nation and give it power. Of course when Jesus sacrificed Himself the need for Israel as a nation was no more, and the need for humanity to be punished was also no more, because Christ took on those burdens for us.

It&#039;s also where wild forage was most abundant, because there was nobody gathering it. This empty land is known as a &quot;buffer zone&quot;, and native tribes of any size would generally have a huge buffer zone of several square miles around their core settlements. This is why a lot of North America appeared &quot;uninhabited&quot;, really it was just vast tracks of carefully emptied buffer territory. The natives would hunt one part of their territory at a time, and allow it to repopulate and regrow when they moved on to the next.<br><br>So if you need more food cause your tribe is getting bigger, you started hunting in somebody else&#039;s buffer territory, which naturally leads to conflict, and when the conflict gets bad enough you start raiding their settlement.

Some advertising buyers said NBC began by asking $150,000 for a 30-second spot, and by this week was offering them for as little as $75,000. One NBC executive, who asked not to be identified, said NBC would give away some of the advertising time in the show as &#039;&#039;make-goods&#039;&#039; - making up to advertisers for past programs that failed to reach guaranteed audience levels. &#039;Not My Concern,&#039; Rivera Says", "time": 1672328231, "resto": 14392291}, {"no": 14392561, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)10:40:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14392546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14392546</a><br>Mr. Rivera&#039;s specials on other stations have received good ratings in the past - in some cases, hurting NBC&#039;s ratings - and that drew the attention of executives at the General Electric Company, NBC&#039;s corporate parent.<br><br>NBC&#039;s news division resisted involvement with Mr. Rivera, but he was signed by the entertainment division and Brandon Tartikoff, the network&#039;s chief programmer, with the approval of Robert C.

At about the same time the pollsters were at work, a mentally ill mother was telling Los Angeles County authorities Story-of-O tales about the McMartin preschool. Following her first accusations, police sent 200 letters to parents, listing specific questions to ask their children about whether and how Ray Buckey molested them.

This interviewing method followed from Los Angeles psychiatrist Roland Summit\u2019s \u201cchild sexual abuse accommodation syndrome,\u201d a theory about incest. Summit argues that if there is evidence of sex abuse and a child denies it, this is only further proof that it happened and a therapist should use any means necessary to help the child talk. When this technique was applied to criminal investigation, there wasn\u2019t supposed to be any problem with false allegations. Research has since suggested that as many as one in twelve sex abuse reports are fabricated, that in divorce custody disputes, the rate may be as high as one in two, and that a disturbingly common source of false allegations is mentally ill mothers who injure their children, even genitally, to get attention. But in 1984, few were thinking about such issues \u2013 conventional wisdom was that since children are innocent beings, they never lie about sexual abuse.
