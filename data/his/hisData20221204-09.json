There is general agreement on this point, though some scholars have minimized the importance of dualistic elements in Zoroastrian doctrine and even denied their existence, in order to emphasize monotheistic or crypto-monotheistic aspects (e.g., Shroff; Moulton, pp. 125-26; Gray, 1929, p. 3), perceived as incompatible with any form of dualism . From a strictly religious-historical perspective, however, dualism should not be conceived as opposed to monotheism (as polytheism must be); on the contrary, it can be viewed as \u201cmonotheism itself in two opposite and contrary aspects\u201d (Pettazzoni, pp. 96, 112 n. 109). Although this definition cannot be applied to every dualistic religious conception (cf. Bianchi, 1986, p. 109), it fits Zoroastrianism, in which a monotheistic tendency and a strong dualism coexisted. The problem is complicated by the fact that Iranian dualism was not unitary and static but a developing concept (Gnoli, 1984). Heterogeneity within the Iranian religious world must also be taken into account; in fact, the fundamentally ethical and philosophical dualism of Zoroaster (as found in the Gathas and in part of Zoroastrian tradition) must be distinguished from a metaphysical and ontological dualism in which two coexisting entities are opposed by their intrinsic natures, rather than by choice", "time": 1670164121, "resto": 14277492}], "last_modified": 1670164121}, {"no": 14277665, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)09:23:48", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "(Humanities) - arguments on abortion", "com": "How did people argue against the act of abortion?<br>How did the arguments change throughout history?", "filename": "Screenshot_2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 664, "h": 496, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 186, "tim": 1670163828165046, "time": 1670163828, "md5": "jd860y8+k2GbezJ+gRYX1A==", "fsize": 150395, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "humanities-arguments-on-abortion", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1670163828}, {"no": 14277162, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)05:51:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Did King Arthur actually exist as a person?", "filename": "C664CF50-4D5E-4C70-A089-6AAEBC11C280", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 476, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 185, "tim": 1670151102999606, "time": 1670151102, "md5": "0IJx+CFLS8TeR7TUY41k1w==", "fsize": 152277, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "did-king-arthur-actually-exist-as-a-person", "replies": 11, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 14277372, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)07:39:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14277176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14277176</a><br>*does<br>and yes. he does.", "time": 1670157559, "resto": 14277162}, {"no": 14277397, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)07:55:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14277162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14277162</a><br>No, and there is no evidence of his existence.

Eve herself was immaculately conceived. If Mary had been conceived as a sinner that would present several problems. First of all, God would be elevating a sinner to the mother of the living God and having Gabriel call her Blessed Amongst Women when she is actually in a state of sin. This would be like if the Ark of the Covenant was covered in shit. It is unfitting for the dwelling of the Lord. According to the customs of the Israelites, the dwelling place of God would have been sanctified and similarly God must have sanctified the womb of Mary for the gestation of Jesus and made it free from sin. Second of all, Jesus Christ was truly man along with being truly God. He had real, literal, physical flesh, and that flesh came from Mary alone because he had no earthly father. If Mary was a sinner then Jesus Christ&#039;s own flesh would be formed out of the flesh tainted with original sin. That is why the immaculate conception is so important.

There&#039;s no piece of history more important to Texans than the Battle of the Alamo, when Davy Crockett and a band of rebels went down in a blaze of glory fighting for independence from Mexico, losing the battle but setting Texas up to win the war. However, that version of events, as Forget the Alamo definitively shows, owes more to fantasy than reality. Just as the site of the Alamo was left in ruins for decades, its story was forgotten and twisted over time, with the contributions of Tejanos--Texans of Mexican origin, who fought alongside the Anglo rebels--scrubbed from the record, and the origin of the conflict over Mexico&#039;s push to abolish slavery papered over. Forget the Alamo provocatively explains the true story of the battle against the backdrop of Texas&#039;s struggle for independence, then shows how the sausage of myth got made in the Jim Crow South of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

Psellos describes him as a stocky man of shorter-than-average stature who nevertheless was an impressive figure on horseback. He had light-blue eyes, strongly arched eyebrows, luxuriant side whiskers\u2014which he had a habit of rolling between his fingers when deep in thought or angry\u2014and in later life a scant beard. Psellos also states that Basil was not an articulate speaker and had a loud laugh that convulsed his whole frame.[8][9] Basil is described as having ascetic tastes and caring little for the pomp and ceremony of the Imperial court, typically wearing a sombre, dark-purple robe furnished with few of the gems that usually decorated imperial costumes. He is also described as a capable administrator who left a well-stocked treasury upon his death.[10] Basil supposedly despised literary culture and affected scorn for the learned classes of Byzantium.[11]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to the 19th century historian George Finlay, Basil saw himself as &quot;prudent, just, and devout; others considered him severe, rapacious, cruel, and bigoted. For Greek learning he cared little, and he was a type of the higher Byzantine moral character, which retained far more of its Roman than its Greek origin&quot;.[12] The modern historian John Julius Norwich wrote of Basil: &quot;No lonelier man ever occupied the Byzantine throne. And it is hardly surprising: Basil was ugly, dirty, coarse, boorish, philistine and almost pathologically mean. He was in short deeply un-Byzantine. He cared only for the greatness of his Empire.
