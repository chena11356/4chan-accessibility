But there&#039;s also an important difference where Israel is much harsher than South Africa, namely the ethnic cleansing. Israel has ensured that their state has a large Jewish minority by forcing most Palestinians into exile, either to the Palestinian enclaves or to other countries. The South African government did have the same objective, the plan was that blacks would live in the Bantustans leaving the rest to the other 3 races, among whom whites were in the majority. However, blacks were never forced to move there, or to other countries, partly because cheap black labour was a crucial component of the economy, which meant that the indigenous blacks continued being in majority, a factor that made apartheid unsustainable in the long run.", "time": 1671361861, "resto": 14341585}, {"no": 14342683, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:19:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342671</a><br>I don&#039;t think Zionists know what the word &quot;indigenous&quot; means.<br><br>originating or occurring naturally in a particular place; native:<br>&quot;the indigenous peoples of Siberia&quot; \u00b7 &quot;coriander is indigenous to southern Europe&quot;", "filename": "idf haeie", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671362391082473, "time": 1671362391, "md5": "q7tp6UCOTiXKUEZyUrkZKA==", "fsize": 113584, "resto": 14341585}, {"no": 14342690, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:24:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342683</a><br>how is judaism not indigenous to Judea?", "time": 1671362698, "resto": 14341585}, {"no": 14342783, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:11:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342690</a><br>the same way french people from burgundy arent indigenous to some random island in sweden", "time": 1671365491, "resto": 14341585}, {"no": 14342792, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:15:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14341585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14341585</a><br>Israel is allowed to do this while Europe has it panties in a bunch when Russia does it?", "time": 1671365704, "resto": 14341585}, {"no": 14342800, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:20:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342792</a><br>You&#039;re blinded by modern media.

Franco came to power on the wave of anti-worker hysteria, which in turn came to be as a result of Spain falling behind in automation and thus having either to innovate faster or to break the worker movement so that wages could be dropped to profitability levels.

Best example is cooperative farms in USSR, which came to be as a labor-saving scheme - at the same time collectivization happened USSR also was creating massive fertilizer production programs, plant/animal breeding programs, tractor and combine factories, education for agricultural (and other) workers and so on, with cooperative farms&#039; profitability being ensured by thorough implementation of best production methods possible - as well as various tool, machine, tractor sharing schemes, basically free loans, boundless grain market via the State buying everything (kulaks chimping out was mainly due to them wanting higher state buying prices and not due to them wanting free market), etc. <br><br>Fascists didn&#039;t have anything even remotely close to this, even in their 4-year plans.

No growing season = no way to increase food supply when population grows = halt to societal advancement. Inuit peoples are very advanced in many ways surviving the Arctic without modern technology. Maybe they just realized it\u2019s better to have your own plot of land where I won\u2019t be bothered than genociding all your competition so you get the \u201cbest\u201d land. Ultimately that is where Western civilization has led and the realization is what is sending us downhill. Why advance when 80 million people died during WW2? That\u2019s 3% of the global population, and essentially all of which were Europeans and East Asians, the most \u201cadvanced\u201d people. If we have another one today with the same proportion of casualties, then that becomes 240 million dead humans. That\u2019s one-third of Europe\u2019s present population, or Two-thirds of the USA\u2019s population, or One out of every 6 Chinese people, or 2 Japans.

I imagine this is an unwitting influence from atheism, since Christians have far too often allowed the atheists in that dispute to lessen the burden of proof which they bear by letting them justify their professed unbelief in God by claiming there has been insufficient evidence to prove His existence; however it is mistaken that a proposition not proven or disproven is assumed to be false, it is assumed to have a truth value equal to its negation. So perhaps the atheist has succeeded in justifying his own personal unbelief, but at the same time he has succeeded in stripping himself of any basis to object to the Christian&#039;s belief, since his unbelief apparently has no more evidentiary basis than belief.

This also seems to be the effect of claiming that it might be compatible with references to male and female as long as you presuppose that trannyism is correct, arguing that scripture does not necessarily condemn it.

The only way it can exist is that God sets the very first church in motion (in the New Testament), and the church goes about reaching the lost and reproducing from there. That&#039;s how the Lord uses churches to do the work of spreading the Gospel (the church is the pillar and ground of the truth), which makes it possible for people to be saved, as the churches are used, along with God&#039;s word, to bring individual conviction in a person&#039;s heart. Anywhere there are saved people, then they can form into an assembly that is called out by God, no matter what the situation may be, and continue the work, including to spread the Gospel just as they received the Gospel from other of God&#039;s people before them. And indeed, they will do so since New Testament tells us to do this.<br><br>Once you have a church body, you can then elect a pastor from those who meet the qualifications laid out in the New Testament, however Christ is always the head of the church and it is His church. As I&#039;ve seen in practice, the church body will be consulted from time to time to vote on things deemed to be of importance, and on things that are deemed of lesser importance than that maybe just the heads of households (the men) will be consulted. The church might appoint deacons (who must meet the Biblical requirements) to handle practical responsibilities. The term &quot;ordination&quot; in this context simply means something that is done and decided by the consent of the church. The pastor or deacons might need to be changed if events transpire that they are no longer qualified for the position. It&#039;s possible for a church to go on without a pastor for a while while they deliberate on who they should appoint.

This was what the Westminster Assembly was originally about, to create the new state religion of England, and it specifically notes that the state has the power to call church councils in its Confession. Some modern Presbyterian denominations have removed this, but their ecclesiology exists in tension with their function as merely one denomination among many.

I believe that such activities do exist, and some of them are eating food, drinking water, and preserving your life in general. The reason why preservation of life is an objective goal of living beings is because I accept the value of life axiomatically. To be clear, I am not talking about the value of a SPECIFIC life, but rather I&#039;m talking about the value of LIFE in general. A particular life might be worthless, but that doesn&#039;t mean LIFE is worthless. So, Life has value, and thus each living being must preserve its own life by eating, building shelters, drinking water, etc.", "filename": "548748738787", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 566, "h": 528, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1671356211326619, "time": 1671356211, "md5": "tsCsCtXpDk9mcu04qDkddg==", "fsize": 48769, "resto": 14341119, "trip": "!!SJt6aDruXj9"}, {"no": 14342525, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)04:37:52", "name": "ichor", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342222</a><br>[2/2] Before I go any further, I must explain the distinction between a persona/person and a being/entity. Every human has a consciousness, aka a singularity, aka a persona. Your experience of reading this post right now is only possible because you are a distinct person. However, you are also a being/entity. An entity/being is something that exists in some way without necessarily having a personhood. Numbers are entities, but they are not persons because they do not have a persona. They are not persons, but they exist in a metaphysical manner. <br>Activities such as eating, sleeping, drinking, and preserving our lives, are essentially preserving our personhood. We survive as distinct persons by performing such activities. However, we must perform another activity if we wish to survive as ENTITIES too. In order for us to survive as entities/beings, we must have children. Our personhood will still be destroyed upon death, but by having children we ensure the preservation and survival of our impersonal being. In a very real, metaphysical sense, your ancestors, your parents, and your family members survive within you. They are you, not as people/persons, but as a being. <br><br>Let me make one more thing clear. There is ONE common characteristic among ALL living beings; THEY ALL REPRODUCE. What commonality exists between a man and a dog, or a worm, or a bee, or a tree, or an amoeba? They all reproduce. This is a very STRONG indication that procreation is one of the goals of humanity. What happens if you don&#039;t eat? You die and your personhood is destroyed. What happens if you don&#039;t procreate? You eventually die and your being is destroyed. If someone tells me &quot;I dont want to have children&quot;, what I hear him saying is &quot;I dont want to eat food&quot;.", "time": 1671356272, "resto": 14341119, "trip": "!!SJt6aDruXj9"}, {"no": 14342534, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)04:43:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14341119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14341119</a><br>you won\u2019t say that after i put my double barrel up your ass and set your brain back in Its place, I\u2019m gonna have 5, children minimum and you can\u2019t stop me, gf is already pregnant with the first", "time": 1671356635, "resto": 14341119}, {"no": 14342575, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:03:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14341119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14341119</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no good arguments against anti-natalism</span><br>There are no good arguments for anti-natalism either.", "time": 1671357805, "resto": 14341119}, {"no": 14342641, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:48:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342229</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;breeders</span><br>not even as joke or an insult, rope and rid us of your retarded ass", "time": 1671360525, "resto": 14341119}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14339656, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:16:53", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "&amp; Humanities", "com": "Has Marx become an antiquated author with the advent of artificial intelligence?", "filename": "1671213554512817", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 711, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 177, "tim": 1671301013192474, "time": 1671301013, "md5": "KERiH1m5bnG4EH04bmTOGA==", "fsize": 195117, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "humanities", "replies": 16, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 14339665, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)13:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14339656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14339656</a><br><br><br>20 specific professions that will disappear due to artificial intelligence:<br><br>1.

Remains belonging to the E-M78 subgroup, dating from about 7000 years ago, were discovered in Avellaner cave, Spain (Lacan et al., 2011). Another E-M78 sample from the Sopot culture was found in Hungary (5000-4800 BCE) (Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi-Nagy, 2015). This indicates that E-M78 men most likely arrived with Neolithic farmers from the Fertile Crescent to Europe and even Asia (Battaglia et al., 2009). Within a few centuries, haplogroup E-V13 became one of the most widespread male lineages in Europe, reaching far beyond the borders of Europe and the Mediterranean, as Asia (Cruciani et al., 2007).&quot;<br><br>&quot;4.

I disagree with some of this anon. Odin didn&#039;t hang himself to prevent the apocalypse at all. He was much younger when he sacrificed himself, he was carrying Mimir&#039;s head to the source of all knowledge (a treat this is a universal concept) and he did it for himself, to discover the runes, not out of altruism. In the Eddas at least this all isn&#039;t said to have happened after Idunn was kidnapped and the death of Baldur, so likely before Ragnarok could be foreseen by him in the Eddas.<br><br>It does seem that Odin was constantly fighting against time in the myths, but this could have been a theme later added or woven into the context of each tale. But in more ways than one Odin is an inversion of Jesus, especially in regards to sacrifice. Christ committed to the cross to save us from our nature in a sense, the final scapegoat, Rene Girard talks about this at length. Very much worth reading or looking into, Christians love him because he helps them rationalize still going to church, Nietzschean people and libruls love him for building off Nietzsche and themes of great literature.<br><br>Anyway, Odin demands sacrifice, human sacrifice in particular because his vision for man is that of the warrior. Odin doubles down on our nature as men and says that it can be made perfect, all his sons like Baldur and Thor are reflections of this. To Odin the warrior is perfect, especially the best warrior. I won&#039;t even speculate on Ragnarok because some think it is just a Norse or Icelandic equivalence of Semitic tier judgement day events. But the difference in Odin and Jesus&#039; sacrifice relates back to many pre-Christian themes, the &quot;master morality&quot; Nietzsche talked about and how it was ultimately overcame all throughout the world via guilt, hesitation, reflection, etc. in these people who were the &quot;masters&quot;.

This horde roamed the great Eurasian Steppe for centuries, migrating back and forth from east to west. Some of them stayed in the Carpathian Basin and the surrounding mountains, while the majority kept going back to the Asia. During this migratory period, they came in contact with various other steppenigger tribes and other Asiatic peoples, and their language started to get influenced by those they came in contact with, thus all the Turkic and Persian loanwords. They also kept establishing proto-states, with it&#039;s location constantly shifting towards the west. Then they finally came into the Carpathian Basin which was ripe for conquest, as it was a largely ungoverned and uncivilized territory stuck between the Western and Eastern civilizations. They quickly subdued the then indigenous Slavs and other such mongrels, then went on to raid across the continent in both directions. They were promptly stopped by the Franks and the Byzantines, and half of them took up Christianity and massacred the other half who wanted to remain pagan, so there went half of their original gene pool. From that point on they started mixing with the remaining Slavs and newly arrived Germans, especially after the Mongols wiped out most of what remained from the Asiatic gene pool. This was also true for their language, with Latin also added to the mix. And this is how it pretty much stayed for the remainder of their history. Now they are genetically a Germanic and Slavic mixed people group sprinkled with some regressive Asian genes. You can still spot a couple of them with slanted eyes and generally Asian features, but it&#039;s becoming more and more rare.

Capitalism decided to create new identities and split their customer base, thus increasing costs and reducing profit, because... they just did? Splitting the family is more complex, culturally it doesn&#039;t really make any sense. economically it is ambiguous: female employment always existed, it just went into overdrive during WW2 due to the literal lack of labour force needed to sustain demand. Post-war, an increase in labour supply (or in Marxian terms, &quot;a reserve army of labour&quot;) would mean a lower cost per labourer, which at once means both higher profits and lower consumption in case there aren&#039;t big enough economic units to consume it. Disrupting the family in this case is then completely counterproductive to capitalism&#039;s intentions and laws, and to that it must be added the decreasing amount of births, which lower the labour force and bring increased taxes, stifling profits and consumption. to sustain the ever increasing pensions. Capitalism arguably did not create migration either, at most took advantage of it to bolster the already existing labour force. Already rich countries attract immigration, it&#039;s not immigration which creates rich countries. All that is taking capitalism as an easily discernable system and not as it actually is, a net of human relations regulated by clear contracts and treaties that can hardly be separated by the culture it is in. To say that one can predict its future by knowing its inner &quot;laws of motion&quot; is to ignore its human character and to ironically reify something that isn&#039;t, which is why Marxists can&#039;t for the sake of themselves ever get a unified view of anything, except of the French Revolutions and the German Peasant War, on which their prophets Marx (pbuh) and Engels (pbuh) directly wrote.", "time": 1671324271, "resto": 14339513}, {"no": 14342128, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:41:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "communism will win", "filename": "1635542900270", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1170, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1671345715556000, "time": 1671345715, "md5": "vz3jkKdEeUeSiVLJ6gqqVw==", "fsize": 233371, "resto": 14339513}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14342030, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:50:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How did the English conquer England from the Britons exactly?", "filename": "1111", "ext": ".png", "w": 699, "h": 956, "tn_w": 182, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671342643328785, "time": 1671342643, "md5": "YgPgLT4aCFW0KckjD6nInQ==", "fsize": 1212043, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-did-the-english-conquer-england-from-the", "replies": 14, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 14342036, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342030</a><br>Through wars and mass migration.", "time": 1671342793, "resto": 14342030}, {"no": 14342039, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:54:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342030</a><br>Is that a male woman?", "time": 1671342848, "resto": 14342030}, {"no": 14342041, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:54:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342030</a><br>conquest and migration.", "time": 1671342882, "resto": 14342030}, {"no": 14342042, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:55:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lol nice arms pussy, dyel?", "time": 1671342903, "resto": 14342030}, {"no": 14342047, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:56:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342030</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;britons had long grown soft and dependent upon roman military protection</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nobility now had little connection with the commoners, mostly spoke latin</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oftentimes saw the angles, saxons, jutes, etc as good foederati allies against the picts and gaels who assaulted their shores</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anglo-saxon warrior class was rewarded with wealth, land, and titles, giving them prestige beyond measure</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when the anglo-saxons got too powerful, either the native upper class married into them and adopted much of their culture (as is likely given the prevalence of brittonic names among many ostensibly anglo-saxon royal lines) or they revolted against the anglo-saxons and were destroyed or subjugated (as popular history relates)</span>", "time": 1671342989, "resto": 14342030}, {"no": 14342065, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "thats a guy, i know because i jerked off to her before and i remember her face", "time": 1671343323, "resto": 14342030}, {"no": 14342068, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14342030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14342030</a><br>Saxon invasion was very similar to Passing of Rhine by Franks.
