The first Roman law forbidding polygamy was by that emperor made in 320 AD, stating: &quot;No married man may have a concubine during the existence of his marriage.&quot; In this law the term &quot;concubine&quot; refers to wife by usus, not to a slave. Usus normally required a written legal contract and the wife was a legal, freeborn wife. In Roman society a usus wife was just as legal as the primary wife. Originally, Romans had several different grades of wife and it was common for wealthy men to have all grades. This gradually devolved into having a primary wife and various usus wives. This does not include sex with slaves who were not considered any kind of wife. Roman law provided for what we now call &quot;common law&quot; wives, meaning automatic usus status even without a contract if the woman slept in the man&#039;s house for over one year. The Twelve Tables specifically states the terms of this law as follows:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;If a wife should sleep for three nights in a year out of her husband&#039;s house, she should not be subject to his paternal power.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Thus any woman could escape being an automatic wife by claiming she slept for three nights outside of the house.

Tests revealed he had not been poisoned, injured, nor was he suffering from any sort of injury. Yet, the man was most definitely dying. After four days of agony spent in the hospital, Kinjika died on the fifth. It was said he died of bone pointing.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Bone pointing&quot; is a method of execution used by the Aborigines. It is said to leave no trace, and never fails to kill its victim. The bone used in this curse is made of human, kangaroo, emu or even wood. The shape of the killing-bone, or kundela, varies from tribe to tribe. The lengths can be from six to nine inches. They look like a long needle. At the rounded end, a piece of hair is attached through the hole, and glued into place with a gummy resin. Before it can be used, the kundela is charged with a powerful psychic energy in a ritual that is kept secret from women and those who are not tribe members. To be effective, the ritual must be performed faultlessly. The bone is then given to the kurdaitcha, who are the tribe&#039;s ritual killers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These killers then go and hunt (if the person has fled) the condemned. The name, kurdaitcha, comes from the slippers they wear while on the hunt. The slippers are made of cockatoo (or emu) feathers and human hair\u2014they virtually leave no footprints. Also, they wear kangaroo hair, which is stuck to their bodies after they coat themselves in human blood and they also don masks of emu feathers. They hunt in pairs or threes and will pursue their quarry for years if necessary, never giving up until the person has been cursed.</span><br>Do you have a favourite tribe or indigenous people?

Joseph Smith, who was once muhammad in a past life, in his 1842 temple endowment play got his explanation of true reality to a near perfection. One scenario that should be known and made apparent to all religious people is where the god Micheal is put to sleep and wakes up as Adam. Adam then proceeds to build an altar and prays to god with the words:<br>Oh God hear the words of my mouth<br>Oh God hear the words of my mouth<br>Oh God hear the words of my mouth<br>Then Lucifer approaches him from behind and says: I hear you, what is it you want. <br>This alone is proof that all vocalised prayer of any sort and sincerity is answered by the same being, Lucifer, who is the god of this world with.<br><br>Thanks for reading", "time": 1668513446, "resto": 14196061}, {"no": 14196444, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)08:36:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14196061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14196061</a><br>https://islamqa.info/en/answers/143<wbr>146/how-we-should-react-to-websites<wbr>-that-vilify-islam-and-what-are-the<wbr>-ways-in-which-we-can-support-islam<wbr><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The websites that speak ill of the religion of Allah and of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are no different from the gatherings where people say similar things that constitute kufr.
