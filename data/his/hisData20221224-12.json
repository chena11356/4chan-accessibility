I know how mendaciously and foolishly this institution is being written about, spoken about and blasphemed, especially abroad. Certainly, like any other deprivation of freedom, the concentration camp is a harsh and strict measure. Hard labor that forges new values, a regulated lifestyle, an unprecedented cleanliness in accommodation and personal hygiene, sound food, strict but fair treatment, guidance to learn to work again and to acquire new craftsmen\u2019s skills \u2013 these are the methods of education. The slogan that stands above these camps is: There is a path to freedom. Its milestones are: obedience, diligence, honesty, orderliness, cleanliness, sobriety, truthfulness, readiness to make sacrifices and love of the fatherland. [\u2026] At any rate one result of this rigorous procedure against criminality is that the total number of criminal offences has again declined last year by a further 7%.</span>", "time": 1671824596, "resto": 14367354}, {"no": 14367561, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)14:45:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14367553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14367553</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[In the concentration camps] we have established so-called Kapos. This arrangement was put in place by Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Eicke, who has done very creditable work in general in organizing our system of control over these subhumans. So one prisoner is the overseer or senior prisoner, if you like, with responsibility for 30, 40 or even more than 100 other prisoners. The moment he becomes a Kapo he no longer sleeps with them. He is responsible for meeting work targets, for preventing any sabotage, for seeing they are all clean and that the beds are set up. You soldiers would be pleased with this lot, though most cannot speak a word of German. A new recruit in an army barracks could not be more spick and span. The Kapo sees to that. He has to get his men to work and the minute we are not satisfied with him he stops being a Kapo and goes back to sleeping with the others. He knows only too well that they will kill him on the first night. A Kapo gets special privileges. Of course, I can say quite candidly that it\u2019s not my job to featherbed anybody but to rid the streets of subhumans and use them to bring us victory. That\u2019s my task and I keep it in view. These camps hold the lowlifes from all the European nations: Jews and Russians and Poles and Czechs and French. Wherever criminals are found in the territories under German occupation they are sent to us. Because we can\u2019t get by only with Germans, we naturally arrange things so that a Frenchman is Kapo in charge of Poles, or a Pole is in charge of Russians, so that one nation is played off against another.</span>", "time": 1671824757, "resto": 14367354}, {"no": 14367584, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)14:51:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14367481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14367481</a><br><br>He doesn&#039;t have a history degree so he&#039;s exactly like the Jews you screech about", "time": 1671825088, "resto": 14367354}, {"no": 14367630, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)15:03:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14367561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14367561</a><br>Here&#039;s probably the weirdest shit they&#039;ve got on Himmler:<br><br>Dear Professor [Clauberg],<br><br>The Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS [Himmler] has today instructed me to write to you and to inform you of his request that, after prior consultation with SS-Gruppenf\u00fchrer [Oswald] Pohl and the camp doctor of the Ravensbr\u00fcck female concentration camp, you should travel to Ravensbr\u00fcck to employ your procedure to carry out the sterilization of Jewesses.<br><br>Before you begin your work the Reichsf\u00fchrer would like to hear from you roughly how long it would take to sterilize 1000 Jewesses.

That&#039;s a poor metaphor, but you get the idea. <br><br>Guys, these philosophical issues are the result of the violent union between Platonism and biblical Judaism. Christians desperately tried merging biblical Judaism and biblical prophecies with Greek philosophy. The problem is that Judaism and Greek philosophy are incompatible, which is why modern Christian theologians are facing so many problems. <br>One of the earlier problems that Christians faced was the problem of the Logos. According to Plato, God&#039;s Logos (i.e. the Forms) is not part of God. The Forms exist outside of God, according to Plato. The Christians claimed that this is false, and they argued that the Logos/Forms is with God. The problem that arises is this: if the creation of the cosmos takes place through the Logos, and the Logos is part of God, then the creation of the cosmos is not a free choice but rather an inevitable result of God&#039;s nature. If the Logos is eternal, then the creation through the Logos must also be eternal. <br>Christians &quot;solved&quot; this issue by introducing the concept of love. If the creation of the cosmos is the result of God&#039;s love, then it is a free choice. God can choose to act upon His love or not.

Participants\u2019 views on the former issues (e.g. gay marriage and abortion) were more strongly associated with their overall conservatism than their views on government regulation (e.g. gun control, higher taxes for the wealthy, speech codes on campus). Interestingly, higher intelligence was associated with less conservative views on traditional gender roles on the one hand, but more \u201cconservative\u201d views opposing government regulation.

There was a constant string of mass murders and war crimes committed by American troops throughout the entire decade of American involvement in the war.<br>Every major American unit in Vietnam, down to the brigade, had &quot;incidents&quot; wherein Vietnamese civilians were abused, murdered, and raped. The only thing exceptional about My Lai was its scope, killing hundreds at once was a step too far that couldn&#039;t be hidden. But the brutalization and killings of civilians was routine.<br>Even the most cursory examination of the evidence shows this, and it isn&#039;t even hidden or disputed. The US military&#039;s own analysis showed that during Operation Speedy Express, for example, 5000-7000 of the 10000 Vietnamese killed were civilians. The most outrageous stories there coming from the helicopter and light plane crews that admitted to military investigators that they constantly just murdered anyone they saw for any reason they could think of.<br>The ubiquitous search and destroy missions were much more up close and personal. Many times these were just covers for the wholesale destruction of a village that happened to be close to a place where a Viet Cong ambush had taken place, or where a GI had gotten injured or killed by a trap or mine. Troops bombed the village, rolled in, burned the houses, killed the livestock, raped the women, and then killed them along with anyone else they could get their hands on. I suggest you read Jamie Henry&#039;s account of one such attack. The highlight is really something, and it was attested to by multiple witnesses to military investigators. Or you could read about Roy Bumgarner, who was known as a murderer among troops and was convicted of manslaughter after gunning down four civilians and blowing their heads up with a grenade to teach some new recruits how to conduct themselves. <br>I can&#039;t do the extent of the violence justice, there is too much and I get too angry.

Also explain the Church&#039;s current understanding of the separability of accidents from substance:<br><br>&quot;The teaching of Catholic philosophy on the distinct reality of certain absolute, not purely modal, accidents was occasioned by the doctrine of the Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist, though the arguments for the theory are deduced from natural experience. The same doctrine, however, suggests the further question, whether such accidents may not be separable from substance. Reason alone offers no positive arguments for such separability. The most it can do is to show that separability involves no inherent contradiction, and hence no absolute impossibility; the Omnipotence that endows substance with the power of supporting accidents can, it is claimed, supply some other means of support. Nor would the accidents thus separated, and supernaturally supported, lose their character as accidents, since they would still retain their essential property, i.e. natural exigence of inhesion. Of course the intrinsic possibility of such separation depends solely on the supernatural interference of God, nor may it extend to all classes of accidents. Thus, e.g., it is absolutely impossible for vital faculties, or acts, to exist outside their natural subjects, or principles. Theorists who, like the Cartesians, deny the objective, distinct entity of all accidents have been obliged to reconcile this negation with their belief in the Real Presence by maintaining that the species, or accidents, of bread and wine do not really remain in the Eucharist, but that after Consecration God produces on our senses the impressions corresponding to the natural phenomena. This theory obviously demands a seemingly unnecessary multiplication of miracles and has at present few if any serious advocates.&quot;<br><br>https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01<wbr>096c.htm", "time": 1671848757, "resto": 14366222}, {"no": 14369064, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)21:29:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14367825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14367825</a><br>Yeah the issue is that Catholics who are born to the faith don&#039;t give a single fuck about muh angelic doctor Aquinas and his fangirling over Aristotle.

Lamentations is indeed making several different comparisons to how they were formerly and how they would become but not in the way you think The transition in complexion was not from a snow white appearance to a charcoal black one;it was from a ruddy ruby complexion to coal black.Pic related shows natural uncut and unpolished rubies. As you can see, these are not white with \u201cblushing\u201d tones of red. They\u2019re brown, black, and dark reddish-brown.<br><br>He was describing how the horrors of slavery in the hot sun would make their already dark skin much darker as it tanned.That\u2019s why the next portion of the text specifies their physical description as \u201cmore ruddy in BODY than rubies.\u201d It also refers to their ruddy appearance in the past tense.Notice only the rubies and charcoal are given bodily designations not the snow. Their BODIES were more ruddy than rubies and their FACES became black as coal but their whiteness is not given similar treatment.This is because it was not in relation to their skin color.In scripture whiteness is used several times in the abstract sense to convey the idea of cleansing from sin:<br>Psalm 51:7 &quot;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.&quot;<br><br>Daniel 12:10 &quot;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.&quot;", "filename": "natural rubies", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 535, "h": 453, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1671748534002658, "time": 1671748534, "md5": "3Zd5fxugP6EuDoR1IBCqMg==", "fsize": 45600, "resto": 14362176}, {"no": 14363768, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14363559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14363559</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Lamentations 4:7 they were, as you admitted a second ago that this passage was indeed describing their appearance.</span><br>I made no such admission.

I will further elucidate you on this matter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;II Kings 5:27 - Therefore the leprosy of Na&#039;aman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.

They said, \u201chath the Lord indeed spoken only to Moses? Hath he not spoken also by us?\u201d Their challenge to Moses angered God, so as a punishment He caused Miriam to become white.<br><br>So you have Lamentations 4:7 &quot;white as snow&quot; compared to II Kings 5:27 as well as Numbers 12:10 &quot;white as snow&quot;. How can this same whiteness be a matter-of-fact description of the Israelites&#039; natural skin tone in the first passage yet stated clearly to be as a mark of an unnatural, shameful and unholy curse in the latter two?

He forces me to self-identify and exist as &quot;a peasant&quot; while he self-identifies as &quot;a king&quot;, he considers dominating and abusing me to be the primary reason why other characters should be animated, and he considers labor and service to be the primary reason why I should exist (eternally).

And so would you, me, or anyone, including the most dogmatic atheists and skeptics, because it is VASTLY more self-evidently real than this brief little experience of life on Earth we have now. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep, deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.", "filename": "1574742683565", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1671652017744548, "time": 1671652017, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 14354283}, {"no": 14358223, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)14:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14354401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14354401</a><br>This is cope", "time": 1671652286, "resto": 14354283}, {"no": 14358397, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)15:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14354311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14354311</a><br><a href=\"#p14354374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14354374</a><br>filtered stinky smegma cocks lmao kys goyim", "time": 1671653947, "resto": 14354283}, {"no": 14358410, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)15:20:50", "name": "Radiochan", "com": "<a href=\"#p14354283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14354283</a><br>you&#039;ll have to be around other jews", "time": 1671654050, "resto": 14354283, "trip": "!!8R5IcuH3PgQ"}, {"no": 14358417, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)15:22:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14354480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14354480</a><br>There are a lot of black orthodox jews.

There is often heavy social stigma against converts in many Jewish communities. Some of the greatest rabbis and biblical figures in Jewish history were converts or descended from converts.

It was close to where I live in Utah and I thought it&#039;d be interesting. I emailed the rabbi before going asking if he&#039;d mind and what&#039;s appropriate. He was kind of cold and straight forward. I went shabbat eve and shabbat morning. There were primarily ashkenazi jews, some dressed in hasidic clothes, most not. There were some sephardi and mizrahi jews, some in hasidic clothes. Some yiddish phrases were thrown around. Some Jews were sort of &quot;Professional Jews&quot; in that they took their Jewishness seriously, others were more normie Jews that sort of showed up because that&#039;s just what they did. <br>Shabbat eve was sort of this informal Jewish party time where Jews in street clothes came from work or school and they all sang and dance. They did this weird conga line type thing around the main lectern in the center of the room. The rabbi very begrudgingly waved for me to join them, which I did. The Jews there were generally very friendly toward me until I told them I wasn&#039;t a Jew and was just visiting, then their smiles would fade and become like the rabbi&#039;s. The shabbat morning was more familiar to me. It was more formal and solemn but still kind of happy. The meeting was all centered around bringing the Torah out of the ark and quasi royal pomp and circumstance where they took turns cradling it. Then they unrolled it and took turns reading from it aloud. I think they sung some psalms and did that whole quaking thing where they rock back and forth while they do it. At the very end the rabbi gave some short spiel in English related to what they just read and sort of connected it to what was going on in their community. The passage they read was about Abraham going to Canaan and so he likened it to a Jewish couple they knew in the community that was making aliyah.
