Without a market to allocate goods</span><br>Even from a Marxist perspective, the marketplace is fair though. You buy and sell at a price reflecting cost of production into that price. The capitalist provides goods and reasonable prices according to what they&#039;re worth, and the worker exchanges their labor power to the capitalist for what it costs to reproduce it. This is sort of where the liberal analysis ends, though. The liberal analysis just sees the transaction, decides it&#039;s fair, and moves on. The billionaire contributes his capital, the worker contributes his labor, commodities are produced, and then exchanged for fair prices. Everything is fair and everyone is happy!<br><br>But Where the Marxist criticism comes in is that focusing purely on the marketplace only focuses on a relationship between things bought and sold on the market, but ignores the social relationships between the people themselves.

Many blamed Gorbachev for allowing it to happen, and revanchists who have a self-centered view of history exist like former KGB man Putin. These people were determined to remain in the former corrupt ways with corrupt cronies and police-like suppression of as many people as possible.

They believe that the cultic use of images (bowing, kissing, processing, praying) is justified by God becoming man, as Christ&#039;s human body is understood as an image in a manner that is analogous to man-made images. I won&#039;t be making an argument that these distinctions are false, but examining where their logic leads, particularly in relation to man-made images of Christ. I am not also seeking to demonstrate that man-made images in themselves are wrong. Definitions: &quot;worship&quot; is the degree of honor due only to God; &quot;veneration&quot; is a lesser degree of honor which can be given to creatures and objects.<br><br>1. If the honor paid to a man-made image passes to its prototype, then worship paid to a man-made image would pass to its prototype. So if a person worshiped a painting of Jesus as if it were God, this worship would pass to Jesus. Catholic/Orthodox theology would state that it is forbidden to worship a man-made image, a piece of wood or stone, as if it were God; but this is still the logic of this understanding of the relation between image and prototype.<br><br>2. Given that worship given to a man-made image of Jesus would pass to Jesus, but this is forbidden, it means that there is a fundamental distinction between man-made images and the image of Christ&#039;s human body. No one would claim that if Jesus were standing physically in front of them, that the proper response would not be to worship him as God, despite him being present in an image. But this is denied for man-made images. So man-made images and Christ&#039;s body are both &quot;images&quot; only in the broadest sense of the term, and are not actually analogous to each other.<br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "christ-pantocrator", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1492, "tn_w": 134, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673525539765494, "time": 1673525539, "md5": "Qxe+mxEMOJbCZJIfQguX6Q==", "fsize": 499270, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "simple-argument-against-images", "replies": 29, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 14456951, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:12:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14456947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14456947</a><br>3. If worship cannot be paid to a man-made image of God, that is, if one cannot worship a painting or statue as if it were God, this means that God can only be worshiped without images. If one wishes to worship God, they cannot do so by utilizing a man-made image. One could venerate God through a man-made image, but one cannot worship God through a man-made image. God can only be worshiped without man-made images. Frankly, I think this point alone vitiates the fundamental claim of iconoclasts.<br><br>4. This begs the question of why I would want to venerate God through a man-made image when the proper response of the soul to God is to worship him. If Christ were physically before me, I would not want to simply venerate him, that is, to give him the honor I would give to merely a man. He is my God, and I would want to worship him as my God. So by utilizing a man-made image of Christ, I am actually unable to pay Christ the honor that he is properly due. Perhaps one could say there is worth in, at times, giving God less honor than what he deserves; this strikes me as impious.<br><br>5. A way around this would be to claim that worship of images is actually acceptable. In which case, you are worshiping a rock or a piece of wood as if it is your God. Your intention is indeed that the true God is worshiped, but you are still paying the worship due to the living God to a rock or to a stone.

Again, though, the word does not necessarily imply virginity. \u201cAlmah\u201d occurs seven times in the Hebrew Scriptures (Genesis 24:43; Exodus 2:8; Psalm 68:25; Proverbs 30:19; Song of Solomon 1:3; 6:8; Isaiah 7:14).

Matthew 1 gives the genealogical proof that Jesus, in His humanity, was a direct descendant of Abraham and David through Joseph, Jesus\u2019 LEGAL father. The genealogy in Luke 3 traces Jesus\u2019 lineage through His mother, Mary. Jesus is a descendant of David by adoption through Joseph and by blood through Mary. \u201cAs to his earthly life [Christ Jesus] was a descendant of David\u201d (Romans 1:3).<br><br>For the Jeconiah curse, that could be a limited reference to the king\u2019s own children\u2014his immediate offspring. On a related note, the phrase \u201cin his lifetime\u201d could apply to the entire verse. The curse would only be in force while the king lived. This is exactly what happened, as Jeconiah was not successful as a king (he only reigned for three months before he surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s forces), and none of his sons (he had seven of them, 1 Chronicles 3:17\u201318) reigned over Judah.<br><br>Another solution concerns the virgin birth. Jesus only had one human parent, Mary. His mother was of David\u2019s line, but not through Jeconiah (Luke 3:31). Joseph was Jesus\u2019 legal father, but not His physical one. Thus, Jesus was of royal blood through Mary, but the curse of Jeconiah stopped with Joseph and was not passed on to Jesus.<br><br>A third possible solution is that God reversed the curse on Jeconiah\u2019s family. This is hinted at by the prophet Haggai, who told Zerubbabel, Jeconiah\u2019s grandson, that God would make him a \u201csignet ring\u201d on God\u2019s hand (Haggai 2:23). Zerubbabel was blessed by God as the governor of Judea, and he prospered in that role when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem. The \u201csignet ring\u201d imagery of Jeconiah\u2019s curse is repeated in Zerubbabel\u2019s blessing, which must be more than coincidence. Several rabbinic sources teach that Jeconiah repented in Babylon and that God forgave him and lifted the curse.<br><br>Part Final.", "time": 1673536372, "resto": 14457345}, {"no": 14457607, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)10:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14457590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14457590</a><br>/Thread", "time": 1673536478, "resto": 14457345}, {"no": 14457612, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)10:16:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14457548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14457548</a><br>These problems have been addressed already.

The Epistle to the Hebrews is often cited in support of this view: the temple sacrifices are described as being imperfect, since they require repeating, and as belonging to a covenant that was &quot;becoming obsolete and growing old&quot; and was &quot;ready to vanish away&quot;. Christ&#039;s crucifixion, being a sacrifice which dealt with sin once and for all, negated any need for further animal sacrifice. Christ himself is compared to the High Priest who was always standing and performing rituals and sacrifices. Christ, however, having performed his sacrifice, &quot;sat down&quot; \u2014 perfection having been finally attained. Further, the veil or curtain to the Holy of Holies is seen as having been torn asunder at the crucifixion \u2013 figuratively in connection with this theology, and literally according to the Gospel of Matthew. For these reasons, a third temple, whose partial purpose would be the re-institution of animal sacrifices, is seen as unnecessary and thus superseded. Irenaeus and Hippolytus were among early church writers who foresaw a rebuilding of the Temple, as necessary for the preparation for the reign of the Antichrist.<br><br>Additionally, Jesus himself stated, in response to a Samaritan asking whether it is right to worship on Mount Gerizim or Mount Zion, that &quot;a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem...

However the fossil fuels will run out soon and nothing comparably powerful will ever replace them, and so males will reassert patriarchy and females will be sex slaves again, just like they were for all of civilizational history.", "time": 1673607584, "resto": 14459567}, {"no": 14462351, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:20:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://psmag.com/.amp/environment/<wbr>17-to-1-reproductive-success", "time": 1673608827, "resto": 14459567}, {"no": 14462358, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:22:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14462351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14462351</a><br>kek, there&#039;s the meme. i knew it was just a matter of time.<br>read this if you want the proper explanation: https://www.researchgate.net/public<wbr>ation/325368259_Cultural_hitchhikin<wbr>g_and_competition_between_patriline<wbr>al_kin_groups_explain_the_post-Neol<wbr>ithic_Y-chromosome_bottleneck", "time": 1673608967, "resto": 14459567}, {"no": 14462496, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)07:08:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14462358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14462358</a><br>Can you explain how this disproves what I posted?", "time": 1673611727, "resto": 14459567}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14462490, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)07:07:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And then... the fucking sumerian dog says...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can&#039;t see a thing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So I&#039;ll open this one</span>", "filename": "image-asset", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 667, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673611623445343, "time": 1673611623, "md5": "0uAGd87sEK2fYbKLyXwVvw==", "fsize": 79084, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "and-then-the-fucking-sumerian-dog-says", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 14462495, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)07:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14462490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14462490</a><br>Funniest shit I&#039;ve ever seen", "time": 1673611720, "resto": 14462490}, {"no": 14462502, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)07:11:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14462495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14462495</a><br>dude... he legit coulnd&#039;t see a thing, so he fucking opened -that- one HAHA omg", "time": 1673611875, "resto": 14462490}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14460932, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:03:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;John 14:14</span><br>If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dJesus, will you heal all the kids with cancer?\u201d</span><br><br>Why won\u2019t he do it?", "filename": "994B5867-1AC6-4BC8-BEBF-6BD7D7215E6B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2045, "h": 2560, "tn_w": 199, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673582615351541, "time": 1673582615, "md5": "+2fBIxNrL0T7LGAwC2OrOg==", "fsize": 674544, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "john-1414", "replies": 316, "images": 30, "unique_ips": 21, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 14460966, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:10:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14460932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460932</a><br>revelation 21:4", "filename": "81B3172C-2243-4C6B-9DB4-A8011CC64696", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 66, "tim": 1673583034906432, "time": 1673583034, "md5": "kF0/S4b64Z+NxOS9qQHfhw==", "fsize": 110795, "resto": 14460932}, {"no": 14460971, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:13:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14460966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460966</a><br>That\u2019s not answering a prayer, that\u2019s some future event that\u2019s been promised and never come for 2,000 years while everyone suffers.", "time": 1673583189, "resto": 14460932}, {"no": 14460981, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:17:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14460971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460971</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that\u2019s some future event that\u2019s been promised and never come for 2,000 years</span><br>you have no faith(believe), it&#039;s over", "time": 1673583443, "resto": 14460932}, {"no": 14460991, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:20:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14460981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460981</a><br>Why won\u2019t Jesus heal the kids when prayed for?

Never himself. BEN ADAM in aramaic is just &quot;Human Being.&quot; a son of Noah, Son of Adam, Son of God.

See for reference Psalm 145:19, Proverbs 10:24, 1 John 5:14-15, and 2 Corinthians 1:19-20. <br><br>Those who think that God is obligated to answer every single line item request they make are obviously ignoring what James told the Jewish believers in his epistle: &quot;You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, that you may spend it on your pleasures.&quot; (James 4:3) <br><br>Recall likewise that Jesus taught His disciples how to pray before giving them the promises relayed in in John 14:14, 15:7, and 16:23-24. It was only in the final days leading up to His crucifixion, nearly three years after these men had begun to follow Him and receive His instruction, that He gave them this generous mandate. Why does that matter? Because twisting Jesus&#039;s words into a blanket &quot;believe it and receive it&quot; guarantee distorts the essential nature and purpose of prayer in the first place; it is an outward sign of the fellowship that exists between God and His people, and a means of grace by which He shows forth His saving power through the intercessory petition of His saints.<br><br>Of course, the objection is raised that if God doesn&#039;t answer a prayer within a given time span, then it somehow disproves His existence altogether. As though God was an employee at a pizza joint with a 5 minute wait-time policy. What foolishness. <br><br>The bottom line is that God answers prayer in the way that He deems most fit and when He so chooses.

The problem is he actually pisses off a lot of historians because the history is all over the place. He&#039;s mixing in bronze age with 16th century at times and it makes no sense. The worst part about A Song of Ice and Fire is that characters do not think or act medieval but rather they think and act more modern without a faint of morality or religion. Much of the themes of family read like a lecture of the patriarchy. The books will have you believe that medieval women in the nobility were so oppressed when in fact historically women in the gentry had a immense amount of power. It&#039;s really quite silly to believe that a world with long winters would in any way function like our own or be a possible explanation why they have been functioning in the middle ages for thousands upon thousands of years. Which brings me to one of the most stupid concepts in the books being that medieval families are able to say so homogenized for generations with the same holdings longer than some of the longest medieval families in history.

This stems from historical abuses of the church. They chose to abandon the church due to the flawed nature of certain clergy at the time. These sects began to spring up as more and more lay people began trying to reintrepret the Bible and look for their own meaning, and they formed new Christian faiths from this.

My entire anglo-american side of the family fought in the war for the South. I do not think they were planters, but it&#039;s really difficult to say because most planters lost much of their wealth out of desperation to fund the confederacy. The fact is they likely owned slaves. I&#039;m not here to justify or apologize for that. They basically have brainwashed majority of Southerners into fighting this battle of morals and finger pointing when it comes to slavery and any discussion outside the politics around slavery is branded as &quot;lost cause.&quot; I think it&#039;s a complete waste to try to defend or understand the actions of slave holders in the South. I really don&#039;t care, my family fought in the Revolution, settled in the south and were culturally connected to European landholding aristocracy. This culture was impoverished and they cut the balls off of the future southern generation so that our bloodlines would not rise up again. Obviously this is logical and has happened throughout history. However, this moment marked a significant change of direction in America for the worst. My question then is how do we connect Jews and the Adam Weishaupt types to this takeover? I see a lot of claim that the Jews made up a large amount of not just the slave trade from Africa, but also of southern planter class ancestry. Among those that research the Jewish question in slavery, there seems to be this moralism where they write off all poor treatment of slaves in the South as the fault of Jewish plantation owners. I&#039;m not buying that Jewish ancestry was widespread in the Southern planter class. Anyone have any good sources on the matter? There is a Jewish community in the South going back to the colonial period, but anyone have sources on their role as plantation owners? Perhaps Jews were involved more in the slave trade itself? I&#039;m not offended by my ancestors owning slaves, but to say that the majority of slave owners were Jewish?

It cannot be assumed that salvation is denied non-Christians living in true piety and according to natural law by the God who &quot;is love&quot; (1 John 4:8), In his justice and mercy God will judge them worthy even though they are outside the true Church. This position is shared by many Orthodox who agree that God&#039;s salvation extends to all who live according to His &quot;image&quot; and &quot;participate in the Logos.&quot; The Holy Spirit acted through the prophets of the Old Testament and in the nations. Salvation is also open outside the Church.<br><br>Some compare the Church to Noah&#039;s Ark. It is not impossible for someone to &quot;survive the flood&quot; of sin by clinging to whatever driftwood is around or by trying to cobble together a raft from bits and pieces of whatever floats, but the Ark is a far safer choice to make. Likewise, the heterodox and even non-Christians might be saved simply through God&#039;s own choice, made for His own reasons, but it is far safer for any individual person to turn to the Orthodox Church. Thus, it behooves Orthodox Christians to exhort others to take this safer path.

Later Muslims, ashamed that their self declared prophet spoke Satan&#039;s words, denied the event occurred. A myriad of excuses and denials have been put forth by these later Muhammadans to cover up Muhammad&#039;s sinful error.<br><br>It must be pointed out again that the &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; event is not something made up by non-Muslims. The event is recorded by the earliest Islamic sources available on Muhammad&#039;s life. No one should think that it is a story made up by people who are critical of Islam. It is an episode directly found in the early Islamic records.<br>This topic is one of the most controversial in Islam. Satan caused Muhammad to recite his words as God&#039;s words. The background to this event is that Muhammad and his followers were being persecuted for attacking the pagan faiths of Mecca, and he did not want to further offend his Arab tribesmen, and, he wanted them to become his followers, i.e. Muslims. In fact Muhammad wished that God would not reveal anything further to him that would further alienate his fellow Arabs. So when opportunity arose, he spoke what Satan put into his heart and mind as God&#039;s word.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the Old Testament (OT), if someone caused the people to worship other gods he was put to death - Deuteronomy 13:1 - 5:</span><br><br><br>yet mo&#039; got away scott free... i bet the situation wouldnt have gone like that if it was a woman who had a false revelation", "time": 1673409686, "resto": 14451035}, {"no": 14451115, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:04:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14451085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14451085</a><br><a href=\"#p14451105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14451105</a><br>The satanic verses in ibn Ishaq is weak, anons, nice try though!

Tertullian and Cyprian corroborate the sense that the bishopric at Rome in the 3rd century was heavily apostate. By all means, if you study the controversy over Caecilian of Carthage in the early 4th century, the Roman bishop and his diocese broke communion with the authentic African bishops and their dioceses (the true church) and sided with their protegee Caecilian, and that means the so-called &quot;Donatist schism&quot; actually proceeded the other way. Catholics broke off from the true church and called that true church &quot;Donatism,&quot; not the other way around. And anyway your boy Luther was a hyper-Catholic who was simply reviving caesaropapism after centuries of ultramontanism, as well as the doctrine that anyone can baptize not just priests, which was actually one of the doctrines engineered by your Babylonian harlot church during the time of the 4th century &quot;Donatist&quot; schism.", "time": 1673587641, "resto": 14460624}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14460599, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)21:15:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why is history Eurocentric?", "filename": "eurocentric-sabine", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 537, "h": 536, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1673576113986750, "time": 1673576113, "md5": "e29D5bNwHJSVgkjYIG92UA==", "fsize": 29889, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-is-history-eurocentric", "replies": 8, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 14460605, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)21:16:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14460599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460599</a><br>Because europe was revolutioning the world with trains, steam engines, electricity and computers while the rest of retards were trapped in medieval mud favela fighting", "time": 1673576208, "resto": 14460599}, {"no": 14460808, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:21:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14460605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460605</a><br>Everything important and noteworthy happened there.", "time": 1673580113, "resto": 14460599}, {"no": 14460922, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:59:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14460599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460599</a><br>History is a narrative.

Not only did Sendero not want allies; it targeted other leftists for intimidation or assassination. Its detachments were often armed with little more than rocks, machetes or sticks of dynamite they had stolen from foreign mining concessions. More than once they loaded donkeys with explosives and sent them into crowded marketplaces (these were known as burrobombas; other homemade devices included the queso ruso, \u2018Russian cheese\u2019, a crude bomb with a timer).

Yet Sendero\u2019s very status as a historical and political anomaly \u2013 seemingly out of place, out of time \u2013 only deepens the enigma.

These features would eventually be subordinated to a grotesque cult of personality, in which Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 \u2018President Gonzalo\u2019 \u2013 was hailed as the \u2018Fourth Sword of Marxism\u2019 (after Marx, Lenin and Mao). But in the meantime they had made Sendero a formidably disciplined political and military force. This is especially striking given that, unlike many other guerrilla insurgencies, Sendero had no practical support at all from outside the country; according to Starn and La Serna, most of its shoestring budget came from tuition fees from a small private school in Lima (they reject the idea that Sendero made fortunes from the drug trade in the Huallaga Valley). There is another respect in which its isolation made a difference. Much of the global left experienced perestroika, the fall of the Berlin Wall and Tiananmen Square as deep ideological shocks, prompting a re-evaluation of strategy as well as basic principles. Sendero by contrast saw these events as confirmation of its worldview: it had already identified both the USSR and China as \u2018revisionist\u2019 powers hostile to the true revolutionary cause, and now destined for the same scrapheap of history as the capitalist world.</span><br><br>The insurgency took place at a moment of great tension in the Peruvian countryside...<br>https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41<wbr>/n13/tony-wood/even-hotter-even-lou<wbr>der", "filename": "81s5ZqagfXL._AC_UL900_SR615,900_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 615, "h": 900, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673489610510480, "time": 1673489610, "md5": "fSgmL+/71GzvxwV8N7py4A==", "fsize": 98659, "resto": 14455204}, {"no": 14455357, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)21:16:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "They were basic leftists.

He was later beheaded by Herod in the first century to satisfy the request of Herod&#039;s stepdaughter, Salome, and wife Herodias. Because he baptized Christ, he is the patron saint of godparents. He is sometimes called the Angel of the Desert; because of this title, he is sometimes depicted with wings.<br><br>Isaiah 40:3-5 is commonly read as a prophecy of John. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the course of Abia (1 Chr. 24:10), and his mother, Elizabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron (Luke 1:5). John held the priesthood of Aaron, giving him the authority to perform baptisms of God.<br><br>His birth took place six months before that of Jesus, and according to the Gospel account was expected by prophecy (Matt. 3:3; Isa. 40:3; Mal. 3:1) and foretold by an angel. Zacharias lost his power of speech because of his unbelief over the birth of his son, and had it restored on the occasion of John&#039;s circumcision (Luke 1:64).<br><br>As an adult John started to preach in public, and people from &quot;every quarter&quot; were attracted to his message. The essence of his preaching was the necessity of repentance and turning away from selfish pursuits. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a &quot;generation of vipers,&quot; and warned them not to assume their heritage gave them special privilege (Luke 3:8). He warned tax collectors and soldiers against extortion and plunder. His doctrine and manner of life stirred interest, bringing people from all parts to see him on the banks of the Jordan River. There he baptized thousands unto repentance.<br><br><a href=\"#p14460923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14460923</a><br>True.
