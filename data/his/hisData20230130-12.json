In a speech at the European Parliament in 2014, he called Europe a \u201cgrandmother\u201d that, no longer capable of renewing itself, should acquiesce to being regenerated by populations from other continents. At the same time, the head of the Catholic Church is wary of referring to Europe\u2019s \u201cChristian roots.\u201d In an interview with the Catholic daily La Croix, he admitted to avoiding the phrase, whose tone can be \u201cvengeful\u201d or \u201ctriumphalist\u201d and therefore \u201ccolonialist.\u201d<br><br>Dandrieu shows that this immigrationist turn did not begin with Francis. The consideration of the issue exclusively from the point of view of migrants, without taking into account the societies that receive them, can already be seen in Pius XII&#039;s apostolic constitution, Exsul Familia. The questions of how the scale of migration or cultural background of the newcomers affects host societies are absent in it.<br><br>Catholicism&#039;s globalist turn begins in earnest in the 1960s. John XXIII saw mass immigration as a sign of a new era, and in his encyclical Pacem in terris argues that the current evolution of the world requires global institutions to govern the world. Despite the fact that he developed his own theology of nations, John Paul II also regarded mass migration as a process that, as he proclaimed on the occasion of World Day of Migrants in 1987, would create \u201ca new world\u2026 founded on truth and justice.\u201d<br><br>1/2", "time": 1675016966, "resto": 14542832}, {"no": 14548409, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)13:30:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14548405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14548405</a><br><br>The late Benedict XVI defended Catholicism&#039;s European roots, but also associated it with certain messianism, as on World Day of Migrants in 2011, when he claimed that migration is \u201cthe prefiguration of an undivided City of God.\u201d In his encyclical Caritas in veritate, as Dandrieu reminds us, he expressed one of the basic globalist tenets: the belief in the necessity of global institutions that would attend to the common good of all mankind and implement its unity.<br><br>Looking for the sources of this \u201ccontamination\u201d of true Catholic universalism by globalism, Dandrieu points to personalism. This intellectual current has detached Catholicism from the notion of the common good, shifting the focus to the individual. While the ideas of Jacques Maritain and his disciples sought to criticize liberalism, they inadvertently led to its triumph within the church. In a personalist vein, John XXIII defined the common good as \u201csafeguarding the rights and duties of the human person,\u201d thus disregarding its inherently communal dimension, central to St. Thomas\u2019s thought and to the whole classical Catholic tradition.

And this happened over and over again, and you can trace that all the way down to the strip mall church. There&#039;s a ethos that the individual and the text alone are all that&#039;s necessary which leads to constant schisms but also expansion and rose up with the capitalist society and its value structure.<br><br>Well obviously that&#039;s not working well right now, and the ability of the U.S. to expand any more is hitting obstacles. So you have new cults like the secular cult of Elon Musk who is going to take the frontier into space. But we live in a world today that&#039;s incredibly atomized with everyone doing their own thing, much like a Protestant reading the Bible, having some &quot;born again&quot; experience, and then going from church to church constantly dissatisfied that none of these pastors seem to reflect their own individual experience with Christianity: &quot;Oh this one doesn&#039;t like Trump! He&#039;s not a Christian! This one is vaxxed, he&#039;s not a Christian! This one doesn&#039;t hate gay people! He&#039;s not a Christian! This one supports women pastors, they aren&#039;t Christian!&quot;<br><br>The Catholic tendency is to centralize things, but the converts are frustrated that the Pope is not Catholic enough. But part of the Church&#039;s authority all along was because, in general, the priests were literate in the background of a broadly illiterate population. You knew who else drew on similar authority because most of the population was illiterate?

I&#039;m not getting involved. But generally speaking the people we&#039;re talking about are conservatives, and I find some of these Catholic conservatives to be intellectual and intelligent, whereas on the left I feel like there&#039;s a similar loose &quot;Protestant&quot; structure where anyone can read the different texts and come to their own conclusions (accelerated by the internet) and decide that the other leftists are not really leftists or whatever, or coming to the conclusion that they&#039;re &quot;communists&quot; without even joining a communist party. It&#039;s like a Christian who doesn&#039;t go to church. It&#039;s remarkably similar to these debates going on here among Christian conservative rightists, that it&#039;s like a characteristic of an absolute bizarre condition of our society right now.<br><br>At the same time, there are real problems with this as a structure to organize people to do things, so there&#039;s also a desire to recentralize things, but the extant communist &quot;parties&quot; or orgs, which do have centralized structures, are at odds with a lot of these people too for a gazillion reasons because they&#039;re doing X, Y or Z. Some even become like Evangelicals with a huge emphasis on theatrics like &quot;The Founding Fathers were the original Socialist Revolutionaries!&quot; There&#039;s this bizarre idea that everything and anything revolves around having the right messaging and theatrics, and you can win the crowd over and get us out of this muck we&#039;re in. <br><br>But it seems that predominantly in the Protestant World, communism has struggled. Historically, communism seems to have taken route in countries with some degree of ideological or state centralization. There&#039;s predominantly Catholic Latin America, Orthodox Russia, and China which had spent hundreds of years under various centralized dynasties. Even in countries without successful communist revolutions, like France or Japan, there are still fairly strong communist parties as well as a history of ideological/governmental centralization.", "time": 1675024387, "resto": 14542832}, {"no": 14549194, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)15:34:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14542832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14542832</a><br>Yeah, catholics should fuck off back to the EUSSR.", "time": 1675024470, "resto": 14542832}, {"no": 14549287, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)15:46:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14549073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14549073</a><br><a href=\"#p14549182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14549182</a><br>I see your point.

The Reformation was never intended to create this sort of situation, but it arose anyway, if only because of state toleration of schismatic sects, rather than annihilating them as in previous periods. And some of the substantial splits that occurred in the mainline denominations were due to resistance to liberalization.

Fascists take great pride in despising theories and well thought-out programs. They had some vague slogans that both capitalists and workers could squint at and project what they wanted onto it, but they didn&#039;t leave behind much in the way of a theory, and fascist ideologues (including Hitler) openly said at the time that their goal was to seize power first and then come up with a program.

They didn&#039;t believe in people reasoning together as equals -- because they didn&#039;t believe in human equality. They believed in INEQUALITY. They loved war and saw that as a source of spiritual renewal. In more industrialized countries with stronger socialist parties like Germany, they played up an anti-capitalist element, and in countries with less industry and weaker socialist parties, they downplayed it. They somehow managed to unite all the contradictions and antagonisms of their societies in a single point represented by a theatrical leader who promised that everything would change and all problems would be solved but nobody would have to change anything about themselves and their own group (except the Jews or communists or X other group who have to GTFO).<br><br>So that&#039;s the strength of fascism, it&#039;s not weighed down by this other stuff.

There were also technical innovations, if China was &quot;wild&quot;, Europe during the late middle ages and renaissance must have been a &quot;heckin&#039; beast fr fr&quot;, for example France had water powered saw mills in the 14th century, Flemish weavers invented new vertical looms that tripled productivity, Flemish forges developed methods of carburizing or decarburizing iron and imported low impurity ore from far off places to produce high quality steel. When Europe reached India and China they only had a handful of innovations the Europeans did not, usually related to things Europe did not have like cotton or lacquer.<br><br>Further you vastly overinflate the significance of colonialism. The industrial revolution was in full swing in Britain at the turn of the 18th century with Isaac Newton and the first economically productive steam engines pumping water out of mines, before this point most goods from the colonies were spices and precious metals, the former is a luxury, the latter lost much of its value due to inflation. Aztec gold and silver was in fact spent on an invasion of England, though I would not actually consider this important in the larger scale of things. The overwhelming majority of economic activity and technological development was taking place in Europe and continued to be even in the industrial revolution when cotton and others goods from the colonies had a significant impact, but by this time the scientific underpinnings of the industrial revolution were already there.<br><br>If you stop looking at it in terms of truisms and flesh out your analysis a little, your narrative is highly distorted.", "filename": "iu[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 571, "h": 612, "tn_w": 116, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674994416856844, "time": 1674994416, "md5": "fd0j6TTpmqFWKyz090syQw==", "fsize": 73165, "resto": 14544457}, {"no": 14547369, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)09:34:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14546950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14546950</a><br><a href=\"#p14547002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14547002</a><br>god youre so oblivious, my point went right over your head, its the same thing as the ancient greek steam engine, technology is a human inevitibility, it will occur either way, there&#039;s no civilizational emergency or necessity, its not inherent to particular entities, thats the problem, and to the essay guy who thinks he&#039;s giving me some grand history lesson, dude you literally tagged every post in which i pre-adress every talking point you speak to in this post and you still chose to repeat the exact things ive been addressing so far, if my language is too aloof or whatever, greentext it and call me a pseud and i&#039;ll explain it for you, but you dont have to pretend to know what im talking about and completely mischaracterize me just for rhetoric, like you talk about a bunch of things completely irrelevant to the structure and historical nature of civilization like you&#039;re educating me about some important grand narrative im apparently oh so oblivious to, no, its simply not relevant to the point im making, and the people in this thread seem to be unable to come to this realization no matter how often i repeatedly tell them; you also seem to ignore the aesthetic that drove europe during that period, which in itself completely sterilized a lot of regional powers up until very recently, there&#039;s an entire spiritual crisis within these superficial cultural conflicts and concepts driving them which i described that, again, wont be so easily recovered from, especially considering how incoherent the entities encompassing regional powers are now, on each and every level, culturally, aesthetically, spiritually, economically -- just materially is enough, you know damn well things are out of order, we live in a world full of such a disproportionate amount of contradictions, i mean, you never came to this realization independently?", "filename": "2B7E5E3D-A904-4269-87F6-BB4D80DFA4D7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 922, "h": 904, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1675002866867334, "time": 1675002866, "md5": "8MF4LwDuHexHPodIX0XEIA==", "fsize": 400463, "resto": 14544457}, {"no": 14547425, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)09:50:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "That progress was slowed down solely because of Christianity", "time": 1675003852, "resto": 14544457}, {"no": 14547436, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)09:54:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14544457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14544457</a><br>Sort of.<br><br>They have their contributions, but they did a lot of shit at the same time.<br><br>So yeah, you&#039;re kinda right", "time": 1675004067, "resto": 14544457}, {"no": 14547458, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)10:00:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14547436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14547436</a><br>tl;dr: this basicalyl, im getting kinda tired of this thread anyways now", "time": 1675004421, "resto": 14544457}, {"no": 14547459, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)10:00:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14544830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14544830</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;engine and computer</span><br>This is the clickbait YouTube thumbnail reader understanding of history.

The reasoning behind that, is that both the writings and the prophets do not have anything unique that is not already found in the Pentateuch; so why bother reading them? Even then they get all of their commentary that they need for their religion in the commentary of Rashi for all of their Bibles, to prove as a hostile apologetic against Christian interpretation of scripture; this helps them ignore all the messianic imagery and prophecies that Christians point out to them. You know it\u2019s really rather funny, the book of Daniel automatically proves rabbinic Judaism false.

The woman returned to England in July and the wound was redressed in her local hospital. By the middle of August she became constantly tired and complained of aches and shooting pains in the back. She was anxious and depressed, and appeared to catch her breath when trying to drink. By the 19th of August she found it impossible to drink more than a few sips. She could not bear the touch of the wind or her hair on her face and had moments of apparent terror.

We&#039;re strict when it comes to being against sexual libertinism, but we also usually favor permitting medical treatment or surgery to solve a condition or illness, even out of economy.<br><br>If surgery works and the person genuinely suffers from gender dysphoria (instead of simply having a sexual fetish for instance), I don&#039;t see why such a person shouldn&#039;t be received or kept into the Church, as long as they have a close enough relationship with their priest that he would know for sure that this is the spiritually healthy path for them (so, in other words, it is done out of economy as a case by case basis). However, because of the whole confusion about whether they count as male or female after that, I&#039;m pretty sure they would have to abide by the same rules of chastity as homosexuals do, and they would be officially considered as their sex of birth.", "time": 1675055743, "resto": 14551051}, {"no": 14551260, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)00:16:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14551232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14551232</a><br>Sikhs are a race/ethnicity and they have similar \u201cneither Greek nor Jew\u201d philosophy, why can\u2019t Christians?

It emerged as the major free festival in the calendar after the violent suppression of the Windsor Free Festival in August 1974, with Wally Hope providing the impetus for its founding, and was itself violently suppressed in 1985 in the Battle of the Beanfield, with no free festival held at Stonehenge since although people have been allowed to gather at the stones again for the solstice since 1999.<br><br>By the 1980s, the festival had grown to be a major event, attracting up to 30,000 people in 1984. The festival attendees were branded as hippies by the British press. This, along with the open drug use and sale, contributed to the increase in restrictions on access to Stonehenge, and fences were erected around the stones in 1977.

Please feel free to comment or correct if need be.<br>Christianity: pray a lot. Fast. Give alms. Make sure to never sin. Never. Slowly you can achieve this state. Then you will have attained actual salvation. Read the mystery of the cross for details on how to renew your mind on Christ of which the bible speaks of. The cross is crucial here.<br>Gnosticism: you need to experience the divine. You need to experience your essence. You need to experience and perceive the lordship of Christ and that he is identical with the father. Once you know he is identical with the father, you got gnosis. Then you become the father as he is the father and you become what you perceive. <br>Islam: You must recognize the Imams first of all to gain gnosis. You must recognize the wilayat of Ali. And, you must recognize that Ali is the face of allah. The Hadith al haqiqa or of reality in English is crucial for enlightenment here. Reading it and meditating on it is crucial. Then Irfan or gnosis is attained when the spirit of Allah descends finally upon your soul. <br>Buddhism: hold firm onto the belief in the Buddha-nature. Contemplate the ideas of this self or Buddha-nature constantly. And meditate a lot. This is the fastest way. Then also contemplate that when the Buddha saved all living beings, he will not have saved even one living being, because words have no meaning. Contemplate these two things, the self and the doctrine of emptiness. <br>Hinduism: meditate a lot. Read the yoga-kundalini upanishad, it details how you should perform yoga to unite Shiva and Shakti. And, contemplate that you are one with Shiva for shaivism, or one with divine consciousness for Vedanta, but vaishnavite practice i have not studied yet. (Sorry for that)<br>Alright that&#039;s it.
