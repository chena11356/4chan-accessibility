Specifically, you can explain many ruins, fossilized remains and such as coming from this period. At the end of it, you have a cataclysmic flood destroying everything and despositing some remains of things on the tops of mountains. Then the flooded earth is reconstructed by God again. The lights being &quot;set&quot; in the sky is a reference to the clouded atmosphere clearing up sufficiently so that they are visible from the surface again, as everything is from the perspective of the Spirit, who is said to be located upon the face of the waters in Genesis 1:2. This way, you&#039;ve got an old universe and potentially old subterranean earth as well, but the earth is still said to be created about 6,300 years ago through some more acts of creation by God at that time. Then later at the time of Noah&#039;s flood you have a more limited flood that is enough to wipe out the area where Adam&#039;s descendants lived but still has some survivors from the ark to replenish the area, with plants replenishing the area from surrounding areas. Lastly, the biblical references to a world-destroying flood are in fact to the former flood, not to the latter. This also explains why Peter in the New Testament in 2 Peter 3:7 would imply that the &quot;heavens (i.e. atmosphere) and earth that are now&quot; are different from that before this flood, meaning that the atmosphere itself was destroyed by said flood, and had to be recreated. This would have to refer to the flood that happened before Genesis 1:2, since nothing could survive a world with no atmosphere. Furthermore, Genesis 9:11 also seems to imply that there were two floods. And in Isaiah 45:18, it states that God, when he created the earth, &quot;created it not in vain.&quot; Genesis 1:2, though, uses the same description for earth there (same Hebrew word).", "time": 1671611026, "resto": 14353323}, {"no": 14356126, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)06:31:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14353323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14353323</a><br>You&#039;d be surprised how most people are hostile to innovation unless they fall off the majority", "time": 1671622312, "resto": 14353323}, {"no": 14356147, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)06:38:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14353425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14353425</a><br>Farming and agriculture was impossible during the last ice age.

Well, the earliest known reference to a Christmas tree is a depiction of one from a sculpture on the keystone of a private home located in Turckheim, France dating to 1576. If we assume that the custom was around for roughly fifty years or so before it was mentioned or depicted anywhere, that would indicate that the very first Christmas trees probably appeared in western Europe in the early 1500s. Christmas trees seem to have most likely originated from the \u201ctree of Paradise,\u201d that is, the tree used in late medieval mystery plays to represent the tree that Adam and Eve are said to have eaten from the Garden of Eden.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The Christmas tree does not seem to have become popular, though, until the eighteenth century, at first mostly among affluent German Lutherans. The earliest known Christmas trees were decorated with nuts, berries, and other small, edible foods (as tree of paradise in the bible might have been). These nuts and berries were later replaced by ornaments and candles. There is a tradition claiming that Martin Luther himself was the first person ever to decorate a Christmas tree using candles, but there is no historical record to vindicate this tradition and it is most likely apocryphal.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Modern Christmas trees have been related to the &quot;tree of paradise&quot; of medieval mystery plays that were given on 24 December, the commemoration and name day of Adam and Eve in various countries. In such plays, a tree decorated with apples (to represent the forbidden fruit) and wafers (to represent the Eucharist and redemption) was used as a setting for the play.

Christianity includes the Jewish texts in its canon, at the same time that it negated Judaism. It made Judaism into a step in the process of the self-fulfillment of Christianity. Marx, in his atheistic turn, took Hegel and critiqued his method in favor of a &quot;materialism&quot;. But of course he maintained much of Hegel&#039;s method in this new course, which is actually to say (at least in my mind) that Marx took Hegel&#039;s method, which itself was already influenced by supersessionist Christian theology, and said &quot;look your problem is that you still have God in here, take God out of it and look at the world&quot;. <br><br>And then you have this fragment as an example, where Marx is basically saying that the religious state actually is using religion to hide its &quot;imperfection&quot;, which is to say that the religious state uses the religion to explain away its imperfection. Marx says later that the religious state acts toward politics religiously, and acts towards religion politically. He also says that the religious state cannot fulfill the letter of the gospel because it would dissolve itself. That is to say, or as I interpret it, the religious state basically acts irreligiously, it presides over a society filled with evil and itself commits evil, but it presents itself as based in religion to absolve itself of responsibility. The irreligiosity of the Christian state is pardoned by its own profession that the church is what cleanses us all of evil, we go and confess and pray for forgiveness for our sins.

Also in the sense that he continuously frames the Christian state as one that is hypocritical, and the secular democratic state as one that has truly embraced the &quot;human foundation&quot; of Christianity. As a said before, he has the Hegelian/supersessionist manner of thinking here, where the self-fulfillment of the democratic state is actually the negation of the religious state. The Christian state is &quot;imperfect&quot;, something of its essence is realized in the democratic state. <br><br>Of course, Marx isn&#039;t talking about communism here, but again I think there are hints of his later thoughts on the subject of the state and communism with his suggestion that the Christian state that wasn&#039;t hypocritical would dissolve itself.

I think the interesting thing about noticing how Marxism has some shared theology with Christianity is that Marxism presents itself as extremely secular and athiestic, yet still carries religious baggage. Point being that I don&#039;t think you can escape religious baggage, and Marxism is a good example of how difficult it is to conceive of what it would mean to escape religion. Much like the Christian state, liberals and communists fell into the same pattern of excusing evil and imperfection with the vision of perfection. They held high concepts up, the USSR held up the realization of communism, the liberal states invoke the vision of &quot;true democracy&quot; and a market driven approach to slowly alleviating suffering, of empowering the individual as fully as possible. The suffering in the interim is what is necessitated by the world not having ended yet, the kingdom of God hasn&#039;t come, Jesus hasn&#039;t returned, we are waiting. The theological function of these visions is to explain why we are waiting, is to explain what we are even doing. How can we live with ourselves in this evil world, how is it we can allow such misery to exist and even to participate in its reproduction without feeling guilty? This is a dilemma to the Christian mind, because Christian theology does have that kernel of humanism in it. We are all guilty of sin, but Christianity also absolves us of the responsibility for our sin in the understanding that we have been saved, and similarly for liberalism and communism. The secular theologies have saved us because we&#039;ve become &quot;truly political&quot;, as Marx would put it, and realized the world of humans is our creation.", "time": 1671562732, "resto": 14352685}, {"no": 14353071, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)14:02:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14352727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14352727</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism was the great goal, the vision, the desideratum, the ultimate end that would make the sufferings of mankind throughout history worthwhile.

He comes out of university and spends a bunch of time basically critiquing religion while also getting involved in secular politics via his journalism. He was critiquing idealism and religion as a consequence of his rejection of the reality of their claims to the values he held, which were fundamentally Christian ones of universal salvation and brotherhood etc. And that ultimately led him to the doorstep of political economy because it was another edifice that the liberals of his day used to uphold bourgeois class society. So he goes at length to suggest the ways that the categories and thought of liberal political economy continues to reproduce a world that is not as &quot;rational&quot; or even &quot;secular&quot; as they seemed to believe.

The emancipation of the peasants in Georgia, his native land, took place in 1865, only fourteen years before his birth. The customs and habits of the environment in which he grew up bore deep and still fresh imprints of serfdom. This is certainly one of the clues to his character. Remember that in this country serfdom had virtually withered away by the end of the fourteenth century. By British standards, Stalin ought to be regarded as a man in whom the fourteenth and the twentieth centuries have met, socially, politically and psychologically. In this respect he has, more than any other Russian leader, been representative of the social outlook of Russia, in which the two centuries did coexist side by side until recently. This was certainly one of the chief reasons why he was so successful in the struggle against so many rivals and also why his deeds so often appear to us to be so incomprehensible.</span>", "time": 1671535978, "resto": 14351563}, {"no": 14351872, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:34:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14351866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14351866</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He spent his formative years, from fifteen to twenty, at the theological seminary of Tiflis, as a student of divinity. Long after he had become a confirmed atheist, the theological influence on his mind was still overwhelming. It still is. It was that influence that in a sense predestined him to introduce the dogmatic, quasi-theological element into socialism. While he was studying divinity he became a revolutionary. I have been lucky to come across a complete dossier of the Tsarist political police, describing the political atmosphere in that seminary over a good many years. The dossier was published by the Transcaucasian Communist University in 1930; but it has remained almost unknown. It contains a full confidential report on a political revolt of the students of the seminary which took place just before Stalin\u2019s entry. The students staged a strike, demanding that they be taught Georgian literature \u2013 this was a Georgian challenge to the Russian authorities \u2013 and that several unpopular tutors be removed from the seminary. Teaching was suspended, police occupied the students\u2019 living quarters and the lecture halls. Eighty-seven undergraduates were expelled from the seminary altogether. Among the organisers of the demonstration was a certain Mikhail Tskhakaya who later became a friend of Lenin and a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee. The seminary was famous for the rebellious mood of its pupils, which at first expressed itself in Georgian patriotism, directed against the Russians, and then simply in socialism. I found in the reports of General Yankovsky, the head of the police at Tiflis, a most valuable glimpse of a spiritual ferment which could not but affect the young Stalin.</span>", "filename": "s1200", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 689, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1671536042972238, "time": 1671536042, "md5": "GtvB19qxIS7cZhsAbEWrCg==", "fsize": 1654970, "resto": 14351563}, {"no": 14351876, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:35:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14351872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14351872</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some of you may perhaps ask for the political moral of my book.

IIRC Nahuatl was still an official language in Colonial Mexico until the mid 18th century (I might be off, there, Prehispanic stuff is really my area of expertise) for example, and even today there&#039;s obviously plenty of people in Mexico who live in indigenous communities and retain more cultural and social practices. It&#039;s safe to say that would be even more true for at least some people back in the 18th century.<br><br>The problem I think is that there&#039;s no clear line, here. For example, during the Mixton rebellion, you had Tlaxcalteca, Mexica, etc forces fighting for the Spanish in the 1550s, and they still used Macuahuitl, Tlazhuiztli warsuits, etc there. You had some indepedent Mesoamerican states that weren&#039;t conquered yet as late as 1697, etc. At one point does something not count as Mesoamerican?", "time": 1671573010, "resto": 14351008}, {"no": 14353997, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)17:17:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14352232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14352232</a><br><a href=\"#p14352258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14352258</a><br>Interesting about the moriscos, I can imagine the early colonial authorities being strict about letting infidels across the atlantic.

Hard to have mobility when you&#039;re locked in like that. Western economies then squeeze the 10-20 best years of their labour productivity (20&#039;s to 30&#039;s) out of them and then dump them. With defunded welfare and other social services many just die, some might leave. Luckily, few have kids. The intergenerational fertility rates are abysmally low, &quot;necessitating&quot; further immigration. Each new wave helps move society below the top percentile in lock step downwards in material comfort and financial security.

But when the Bishop does not obey the Gospel and does not do according to the Holy Canons, then the clergy and the people are not obliged to obey the Bishop. In the event of a dilemma because of a contradiction between the Gospel and the bishop\u2019s teaching, \u2018we must obey God rather than human beings!\u2019 (Acts 5:29) And then heroic clergymen and monks, even ordinary lay people\u2026 then every clergyman and lay person has the right and the obligation to say those things which the Bishops dare not say either because of cowardice, or a worldly spirit, or misapprehension. Whenever the pulpits were silent, simple and humble monks and people, men and women, supported Orthodoxy... Therefore, each clergyman is not a slave of his hierarch, but is only obligated to obey his Bishop when that Bishop is a contender in the holy struggle.\u201d</span><br>\u2014 St. Paisios", "filename": "FEF61251-D6DB-4E3F-B3EF-34F734896739", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1064, "h": 1412, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671505864421255, "time": 1671505864, "md5": "Ep7LIYkKcCNF7iBh/wEUcw==", "fsize": 234157, "resto": 14339590}, {"no": 14350839, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350771</a><br>(1) Stalin doesn\u2019t even have a halo in that image, so he isn\u2019t a saint, (2) the ROC doesn\u2019t say Stalin is a saint or publicly venerate him, (3) just because someone makes an icon doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s officially sanctioned by the Church or even representative of it", "time": 1671506727, "resto": 14339590}, {"no": 14351004, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:33:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14350671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14350671</a><br>I&#039;m confused about how God is so great, and being pious should save you, yet it was so easy for Muslims to smash them and convert them.

Many of these are petty concerns that should never have been roadblocks to unity. The East often acted rather tsundere towards Rome too.

The fact that Rome was given essentially universal appellate jurisdiction in the Council of Sardica is pretty interesting as well.
