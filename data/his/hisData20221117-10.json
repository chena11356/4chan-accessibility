Although illiterate he was able to perform the most difficult mathematical calculations.

He was captured and sent to America in 1724 at the age of 14. Fuller was enslaved by Presley and Elizabeth Cox of Alexandria, Virginia. Both Fuller and the Coxes were illiterate. The Coxes enslaved 16 people and appeared to value Fuller the most, because of his unusual talent for solving complex math problems in his head. His talent was put to practical use, and he was employed in every phase of the management of their 232-acre plantation farm. For example, his enslavers would ask:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How many shingles for the new roof? How many poles and rails to enclose the meadow? How much corn to seed a designated field?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;His answers were immediate, and always correct.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As the years passed, stories of his abilities became known throughout the Eastern seaboard.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 1777, a Philadelphia Quaker and businessman, William Hartshorne, moved his family to Alexandria. Hartshorne and three other Quakers from Philadelphia came to meet Fuller to test his arithmetic feats. One of the visitors took notes and made calculations on paper, and the others fired questions at him.

It&#039;s all about making the world holy and sanctified before God. You see, one cannot approach the presence of the God of Israel if one is not holy, because God is holy. God chose Israel to be his sanctified people, this is why he had them build his tabernacle and temples. That he might dwell in their presence, just as he did among Adam and Eve in the garden. This is why the Israelites had to continually sacrifice to God, especially in the yearly day of atonement, because it was a way to keep them holy and pure, since the very land that they had been given was to be holy and sanctified because it was God&#039;s land where God dwelt. Forgiveness of sins was a secondary element to it. The High Priest was the holiest, because he could stand before God&#039;s throne room, before his mercy seat. But now, this has been extended to the entire world. Israel truly has been a light to the gentiles. But the problem was: you cannot be holy unless you are righteous. The sacrifices of the old law could never truly forgive sins, they were but a type of what was to come. Christ&#039;s sacrifice offers forgiveness, it allows us to say as the prophet Jeremiah did &quot;The Lord our righteousness.&quot; Christ is our ultimate High Priest, his ministers are the priests, and we the people are the Levites.
