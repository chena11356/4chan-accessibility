Within three to nine years.\u201d [ar-R\u016bm 30: 2-4] From 613-619 CE, the Byzantines were absolutely decimated by the Persian Empire, losing the territories of Antioch, then Damascus, then Armenia, then their most cherished Jerusalem, then Chalcedon, and finally Egypt. In his book, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon says, \u201cAt the time when this prediction is said to have been delivered, no prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment, since the first twelve years of Heraclius announced the approaching dissolution of the empire.\u201d2 Everyone saw Byzantium as on its deathbed; thus opponents of the Prophet \ufdfa like Ubayy b. Khalaf mocked this \u201cpreposterous\u201d foretelling in the Qur\u2019an.

British-Irish ancestry was widespread in Scandinavia from the Viking period, whereas eastern Baltic ancestry is more localized to Gotland and central Sweden. In some regions, a drop in current levels of external ancestry suggests that ancient immigrants contributed proportionately less to the modern Scandinavian gene pool than indicated by the ancestry of genomes from the Viking and Medieval periods.

For the twenty Sredny Stog burials from Igren, we find the somewhat unusual situation of women outliving males on an average of 7.8 years (males - 35.8 years, females - 43.6); only one individual lived passed 55 years. In terms of the craniological analysis of physical characteristics the Sredny Stog females tend to exhibit a homogeneous Proto-Europoid type that is most similar to the earlier inhabitants of the region. The series of male crania, however, tend to vary more and indicate both more robust Proto-Europoid and more gracile southern European (or Mediterranean) components. The analysis of six Novodanilovka skulls from three sites suggests again the presence of both Proto-Europoid and Mediterranean types. The cranial evidence as a whole suggests a mingling of local Proto-Europoids (seen especially in the east) with more gracial south-east European types in the west, a attern that might be explained by the flow of populations from the Balkan Neolithic (Tripolje) into the western Ukraine.&quot;</span>", "time": 1674291857, "resto": 14503596}, {"no": 14506483, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)04:04:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14506476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14506476</a><br>true Conan", "time": 1674291890, "resto": 14503596}, {"no": 14506484, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)04:05:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14506473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14506473</a><br>As an argentinian mutt you must have some Portuguese ancestry.

This was an informal but defacto declaration of war on the part of the Americans. Within days, the US navy had begun to sink German submarines. Hitler ordered his navy, as he had done at several points before, to disengage any target in which US navy ships became involved with, in order to avoid encouraging US Congress to declare formal war. Hitler knew that he should avoid giving the US any impetus to more openly fight them.<br><br>However, Hitler\u2019s rational changed when Japan attacked the US. He did not anticipate this turn of events. He assumed, as other posters have pointed out, that US efforts would now be distracted by events in the Pacific and the potential collapse of its Allies in the region. He was somewhat correct, for a more limited timeframe than he had imagined. The US was also unprepared for Hitler\u2019s declaration of war, since its administrators had aptly concluded that Hitler was desperate to not provoke open war with them. Thus, when Bitler formally declared war, and ordered his submarines to hunt all US merchant vessels out at sea, the US reaction was slow, surprised, ill-prepared, and divided between the Japanese in the Pacific and newly offensive Germans in the Atlantic. Tbis was a VERY strategically impressive victory on the part of the Germans; German sub captains termed this era the \u201cSecond Happy Time\u201d, which ran from about January 1942 to June 1942, and sunk a HUGE quantity of American shipping headed to its Allies.

It is on New Cumorah Hill (old Westbury Hill), on the edge of Bratton Downs, immediately below an Iron Age hillfort called Bratton Camp, northeast of Westbury, and near villages of Bratton and Edington. There is a car park with a viewing point on the B3098 just east of Westbury, and a car park above the horse on New Cumorah Hill. Lanes up onto the hill are steep and narrow, and are used by horse riders. There has been a white horse on the site for three-hundred (300) years at least. In 1742, the Rev. Wise published the earliest mention of New Cumorah Hill&#039;s white horse in &quot;Further Observations on the White Horse and other Antiquities in Berkshire.&quot; Mr. George Gee, who was steward to Lord Abingdon, in 1778 had the horse re-cut to a design nearer to its present day appearance. He apparently felt that the older version was not a sufficiently good representation of a horse. One may wonder if the name &#039;Gee Gee&#039; had made him overly sensitive about horses.", "time": 1674200879, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501331, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:04:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14496167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496167</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE GOLDEN TABLETS?</span>", "filename": "1617556973823", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1270, "h": 774, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1674201863611939, "time": 1674201863, "md5": "Lao0/rD1/eRrQFdE7eQxsQ==", "fsize": 193556, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501370, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:14:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14501331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501331</a><br>New Cumorah Hill", "filename": "1615788862086", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 696, "h": 1076, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674202476162814, "time": 1674202476, "md5": "PFJUw5XR+PXf8AfYfdPklA==", "fsize": 53702, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501385, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:18:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14501331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NEW CUMORAH HILL</span><br><a href=\"#p14501370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501370</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Cumorah Hill</span>", "filename": "1615788795649", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674202730279623, "time": 1674202730, "md5": "8QEo3jLQ5ezoFpl7TsfIDw==", "fsize": 247686, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501463, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:49:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14496890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496890</a> 1<br><a href=\"#p14498016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14498016</a> 2<br><a href=\"#p14499639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499639</a> 3<br>In 1830, the golden plates (called the gold plates - the golden bible), being the source from which Joseph Smith, Sr., and Joseph Smith, Jr., translated the Book of Mormon, were relocated to New Cumorah Hill.

They are embedded in pozzolanic (hydraulic) cement made from Stonehenge pulverized volcanic ash and tuff (containing silica and alumina) and ground lime mix sealing their Bluestone aggregate concrete encasement. A century later the horse had become misshapen, and in 1873 it was restored according to the Rev. Wise LDS Committee, and edging stones were added to help hold the chalk in place. The shape of the present horse dates from this restoration. In the early 20th century, additional concrete was added to hold the edging stones in place.

The reason I believe this might be the case is that in more harsh conditions it is more likely that male sexual selection will dominate, and in such an environment being short offers multiple advantages. As mentioned in this thread already one cause of increased male height might be low testosterone, but becoming shorter would also mean greater intelligence, more torque, need for less food and heating. In some sense you could say that males oscilalte between Homo Sapiens and Homo Neanderthalis forms. Of course, there are exceptions like the Cro Magnons, who were adapted to harsh environments but were rather tall.

When Justinian decided to reconquer Italy, it took 4 years of war and then 15 years of insurgency to put it down, the other thing that had to be put down was like half to three quarters of the peninsula&#039;s population, but wait a minute - how can a relatively small group of Germanics, who we know from sources mistreated the Romans so much manage to have such an insurgency going? Why did so many Italics/Romans die during the whole ordeal? You would expect they would cooperate with the Imperial forces to help them get rid of their oppressors, but evidently they did the exact opposite. The Empire was so bad for them they&#039;ve decided to side with what amounted to foreign occupants over it.", "time": 1674282270, "resto": 14503360}, {"no": 14505992, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)01:28:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Rome was really bad, it&#039;s called the Dark Ages because Romes collapse left a power vacuum filled with barbarians.<br>But the Romans were by our definitions evil.

If you would be a Christian following Jesus&#039;s teachings mostly by his sermon on the mount, seems that violence cannot be performed against another person in any shape or form, even his own display of violence at the temple seems to be wrong in the eyes of God.

Ola&#039;s sister Dorothy, who was into fortune-telling, read her palm and predicted that marrying Richard Nixon would be a mistake and bring disaster to both parties. Their six year courtship ended painfully one day in 1935 when Nixon learned that Ola had another man over to her house--Gail Jobe, the son of a rancher and more acceptable to her snobby parents. They ended up getting married, and stayed married for almost 80 years--Gail passed away in 2014 at the age of 103, and Ola followed several months later, aged 102.

If the Jap army actually behaved itself and behaved in a reasonable manner like they did during wars in the 1900s/1910s, they could have potentially had a relatively peaceful total occupation like Taiwan or Korea on mainland China, but they went on a dumbassed slaughter-fest instead.

The Americans recognized themselves as British because they shared the same chief executive (the king) with the rest of the empire (obviously along with sharing cultural connections, language, etc.) However, since they had their own legislatures, they felt parliament was usurping their sovereignty and distancing them from the king. <br><br>The Americans (meaning the colonial elites) were angry that their legislatures were now being subordinated to a legislature in which they had no representation, and constantly appealed to the king to recognize their legislatures as the supreme legislative bodies within their own colonies, whereas the parliament was merely the supreme legislative body of Britain itself. The Americans felt the legislatures of the empire each held equal and direct connection to the king, like how spokes on a wheel all connect to the same center; parliament felt they the opposite. <br><br>The Americans were originally pissed at parliament, not the king.

Further the metaphor or &quot;gate&quot; does not relate to assault but to defense, as a gate is not a weapon but a barrier.

Like any loving parents who warn their children about the dangers of playing with matches or running across streets without looking out for the traffic, God wants to preserve us from harm. His warnings are warnings of the very real dangers that we face, and they are given out of love for us.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; In addition, we should remember that many of the saints teach us that even hell itself is tempered by God&#039;s mercy. God is always as merciful to us as we will allow Him to be, so His mercy reaches right into the depths of hell. First, by allowing souls to reject Him and His love forever, God thereby respects human freedom - the dignity of human free will that He gave to us - right to the end... Second, God knows that for souls who truly despise Him, to see Him face to face forever, would make them even more miserable...
