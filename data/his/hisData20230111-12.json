Muhammad spoke Satan&#039;s words as the word of God. This event is documented by several early Muslim scholars and referenced in the Hadith and Quran. Later Muslims, ashamed that their self declared prophet spoke Satan&#039;s words, denied the event occurred. A myriad of excuses and denials have been put forth by these later Muhammadans to cover up Muhammad&#039;s sinful error.<br><br>It must be pointed out again that the &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; event is not something made up by non-Muslims. The event is recorded by the earliest Islamic sources available on Muhammad&#039;s life. No one should think that it is a story made up by people who are critical of Islam. It is an episode directly found in the early Islamic records.<br>This topic is one of the most controversial in Islam. Satan caused Muhammad to recite his words as God&#039;s words. The background to this event is that Muhammad and his followers were being persecuted for attacking the pagan faiths of Mecca, and he did not want to further offend his Arab tribesmen, and, he wanted them to become his followers, i.e. Muslims. In fact Muhammad wished that God would not reveal anything further to him that would further alienate his fellow Arabs. So when opportunity arose, he spoke what Satan put into his heart and mind as God&#039;s word.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the Old Testament (OT), if someone caused the people to worship other gods he was put to death - Deuteronomy 13:1 - 5:</span><br><br><br>yet mo&#039; got away scott free... i bet the situation wouldnt have gone like that if it was a woman who had a false revelation", "time": 1673409686, "resto": 14451035}, {"no": 14451115, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:04:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14451085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14451085</a><br><a href=\"#p14451105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14451105</a><br>The satanic verses in ibn Ishaq is weak, anons, nice try though!

Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, \u201cLet me not see the death of the boy.\u201d So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept. But God heard the voice of the lad from the place where he was. Then the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, \u201cWhat is the matter, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.\u2020 Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.\u201d\u2020 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.

This is what the informational part of reality needs in order to be coherently identifiable as information. Deny as much, and you&#039;re saying that it&#039;s contingent on something which is informational in nature (that&#039;s what you&#039;d have to be saying because no alternative exists). So the identifiable existence of any coherent X automatically implies the negation of X, making the distinction both evidential and conceptual. This is why reality isn&#039;t completely deterministic in nature and explains much of what has been empirically verified in QM. Many mystics have intuited this medium and have tried to explain it, variously using terms such as &quot;abyss (Ungrund)&quot;, &quot;emptiness (Sunyata)&quot;, and &quot;Ayin&quot; in their attempts to do so. But it is best and most precisely described in Langan&#039;s theory, called the CTMU, which has been mentioned above. It relates very, very heavily to some of the things you write about. Although reality isn&#039;t entirely analogous to a computer because of reasons stated above, it describes informational reality as existing under the auspices of a Self-Configuring-Self-Processing Language, and it is very detailed in its description of the syntax and dynamic properties of it) More notably, it can even prove some of the things you&#039;ve said to be correct. It was the first theory of reality as a self-simulation, and I think you&#039;d be surprised to see how much of modern popular science is wrought with ideas which were first constructively communicated under the name of its author.

God can do all sorts of things, if He so chooses. The issue lies in what He has purposed to do and how He has disclosed Himself in His Word and in Nature. You reject the logic behind Biblical truth because it competes with your own epistemological method, one which takes for granted fallen man&#039;s powers of perception and reasoning, while neglecting to take into account the results of sin on the human heart (i.e. the seedbed or originator of human desire, motivation, axiological judgment, affections, and beliefs).

Recently I came around on some of the Marian dogmas and I thought that it might be beneficial to attempt praying to her, as this is such an important element of piety among Catholics and Orthodox. As a Protestant, when asking Christ for something, I will pray to him and make my request, then if it is not granted, I accept it, knowing that Christ knows what is best and that God wills things for my good. I don&#039;t generally make trivial requests, or ask for things like money -- normally I pray for strength regarding sinful temptations. But I had a pressing need regarding a the physical health of a family member, so I prayed to Christ asking that he would help them, and I prayed to Mary, and asked that she would also pray for this family member and ask Christ to help them. I did this on a number of occasions.<br><br>Suffice it to say that the prayer has not been answered in any observable way. That is acceptable, of course. I&#039;m not evaluating this as some kind of experiment on whether my prayers will become more effective or something, but I wanted to see how this would affect my spirituality, or how I understand prayer. And I have to say that the change was strong, but in a wholly negative manner. Whereas in the past, I could make my petition, then accept Christ&#039;s will and move on, with the involvement of prayers to the saints this changes as there are now more possibilities. It could be that Christ will not grant the petition if I ask it, but he will grant it if Mary asks it (&quot;the prayer of a righteous man avails much&quot;). And perhaps Mary declined my request for prayer. In this case the way to get my prayer granted would be to supplicate Mary so that she might pray as I have requested.<br><br>(1/3)", "filename": "immaculate-conception", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1520, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 190, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673352342005061, "time": 1673352342, "md5": "/ruvRXojAFeo4+vgKoT3mg==", "fsize": 487763, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-attempted-praying-to-mary-and-i-would-like-to", "replies": 34, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 14447919, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)07:06:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do you see the problem? Prayer becomes alienated from Christ and the acceptance of God&#039;s will, and becomes attuned to supplicating other humans, or creating the right conditions for your prayer to be accepted. This ties in with other concepts, like needing to pray in particular places, or pray in contact with or near the relics of saints, to increase the efficacy of prayer. It&#039;s almost like prayer ends up being more like constructing a spell, and it turns into a superstitious practice. Christ won&#039;t answer my prayer, but perhaps if I venerate Mary in my prayers enough, she will help me. Or perhaps if I pray near the bones of so-and-so he will pray for me and it will be sufficient. After all, we need the righteous to pray for us so that God will hear us. Simply asking him ourselves is not sufficient if we need something from Christ. That is the logic that comes to bear.

Does not the prayer of the righteous have greater efficacy? Should we not seek out the righteous or (in Mary&#039;s case) the most righteous to pray for us? This verse gave me some consternation after my experience, but I eventually came to understand what it actually means. The verse in full:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.</span><br>Now the context is that he is telling the readers of the letter to pray for one another. So the prayers he is referring to are the ones performed by the readers of the letter. So who is the &quot;righteous&quot; whose prayers are so effective? Frankly, it is you. Or it is supposed to be you. If you are not righteous you need to demonstrate your faith through your works, as James tells us earlier in the letter. Rather than telling us to seek out the righteous to pray for us, he is telling us to pray for others, because our prayers can help them. The emphasis placed on this verse by Catholics and Orthodox is inverted from its meaning. James wants us to direct our prayers to the benefit of others, the Catholic and Orthodox reading is for us to seek out the prayers of others who are more righteous in order for our own prayers to be answered. See the difference? This is the meaning of Christians praying for each other, not that we seek out particular righteous people to pray for us in a superstitious way, because otherwise Christ may not hear us; but that we love each other and pray for each other, because we wish God to be merciful on all of us. If we love our brother in Christ, we ask God to bless him.

So if you pray to both Christ and Mary for something, and you do not receive it, that means that Christ has said no to you. But it also means that Mary has not prayed for you, because if she had, Christ would have said yes to her. So the logical answer is to supplicate Mary until she deigns to pray for you.

If you look at any Catholic academic works on controversial matters, they&#039;ll tell you point blank that the modern Catholic position is not authentic, that bishops were a development, that Rome did not have a bishop until the 2nd century, etc. Their scholars adapt a historical critical approach to the Bible as well. I live in the U.S. and the translation produced by the bishops here, the NABRE, contains footnotes that basically discredit the Bible entirely, telling you that the Gospels contain errors and all sorts of things, and this is true for the majority of Catholic biblical studies produced today. There are some exceptions I will grant, but they are a minority, and this is something I really can&#039;t get past, that these liberal viewpoints are completely endorsed and allowed in the Church. I know that as a conservative Protestant, I can look to our scholars and find robust defenses of the conservative, orthodox position on these matters, and that if one them stated otherwise, there would be a holy uproar about it. The Protestants who have rejected orthodoxy in this way -- we have nothing to do with them at all, they are cut off from us.

Before Mary\u2019s bodily Assumption into heaven was defined, all theological faculties in the world were consulted for their opinion. Our teachers\u2019 answer was emphatically negative\u2026\u201dTradition\u201d was identified with what could be proved on the basis of texts. Altaner, the patrologist from W\u00fcrzburg\u2026 had proven in a scientifically persuasive manner that the doctrine of Mary\u2019s bodily Assumption into haven was unknown before the 5C; this doctrine, therefore, he argued, could not belong to the \u201capostolic tradition. And this was his conclusion, which my teachers at Munich shared. This argument is compelling if you understand \u201ctradition\u201d strictly as the handing down of fixed formulas and texts\u2026But if you conceive of \u201ctradition\u201d as the living process whereby the Holy Spirit introduces us to the fullness of truth and teaches us how to understand what previously we could still not grasp (cf. Jn 16:12-13), then subsequent \u201cremembering\u201d (cf. Jn 16:4, for instance) can come to recognize what it has not caught sight of previously and was already handed down in the original Word, (Milestones, p. 58-59).</span>", "time": 1673290553, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444471, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:57:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444310</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No evidence, just vague &quot;it makes sense&quot; ramblings</span><br>We could use the same logic and say that you should honour your father therefore Joseph was sinless, but I doubt you want to go there", "time": 1673290641, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444472, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:58:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444468</a><br>so basically &quot;it was real in our minds&quot;", "time": 1673290684, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444473, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:58:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444468</a><br>Meant the bodily assumption, to be clear", "time": 1673290718, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444475, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:59:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444310</a><br>By the same logic mary should be able to boss Jesus around and start hitting him with sandals or something, get real, he&#039;s God, he wrote those commandments you are quoting", "time": 1673290762, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444481, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444468</a><br>I&#039;m aware that it has no early evidence among orthodox Christians.

I think it makes sense as Noah is the ancestor of Abraham, and Abraham was very likely a Hurrian or partially descended from Hurrians. Mount Ararat is in the Hurrian homeland.<br>Proof that Abraham was descended from Hurrians: the &quot;Ur Kasdim&quot; was probably Urkesh in northern Mesopotamia, which is a known Hurrian city. If he was from the Sumerian Ur, it wouldn&#039;t make sense for him to pass by Haran on his way to Canaan. Moreover, after Abraham arrived in Haran, God told him to leave the &quot;land of his birth,&quot; which means he was born in that same region. We know there was a mass exodus of people in northeastern Syria around 2000\u20131500 BC because the climate became very dry. The city of Urkesh was abandoned. The people very likely travelled toward Egypt where the economy was booming, and the Hyksos may have been among them, and perhaps some of the migrants stopped in Canaan during their journey. In the Bible, Abraham&#039;s family was already travelling toward Canaan before God spoke to him, for an unspecified reason.

This was not a complete overhaul of the way France worked, it was simply a title change and the addition of a bit more court ceremony. Since Napoleon was already in complete control, nobody could do anything about it even if they disliked it. The power of Jacobins was long since broken and everyone else was not willing to stick their neck out.<br><br>3. Ideological republicanism was a minority view, mainly centred on bourgeois intelligentsia and working-class sans-culottes. Most of France still, even post revolution was supportive or neutral to the idea of monarchism, provided their actual grievances against the old regime were addressed. <br><br>4. Napoleon deliberetely styled his monarchy differently than the old regime, &quot;Emperor&quot; reflects Rome and Charlemagne, not the Bourbons. He was Emperor &quot;of the French&quot; not &quot;of France&quot; implying he was leader of the people, not owner of the land. The official name of the state remained &quot;French Republic&quot; for years after Napoleon crowned himself. This was a new form of Revolutionary Monarchy and Napoleon was keen to emphasise the change, even if they seem to us as just wording differences.", "time": 1673395242, "resto": 14450074}, {"no": 14450284, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:11:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14450074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14450074</a><br>The Revolution wasn&#039;t to get rid of their kings initially.

Because look at what the French Revolution led to! Napoleon! Liberty defaced with this man&#039;s face! Tyranny wearing a Phrygian cap with a tricolor cockade stuck to it! That&#039;s true. But what kind of victory was that anyways? What kind of world did the modern-day &quot;holy alliance&quot; of capital give to us?

Social, Religious, and Political/Economic. The religious aspect should be outside the realm of government - and if a church wants to preform a ceremony for gay couples then that&#039;s a matter for that church&#039;s leadership and congregation. The social aspect is to announce to your friends and family that you think that this relationship is the one you want to keep from now on (although given divorce stats there&#039;s some debate about how much this applies now), but again that&#039;s not something that you need a government&#039;s or church&#039;s permission for, just throw a party and announce it. The reason that marriage has legislation around it is for the last one there, the economic factor. A stable, loving, supportive heterosexual family has been proven time and time again to be the best scenario to breed and produce children (the next generation of citizens and workers, hence the government&#039;s interest in it). There isn&#039;t sufficient data to tell us how gay parents will compare to that just yet - and for such a polarising issue it is almost impossible for a fair and honest study to be conducted/published - but let&#039;s be real and acknowledge that at its best it can only be as good as a functional heterosexual marriage, just without the ability to actually breed their own children. <br><br>As such it is, in the absolute best possible case, a second rate set up for fulfilling the task of a marriage (from the perspective of the government, the people you are arguing should be involved).

In April 2013, the leaders of the Lev Tahor community developed a contingency plan in the event that the authorities would initiate action and seek to apprehend the children.[31] That August, 21 child services workers began knocking on doors. According to Denis Baraby, director of youth protection services in the area, they discovered some houses that were dirty, had 4\u20135 children sleeping in one bedroom, some mattresses soaked in urine, and children with fungus on their feet.

One woman said she was struck with a belt and a coat hanger, and a pregnant 17-year-old girl said she was beaten by her brother, sexually abused by her father, and married by force to a 30-year-old man when she was 15.[36] On November 27, 2013, a Quebec court ruled that 14 children of the group must be placed in foster care, and arrangements were made for the children to be placed in Yiddish-speaking foster homes.[40] On February 21, a Quebec court ruled the group did not have the right to appeal the previous ruling of a Quebec court, because they failed to file the appeal within a 30-day period, and soon, Canadian authorities began to seek custody of children of Lev Tahor members.[41][42]</span><br>they&#039;re cunts", "time": 1673334804, "resto": 14445308}, {"no": 14447767, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:52:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14446100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14446100</a><br>I can&#039;t believe a bunch of old geezers and kids were able to overpower a prison and the guards, are lantinos this weak?", "time": 1673347979, "resto": 14445308}, {"no": 14447809, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:10:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14445308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14445308</a><br><br>Based.

What happened here? Did I transfer my soul to every single person being pushed? Also I only exerted enough force to push one person, not a million person in the crowd, how did that happen? <br><br>The answer is karma/our strong mental habits create a &quot;push&quot; like effect for new births. New birth create their own conditions for pushing to the next new birth and so on. Each new push takes a new characteristics, some people push harder, others less so. Each person has a chance in stopping that wave but without understanding the incoming wave, the wave become unstoppable. Thats cycle of rebirth/karma/path to enlightenment in nutshell. <br><br>Concept of loving creator is nice. Its born from our idea that something good is &quot;out there&quot; to solve our suffering for us, without us even trying. Its the hope for a better future. But its a misplaced hope.

Initial linear formations however were either of defensive nature or required of higher numbers and the equivalent of human wave tactics to overwhelm traditional pike and shot elite professional troops, because unlike what morons say about innacuracy, at relatively short distances they were accurate, sniping was already a thing and a line of infantry firing at once does hit people. That was the fucking point. I mean, the retardation if it didn&#039;t... But the real game changer was artillery. Pike and shot formations had their tactics against this, like using the terrain to get some level of protection for themselves, making use of some sort of wood and metal shields and barricades, or simply ducking/lie on the ground. So even so, elite pike and shot units were still kicking the ass of linear infantry, the battle of Nordlingen is a nice example of Tercio units absolutely btfo pre-bayonet linear infantry. But then small, battlefield cannons became more available, efficient and prevalent and their firepower more overwhelming to the type of deep-ranked compact formation infantry units.

Such a mother will not ask others what she is to do, she will know it all and will fear nothing, and will always be at peace, for she will know that she has done what she had to do.", "filename": "Mothers-Love-Eli-Cedrone", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 479, "h": 640, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673407096308031, "time": 1673407096, "md5": "XNb27PPdjjr5JuhCsIYyJg==", "fsize": 144570, "resto": 14450828}, {"no": 14450943, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:19:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If there may be doubts for men and for a childless woman as to the way to, fulfil the will of God, for a mother that path is firmly and clearly defined, and if she fulfils it humbly with a simple heart she stands on the highest point of perfection a human being can attain, and becomes for all a model of that complete performance of God&#039;s will which all desire. <br><br>Only a mother can before her death tranquilly say to Him who sent her into this world, and Whom she has served by bearing and bringing up children whom she has loved more than herself - only she having served Him in the way appointed to her can say with tranquillity, &#039;Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.&#039; And that is the highest perfection to which, as to the highest good, men aspire. <br><br>Such women who fulfil their mission reign over men, and serve as a guiding star to man- kind; such women form public opinion and prepare the coming generation; and therefore in their hands lies the highest power, the power to save men from the existing and threatening evils of our time. <br><br>Yes, women, mothers, in your hands more than in those of anyone else lies the salvation <br>of the world.", "filename": "e158753ad2b0001d93680ae43e16edbc", "ext": ".png", "w": 949, "h": 1180, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673407170537586, "time": 1673407170, "md5": "mlq/gYCPOtcKWk4EJbUoYA==", "fsize": 213998, "resto": 14450828}]}]
