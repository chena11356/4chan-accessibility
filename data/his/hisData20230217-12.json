Even the U.S. conception of republicanism is distinct from the French concept of the &quot;general will&quot; and &quot;common good&quot; and so on; you can see how that birthed socialism. Russians endlessly debated the French Revolution, which was the tradition they drew from, when they made their own revolution, as they lacked a pre-existing democratic tradition.<br><br>But if you take the American concept of freedom for example, that means freedom from domination by political authority (the state); this theory is strictly a vertical one. That&#039;s how libertarians take it (freedom to own property with as little state interference as possible). On the left, it turns into something like communism, but discarding respect for private property, and including employers as a dominating group who we&#039;re trying to free ourselves from, but nobody can tell you what to do either (like doing drugs, etc., although it&#039;s fun to ask them if they support the Zapatistas shooting drug traffickers if you want to troll). <br><br>Employers in this framework are bad because of the hierarchical relationship. In Marxist socialism, employers are bad because employees are unfree as a *status*, you can be arbitrarily fired by your boss, and this unfree relationship exists even if the boss doesn&#039;t act on it, because he could, at any moment. That comes out of republicanism, not liberalism, but both have interacted in U.S. history, liberalism is quite strong though.", "filename": "Emma_02_Anarchists", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 873, "h": 486, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1676630448507848, "time": 1676630448, "md5": "UqpQwELv6W4xHHouKp7IsQ==", "fsize": 476946, "resto": 14641139}, {"no": 14641839, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)05:59:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14641823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14641823</a><br>That didn&#039;t have to do with the individuals involved. But part of it too is that the American left is also exceptionally self-loathing. The American left professes a hatred for &quot;America&quot; more than leftists in other countries, who loathe the U.S. government, but are usually much better at distinguishing it from the country called the United States and the people there. I&#039;m not sure why this is. Part of it might be that the last revolution you could say the U.S. had was the Civil War (which incidentally involved taking state power and using it). Most countries in the world otoh have seen their governments and state institutions and constitutions collapse or overthrown or rewritten multiple times since then. How many European constitutions in use today date to before the 20th century? The PRC&#039;s constitution dates to 1949:<br><br>https://youtu.be/E7C2MKlTTFw<br><br>So regimes come and go, but the country remains. The U.S. though has had a relatively smoother development over the same period. <br><br>This attitude on the U.S. left is also really self-defeating, as it reflects -- like a mirror -- the image of the U.S. that the rich and powerful have constructed; that their interests are the same as the interest of the country as a whole. For anyone reading this, do you believe it is? But since liberalism is so thick in the water, the antithesis to that can often be a total negation of both the particular U.S. regime and the concept of &quot;America&quot; itself, which I think is pretty nihilistic. But they haven&#039;t completed the circuit. A stronger (little-r) republican argument would say that&#039;s bullshit, the U.S. is ultimately ITS PEOPLE, who have been here this whole time. That tradition exists within the U.S., too, while the socialist republican would say the interest of the working class in particular reflects the general will of the American nation, but again, that&#039;s a pretty alien concept to the American political tradition.", "filename": "ohio-train-derailment-1-ap-230_hpMain_20230207-060432_16x9_992", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 992, "h": 558, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676631599346806, "time": 1676631599, "md5": "hfBOy4D8m45aSvLQNiYroA==", "fsize": 167707, "resto": 14641139}, {"no": 14641846, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)06:12:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14641139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14641139</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heh anarchism is so shit I&#039;d much rather be ruled by billionarie jews that want me dead than govern myself</span><br>never chang retards, never chang", "filename": "1587499936261", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 454, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1676632349116167, "time": 1676632349, "md5": "kxqWN/z3ks3W19oyfU3HRw==", "fsize": 28517, "resto": 14641139}, {"no": 14641856, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)06:18:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14641146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14641146</a><br>a gen x meme", "time": 1676632726, "resto": 14641139}, {"no": 14641860, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)06:20:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14641846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14641846</a><br>It&#039;s not a matter of preference, but about which system is actually capable of accumulating and exercising real power.

Therefore, garments had to adhere as strictly as possible to the standard parameters that gave these pieces an eminently imperial character; however, it has also been pointed out that one of the political strategies of the Inka state was to coordinate the diversity of the peoples, with their different cultures, languages, and traditions, without trying to homogenize them completely. The Inka promoted diversity and allowed local groups to produce material culture and conduct local ritual behavior in ways that represented their ethnic identity [14, 42]. In short, the relationship between the state and local communities was a dialectical process that varied from region to region and village to village, depending on the pressure exerted by the state and the receptivity of local groups [40, 43]. In our opinion, these historical contexts would have generated the conditions for local weavers to introduce morphological, technological, and stylistic features with low visibility, attributes which did not radically transform the imperial character of these iconic objects that represented the state.&quot;<br><br>there&#039;s still a level of assimilation involved - the state did have a lot of control over its subjects, especially compared to another empire like the aztecs for example. but they certainly organized the imperial structure around ethnicity.

Maybe the universe is infinitely old, and never started. Maybe aliens created the universe. I think that to say an omnipotent creator created the universe is just a massive assumption. I don&#039;t see enough evidence for it. Also of course let&#039;s remember that the idea of &quot;God&quot; is very old, and was used to try and explain things that can now be explained by science (like the complexity of the human body)... so I think the most likely explanation of the idea of &quot;God&quot; is that pre-scientific humans created this idea.

If it is so that a belief is illegitimate if it is not supported by such empirical evidence, then I must know what empirical evidence there is for the belief that all beliefs which are not supported by empirical evidence are illegitimate? Furthermore, we insist that God and spirits are immaterial, and the senses are manifestly only capable of detecting material objects. Given that an epistemology is intended to provide us a means of distinguishing truth from falsehood, to define only those beliefs which are proven with the senses to be rational is indistinct from identifying matter as the only thing which exists, and therefore the atheist who insists upon that standard begs the very question at issue, because he has begun the conversation by defining immaterial things as non-existent.

I can find many medieval historians point out that only a certain type of horse like a destrier would be preferred for a heavy knight charge. Riding knee to knee, the horse not only has the bravery to charge in the direction of spears, pikes, and missile fire, but it&#039;s got balls big enough to trust the rider to charge directly into them. In some cases they would run over men, kick, bite, and completely jump into the air to create space (only some horses can do this). They had absolutely ridiculous strength to get an armored man in and out of the melee alive. I don&#039;t care how well trained a horse is, it&#039;s not natural for most breeds to run into and over people or even run directly into a tight formation of enemy horses charging toward them. <br>However, I never see the spirit of the horse talked about in 20th century when they were most widely used in war.

He doesn&#039;t expect you to change over night, it is a process to carry that cross, it teaches you virtues like temperance and fortitude and courage. We all sin, that is the result of original sin and why we have Confession. Once you begin to orient your life--actions, words, thoughts--towards God and His love, you will not feel lonely as frequently.
