Many of the slain Americans were dumped in the mass grave at Yuzhnoye Butovo District near Moscow.[23] Even so, the people of the Soviet Republics still formed the majority of NKVD victims.</span>", "filename": "1579738284767", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 483, "h": 394, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 101, "tim": 1671748845680780, "time": 1671748845, "md5": "esXmfxDR/0ovRatlTnUqfA==", "fsize": 19550, "resto": 14359320}, {"no": 14363787, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:45:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14359747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14359747</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In several countries in the former Eastern Bloc, there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a &quot;totalitarian and criminal ideology&quot; and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols such as the red star is considered a criminal offence.

It does not help that popular depictions of this type of warfare are overly idealized and only focus on the most impressive aspects - mainly the singular line of infantry advancing valiently under fire (the same can be said about cavalry). In truth most battles included distinctive skirmishing phases and areas depending on the terrain and or structures. <br>Only when two infantry formations would meet in an open field without any impactful outside influences (such as cavalry, artillery, terrain, etc.) it would turn practically into a game of chicken as this poster said here <a href=\"#p14365726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14365726</a><br><a href=\"#p14363710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14363710</a><br>This would risk the cohesion of the unit and exhaust the men.Not that skirmishers in loose order would not move faster when the situation called for.

A child will be seen as Jewish by Jewish communities of all stripes if their mother was a Jew, regardless of whether or not their father was a Gentile or a convert. There is often heavy social stigma against converts in many Jewish communities. Some of the greatest rabbis and biblical figures in Jewish history were converts or descended from converts.

There was a constant string of mass murders and war crimes committed by American troops throughout the entire decade of American involvement in the war.<br>Every major American unit in Vietnam, down to the brigade, had &quot;incidents&quot; wherein Vietnamese civilians were abused, murdered, and raped. The only thing exceptional about My Lai was its scope, killing hundreds at once was a step too far that couldn&#039;t be hidden. But the brutalization and killings of civilians was routine.<br>Even the most cursory examination of the evidence shows this, and it isn&#039;t even hidden or disputed. The US military&#039;s own analysis showed that during Operation Speedy Express, for example, 5000-7000 of the 10000 Vietnamese killed were civilians. The most outrageous stories there coming from the helicopter and light plane crews that admitted to military investigators that they constantly just murdered anyone they saw for any reason they could think of.<br>The ubiquitous search and destroy missions were much more up close and personal. Many times these were just covers for the wholesale destruction of a village that happened to be close to a place where a Viet Cong ambush had taken place, or where a GI had gotten injured or killed by a trap or mine. Troops bombed the village, rolled in, burned the houses, killed the livestock, raped the women, and then killed them along with anyone else they could get their hands on. I suggest you read Jamie Henry&#039;s account of one such attack. The highlight is really something, and it was attested to by multiple witnesses to military investigators. Or you could read about Roy Bumgarner, who was known as a murderer among troops and was convicted of manslaughter after gunning down four civilians and blowing their heads up with a grenade to teach some new recruits how to conduct themselves. <br>I can&#039;t do the extent of the violence justice, there is too much and I get too angry.

The army was so great that the defending claimants to the throne simply fled, leaving all their possessions and their claims to the kingdom behind. Thus, having driven his enemies before him, Conaire has successfully upped his honor by wielding a large army to take something by force of arms. However, in \u201cDestruction\u201d, Conaire does not come to power by force of arms. Instead, he relies on prophecy that says he will be king and stands up for his right at the feast by invoking his noble lineage.

They\u2019re brown, black, and dark reddish-brown.<br><br>He was describing how the horrors of slavery in the hot sun would make their already dark skin much darker as it tanned.That\u2019s why the next portion of the text specifies their physical description as \u201cmore ruddy in BODY than rubies.\u201d It also refers to their ruddy appearance in the past tense.Notice only the rubies and charcoal are given bodily designations not the snow. Their BODIES were more ruddy than rubies and their FACES became black as coal but their whiteness is not given similar treatment.This is because it was not in relation to their skin color.In scripture whiteness is used several times in the abstract sense to convey the idea of cleansing from sin:<br>Psalm 51:7 &quot;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.&quot;<br><br>Daniel 12:10 &quot;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.&quot;", "filename": "natural rubies", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 535, "h": 453, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1671748534002658, "time": 1671748534, "md5": "3Zd5fxugP6EuDoR1IBCqMg==", "fsize": 45600, "resto": 14362176}, {"no": 14363768, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14363559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14363559</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Lamentations 4:7 they were, as you admitted a second ago that this passage was indeed describing their appearance.</span><br>I made no such admission.

I will further elucidate you on this matter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;II Kings 5:27 - Therefore the leprosy of Na&#039;aman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.

They said, \u201chath the Lord indeed spoken only to Moses? Hath he not spoken also by us?\u201d Their challenge to Moses angered God, so as a punishment He caused Miriam to become white.<br><br>So you have Lamentations 4:7 &quot;white as snow&quot; compared to II Kings 5:27 as well as Numbers 12:10 &quot;white as snow&quot;. How can this same whiteness be a matter-of-fact description of the Israelites&#039; natural skin tone in the first passage yet stated clearly to be as a mark of an unnatural, shameful and unholy curse in the latter two?

According to the medieval commentator, Rashi, we should not erase or destroy God\u2019s name and should avoid writing it. In a Responsa (legal opinion) by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the primary prohibition against erasure of the name God applies to the sacred names in a written text of Torah.
