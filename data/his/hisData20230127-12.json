It boils down to their &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality, though every ideology is guilty of this to a degree, the new left has taken it to another level. It takes patient honest study to understand an argument and see why it is correct, but due to their sense of &quot;righteousness&quot; they never give their opponents an ounce of thought beyond their thought stopping logical fallacies and emotional appeals.

IE, desire and libidinal desire isn&#039;t just a superstructural element of society but actually part of the material, economic, infrastructural &quot;base&quot; of society, and every unconscious libidinal investment is social and bears upon a socio-historical field.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The truth is sexuality is everywhere: the way a bureaucrat fondles his records, a judge administers justice, a businessman causes money to circulate; the way the bourgeoisie fucks the proletariat; and so on. [...] Flags, nations, armies, banks get a lot of people aroused.</span><br><br>As an outgrowth of this, the next argument is that &#039;desire&#039; as discussed historically is not merely an abstract impulse that emerges in the theatre of the unconscious (as Freud would see it), and it is not just concerned with acquisition, ie the desire to acquire things (as Plato would see it). Instead, desire is a positive process of production that produces reality, a machine that engineers and manufactures its own objects, its own self-replication, and its own autopoiesis. This was influenced by Nietzsche&#039;s will to power and Spinoza&#039;s conatus.<br>This is then applied to the concept of social reproduction, as in the reproduction and repetition of certain social modes in a given society. Since desire produces reality, social production, with its forces and relations, is purely and simply desiring-production itself under determinate conditions. They argue, thus, that the social universe is composed of &#039;desiring-machines&#039;, all connected to one another and involved in the production and reproduction of desires, which form the individual pieces of much of social reality, like the cells of a body.", "time": 1674790082, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535473, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:29:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14529672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14529672</a><br><a href=\"#p14535467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535467</a><br><br>This concept is fundamental to the book, and from it the notion of the Anti-Oedipus. Freud argues that the Oedipus complex represents an area in which the unconscious and desire is central to the social world - in the tripartite structure of the family (mother, father, offspring). However, the Anti-Oedipus shows that it&#039;s foolish to argue that the social world is solely made up of tripartite families, and instead it is an interconnected flow of different desires and the production of said desires by the desiring machines (ie humans). <br><br>From that standpoint, the concept of the desiring machine, they begin to interrogate how capitalism relates to this production of desire, and how it predicates itself upon the repression of some desiring machines, which leads to neurosis. The argument, then, is that schizophrenia is an extreme mental state co-existent with the capitalist system itself.<br><br>&#039;Desire&#039; here is obviously a broad term, but they were influenced by the discoveries of geneticists and the self-replication of genes - the &#039;desire&#039; for self-replication, survival, procreation showing that desire was not merely an aberrant impulse to acquire, but rather a fundamental productive force. From there, they develop the concept of a &#039;body without organs&#039; - ie the unregulated potential of a body without organisational structures imposed on its constituent parts by the necessities of biological homeostasis, the need to eat, sleep, breath, and instead one that is formed of combinations of desiring machines.

This is modelled on Kant and his transcendental apperception, which isn&#039;t about reality as the Ding an sich (thing-in-itself), ie objective reality independent of representation and observation, but rather reality as it is experienced. Kant argued that much of our experience of what we imagine to be objective reality, i.e. the space and time around us, are actually the forms of intuition via which we structure our experience. Your perception of light isn&#039;t the objective nature of light as a thing-in-itself, but rather light as it is observed by the self. Your perception of time isn&#039;t the objective nature of time as a thing-in-itself, but rather time as it is observed by the self. While the things-in-themselves do exist, they are distinct from our experience of them. From this it follows that the objects of our experience are mere &#039;appearances&#039; and that the nature of things as they are in themselves is unknowable to us. You can compare this to the allegory of the cave, or even to the observer effect in quantum mechanics (which relies on advanced forms of mechanical intuition). This is the basic argument behind Kant&#039;s epistemological programme, which he called transcendental idealism. It has been an epistemological argument that philosophers have grappled with since the 18th century. Russell and the analytics opposed it with na\u00efve realism, which argues that no, we can trust our perception, the world is knowable as it really is, without any consideration of the knower&#039;s manner of knowing. This has always struck me as putting your fingers in your ears and going &#039;La La La&#039;. Applied metaphysical realism to me is like the healthy vegetable of philosophy - it has done us a lot of good so far, it keeps our bowels in check, but it is far from the whole story.", "time": 1674794563, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535765, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:43:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535678</a><br><a href=\"#p14535762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535762</a><br><br>Attached is a map of Kant&#039;s model of coherent consciousness (an issue which is still challenging us today under the new guise of the &#039;consciousness and binding problem&#039;). Deleuze and Guattari basically repurpose this and apply it specifically to desire, desire as an investment or cathexis, meaning a concept or object that is allocated mental, emotional or even physical energy. If desire is allocated less energy, it becomes a libidinal investment rather than a direct investment. If your desire is to drink water, and you then immediately follow every course of action to drink water, then that&#039;s a direct investment. If your desire is to drink water, but your job, your family, or other social relations require you to de-prioritise that desire and follow other, unrelated courses of desire, then your desire to drink water becomes libidinal - at least until you have the opportunity to drink water.<br><br>This leads us to<br><br>2) The meaning that is more important to Deleuze and Guattari is that desire is thus, then, a socially productive and reproductive force. The thing driving the development of a social sector, or a social world, or an entire society, economy, civilisation, whatever, is not just the material conditions, but also the ecosystem and flow of desires between the occupants. There is a complex, mutable web of trillions and trillions of desires being produced by desiring machines, and much of this then governs not just the overall shape of social development, but also the junction at which the self and the world come together (as in Kant).", "filename": "transcendental apperception", "ext": ".png", "w": 1926, "h": 420, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 27, "tim": 1674794624441901, "time": 1674794624, "md5": "ETEbWj1bxdVmpl1c90c0eg==", "fsize": 138140, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535796, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:56:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535684</a><br><br>Science did not exist in Plato&#039;s time.

However, no amount of that can truly contend with the armour piercing question: What proof is there that you are observing and testing the universe as it objectively exists, and not instead simply observing and testing your own objects of experience? How do you know you&#039;re measuring the universe to gain and objective piece of information - a fact - instead of gaining an objective piece of information about your experience alone? How do you know you&#039;re not just measuring the shadows on the cave wall? It&#039;s a really annoying, pointless question, but it can&#039;t really be satisfactorily answered. The metaphysical realists have created a million rebuttals (see: post-Hume analytic philosophy), but still cannot escape the shadow of this postulate.

The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some consider slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.

The only remnant of the early Judaic Christians in the New Testament is Revelation, which was written by survivors of the Jewish Revolt wondering why God hasn&#039;t nuked Rome for destroying the Temple and coping real hard that it&#039;s coming soon trust the plan.<br><br>More references:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON<wbr>O9MhbJFMs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga<wbr>E5PG8gbnE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS<wbr>LtDUtfhco</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC<wbr>-rnKTn4mM</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP<wbr>JoG8VNBNg</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E<wbr>FpEqLE9kE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU<wbr>dMaaKmgEc</span>", "time": 1674787921, "resto": 14531880}, {"no": 14535375, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:53:13", "name": "Chud Anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535363</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;turn the other cheek</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;render unto ceaser </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be meek and keep your head down</span><br><br>It was excellent tuff for keeping the proles quiet", "filename": "AC2C8F3B-D405-4351-B14D-9FDE390431D4", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674787993133639, "time": 1674787993, "md5": "b065Ayjw3rgjRz5GlXq9Cw==", "fsize": 652093, "resto": 14531880}, {"no": 14535379, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:56:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535370</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paul was never a jew, he was a gentile</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paul never existed</span><br>Please take your meds", "time": 1674788182, "resto": 14531880}, {"no": 14535382, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:59:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535375</a><br>Was it the Jews or was it the Romans", "time": 1674788343, "resto": 14531880}, {"no": 14535658, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:06:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535310</a><br>what, you think it&#039;s more likely some guy rose from the dead 2000 years ago?", "time": 1674792396, "resto": 14531880}, {"no": 14536486, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:54:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14534610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14534610</a><br>I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a state that should force you to do stuff, no", "time": 1674813244, "resto": 14531880}, {"no": 14536517, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:11:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14531902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14531902</a><br>bait", "time": 1674814285, "resto": 14531880}, {"no": 14536782, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)06:50:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14536486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14536486</a><br>I agree, but would that be evil?", "time": 1674820222, "resto": 14531880}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14535042, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:29:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Knowing that Fall Blau was a complete logistical disaster, what should Hitler have done instead?", "filename": "lNc4FQc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 6637, "h": 4983, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1674782992507512, "time": 1674782992, "md5": "5RS0Y/bErzBZ4G4+NcTxCQ==", "fsize": 4050468, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "knowing-that-fall-blau-was-a-complete-logistical", "replies": 13, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 14535058, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:34:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535042</a><br>Declare war on Mexico.

His book was based almost entirely on 200 interviews with American, Pakistan, Saudi and Afghan participants. He also tried to draw on documents as much as he could but this proved difficult as there is very little documentation during this period. He describes the book as a piece of journalism where he attempted to bring multiple and balanced points of view to bear on controversial episodes.<br><br>The story is written in 3 parts. The first section covers the anti-Soviet Jihad of 1979-89, a time when the U.S. collaborated with Pakistani and Saudi intelligence to aid the Afghan Mujahadeen battling Soviet occupying forces. The second phase he covers in the book begins in 1989 with the Soviet pullout and goes through late 1997, early 1998. Here he tells the story of the &quot;American retreat form Afghanistan and the rise of the Taliban, the full radicalization of Bin Laden, the maturation of Al Qaeda into a global terrorist organization, and the erosion of common cause among CIA, ISI (Pakistani), and Saudi intelligence.&quot; The third and final part of this story begins in the Spring of 1998 and runs right up to Sept 10, 2001. Here Coll focuses on the return of CIA covert action to Afghanistan and the Clinton Administration&#039;s mandate to capture, disrupt, or kill Bin Laden, and his lieutenants.<br><br>Coll went on to highlight a few of the major themes in each part of the book including the relationship between the Saudis and Bin Laden in the 1980s as well as Bin Laden&#039;s evolving relationship with Pakistani Intelligence (ISI) which led to his role in training guerillas for Kashmir and other theatres.

Many ANA fighters were Hazari, more out of a desire to keep the Sunni Pashtun Taliban from taking power, which would mean a return to the ethno-religious cleansing policies promoted by the Taliban.

American&#039;s have long struggled (or outright ignored) the complexity of other regions of the world. The campaign in Afghanistan highlighted this fact.

I tend to think all the actual numbers are made up, and that the putting Simeon&#039;s numbers on par with Levi&#039;s are an attempt to link the two tribes. Furthermore, like the Levites, they don&#039;t have a core of contiguous claimed territory within Israel (and I want to stress claim, since I think the territorial claims are about as real as the census numbers, i.e. not very). Simeon and Levi, however, have little enclaves scattered all over the place, often individual towns with little plots of land around them.

There are also a bunch of later Aggadic stories about him which usually stress his close ties with Levi, above and beyond that of the other brothers, as well as his psychopathic disposition.

At the US exhibit in Moscow was showcased an average American home, complete with all the modern furnishings and appliances a working class family in 1959 might have. Khrushchev countered that vacuum cleaners and electric washing machines were &quot;capitalist frivolities&quot; and useless. He added that the average Soviet citizen could easily enjoy these standards of living if they desired, but sacrificed such selfish creature comforts for the greater benefit of the nation. &quot;Our people prefer to have rockets instead, which are better than American rockets.&quot; &quot;Wouldn&#039;t you prefer we discuss the merits of washing machines over rockets?

Nixon countered Soviet charges that the model home shown at the exhibition was simply a Potemkin village and not representative of reality, he read off statistics showing that there were 56 million registered motor vehicles in the United States, 50 million TV sets, and 143 million radio sets.

I never forgot it. We were sitting around my mother&#039;s big old radio listening, and then we argued about it for months afterward. We knew he was speaking the truth for this reason: There was a story on the front page of Pravda claiming Nixon tried to bribe a man in the crowd at a market to come and hear him speak. This was a ridiculous charge. If anything, a common Russian man would have tried to bribe an official to come and hear the American vice president speak, not vice versa! So nobody believed the Pravda story anyway, but then when he was on the radio, Nixon got really mad about it and actually accused Pravda of lying. We knew he was speaking uncensored, right from the heart. So then we really listened to him, and we argued on and on about how Americans had so much money, freedom, and all these truthful newspapers he offered in exchange for Pravda. It was the first time a lot of us ever even considered the idea that the West might have better quality of life than us, or that freedom of the press was a good thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know it sounds silly, but you cannot imagine just how brainwashed we were at school and university.

Do you know who really brought glasnost to Moscow? It was Richard Nixon. Of course, I&#039;m exaggerating a little but there is some truth to it.

The two leaders became increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress of the negotiations. Kennedy later said of Khrushchev, &quot;He beat the hell out of me&quot; and told New York Times reporter James &#039;Scotty&#039; Reston immediately afterwards it was the &quot;worst thing in my life. He savaged me.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[17] On the other hand, Khrushchev viewed the summit in a much more positive light. In his memoir he showed ambivalence, writing, &quot;I was generally pleased with our meeting in Vienna. Even though we came to no concrete agreement, I could tell that [Kennedy] was interested in finding a peaceful solution to world problems and avoiding conflict with the Soviet Union.&quot;[18] However, historian William Taubman suggests that Khrushchev merely felt he could &quot;push Kennedy around.&quot;[19]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In addition to conveying U.S. reluctance to defend the full rights of Berlin&#039;s citizens, Kennedy ignored his own cabinet officials&#039; advice to avoid ideological debate with Khrushchev. Khrushchev outmatched Kennedy in this debate and came away believing he had triumphed in the summit over a weak and inexperienced leader. Observing Kennedy&#039;s morose expression at the end of the summit, Khrushchev believed Kennedy &quot;looked not only anxious, but deeply upset.... I hadn&#039;t meant to upset him. I would have liked very much for us to part in a different mood. But there was nothing I could do to help him.... Politics is a merciless business.&quot;[20]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy believed that another failure on the part of the United States would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. He was thus determined to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; and prevent a communist victory in the Vietnam War. He told Reston, &quot;Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.&quot;[21][22]</span><br><br>The virgin Kennedy<br>The Chad Nixon", "filename": "455572893475", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 872, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1674785167713803, "time": 1674785167, "md5": "Zn8lUtJJ5z51UMb+hS0zng==", "fsize": 129318, "resto": 14534061}, {"no": 14535224, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:08:29", "name": "Chud Anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p14534789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14534789</a><br>Want me to post pictures of Chechnya under Soviet rule?<br><br><a href=\"#p14535084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535084</a><br>The USSR plundered multiple nations by illegally occupying Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, and half of Poland before WW2, and then the rest of East Europe after WW2.<br><br>Soviet retards were so bad at farming they had to steal their food from impoverished Ukrainians.", "time": 1674785309, "resto": 14534061}, {"no": 14535230, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:09:52", "name": "Chud Anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535207</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;any communist movement of the future</span><br><br>LMAO let me stop you right there dumbass.

Since Christ will do whatever Mary asks of him, this means that Mary did not actually pray for you, otherwise Christ would have done what she asked. So therefore the means of getting your prayer answered is to supplicate Mary in the hope that she will eventually deign to pray for you, since that is a sure way to have your prayer granted. The focus shifts from Christ to his mother. Rather than trusting in Christ&#039;s judgment, you have a sure way to make him acquiesce to your demand, if only you can get his mother to pray for you. And how can you place your faith in a mere human in this way? Christ hears all prayers, he answers all prayers, he knows all of your needs, he knows what is best for you.

An autopsy found her blood alcohol level to be .25 and there were no drugs in her system. It took four days to identify Melissa and another day to search Gardner&#039;s trailer. Police immediately suspected a racial motive to the murder as there was a &quot;crudely-written racial diatribe&quot; in the trailer, complete with racial epithets about white oppression, which claimed blacks were &quot;justified in seeking revenge.&quot;", "time": 1674795356, "resto": 14535774}, {"no": 14535798, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:57:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "By January 9, 1993, police had arrested seven people including two of the ringleaders--Matthew Mack and Matthew Williams\u2014and two women, Edna Williams and Indira Simmons, who were charged with being accessories to murder and sexual assault.

Money and power can be lost or unattainable, but your blood is and will be yours for life, so making the most of your heritage (real or imagined) can easily become a lifelong obsession.", "time": 1674755396, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533089, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)13:34:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "When you have no personal accomplishment or remarkable trait then surely you&#039;re based because your ancestors were, too.", "time": 1674758091, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533160, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)13:51:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532950</a><br><a href=\"#p14533089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533089</a><br>Truly fascinating", "time": 1674759104, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533209, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:02:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532896</a>", "filename": "explain meme neolithic farmers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 719, "h": 726, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674759737540787, "time": 1674759737, "md5": "DC9KpoX0NwmGnaNBgKm8AA==", "fsize": 100741, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533213, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:03:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14533209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533209</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My ancestor were shit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But i m 6&#039;4 n attractivs</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ancestor were nords vikingz </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but i m 5&#039;4 and a chud</span><br><br>Which one would you choose?", "time": 1674759816, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533217, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:04:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532950</a><br>Good post", "time": 1674759873, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533288, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532901</a><br>this is rather sad.", "time": 1674760747, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533290, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:19:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14533213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533213</a><br>First one.", "filename": "giga", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 586, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674760779956181, "time": 1674760779, "md5": "k0iWy/vm8SBmIyy+cqyPcg==", "fsize": 23481, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533314, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:26:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532901</a><br>no cap good theory desu frfr", "time": 1674761182, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533382, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:41:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14533290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533290</a><br>Has expected", "time": 1674762099, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533807, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532950</a><br>Holy gem", "time": 1674766836, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533816, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:02:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14533213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533213</a><br>second one", "filename": "1627055815986", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674766948187434, "time": 1674766948, "md5": "8PVUnsRzZQsm28IL6e+1RA==", "fsize": 50835, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533825, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:03:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532896</a><br>Because we know that Bronze Age genetic components correlate with some phenotypical features. <br><a href=\"#p14533213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533213</a><br>Impossible.", "filename": "1674766957054", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 985, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1674767010601601, "time": 1674767010, "md5": "WYRBwDknFZ0PhcLIPgTMKQ==", "fsize": 259940, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533837, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:05:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14533825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533825</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;impossible</span><br><br>I m med and tall genetics need not apply", "filename": "95e", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 1209, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674767132890383, "time": 1674767132, "md5": "583yAzB27fbcUHhaEcE2rA==", "fsize": 79809, "resto": 14532896}, {"no": 14533886, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:13:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14533837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533837</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cool story</span><br>Nobody cares, goblin.

And if he does it then he will have &quot;seed.&quot; The Hebrew word is Zera, which always means biological descendants. Did Jesus have children? What&#039;s happening is that the children of Israel have a choice: if they will be righteous, God will reward them with descendants, and if not they will perish. It is exactly the same message we see again and again throughout the Torah. To make one&#039;s soul into a sin offering means to devote one&#039;s life to serving God. Crucially, the &quot;sin offering&quot; or restitution is paid to God on his own behalf, not on behalf of others. In verse 11 he justified many by &quot;his knowledge,&quot; which is the knowledge of God this righteous servant will spread throughout the world. See Zechariah 8:23. If this is a blood sacrifice on the cross, why didn&#039;t Isaiah say we are saved by his &quot;blood&quot;? In verse 12 he bears the sins of others because he is a victim of their sins (envy, hatred, pride, greed, etc.). His death is not an atonement for their sins. A person can intercede for others by praying for them or doing good things in their name, but that is it. Every person must still atone for their own sins (see Ezekiel 18:20-23). You only think Isaiah 53 is about Jesus because you already believe in him.

In Korea, there is a shortage of sperm donors; the law dictates that only one donation is permitted from every male. As such, for patients that need to rely on the use of donor sperm, the quantity of donors to choose from is quite limited. Egg donation and surrogacy are also not allowed in Korea. For these reasons, Korean patients with infertility issues will often travel to the Fertility Institute of Hawaii to seek services that can enhance conception, outside of the limited treatment modalities available in their home country.

While anyone can use PGS in order to ensure that only chromosomally normal embryos are transferred during an IVF cycle, PGS is often used for older couples who have an elevated risk of chromosomally abnormal embryos.

However, the Spanish officials in the colony could do very little except tolerate the extraterritorial interference and continue their policy of appeasement. Their well-armed but tiny garrison stood no match for the tens of thousands of soldiers Taiwan could muster in the event of armed conflict.194 In fact, by 1670, Zheng Jing and his officials were already seriously considering an invasion of the Philippines, and appeared, for all purposes, to be repeating the precedent set out by Chenggong toward the Dutch, until the outbreak of Rebellion of the Three Feudatories in 1674 put an end to their preparations.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The expeditionary force planned to attack Manila after the monsoon season, in early 1671.

There she took Christian instruction and was baptised prior to her marriage at Aden on 30 May 1867. Nonetheless, in a later letter to her sister, she avoided eating pork and dreaded attending church, stressing that she remained Muslim in secret.[4] She had given birth to a son, Heinrich, in Aden in December 1866; he died in France en route to Germany in the summer of 1867.[5]</span><br><br>This is the Muslim princess&#039;s autobiography.<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00ruetgoog/page/n11<br><br>https://archive.org/details/memoirs<wbr>anarabia00stragoog/page/n9<br><br>Her descendants with the Christian German man still live in Florida in the US I&#039;ve heard.", "filename": "Salma_bent_said", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 322, "h": 468, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674780926009341, "time": 1674780926, "md5": "GppG639XxUMv7QbQc/dt7A==", "fsize": 69055, "resto": 14533564}, {"no": 14534893, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)19:56:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14534885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14534885</a><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phili<wbr>ppe_Servaty<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Philippe Servaty is a Belgian[1] Walloon journalist who formerly worked for Brussels-based newspaper Le Soir.[2] While in Morocco from 2002\u201305, he engaged in sex with over 80 Moroccan women, promising to take them to Belgium.[3] Before leaving for Belgium, he asked them for sexual photos as souvenirs and photographed them in poses that could be seen as degrading. They included ejaculating on the face of a veiled woman and having another woman kneel, bound, and gagged while he urinated on her.[3][4] After returning to Belgium, he published the photos on the internet under the pseudonym, &#039;Belguel&#039; and included captions such as, &quot;There is no better drug than to ejaculate on the veiled face of a woman.&quot; &quot;These sluts are so naive.

For example in Proverbs 8:16 where the pre-Masoretic Hebrew originally says &quot;judges of the earth,&quot; the Ben Asher Masoretic text instead says &quot;those who judge rightly.&quot; One more example of a difference between these two is in Malachi 1:12, where the pre-Masoretic Hebrew says &quot;table of the LORD&quot; (\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4), containing here the Tetragrammaton, while the Ben Asher Masoretic text instead says &quot;table of the Lord&quot; (\u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9) in this place, which is a different Hebrew word, pronounced &quot;Adonai&quot;. The difference between these words is translated distinctly in English Bibles, where the Tetragrammaton is written as LORD in all capital letters, while the word &quot;Adonai&quot; instead is usually written as Lord with one capital letter. In Malachi 1:11 both versions have the Tetragrammaton, so you will see all translations write LORD in capitals there. Only the pre-Masoretic Hebrew (the older version, whose origin really has nothing at all to do with the Masoretes) had this word in Malachi 1:12.", "time": 1674793378, "resto": 14533451}, {"no": 14535725, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:26:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535716</a><br>Forgot pic.", "filename": "Hutter_Mal_1_12_Underlined", "ext": ".png", "w": 1324, "h": 396, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 37, "tim": 1674793563543645, "time": 1674793563, "md5": "cDQPUWASELUxLeVFe/1ouQ==", "fsize": 668065, "resto": 14533451}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14535711, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:21:43", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Anti-Gnostics refuted", "com": "The natural world is, objectively calculated, an unimaginably giant machine of unfathomable suffering.

But many have argued that this is false: see, for instance, Faria (2016), Faria and Paez (2015), Horta (2010, 2017), Ng (1995), and Tomasik (2015). On this alternative view, most animals live \u201cnet negative lives,\u201d that is, they experience more pain than pleasure for reasons having little to do with human beings. Animals regularly starve, suffer from debilitating injuries and diseases, and find themselves the victims of predation. And when not facing these acute sources of pain, they are often stressed by their possibility: many animals live their lives on high alert, constantly having to be wary of deadly threats. Moreover, it\u2019s plausible that most animals don\u2019t live long enough to reach more secure positions in the food web where they are less vulnerable to predation. Consider that elephants might have 6 offspring; mice, 40; some species of salmon, 17,000; and ocean sunfish, 300 million per year. Obviously, most of these animals die young.</span>", "filename": "Vendimian_of_Bythinia_Menologion_of_Basil_II", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2691, "h": 1769, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 164, "tim": 1674793303020163, "time": 1674793303, "md5": "ED2lT9wy82oXgGlZrP/Cdw==", "fsize": 3398229, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "antignostics-refuted", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 14535712, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:21:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is among fish species in particular that we find some of the most extreme examples of the r-strategy. Consider a particular example discussed by Oscar Horta: the Atlantic Cod population located on the Gulf of Maine\u2019s bank (Horta 2010). An adult female cod lays anywhere from many thousands to many millions of eggs each time (J\u00f8rstad et al. 2007, 11). Furthermore, it was estimated that in 2007 the Gulf of Maine\u2019s bank contained 33, 877 metric tons of \u2018spawning stock\u2019, i.e., one million cod old enough to breed if we assume an average weight of 33.877 kilograms per cod (Mayo et al. 2009, 100). Even if only a small proportion of their eggs hatch, it remains true that a tremendous amount of suffering and premature death occurs every time a more or less stable cod population of this size reproduces. Horta estimates an aggregate total of 200 billion seconds or roughly 6,300 years of suffering across the doomed codlings produced per cycle, but the precise figures don\u2019t really matter. Whatever the correct amount of suffering and premature death is, it\u2019s astronomically high, and this is just for a specific r-strategist fish species in a very specific geographic area.</span>", "time": 1674793318, "resto": 14535711}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14534345, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)17:40:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Was this the biggest grudgefest of the Pacific Campaign?", "filename": "Battle_of_Peleliu_map", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 576, "h": 675, "tn_w": 213, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674772848587244, "time": 1674772848, "md5": "Q+hFL0jIB6iZACj4kozbEw==", "fsize": 181403, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "was-this-the-biggest-grudgefest-of-the-pacific", "replies": 7, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 14534439, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)18:02:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why didn&#039;t they just dump a bucket of poisonous snakes on these islands and block it off?", "time": 1674774146, "resto": 14534345}, {"no": 14534462, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)18:05:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14534439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14534439</a><br>Peleliu is special in that it was a largely pointless slaughter.
