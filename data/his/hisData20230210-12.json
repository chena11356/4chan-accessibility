There are many allegories present in Christianity that exist in relation to previous deities. The concept of a God being born in or around the winter solstice, when the sun starts to &quot;grow&quot; in the Northern Hemisphere, is not unique to Jesus, nor is being born of a virgin mother, nor a story of resurrection, nor being a doer of miracles, nor being a representative of the forces of light (or the Sun, more accurately). Jesus is just an amalgamation of various pagan deities. A little bit of Mithras, a bit of Serapis, a bit of Osiris, a bit of Dionysus. Whatever. The same way Serapis was a syncretism of Osiris and Apis. Christianity was just a syncretism of Greco-Roman paganism and Hebraic paganism. The caveats of sin and salvation were added as a tool to better control the plebeian masses, as was the discouragement of transcendental magic and esoteric studies (see: the death of mystery cults and the crushing of Gnosticism). It is easier to rule over unenlightened slaves than enlightened ones. Not to mention, though no less significant, it helped centralise the power structures of the day.

What saith history?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It seems that in the early centuries of Christianity no distinctive dress was adopted by ecclesiastics. Many indications point to this conclusion ... The most explicit testimony is that afforded by a letter of Pope Celestine in 428 to certain bishops of Gaul, in which he rebukes them for wearing attire which made them conspicuous, and lays down the rule that &quot;we [the bishops and clergy] should be distinguished from the common people [plebe] by our learning, not by our clothes; by our conduct, not by our dress; by cleanness of mind, not by the care we spend upon our person&quot; (Mansi, &quot;Concilia&quot;, IV, 465). In the East it would seem to have been the custom for ascetics and philosophers, whether Christian or not to affect a special habit, but the Christian clergy generally did not profess asceticism in this distinctive way, and were content to wear the birrus (byros) like the laity about them. ... &quot;If any man&quot;, says [the Council of Gangra (340)], &quot;uses the pallium [cloak] upon account of an ascetic life, and, as if there be some holiness in that, condemns those who with reverence use the birrus and other garments that are commonly worn, let him be anathema&quot; (Hefele-Leclercq, &quot;Hist. des Conc.&quot;, I, 1037). At the other extremity of Christendom the documents that survive concerning St. Patrick and other early Celtic bishops present them to us as habitually dressed in the casula (chasuble), which was at that time not a distinctively liturgical attire, but simply an outer garment commonly worn by the humbler classes.</span><br><br>https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04<wbr>419b.htm", "time": 1676010196, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606516, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:24:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14606510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606510</a><br>Point me to any father in the first 500 years of the church who supports the cultic veneration of man-made images.", "time": 1676010295, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606527, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:28:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14606478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606478</a><br>Why do you think all their arguments eventually boil down to an appeal to authority lol", "time": 1676010519, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606544, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:33:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14605219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14605219</a><br>That&#039;s a Vatican II Roman Catholic church, not a Protestant one.<br>Who are you fooling?", "time": 1676010815, "resto": 14605211}, {"no": 14606559, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:39:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14606485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606485</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Please stop calling us Protestants, the proper term is Reformed Catholic.</span><br>Apostolic succession?<br><br><a href=\"#p14606478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14606478</a><br>The church is as the church does.

Beds were made of straw. They were generally illiterate. The village priest was also drawn from the lower classes and often had a poor understanding of Latin and theology compared to more noble born priests and bishops. A peasant could not leave the manor without permission from their lord. While under some forms of serfdom a lord could force you to fight, especially as time went on, this burden fell on freemen and later professional mercenaries. On the other hand it was not unheard of for villages to suffer raids from knights without wars to fight. Hunting was for nobles, a peasant could get in big trouble if they were caught hunting. Fishing however was OK. Most meat peasants ate was preserved. They did get some meat and fish but the vast majority of their diet was grain based.

Oliver Cromwell would have called himself a farmer for an example, although the period is wrong it gives you an idea of the meaning of a farmer into the early modern period. Also when we are talking about &quot;peasants&quot; where in Europe are we talking makes a big difference in terms of class. A &quot;peasant&quot; in England is different from one in a French kingdom who is different from a central European kingdom and so on. Also you have to consider regions where farming was poor.

The word &quot;Ethnos&quot; is litterally a ethnic group, you might say this is a &quot;race&#039; , but that still doesn&#039;t cut it. Greeks used ethnos to signify basically a tribal group of people. However because Greeks spoke different dialects of Greek, and because they were never unified politically and defined their differences in what political systems they used there was never a Greek nation in the ethno-political sense nor exactly in the precice cultural sense. Rather the interesting thing with Greeks is that although they had no uniform national-ethnic identity , they certainly used a term as an exonym to define anyone who was not Greek, that is the &quot;barbarian&quot;. Thus this exonym was the defining factor, rather than defining the characteristics of a &quot;Greek race&quot;, since this would devolve into too many confusions. For example Plato says that the &quot;ideal&quot; Republic would be a unified &quot;Greek state&quot;, but that is mainly to protect the Greeks from being enslaved by barbarians. Thus the classical Greeks intellectuals did not recognize the inborn state of nationhood and polities of barbarians as some kind of natural political entity (like John Locke would argue), but as theologically opposed to them. This was not so different in how the Jews defined themselves against the &quot;idolatrus&quot; non-Jews. <br><br>https://digressionsnimpressions.typ<wbr>epad.com/digressionsimpressions/201<wbr>8/09/on-socratess-ethno-nationalist<wbr>-political-theology.html", "time": 1675922802, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14601706, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:11:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are there any right wing critiques of nationalism?<br>I am a retard, politically naive and historically ignorant but I can&#039;t help but shake off the feelings that the sense of nationality is wrong and that we&#039;ve seriously lost something during the period that nationalism gave us these identities", "time": 1675923102, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602227, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)05:37:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14601706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601706</a><br>Depends on what you mean by &quot;right-wing&quot;, but nationalism could be opposed from both a libertarian and a religious perspective.", "time": 1675939033, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602274, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)06:03:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14601706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601706</a><br>historically, right-wing= monarchist and left-wing=republican<br><br>Once there is no monarchist, right-wing inside a democracy is a meaningless term made up by the revolutionists to make the plebs believe they have a choice when they vote inside the republic", "time": 1675940617, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602306, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)06:20:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The absolute seething from /pol/fags who can&#039;t accept that nationalism as we conceive of it is a modern invention codified to transfer legitimacy and authority from kings and nobility to the more amorphous state because it conflicts with their fantasies of huwite nations being an eternal and natural creation because they&#039;re generally historically illiterate retards.", "time": 1675941626, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602442, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)07:19:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14592680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14592680</a><br>So patriotic then?", "time": 1675945187, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602476, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)07:36:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595311</a><br>Egypt was a Roman province.", "time": 1675946168, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602789, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)09:40:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14597889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14597889</a><br>he&#039;s considered by marx and engels to be the first modern communist, and a member of the first paris commune which occurred before marx was even born. just pointing out how that poster is misinformed", "time": 1675953617, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602960, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)10:32:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14602789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14602789</a><br>He just said that he came before, even if he thought that he was the first there&#039;s no way to figure that out through his post. <br>But anyway, my reply was assuming you were speaking about the first part of the post", "time": 1675956755, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602989, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)10:44:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14602306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14602306</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brings up /pol/ out of nowhere</span><br>most /pol/fags are firmly aware that most &quot;states&quot; today are nothing but a farce, a way to sell out your nation to the faceless multinational companies and the jews", "time": 1675957483, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14602996, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)10:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14602989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14602989</a><br>most polfags contribute nothing to society", "time": 1675957630, "resto": 14592607}, {"no": 14603004, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)10:49:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14601386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601386</a><br>Aaaaah, pop/his/, pop/his/, pop/his/...<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They literally spent 100 years in the Hundred Years War fighting over whether the King of England (and Duke of Normandy) was an equal or subordinate to the King of France and who should inherit fucking what</span><br>Edward III or any of his predecessors since a long ago were never dukes of Normandy, the war had more to do with Flanders at the start, and besides the arguments used by the french peers against Edward&#039;s claims or a bunch of other events are not things you want to highlight to defend your point.<br>And I don&#039;t get what you think you&#039;re contradicting.

The underlying context then is the intention to show Jesus to be inferior to nothing, to show how to go back would be to go back to nothing, since they would be leaving everything. <br><br>In verse 10 the apostle quotes from Psalm 102 prefaced with the words &quot;To the Son He says&quot;.

It seems clear this messianic character is the primary relation to Jesus for which reason the apostle identifies Him as the one whom it is about: for in Jesus it has fulfillment, He has had compassion on Zion, He has been gracious to it, the appointed time came, through Him the nations and the kings of the earth have learned to fear Yahweh, through Him a nation other than the Jews, which had yet even to be created, praise His name; the Son is the appearance of Yahweh in His glory.", "time": 1675901133, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600018, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:06:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14599778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14599778</a><br><a href=\"#p14600008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600008</a><br><a href=\"#p14600013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600013</a><br>Thus it is not only the part which the apostle quoted, which is about Yahweh&#039;s eternal unchanging nature in contrast with His own creation, that is about the Son, for if that were so the section I quoted would undeniably be the more applicable.

This is further demonstrated by the fact the apostle&#039;s quotation includes the word &quot;Lord&quot;, which the entirety of Psalm 102 does not. It is well known that in the last few centuries leading up to Christ out of superstition the Jews ceased to pronounce the divine name, or even to write it except when transcribing scripture. When they translated the Old Testament into Greek they did not render the divine name but translated it as &quot;kyrios&quot; (Lord) which is why the New Testament even in quoting the Old Testament never used the divine name outright but only under this title.

(Later copyists strongly tended to \u201ccorrect\u201d the original NT manuscripts by making their OT quotes conform exactly to the wording in the Septuagint version.)<br><br><br>Another consideration is that later Church copyists would often change the wording of a scripture if it seemed to contradict a teaching of the Roman Church.[1] Therefore, if the wording of an ancient manuscript seems to contradict a later teaching of the Roman Church, it is more likely to have the original wording than another ancient manuscript which (at the same verse) seems to agree with that Church teaching.<br><br><a href=\"#p14600565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600565</a><br><a href=\"#p14600593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600593</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally 0 argument</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh jw boogeyman</span><br>Every time.", "time": 1675907414, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600600, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:50:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595649</a><br>about 60%", "time": 1675907445, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600602, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:51:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14600597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600597</a><br>Using these criteria, the UBS Committee unanimously agreed with all the wording of Heb. 1:8 except for one word.

He thought he got the better of it because the audience at the debate was mostly local business owners (ie. Republicans) rather than blue collar workers.

When Nixon set off for his Congressional fact-finding trip to Europe in August 1947, Kennedy thought he might enjoy some nookie on the trip.

They usually had good bodies too which I assume is because of gay culture (men not wanting to have sex with fat men, appearance being everything).

Honestly speaking, they match up to the ideal physique Hitler and co wanted for aryan men; they\u2019re strong whites\u2026but they\u2019re gay. I think they become right wing as a result of a mix of the gym/body culture and their innate hatred of women. Whenever you see \u201cstan\u201d accounts etc they\u2019re run by teenage girls or gay men; girls usually grow out of the stanning phase but gay men never do so. They continue to critique female artists, bash them and degrade them. They resent women as they are able to get with straight men which is what all gay men desire, that\u2019s why those \u201cstraight\u201d guy x gay man porn vids are the most popular. <br><br>Homofascists are not rare (as you can see from RW bodybuilding BAP twitter). They are disliked by others as they are sodomites so they constantly bash women to gain approval, wishing that women were subjugated so they could have straight men to themselves. They are beyond delusional though and any gay right winger will face the same fate as Rohm (or Milo for a more modern example\u2026total ostracisation when they speak out of line). Their hatred towards women is a shield to cover their own underachievement. What have gay men created? Ryan Murphy? Andy Cohen? Ru Paul?
