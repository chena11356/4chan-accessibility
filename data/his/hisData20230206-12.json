Like every dictator-in-waiting he proposed an autarky, where the Indian people would live a simple, agrarian life rather than participating in global capitalism. He and his follows founded a number of communes which were meant to be a model for India&#039;s economy going forward.<br><br>After independence the new ruling class tried to put some of these basic principles into practice, and although his economic ideas were never really followed completely it did lead to a heavily socialist-leaning economic model.

In real life, she had been a victim of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and had regressed, before her death, to a semi-conscious state. In the dream, as well, she had lost her capacity for self-control. Her genital region was exposed, dimly; it had the appearance of a thick mat of hair. She was stroking herself, absent-mindedly. She walked over to me, with a handful of pubic hair, compacted into something resembling a large artist\u2019s paint-brush. She pushed this at my face. I raised my arm, several times, to deflect her hand; finally, unwilling to hurt her, or interfere with her any farther, I let her have her way.

Weapons of a broadly similar type are found in a wide belt of Eastern Africa from Lake Victoria in the west to the Swahili coast in the east<br><br>The seme can vary in length, from the size of a knife, to the size of medium length sword, with an elegant leaf shaped blade flaring towards the tip and featuring a median ridge running the length of the blade. Typically, this one handed slashing weapon has a short wooden hilt covered in leather, often tapering towards the tip, and is kept in a leather sheath, often dyed red.<br>The seme was used for mundane everyday purposes like clearing brush and butchering meat, and was also used for war, and during lion hunts, which were once important rites of passage. It is important however to note, that the seme is a secondary weapon, second only to the spear.<br><br>Among the Maasai, men belong to age groups that determine their status, with each age group being assigned a distinctive set of weapons. At about 15 to 21 years of age, Maasai youths, called \u201clayok\u201d, are initiated into the status of young manhood, called \u201cmoran\u201d, at which point they are given their first seme, which they will carry for the rest of their lives.<br>The Maasai and Samburu have their own subgroup of specialized blacksmiths, known as \u201cIlkunono\u201d, who produce seme\u2019s, and who were traditionally surrounded by taboos and even scorned for being ritually unclean.

The Phoenician/Canaanite gods mixed with local Celtic tradition are the roots of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry and British Israelism/Christian Identity LARPing.

The English then British Monarchy interbred through hundreds of years to preserve their Phoenician blood. As well as joining with our royal families which had similar Phoenician ancestral blood, specifically the Papacy. This is why Britain housed the most Jews in Europe, the Rothschilds came from this ancestry too. All of this gave the British the define right to form a Jewish state in Palestine called Israel.

Pain is something that happens TO US, but how we interpret that pain, and the actions we take to cope with that pain, are what matter. For instance, if someone felt unusually subjected to lustful desires, they have several ways to address this. They can find a pure and innocent way to cope with this feeling, like in finding a monogamous lover to marry and produce children with--or they can find sinful and dangerous ways to cope with it, like in pornography addiction and in extreme cases in rape. Very rarely will you hear Atheists ask &quot;why does God make us feel lust?&quot; because most Atheists won&#039;t even think &quot;lust&quot; is a negative thing. Regardless, we experience all of these feelings and conditions in varying degrees--some experience more lust than anger, others more anger than sadness, or more sadness than greed, or more pain.

In contrast, while in some cases not following orders could get you sent to the very dangerous Eastern Front, the majority of SS and Wehrmacht soldiers were often not severely punished and very usually had no problem with what they were doing; indeed, in many, many cases, they exceeded their orders and many atrocities were initiated at ground-level by officers. Since conquered Jews, Poles and other victims were forbidden to work (slave labour aside) yet were now part of the Greater German Reich, they became an economic burden, and since deportation was increasingly impractical, mass murder was often seen as cheaper and easier.
