Benedict&#039;s election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Benedict chose to be known by the title &quot;pope emeritus&quot; upon his resignation. Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1950s. He was appointed a full professor in 1958 at the age of 31. After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until his election as pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Prior to becoming pope, he was &quot;a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century&quot;; he had an influence &quot;second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions&quot; as one of John Paul II&#039;s closest confidants. He lived in Rome from 1981 until his death in 2022. His prolific writings generally defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values. He was originally a liberal theologian, but adopted conservative views after 1968. During his papacy, Benedict XVI advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries.", "time": 1672482898, "resto": 14401711}, {"no": 14401888, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:37:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Rest in power, king.", "time": 1672483029, "resto": 14401711}, {"no": 14401889, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:37:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14401851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14401851</a><br>RIP", "time": 1672483031, "resto": 14401711}, {"no": 14401899, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:38:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14401888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14401888</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6e<wbr>XyYJ4h5o&amp;vl", "filename": "logos", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 600, "tn_w": 104, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672483137769643, "time": 1672483137, "md5": "+MNYX+8SlCfnbQ5nciuYRg==", "fsize": 180804, "resto": 14401711}, {"no": 14401911, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:43:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14401711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14401711</a><br>F<br>Although I am Orthodox, I have great respect for Pope Benedict XVI. <br>I always found his theology books to be very intellectually honest and of high theological caliber.

What is worse, depending on centralization, all government can in the end be affected, especially with a rise of pseudo-nepotistic favour trading systems - &quot;I know a guy who is my uncle in the Ministry of Internal Security, he&#039;ll put a good word in for your boss to get you that job!&quot;. This is a basic, every-day example that was and is the norm in almost all authoritarian states. Over time, this mindset trickles down to the general public, to the point you start doing favour system shit with your supervising store manager to get your failson accepted into the junior assitant position. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Single point of failure</span><br>If the autocrat is a retard, your society is fucked. You can&#039;t elect him out of office. You can&#039;t indite him. No opposing party will selfishly rally against him to garner public support. He&#039;ll stay there and shit things up, hopefully only via lazyness and neglect, more likely by doing something extremely stupid. Same aplies if an idiot takes over an aformentioned power structure. And it doesn&#039;t have to be an idiot. A stroke that kills of the bold generalismo will also cause mass chaos, and even with an apparent heir, the succession can be questioned if one only has power.", "time": 1672439228, "resto": 14393178}, {"no": 14398991, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)17:37:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398937</a><br>Its not racist; you&#039;re racist since you&#039;re assuming its a shit hole because its race.

She chose a path, and went down it like a thunderbolt. Yet Joan, when I came to think of her, had in her all that was true either in Tolstoy or Nietzsche, all that was even tolerable in either of them. I thought of all that is noble in Tolstoy, the pleasure in plain things, especially in plain pity, the actualities of the earth, the reverence for the poor, the dignity of the bowed back. Joan of Arc had all that and with this great addition, that she endured poverty as well as admiring it; whereas Tolstoy is only a typical aristocrat trying to find out its secret. And then I thought of all that was brave and proud and pathetic in poor Nietzsche, and his mutiny against the emptiness and timidity of our time. I thought of his cry for the ecstatic equilibrium of danger, his hunger for the rush of great horses, his cry to arms. Well, Joan of Arc had all that, and again with this difference, that she did not praise fighting, but fought. We know that she was not afraid of an army, while Nietzsche, for all we know, was afraid of a cow. Tolstoy only praised the peasant; she was the peasant. Nietzsche only praised the warrior; she was the warrior. She beat them both at their own antagonistic ideals; she was more gentle than the one, more violent than the other. Yet she was a perfectly practical person who did something, while they are wild speculators who do nothing. It was impossible that the thought should not cross my mind that she and her faith had perhaps some secret of moral unity and utility that has been lost. And with that thought came a larger one, and the colossal figure of her Master had also crossed the theatre of my thoughts.&quot;</span>", "time": 1672461491, "resto": 14398238}, {"no": 14400772, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:42:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14399471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14399471</a><br><a href=\"#p14399502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14399502</a><br><br>Maybe you should read the rest of the bible before talking shit, idiot.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, \u201cTruly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.(D) 11 I say to you that many will come from the east and the west,(E) and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.(F) 12 But the sons of the kingdom(G) will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d(H)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, \u201cGo!

While this sounds great and fully workable on paper, in real life it completely failed because none of the technocrats involved bothered to ask why would Vietnamese trust Americans in the first place when their government was run by a religious minority, a bully, and had such a backwards unworkable rice economy. The Tet Offensive both proved and disproved this thinking - the TO was successfully repelled, but it totally broke morale. No amount of numbers and math can argue with Walter Cronkite going on TV and announcing that the war is unwinnable.

Ford was by then a large mature company helping dismantle America&#039;s defunct, outdated and unwanted railroad network. Ford, and the rest of the auto industry, were building the World Of Tomorrow they promised in 1933. With the core Interstate network built out, cars were faster than ever and millions of Americans were liberated economically as they could live and work wherever they wanted. Gas was nickles to the gallon and some of the fastest road cars ever built would soon be released to the public. With such massive domestic success, it was only natural to pave the entire planet in freeways. It&#039;s certainly why American companies like Esso and Union Carbide were in Vietnam - they wanted their oil, their minerals, and their labor to produce car parts in an increasingly globalized market just as they did with Brazil vis-a-vis rubber tires thirty years prior. New plastics meant a whole new world of manufacturing was plausible, requiring new machines. Chief amongst these were the Bradley IFV/M113 (which is now being replaced with the OMFV/M1284 due to the Ukraine War) and the M-16, which came to symbolize the war&#039;s failures as early models were prone to cracking and breaking under stress.<br><br>I mention this because the other side of the war was the nationbuilding in the locomotives, trucks, power plants and other miscellany we sent to Vietnam as we also sent to Korea, Japan and West Germany. It was around ~1960 where American companies bothered to keep records of this stuff, and cameras had become cheap enough where records of such things could exist. And this was also how the war came home through television and newspapers, similar to the civil rights debate. This latter part matters because the people in charge could not account for the public&#039;s response to such visceral, real images of war, and this gradually annhilated the Nixon adminsitration when he failed to get us out as he promised.

If one has declared war against something like &quot;terror,&quot; or if one has poorly defined or impossible goals, then they have severely burdened their fighting force.<br><br>Consequently, the reason why a weaker side might still fight a war is because their war goals could be completely different, time might be on their side due to the differing strategies involved. They might just have to hold their ground and be on the defensive to win, while the other side has to extend into dangerous territory and expose themselves more to the elements of attrition. So even if one has excellent logistics to help avoid an all-out catastrophe, and even if one has a far greater force than the other side, one can still lose to attrition anyway. Things like winter weather and disease can still ravage a force, regardless of supply lines. We saw this for instance in the Crimean war, which saw massive attrition to disease, the horrendous result of which led to much more focus by the Europeans on medical attention being available on future battlefields.

The door was open by the landlord, a Mohammedan named Ha. They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs. Ha, who knelt before them after Ha&#039;s death, begging them not to kill anyone else. Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged out from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1 year old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia&#039;s parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2\u20133 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7\u20138, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha&#039;s two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively. The older was bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword.</span><br><br>Iris Chang, a Han, quoted Magee&#039;s account of the rape of this family in her book on Nanjing and Japanese war crimes but deleted all references to the family being Muslim.", "time": 1672463960, "resto": 14399937}, {"no": 14400909, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)00:22:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14399937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14399937</a><br><a href=\"#p14400901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14400901</a><br>Her mentality is that the more you portray yourself as a victim the mofe support you would get.<br><br>Most PRC nationals censor the religion of victims in the war.

Wu worked on the Manhattan Project, where she helped develop the process for separating uranium metal into uranium-235 and uranium-238 isotopes by gaseous diffusion. She is best known for conducting the Wu experiment, which contradicted the hypothetical law of conservation of parity. This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics, and earned Wu the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978. Her expertise in experimental physics evoked comparisons to Marie Curie.

When Timmerman refused to pay, Logue attacked him with an axe but Timmerman had a revolver and killed Logue instead. The shooting was considered self-defense and Timmerman was not charged with his death. However Sue Logue wanted revenge, and on the one year anniversary of her husband&#039;s death, she and her brother-in-law George Logue plotted to take Timmerman out.

When cops came to arrest George, he was ready and with the help of a black sharecropper named Fred Dorn, ambushed and shot the officers.

She reportedly had an affair with Strom Thurmond when he was a school superintendant and she had worked as a teacher, and that they&#039;d done the deed in his office at least once. Also when Sue was taken from her cell in Columbia Women&#039;s Prison to the electric chair in the state pen, Thurmond accompanied her there and Randall Johnson, a black prison worker and sometimes driver who was manning the prison wagon that day, later claimed he was sure the two had had sex in the back of the vehicle en route to &quot;Old Sparky.&quot;", "time": 1672462054, "resto": 14398795}, {"no": 14400830, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:58:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14400785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14400785</a><br><a href=\"#p14400779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14400779</a><br>solid 5/10. her pussy game must have been that good because the face alone wouldn&#039;t do the trick.", "time": 1672462698, "resto": 14398795}, {"no": 14400875, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)00:13:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398795</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all those Kentucky Fried Niggers</span><br><br>Based", "filename": "Anne is amused", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 822, "h": 291, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 44, "tim": 1672463580697222, "time": 1672463580, "md5": "69R2KLL3LyAte5zLM5umGQ==", "fsize": 71449, "resto": 14398795}, {"no": 14401169, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:52:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14400553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14400553</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;testimony from elderly black folk.</span><br>kek", "time": 1672469567, "resto": 14398795}, {"no": 14401180, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:59:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398795</a><br>Based.

Buddhism can be made more active, you can see this in South East Asia with Militant Buddhists in Myanmar, Thailand, Japan, etc, but for the &quot;most part&quot; Buddhism is a fairly low energy religion. The great spiritual truth of Buddhism is non-self, inaction, the middle path, and that&#039;s pretty neato until it isn&#039;t anymore. Myanmar has the radical conclusion of this where a decent chunk of the population is composed of Monks &amp; Priests effectively doing nothing while being supported by those unordained individuals who do work... Creating a kind of awkward situation where anyone doing anything of material value is effectively compromising their spirituality. <br>Again, Buddhism casts shade on farmers, merchants, tradespeople, etc. It doesn&#039;t say these people will go to hell, but it does spend enough time saying they&#039;re wasting their lives and if they were &quot;really&quot; good they&#039;d stop all that nonsense. Buddhism in other parts of Asia have specifically made efforts to doctor that out as much as possible by assimilating folk gods WITH JOBS.<br><br>I&#039;ll also add that Hinduism is sex positive. By that I mean in Buddhism bringing another life into the world is an asshole thing to do, but in Hinduism you&#039;ve just done the single greatest thing you could do because you&#039;ve expanded the ahntman/anima/brahma/whatever into another entity. And sex in general is just seen as a way more valid, ritualized, positive thing. Infinitely more so than Buddhism. <br>This isn&#039;t to say they &quot;birthed&quot; more Hindus. What I&#039;m saying is that Hinduism telling people to fuck probably encouraged it&#039;s popularity.", "time": 1672442106, "resto": 14397174}, {"no": 14399252, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)18:19:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14397174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14397174</a><br>Jesus ended his life advaita.<br><br>https://saispeaks.sathyasai.org/dis<wbr>course/isa", "time": 1672442378, "resto": 14397174}, {"no": 14400181, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:26:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398884</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that picture</span><br>Just like how Buddhism got it from Samkhya :^)", "time": 1672453616, "resto": 14397174}, {"no": 14400197, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:29:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14397174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14397174</a><br>Cuz buddhism is incomplete.", "time": 1672453787, "resto": 14397174}, {"no": 14400204, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:31:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14399252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14399252</a><br>God damn it pajeets you leave my euro-middle eastern jewish apocalyptic religion out of your schizophrenia.", "time": 1672453863, "resto": 14397174}, {"no": 14400371, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:02:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14399223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14399223</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Creating a kind of awkward situation where anyone doing anything of material value is effectively compromising their spirituality</span><br>The Buddha said that his teachings were for all people, not just monks.

Despite this, there exist many racist myths that seek to discourage and even prevent individuals from engaging in interracial relationships. It is important to examine these myths and understand their origin and purpose in order to understand why they continue to exist and how to counteract them. This essay will discuss the racist myths surrounding anti-interracial relationships and how to move away from them. Racist myths surrounding such relationships typically include untrue claims that one race is superior, believing that interracial relationships will lead to the \u201cdilution\u201d of a certain race, and that interracial couples are immoral or have ulterior motives. Through an analysis of the origin, function, and circulation of these myths, it is clear that these ideas are incorrect and based on oppressive stereotypes. This essay will explore the various ways society can work to oppose and debunk these myths in order to create a more inclusive and equitable society.<br><br>Many people believe that anti-interracial relationships are actually beneficial for society because they keep people segregated and isolated. However, this is far from the truth when it comes to the impact of anti-interracial relationships. In fact, there is research that shows anti-interracial relationships to be detrimental to a healthy and diverse society. According to author James Jones, &quot;anti-interracial relationships stigmatize mixed backgrounds and lead to stereotypical assumptions about mixed-race individuals that have racist root causes&quot; (&quot;Consequences and Myths of Interracial Relationships&quot;). This implies that anti-interracial relationships can create and perpetuate racism by giving rise to myths, such as the belief that an individual&#039;s race determines their intellectual, social, and moral capabilities.", "time": 1672433916, "resto": 14398309}, {"no": 14398550, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)15:58:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398541</a><br>Were you pretending to be a retard, anon?", "time": 1672433923, "resto": 14398309}, {"no": 14398552, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)15:59:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398549</a><br>The myths surrounding anti-interracial relationships are perpetuated by the idea that it is beneficial for society to keep people separated and isolated. However, this is not the case, as these relationships can lead to racist behaviour. A common myth is that interracial couples face higher levels of discrimination than couples of the same race. Research has debunked this claim, finding that interracial couples are just as likely to receive negative attention as singles of the same race, if not more so (Waterman &amp; Stillwell, 2018). Other myths suggest that interracial relationships weaken racial identity and lead to a decrease in cultural values. Studies, however, have found that interracial relationships have little to no impact on a person\u2019s racial identification, such as their beliefs or values (Smith et al., 2015).

On the other hand, there are those who disagree and feel that anti-interracial relationships can lead to racist behaviour due to a lack of understanding and sensitivity to one another&#039;s cultures, customs and lifestyles (Jones). Although separating people through interracial relationships may result in a relatively homogenous population, it also allows for a lack of cultural appreciation and personal growth (Mason). In the end, both sides of the argument have valid points, but ultimately it is up to the individual to decide what is best for themselves and the people they care about.<br><br>Interracial relationships have long been stigmatised in American culture, with much of the racism deeply rooted in myths and stereotypes. According to a 2003-2010 US Census Bureau survey, the number of interracial couples has more than tripled since 1967 (U.S. Census Bureau). Despite the increase in interracial relationships, the vast majority of such couples continue to face racism and prejudice. In a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), four pervasive racist myths surrounding interracial relationships are identified. First, that Black people are biologically less capable of partaking in relationships with people of other races. Second, the belief that interracial relationships damage the gene pool and produce inferior offspring. Third, the idea that people of different races do not share the same cultural values and beliefs. Fourth, the false notion that White people are superior to people of other racial backgrounds (ACLU). Such myths are damaging and misguided, and should be debunked in order to promote equality in relationships and for interracial couples to be able to exist without social stigma or discrimination.", "time": 1672434057, "resto": 14398309}, {"no": 14398564, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)16:01:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398446</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anon copypastes some brainwashed &quot;diversity is our strength&quot; shit off wikipedia</span><br>very cringe", "time": 1672434103, "resto": 14398309}, {"no": 14398565, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)16:02:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14398558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398558</a><br>There is no denying the fact that anti-interracial relationships have been a topic of racism throughout history.

Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga&#039;s camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners,[33] mostly by crucifixion and decapitation[34] with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek&#039;s teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as &quot;a very sweet and pleasing maiden&quot;, while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses.[35][36][37] The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that &quot;the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.&quot;[38] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga&#039;s but it came to nothing.[39][40][41]</span>", "filename": "Taiwan", "ext": ".png", "w": 1717, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672428185872228, "time": 1672428185, "md5": "iRRS8qd+zKjZKzcK7ObMYQ==", "fsize": 785060, "resto": 14384109}, {"no": 14398438, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)15:29:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14397848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14397848</a><br>These <a href=\"#p14398135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398135</a> your great great great grandmothers?", "time": 1672432169, "resto": 14384109}, {"no": 14399353, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)18:34:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14396783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14396783</a><br><a href=\"#p14398127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398127</a><br><a href=\"#p14398135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14398135</a><br>Why do you ruin every China thread on /his/ you soiboi cuck?", "time": 1672443294, "resto": 14384109}, {"no": 14400607, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:09:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why was cannibalism so prevalent in Ancient China?

Perpetual Virginity -- the statements regarding Jesus having brothers can be read either way linguistically, there is typology which could apply to Mary, Eze. 44:2, and there is intertexual comparison of Mary with the ark of the covenant in Luke. What we need is a reason to read these things in this way. First we should note what perpetual virginity actually is, which is that Mary was a virgin before, during, and after birth. The &quot;during&quot; means that her virginity remained physically intact as Christ&#039;s birth was of a miraculous nature. If this did not occur, then it means that Christ damaged his own mother&#039;s physical virginity, which is too impious to consider. This must be avoided, and thus we must at least affirm Mary&#039;s virginity during birth. This would fit the typology of Eze. 44:2, and thus also affirm her virginity after birth.<br><br>2. Immaculate Conception -- this teaches that Mary was saved by a retroactive application of Christ&#039;s saving work: at the moment of her conception she was saved by Christ and preserved from original sin, and cooperated with God&#039;s will in committing no personal sins, so that original sin would not pass to Christ. God prepared her as a holy vessel, for if Mary is stained with sin, then that means that God dwelt bodily in a body that was sinful, as his body was within Mary&#039;s body, and he took his flesh from Mary&#039;s flesh. How can God dwell within a sinful body? Further we know that God is a consuming fire, Heb. 12:29, but this fire burned in Mary&#039;s womb and she was not burned -- she is a typological fulfillment of the burning bush -- and she was not consumed because she bore no sin. One should also consider the special love that God has for Mary, for example the icon I have posted which shows God&#039;s special relationship to her.

That\u2019s the main reason. Most muslim countries like Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc. are extremely corrupt with very authoritarian regimes in control. An exception seems to be Tunisia, which has some elements of liberalism, but it\u2019s still in its infancy. The thing is that in Islam, the \u201csharia law\u201d is in the responsibility of the government to uphold. When you criticize this law or provide an alternative view on the sharia law, the governments get anxious and feel like this is a direct insult on their power. For example, in Saudi Arabia, they mostly follow Wahhabism, and the sheikhs there are personally appointed by the Saudi royal family. There are cases of sheikhs that say something that doesn\u2019t align with the royal family\u2019s agenda, and they are almost always arrested and silenced. Notice how a couple of years ago, driving was illegal in saudi for women, women were not allowed to drive.

Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Extant biographies of Epaminondas universally describe him as one of the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: &quot;Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone.&quot; Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas&#039;s military record: &quot;For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Cicero eulogized him as &quot;the first man, in my judgement, of Greece</span>", "filename": "1650092580534", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 249, "h": 249, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672390738927363, "time": 1672390738, "md5": "ntDsZKvPraAhTZddx0ixdg==", "fsize": 41916, "resto": 14395496}, {"no": 14395752, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:00:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14395496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14395496</a><br>Fuck off.", "filename": "1654026784822", "ext": ".png", "w": 956, "h": 3414, "tn_w": 35, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672390854669419, "time": 1672390854, "md5": "jQFzoPKjhoOlqhqMc6n8NQ==", "fsize": 871385, "resto": 14395496}, {"no": 14395771, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:12:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14395752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14395752</a><br>The Laws is not a collection of actual Greek laws but Plato&#039;s opinions on what they should be.

A truly marvellous argument, if he means that men accustomed to turn deaf ears to censure and to behave to one another shamelessly, are more likely to feel ashamed of doing a shameful deed. He adduced as evidence the fact that the Thebans and the Eleians[68] recognise the very principle, and added: Though they sleep inarmed, they do not scruple to range the lover side by side with the beloved one in the field of battle. An instance which I take to be no instance, or at any rate one-sided,[69] seeing that what they look upon as lawful with us is scandalous.[70] Indeed, it strikes me that this vaunted battle-order would seem to argue some mistrust on their part who adopt it--a suspicion that their bosom friends, once separated from them, may forget to behave as brave men should.

deal?</span><br><br>It was really just &quot;babies first luxury goods market&quot;. <br>The &quot;on brand&quot; spice trade as we know it started during the Roman Empire: Upper Class Romans would buy spice because it had medicinal properties, for flavor, but mostly because it was seen as something expensive and luxurious to own. Well-to-do individuals would cook up a fucking Ostrich or a Peacock or something and cake it in spices to prove what a cool guy they were. <br>Another major aspect of the spice trade was that nobody who bought spice in Europe actually &#039;knew&#039; how spice was cultivated, so merchants would just make shit up in order to both vastly inflate the price of their product and to further endear their customer basis to it. Fragrant cinnamon sticks were collected by large carnivorous birds to make their nests and had to be harvested by feeding them large, heavy, slabs of ox meat so when they bring it to their nest it&#039;d fall down and workers could collect it. That kind of thing. <br><br>Two other things:<br>The &quot;food preservation&quot; thing was largely inconsequential to the spice trade. Salt was used for food preservation and it wasn&#039;t considered a spice, nor a luxury good, but an economically vital product to harvest, process, and distribute as needed.
