Having sex with someone who has hit puberty is not pedophilia, you can move your little numbers up but it&#039;s meaningless, you&#039;re just a retard who can&#039;t see the bigger picture.

But it&#039;s perfectly normal for puberty to begin at any point between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.&quot;</span><br>That being said, Muhammad did nothing wrong for having sex with his wife, in fact it was a good thing. His action was no different than any other that God has permitted, doing any action that falls under this is &quot;good&quot;. Anything else is pure cope, why is this so difficult to understand?

Benedict&#039;s election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Benedict chose to be known by the title &quot;pope emeritus&quot; upon his resignation. Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1950s. He was appointed a full professor in 1958 at the age of 31. After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until his election as pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Prior to becoming pope, he was &quot;a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century&quot;; he had an influence &quot;second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions&quot; as one of John Paul II&#039;s closest confidants. He lived in Rome from 1981 until his death in 2022. His prolific writings generally defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values.

But whatever, lets assume that its a long time. Systemic racism is *specifically* talking about forms of oppression that have occurred post-slavery, so what you said is not an actual argument. Neither is &quot;153 years&quot; instead of addressing disenfranchisement and modern slavery which takes form in the prison-industrial complex. It doesn&#039;t address the ways systemic oppression is present at the level of institutions through harmful policies and practices, and across structures such as education, health, and economy, that are interconnected and reinforcing over time. You should also have an understanding of the origins of &quot;whiteness&quot;, and its purpose as an economic tool for the planter class, instead of being something that arrived through explicit biases. There is no point you could bring up that hasn&#039;t been addressed and defeated repeatedly, so please educate yourself before parroting the most basic counterpoints that would get you laughed out of any intellectual discussion about race and systems of oppression.

Aristotelian science was accordingly based on commonsense observations of nature.

For example, Trump&#039;s supporters started tuning out the liberal media, nothing they reported about Trump would phase them because they realized -- correctly btw -- that it was all biased and designed to tear him down. But the reverse is now true, the liberals with the Democrats are now tuning out the conservatives. Project Veritas? Doesn&#039;t matter anymore.

Perpetual Virginity -- the statements regarding Jesus having brothers can be read either way linguistically, there is typology which could apply to Mary, Eze. 44:2, and there is intertexual comparison of Mary with the ark of the covenant in Luke. What we need is a reason to read these things in this way. First we should note what perpetual virginity actually is, which is that Mary was a virgin before, during, and after birth. The &quot;during&quot; means that her virginity remained physically intact as Christ&#039;s birth was of a miraculous nature. If this did not occur, then it means that Christ damaged his own mother&#039;s physical virginity, which is too impious to consider. This must be avoided, and thus we must at least affirm Mary&#039;s virginity during birth. This would fit the typology of Eze. 44:2, and thus also affirm her virginity after birth.<br><br>2. Immaculate Conception -- this teaches that Mary was saved by a retroactive application of Christ&#039;s saving work: at the moment of her conception she was saved by Christ and preserved from original sin, and cooperated with God&#039;s will in committing no personal sins, so that original sin would not pass to Christ. God prepared her as a holy vessel, for if Mary is stained with sin, then that means that God dwelt bodily in a body that was sinful, as his body was within Mary&#039;s body, and he took his flesh from Mary&#039;s flesh.

They might just have to hold their ground and be on the defensive to win, while the other side has to extend into dangerous territory and expose themselves more to the elements of attrition. So even if one has excellent logistics to help avoid an all-out catastrophe, and even if one has a far greater force than the other side, one can still lose to attrition anyway. Things like winter weather and disease can still ravage a force, regardless of supply lines. We saw this for instance in the Crimean war, which saw massive attrition to disease, the horrendous result of which led to much more focus by the Europeans on medical attention being available on future battlefields. The fact that newspapers at the time were beginning to be able to report on battlefield conditions to the rest of the world relatively quickly, probably also spurred this development.<br><br>So, applying this to the example of Vietnam, we can see that the gorillas just had to outlast an opponent who was strategically unwilling to escalate the conflict beyond a certain point.

His Old World accent and reactionary politics might not have been sufficient to earn Niall Ferguson his cisatlantic celebrity, were it not for the demise of American intellectual conservatism, chronicled by Sam Tanenhaus and others. The mass extinction of America\u2019s intellectual right at the hands of anti-intellectual Jacksonian populists like the Tea Partyers has created a lack of native conservative thinkers with impressive academic credentials who are willing to dash to a TV studio at a moment\u2019s notice.

Buckley Jr., George Will and Irving Kristol, even Niall Ferguson can be mistaken for an intellectual.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Having begun his career as a historian of 19th-century banking, Ferguson became what in Britain is called a &quot;television don&quot; in 1998 with the publication of his book &quot;The Pity of War,&quot; about World War I. Like the historian John Charmley, who expressed the same wish in the case of World War II, Ferguson belongs to the fringe element of British conservatism that regrets the absence of a German-British deal in the first half of the 20th century that would have marginalized the United States and might have allowed the British Empire to survive to this day.</span><br>https://www.salon.com/2011/05/24/li<wbr>nd_niall_fergsuon/", "time": 1672533645, "resto": 14404869}, {"no": 14404896, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)19:42:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14404869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14404869</a><br>Allies were at fault for essentially dooming Germany to economic failure creating even more resentment and the explosive rise of the Nazis.", "time": 1672533771, "resto": 14404869}, {"no": 14404900, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)19:43:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Key paragraph:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Ferguson, Britain should have stayed out of World War I and allowed Imperial Germany to smash France and Russia and create a continental empire from the Atlantic to the Middle East.

Even though he invoked the devil and expected from him the reestablishment of his fortune, up to the end he was naively a good and devout Christian. A few months before his death, still free, he confessed and approached the Sacred Altar. He even had a feeling of humility on this occasion; in the church at Machecoul, the common people moved aside, leaving room for the great lord. Gilles refused, asking the poor folk to stay beside him. This was a moment when anguish perhaps took him by the throat, when he wanted to renounce his orgies of blood. He decided then to go abroad, to go crying in front of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. He dreamed of the endless voyage that would save him \u2026 But he contented himself with the intention.

While this sounds great and fully workable on paper, in real life it completely failed because none of the technocrats involved bothered to ask why would Vietnamese trust Americans in the first place when their government was run by a religious minority, a bully, and had such a backwards unworkable rice economy. The Tet Offensive both proved and disproved this thinking - the TO was successfully repelled, but it totally broke morale. No amount of numbers and math can argue with Walter Cronkite going on TV and announcing that the war is unwinnable.

Ford was by then a large mature company helping dismantle America&#039;s defunct, outdated and unwanted railroad network. Ford, and the rest of the auto industry, were building the World Of Tomorrow they promised in 1933. With the core Interstate network built out, cars were faster than ever and millions of Americans were liberated economically as they could live and work wherever they wanted. Gas was nickles to the gallon and some of the fastest road cars ever built would soon be released to the public. With such massive domestic success, it was only natural to pave the entire planet in freeways. It&#039;s certainly why American companies like Esso and Union Carbide were in Vietnam - they wanted their oil, their minerals, and their labor to produce car parts in an increasingly globalized market just as they did with Brazil vis-a-vis rubber tires thirty years prior. New plastics meant a whole new world of manufacturing was plausible, requiring new machines. Chief amongst these were the Bradley IFV/M113 (which is now being replaced with the OMFV/M1284 due to the Ukraine War) and the M-16, which came to symbolize the war&#039;s failures as early models were prone to cracking and breaking under stress.<br><br>I mention this because the other side of the war was the nationbuilding in the locomotives, trucks, power plants and other miscellany we sent to Vietnam as we also sent to Korea, Japan and West Germany. It was around ~1960 where American companies bothered to keep records of this stuff, and cameras had become cheap enough where records of such things could exist. And this was also how the war came home through television and newspapers, similar to the civil rights debate. This latter part matters because the people in charge could not account for the public&#039;s response to such visceral, real images of war, and this gradually annhilated the Nixon adminsitration when he failed to get us out as he promised.

Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga&#039;s camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners,[33] mostly by crucifixion and decapitation[34] with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek&#039;s teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as &quot;a very sweet and pleasing maiden&quot;, while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses.[35][36][37] The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that &quot;the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.&quot;[38] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living.

Being poor does not induce one to commit sin, and in fact it is made clear that privation can bring one closer to God.", "time": 1672545760, "resto": 14402319}, {"no": 14405346, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)23:06:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14402319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14402319</a><br>Acts 10:34 Then Peter opened [his] mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:", "time": 1672545963, "resto": 14402319}, {"no": 14405349, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)23:07:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14405082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14405082</a><br>There is only one God, but it&#039;s not that babylonian trinity you falsely call God", "time": 1672546033, "resto": 14402319}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14403964, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)14:53:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do Orthodox believe the Gregorian calendar is heretical?", "filename": "ba2ef399-9156-4958-9fb0-681552f8b77a-Pope_Gregory_XIII_portrait", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1123, "tn_w": 178, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672516426943811, "time": 1672516426, "md5": "kUiK9+Naw8k8k9rSTXnu0A==", "fsize": 79082, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "do-orthodox-believe-the-gregorian-calendar-is", "replies": 20, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 14404007, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)15:02:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14403964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14403964</a><br>some do, but they are weirdos generally <br>I would recommend to not associate with them <br>they are usually guys like pic rel", "filename": "iw4grnw836n81", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1709, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672516920849207, "time": 1672516920, "md5": "j2sXUkb7AQRbk9jBiftBBg==", "fsize": 196841, "resto": 14403964}, {"no": 14404297, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:12:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14403964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14403964</a><br>Orthodox in Finland use it and a lot of people don&#039;t like that but it&#039;s not considered heretical.", "time": 1672521141, "resto": 14403964}, {"no": 14404317, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:15:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14403964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14403964</a><br>Some schismatic groups do.", "time": 1672521339, "resto": 14403964}, {"no": 14404322, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:17:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14403964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14403964</a><br>The Orthodox are so retarded that their Calendar isn\u2019t even numerically stable.

The counter revolution and coup was widely supported because of communist terrorism. Attempts at moderate reforms were thwarted by communists and leftists and increasingly the country was split between loyalists and communists. In 1943 there was another counter revolution due to the worsening economic situation caused by WWII and there was slight capitulation towards communists. After this the government was taken over by Peron who was a socialist and believed in deficit spending and kissing union ass (like FDR). Within two years the peso had lost 70% of its value. Eventually another counter revolutionary coup was launched and Peron was deposed. Soon after communist paramilitary groups started executing politicians. Because of the communists they were unable to reach concessions again on the constitution. Eventually this gave rise to conservative paramilitary groups in the late 50&#039;s.
