These were instituted in a very arbitrary and autocratic manner and produced substantial revolt. Later, modern scholarly analysis demonstrated that the Russian practices were more ancient and that the Greek practices were the innovations.

For example, to label the Bulgarians as Slavs is pure nonsense; originally they were Turkomans. The same applies to the Czechs. It is enough for a Czech to grow a mostache for anyone to see, from the way the thing droops, that his origin is Mongolian. Among the so-called Slavs of the South the Dinaric race predominant. Turning to the Croats, I must say I think it is highly desirable, from the racial point of view, that they should be Germanised. There are, however, political reasons which completely preclude any such measures. There is one cardinal principle. This question of the Germanisation of certain peoples must not be examined in the light of abstract ideas and theory. We must examine each particular case. The only problem is to make sure whether the offspring of any race will mingle well with the German population and will improve it, or whether, on the contrary (as is the case when Jew blood is mixed with German blood), negative results will arise.</span>", "time": 1670750359, "resto": 14310763}, {"no": 14311000, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)04:22:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310991</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;quoting Fable Talks</span><br><br>LMAO", "time": 1670750537, "resto": 14310763}, {"no": 14311054, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)04:51:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Nazi racial ideology wasn&#039;t ever coherent or centralized.

Not all ethnic Germans are of Aryan descent and should be viewed as a lower caste) to more nationalistic anti-Bolshevik German supremacy that equated German ethnic heritage to Aryanness. Himmler, Rosenberg etc were on the &quot;esoteric&quot; end of the spectrum, Hitler was somewhere in the middle and more &quot;moderate&quot; Nazis like Goering and Speer were on the opposite end.

If they wanted to make allies or recruit from Slavic people, they &quot;found&quot; Aryans living amongst them or recruited nationalists who opposed Bolshevism. On the other hand, they could easily cast Slavs as semihuman barbarians when it was politically opportune. In general though, the Nazi party&#039;s view on Slavs early on is ambivalent, viewing them initially as a race closely related to the Germanics akin to the Celts. pre-Barbarossa Nazi sentiment towards Slavs was largely driven by their relation to Bolshevism; Pilsudski and the Poles were positively viewed for defending Europe from Bolshevik invasion (Pilsudski&#039;s German language autobiography had a forward written by Herman Goering) and the East Slavs were viewed as oppressed people under the yoke of Judeo Bolshevism. However after the failure of Barbarossa this quickly falls apart when they realize the Russian people are not welcoming the Germans as liberators and face resistance across Eastern and Southern Europe, and Slavs in general are viewed as subhuman with plans to eventually eradicate them or &quot;Germanize&quot; them (Poles and Czechs specifically).", "time": 1670752315, "resto": 14310763}, {"no": 14311094, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:03:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310872</a><br>i never understood this especially towards the later years of the war when things were going bad those men that hated communism could of easily been used as cannon fodder if given a rifle to put down communism", "time": 1670752991, "resto": 14310763}, {"no": 14311176, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:23:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14311094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14311094</a><br>See<br><br><a href=\"#p14311054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14311054</a>", "time": 1670754211, "resto": 14310763}], "last_modified": 1670754211}, {"no": 14308602, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:15:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thoughts on the Sikh religion?", "filename": "sikh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 333, "h": 500, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670706935581860, "time": 1670706935, "md5": "xlZGoQqB2ttQFs2VeMs6Bw==", "fsize": 49045, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "thoughts-on-the-sikh-religion", "replies": 25, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 20, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 14310519, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:59:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310338</a><br>Their concept of God is quite different from the Abrahamic one.", "time": 1670738348, "resto": 14308602}, {"no": 14310561, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)01:11:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310519</a><br>Its different from the Jewish and Islamic concept of God but basically the same as the Christian concept.", "time": 1670739062, "resto": 14308602}, {"no": 14310571, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)01:15:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m a Canadian who lived in Mill Woods, Edmonton, for a third of my life.

The texts report that he became so emaciated that his bones became visible through his skin.[186] The Mah\u0101saccaka-sutta and most of its parallels agree that after taking asceticism to its extremes, Gautama realized that this had not helped him attain nirvana, and that he needed to regain strength to pursue his goal.[187] One popular story tells of how he accepted milk and rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata.[188] His break with asceticism is said to have led his five companions to abandon him, since they believed that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined. At this point, Gautama remembered a previous experience of dhyana he had as a child sitting under a tree while his father worked.[187] This memory leads him to understand that dhyana (&quot;meditation&quot;) is the path to liberation, and the texts then depict the Buddha achieving all four dhyanas, followed by the &quot;three higher knowledges&quot; (tevijja),[v] culminating in complete insight into the Four Noble Truths, thereby attaining liberation from samsara, the endless cycle of rebirth.</span><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_B<wbr>uddha#Ascetic_life_and_awakening", "time": 1670748313, "resto": 14310447}, {"no": 14310907, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:45:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310902</a><br>So all those monks are completely getting it wrong?", "time": 1670748315, "resto": 14310447}, {"no": 14310914, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:47:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310907</a><br>Yes, if they&#039;re practicing the kind of asceticism that Buddha tried and found to be insufficient for realizing Nibbana. &quot;Asceticism&quot; is a very, very broad term, but again, read pretty much any version of the Buddha&#039;s life story and you&#039;ll see exactly the kind of asceticism that he denied.", "time": 1670748435, "resto": 14310447}, {"no": 14310915, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:47:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310907</a><br>Monachism is not necessarily ascetic.", "time": 1670748462, "resto": 14310447}, {"no": 14310942, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:58:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14310488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14310488</a><br>Still East of Europe retard", "time": 1670749127, "resto": 14310447}], "last_modified": 1670749127}, {"no": 14308068, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)13:52:40", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "The the Greeks &amp; Romans Actually Think", "com": "that The Gods walked the Earth?
