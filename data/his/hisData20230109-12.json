Moreover, the observation that the derivative E-M78 displays the DYS392-12/DYS19-11 haplotype suggests that it also arose in East Africa.

Northeastern African populations were not represented in that study. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed for DYS392, a geographically widespread subset of the E-M78 chromosomes here identified.

While these results do not suggest that the AHG gene pool originated as a mixture of Levant_N and WHG, both of which lived millennia later than AHG, it still robustly supports that AHG is genetically intermediate between WHG and Levant_N. This cannot be explained without gene flow between the ancestral gene pools of those three groups. This supports a late Pleistocene presence of both Near-Eastern and European hunter-gatherer-related ancestries in central Anatolia.

This is evident in the Ethics, Short Treatise, and Descartes\u2019 Principles of Philosophy Demonstrated in the Geometric Manner. In Tractatus de Intellectu Emendatione, Spinoza talks about \u201ca way of healing the intellect, and purifying it\u201d that might precede geometrical demonstration but gives no definition of the intellect or any general procedure for acquiring true definitions. This chapter examines how one acquires these definitions, discussing first what Spinoza might have considered to be the advantages or virtues of geometrical demonstration: transparency, force, security, scale, compactness, flexibility, generality, and sense-independence. It then analyzes Spinoza\u2019s relation to Descartes, highlighting the distinction between the analytic and the synthetic method, their different sense of geometrical order, and another virtue of geometry: ease. Finally, it invokes the idea of method Spinoza outlined in Emendatione as a solution to the puzzle mentioned earlier.<br><br>https://academic.oup.com/edited-vol<wbr>ume/28070/chapter-abstract/21206764<wbr>1?redirectedFrom=fulltext", "time": 1673256651, "resto": 14442515}, {"no": 14442965, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)07:22:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "YOU DARE QUESTION THE ALMIGHTY JIMMY?", "time": 1673266925, "resto": 14442515}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14442593, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)04:30:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Underrated historical figure", "filename": "5CCA4A45-2567-47C9-A520-7AFCB26BAC54", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 689, "h": 599, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 217, "tim": 1673256620732123, "time": 1673256620, "md5": "IbwYytXdvPdrggEfPzpIMQ==", "fsize": 58068, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "underrated-historical-figure", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 14442964, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)07:21:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "His only mistake was not making Saudi a constitutional monarchy after his death.

Reality ultimately reduces to a medium in which there is infinite (unbounded) informational potential, or a total lack of informational constraint. This is what the informational part of reality needs in order to be coherently identifiable as information. Deny as much, and you&#039;re saying that it&#039;s contingent on something which is informational in nature (that&#039;s what you&#039;d have to be saying because no alternative exists). So the identifiable existence of any coherent X automatically implies the negation of X, making the distinction both evidential and conceptual. This is why reality isn&#039;t completely deterministic in nature and explains much of what has been empirically verified in QM. Many mystics have intuited this medium and have tried to explain it, variously using terms such as &quot;abyss (Ungrund)&quot;, &quot;emptiness (Sunyata)&quot;, and &quot;Ayin&quot; in their attempts to do so. But it is best and most precisely described in Langan&#039;s theory, called the CTMU, which has been mentioned above. It relates very, very heavily to some of the things you write about. Although reality isn&#039;t entirely analogous to a computer because of reasons stated above, it describes informational reality as existing under the auspices of a Self-Configuring-Self-Processing Language, and it is very detailed in its description of the syntax and dynamic properties of it) More notably, it can even prove some of the things you&#039;ve said to be correct. It was the first theory of reality as a self-simulation, and I think you&#039;d be surprised to see how much of modern popular science is wrought with ideas which were first constructively communicated under the name of its author.

Others believe that it&#039;s a more traditional heavenly realm, or perhaps a retrun to the Garden of Eden. In general, it&#039;s not something worth worrying about in Judaism; God is good, so there&#039;s nothing to fear.<br><br>It is explicitly not a place just for Jews.

The reward for following the Covenant is not the afterlife, but rather God&#039;s temporal protection of the Jewish nation.<br><br>The interpretation of afterlife that I subscribe to is that of Gehinom. Gehinom (or Gehenna) is not a place, but rather an emotion; a feeling of intense shame. When we die, we become beings of pure soul, and thus lose our physical bodies and physical insticts. The human inclination to sin comes entirely from physical instinct, so the first emotion that every human being feels upon rising to heaven is the shame of Gehinom, comiserate to how much they sinned in life.<br><br>This is the only &quot;punishment&quot; one recieves after they die. One must atone for their the sins and regrets of their life in heaven, often by approaching the souls of those they hurt when alive and asking their forgiveness directly. They choose to attone not because it is forced on them, but because it is the natural desire of every soul to be good. Those who lived righteous lives will very quickly escape Gehinom and will get to enjoy heaven. Those who were wicked in life will struggle against Gehinom for longer, but it is never a permanent state; one has endless time to atone while in heaven.<br><br>Some rabbis also say that all souls are freed from Gehinom during the sabbath, so even those under its burden are not completely overwhelmed by it.", "time": 1673236460, "resto": 14438581}, {"no": 14441844, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:59:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s funny how weak faggots pretend that actually taking your religion seriously is purely an Abrahamic thing, and every other religion just gets along accepting other religions as equalling valid.", "time": 1673236741, "resto": 14438581}, {"no": 14441849, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)23:04:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14441844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14441844</a><br>Pagans don&#039;t take their religion seriously because their religions are retarded.

The transition from feudal to capitalist society lasted approximately 400 years. The changeover from a horse to a horsepower civilisation has been going on for over a hundred years with all the changes and stresses in social structure that intensified mass production brings. The big jump that has now to be made is the changeover from an individualistic to a collective, from an anarchic to a planned economy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fascism is the political form of one of the stages in this transition, that stage in which we now are. All the antagonistic and contradictory tendencies are somehow united in it. All the elements that feel the necessity of change, but want everybody to be changed except themselves and their own group, can project their wishes into the Fascist party, and find nothing there that is rigidly opposed to their wish phantasies. It is usual to reproach Hitler because he promised to everybody (except Jews) anything they wanted. Why reproach a leader for doing what his party exists to do? It is the strength of Fascism that it can take all the contradictory elements into itself. It is the weakness of Fascism, as of any other essentially reactionary system, that it attempts to solve these contradictions and can only do so on the basis of war preparation.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/subject/fa<wbr>scism/conze-wilkinson/ch21.htm", "filename": "z", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 406, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 101, "tim": 1673159965233982, "time": 1673159965, "md5": "DDoQWCkz8nLiE9M2KJMuIg==", "fsize": 54483, "resto": 14436916}, {"no": 14438071, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)01:40:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14438065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14438065</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Minor Contradictions in Fascism: Owing to the general contradictions within Fascism a number of minor contradictions exist. There is the inevitable struggle between the policy of preserving the \u2018old\u2019 middle classes, their local status and independence, and the desire for a plan which would make superfluous many functions that the old middle class performed. There is the contradiction between the attempt to lower the standard of the workers, dictated by the capitalist elements in Fascism, and the war preparations which need a reasonably contented working class. There is the incompatibility of autarchy and conquest of foreign markets: between the return to the village economy and war. The return to the village means the extinction of the heavy industry which is indispensable to the needs of the militarists. To see only one side of these contradictions as real, and to assume that the other is there for window-dressing purposes, makes it impossible to understand Fascism and the necessary zig-zaggery of Fascist policy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is the Leader who keeps together and maintains the equilibrium between the contradictory elements and groups. Therefore each Fascist party has one thing at least in common... a leader. Hence the fanatical loyalty to his person, and the theatrical over-advertisement of the man. A myth grows round him. The conviction spreads that whatever seems confusing or disappointing will somehow be solved when the Leader has time to give it his personal and magical attention. This belief in the magic powers of a leader, a hero-king, a warrior-Messiah, goes far back into the history of the race. Both Mussolini and Hitler have realised this. They tolerate no rivals to their divinity.</span>", "time": 1673160026, "resto": 14436916}, {"no": 14438104, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)01:52:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14438071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14438071</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is the purpose of this book to show that while Fascism has all these features of the gang, the dictatorship, the sadistic tyranny, these are only part of the whole picture, that Fascism is not an accident, but is the inevitable product of a specific set of circumstances. Fascism has only triumphed when other ways of getting out of the mess of the postwar world have been tried. Just as the first World War was a way of trying to solve the contradictions of prewar capitalism, so the second World War will be the way forced by Fascism to get out of the mess in which already the Fascist countries are involved.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Only by understanding the conditions that inevitably produce Fascism in a country can the correct method be evolved for avoiding it in one\u2019s own, presuming, that is, that the people are prepared to pay the price for avoiding it.

The breakdown of individualism, the collapse into chaos of that economic system on which the whole liberal outlook on life was based, is the dominating factor in our period. No propaganda, no spread of ideas with which any policeman can deal, but the relentless pressure of the products of the machine has smashed the foundations of laissez-faire. Mankind, solidly set on the land, can exist through any political chaos. That has been proved over and over again. But the Machine Age must be planned.

Social, Religious, and Political/Economic. The religious aspect should be outside the realm of government - and if a church wants to preform a ceremony for gay couples then that&#039;s a matter for that church&#039;s leadership and congregation. The social aspect is to announce to your friends and family that you think that this relationship is the one you want to keep from now on (although given divorce stats there&#039;s some debate about how much this applies now), but again that&#039;s not something that you need a government&#039;s or church&#039;s permission for, just throw a party and announce it. The reason that marriage has legislation around it is for the last one there, the economic factor. A stable, loving, supportive heterosexual family has been proven time and time again to be the best scenario to breed and produce children (the next generation of citizens and workers, hence the government&#039;s interest in it). There isn&#039;t sufficient data to tell us how gay parents will compare to that just yet - and for such a polarising issue it is almost impossible for a fair and honest study to be conducted/published - but let&#039;s be real and acknowledge that at its best it can only be as good as a functional heterosexual marriage, just without the ability to actually breed their own children. <br><br>As such it is, in the absolute best possible case, a second rate set up for fulfilling the task of a marriage (from the perspective of the government, the people you are arguing should be involved). Why are you in favour of the state wasting its limited and already overstretched resources on an, at best, second rate set up OP? Your fee-fees are not a political issue. Grow up.

The appointment of Warren Berger as new Chief Justice went smoothly enough, but shortly afterwards Justice Abe Fortas retired from the USSC unexpectedly. His initial choice to replace Fortas was Justice Clement Haynsworth of South Carolina, then sitting on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. This move was in line with Nixon&#039;s desire to extend the olive branch to the South, which had snubbed in terms of appointments to the judiciary and the Federal bureaucracy--attending Duke University as a young man had brought him into contact with Southern society and he had become a convert to the idea that it was necessary to move past the Civil War and accept Southerners as Americans, too.<br><br>Predictably, a pitchfork mob comprised of various factions formed to oppose Haynsworth&#039;s appointment. Civil rights groups were outraged at the idea of a Southerner sitting on the Supreme Court. Organized labor feared that Haynsworth, coming from a region with a traditional antipathy to labor unions, would be hostile to their interests. Jewish groups were also opposed to Haynsworth, not because he&#039;d done anything anti-Semitic, but because appointing him meant that the Supreme Court would not have a Jewish member for the first time since 1915, and they&#039;d come to feel entitled to having a representative on the bench.

Douglas had been involved in far more improprieties and conflicts of interest than Haynsworth, but it didn&#039;t matter for much. Haynsworth&#039;s nomination folded for the simple reason that he was conservative and a Southerner.<br><br>Nixon tried again by appointing Harrold Carswell of Florida, then sitting on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Unfortunately, Carswell was not only less than an outstanding jurist and intellect but earlier in his career had supported Jim Crow.

Cremer dutifully went off to get the jacket. When he failed to immediately come home, John and Nancy assumed he was just off playing with Dane somewhere. However, as hours passed with no sign of Cremer anywhere the two started to get worried.

Their literary correspondence and friendship, which spanned almost 50 years, began as a flirtation and maintained a mutual intellectual fascination.[17] However, Frederick found Voltaire difficult to live with in person. In addition, Frederick was often annoyed by Voltaire&#039;s many quarrels with his other friends. Voltaire&#039;s angry attack on Maupertuis, the President of Frederick&#039;s academy, in the form of a pamphlet, Le Diatribe du Docteur Akakia (The Diatribe of Doctor Akakia) provoked Frederick to burn the pamphlet publicly and put Voltaire under house arrest, after which Voltaire left Prussia. When Voltaire left, he took with him poems by Frederick mocking other rulers that could compromise Frederick. Frederick had his agents detain Voltaire in Frankfurt am Main on his way back to France and forced him to surrender the poems.[18] This episode, which has been called a &quot;lover&#039;s quarrel&quot;,[19] cooled Frederick and Voltaire&#039;s friendship. Eventually, they resumed their correspondence, aired their mutual recriminations, and remained on friendly terms until Voltaire&#039;s death.[2]</span>", "time": 1673201715, "resto": 14439207}, {"no": 14439927, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)13:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14439919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14439919</a><br>ugh if only my intellectual fascination could have been with me for 50 years", "time": 1673201906, "resto": 14439207}, {"no": 14439949, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)13:23:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;in July 1750, the Prussian king unmistakably wrote to his gay secretary and reader, Claude \u00c9tienne Darget: \u201cMes h\u00e9morro\u00efdes salient affectueusement votre v\u2026\u201d (\u201cMy hemorrhoids affectionately greet your cock\u201d), which strongly suggests that he was an active homosexual who practiced passive anal intercourse with men.</span>", "filename": "dee (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 1069, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673202227903006, "time": 1673202227, "md5": "NJiPTBhT7U0JXE1/3+gm4g==", "fsize": 56867, "resto": 14439207}, {"no": 14439961, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)13:27:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soon after his relationship with Keith ended, Frederick became close friends with Hans Hermann von Katte, a Prussian officer several years older than Frederick who became one of his boon companions and may have been his lover.[25] After the English marriages became impossible, Frederick plotted to flee to England with Katte and other junior army officers.[26] While the royal retinue was near Mannheim in the Electorate of the Palatinate, Robert Keith, who was Peter Keith&#039;s brother and also one of Frederick&#039;s companions, had an attack of conscience when the conspirators were preparing to escape and begged Frederick William for forgiveness on 5 August 1730.[27] Frederick and Katte were subsequently arrested and imprisoned in K\u00fcstrin. Because they were army officers who had tried to flee Prussia for Great Britain, Frederick William levelled an accusation of treason against the pair. The king briefly threatened the crown prince with execution, then considered forcing Frederick to renounce the succession in favour of his brother, Augustus William, although either option would have been difficult to justify to the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire.[28] The king forced Frederick to watch the beheading of his confidant Katte at K\u00fcstrin on 6 November, leading the crown prince to faint just before the fatal blow.[29]</span>", "filename": "564c11d9b6bfc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 694, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673202442767086, "time": 1673202442, "md5": "rCx1FzT5THV0+K9tI08t7Q==", "fsize": 98618, "resto": 14439207}, {"no": 14439972, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)13:30:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14439961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14439961</a><br>Damn poor frederick", "time": 1673202645, "resto": 14439207}, {"no": 14440255, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)14:50:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14439972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14439972</a><br>His father was seemingly a closeted gay man and a crypto calvinist who was deathly afraid for his immortal soul his entire life<br>It made him overreact to everything Frederick did<br>I&#039;m pretty sure Frederick Wilhelm was also notorious for beating his wife, guy had a lot of issues", "time": 1673207404, "resto": 14439207}, {"no": 14440291, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)14:58:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14440255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14440255</a><br>His dad was very based.

Frederick himself proposed marrying Maria Theresa of Austria in return for renouncing the succession.[33] Instead, Eugene persuaded Frederick William, through Seckendorff, that the crown prince should marry Elisabeth Christine, who was a Protestant relative of the Austrian Habsburgs.[34] Frederick wrote to his sister that, &quot;There can be neither love nor friendship between us&quot;,[35] and he threatened suicide,[36] but he went along with the wedding on 12 June 1733. He had little in common with his bride, and the marriage was resented as an example of the Austrian political interference that had plagued Prussia.[37] Nevertheless, during their early married life, the royal couple resided at the Crown Prince&#039;s Palace in Berlin. Later, Elisabeth Christine accompanied Frederick to Schloss Rheinsberg, where at this time she played an active role in his social life.[38] After his father died and he had secured the throne, Frederick separated from Elisabeth. He granted her the Sch\u00f6nhausen Palace and apartments at the Berliner Stadtschloss, but he prohibited Elisabeth Christine from visiting his court in Potsdam. Frederick and Elisabeth Christine had no children, and Frederick bestowed the title of the heir to the throne, &quot;Prince of Prussia&quot;, on his brother Augustus William.
