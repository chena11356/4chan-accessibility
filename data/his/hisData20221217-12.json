In Greek the translation is \u201cto view\u201d which is correct as it\u2019s the same as \u201cto watch\u201d.", "filename": "036BC148-1437-4459-B23E-00D916F18EE8", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 1013, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671276506771337, "time": 1671276506, "md5": "4/b1c8CpqSq7W4ON2459hg==", "fsize": 139878, "resto": 14337222}, {"no": 14338476, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)07:22:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14338322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14338322</a><br>So the original was &quot;to see him naming them&quot; but it got changed to &quot;to see what he would name them&quot;?", "time": 1671279745, "resto": 14337222}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14324953, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)11:20:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s the difference between hope and cope, they seem to overlap.", "filename": "1671029164052181 1670964638383544", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 1051, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671034825537659, "time": 1671034825, "md5": "F+MIJoXqU8s7VooGRdhkWg==", "fsize": 138968, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-the-difference-between-hope-and-cope-they", "replies": 61, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 47}, {"no": 14325904, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:42:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can assure you, the rat drowning experiment was absolutely crucial for the advancement of psychology.</span>", "time": 1671050522, "resto": 14324953}, {"no": 14325937, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:50:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14324953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14324953</a><br>This sounds like animal abuse.

The initial isolation was in large part due to French influence on the Jefferson admin, it&#039;s true, but it took until 1862 for the U.S. to recognize Haiti, after France had fully recognized their statehood in 1825. That had nothing to do with commitment to French sovereignty or their claims; the French had discarded those claims three decades prior. It was because the brutal killing of every white in Haiti after independence pissed off and frightened every southerner stateside, along with most others in the country. Opposition to Haiti didn&#039;t become nearly the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre that it did until the Haitians started chimping out, and this is affirmed by the prominent political figures of the times, such as Jefferson and Hamilton. Virtually every other Latin American independence movement was associated with slave revolts and abolition, and no other nation was isolated or had trouble getting recognized. Spain was involved in U.S. independence too, and they weren&#039;t happy about the independence of their colonies either, and yet the U.S. had no problem establishing firm boundaries in the Americas.

I imagine this is an unwitting influence from atheism, since Christians have far too often allowed the atheists in that dispute to lessen the burden of proof which they bear by letting them justify their professed unbelief in God by claiming there has been insufficient evidence to prove His existence; however it is mistaken that a proposition not proven or disproven is assumed to be false, it is assumed to have a truth value equal to its negation. So perhaps the atheist has succeeded in justifying his own personal unbelief, but at the same time he has succeeded in stripping himself of any basis to object to the Christian&#039;s belief, since his unbelief apparently has no more evidentiary basis than belief.

Beginning in 1869 Bragg ran the water works for a salary of $350 a year as superintendent and $100 as chief engineer (for which he had trained at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.) (City Archives, Water Works letters, I, 23; Daily Picayune )</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On Bragg\u2019s staff as assistant superintendent was a remarkable man. Edmond Rillieux was one of the children of a Free Woman of Color, Constance Vivant, and the white man with whom she was plac\u00e9ed (in common law marriage), Vincent Rillieux, who was the uncle of the French Impressionist painter, Edgar Degas. Although their mixed racial heritage might have precluded any education for them in mid-nineteenth century America, the Rillieux children were part of the milieu of cosmopolitan New Orleans, and thanks to the support of their father, Edmond and his brother Norbert were both French trained. Norbert achieved fame as an engineer of sugar making equipment (and, it is said, offered a drainage plan for New Orleans that was not accepted.)

He thoroughly organized and perfected as much as possible that department, and then repaired to Texas. . .\u201d Whether the General\u2019s westward retreat was occasioned by over exposure to bureaucracy can not be known.

Wood buildings were rare and would have been mostly in the countryside and temporary, constructed by nomadic invaders. Brick buildings were common, with new medieval buildings using half timbered style, but much less so than anywhere else in Europe. Even in the countryside peoples houses were mostly built with brick or stones. A great surviving example is the Apulian trullo, a stone country house that can be built or demolished I a couple of days (in the past this was done to avoid paying property tax).

British and Scandinavian nationalists just want to make money and protect what private property they&#039;ve gained in the post world war 2 period against the immigrants and poorer native parts of their society., and to this end they&#039;ll support the complete privitization of their economy and the upgrading of policing on the people.", "time": 1671254594, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14337419, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:31:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14337381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14337381</a><br>i think cubas an interesting example of non toxic third world nationalism. but it stands pretty much alone through sheer isolation. at no point could cuba ever pose a serious threat to its neighbours because the US had total domination of the local region", "time": 1671255064, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14337538, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)01:05:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "nukes are fake and gay<br>all tests were simply large tnt explosions", "filename": "Trinity_Test_-_100_Ton_Test_-_High_Explosive_Stack_002", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 384, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671257143000481, "time": 1671257143, "md5": "k4tyZbukvUkNZ27LNsfRxw==", "fsize": 46855, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14337549, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)01:09:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what you really need to ask yourself is what is found in those areas teh us, russia, and china have been blowing up together since 1950<br>what is in nevada, xinjiang, the small islands in the pacific, north africa, north asia<br>what lives there, what do the american indians and global local populations describe living there<br>what did we find in love locke lake and in exactly all those places<br>what did we find in laos and south asia where we bombed the place non stop for a decade<br>why did we pay isis to destroy those sites in the middle east", "filename": "map_nuclear_tests2", "ext": ".gif", "w": 530, "h": 257, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1671257340905129, "time": 1671257340, "md5": "klO9b8YDOsiquxTxRVrzQQ==", "fsize": 48535, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14337970, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)03:52:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14337225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14337225</a><br>i dont know if you are doing bunkerchan raid shit or whatever but you should probably just log off and find an actual hobby, arguing in 4chan about your favourite marxist method of g spot stimulation is a really bad way to inject meaning and adversity into your life, you arent going to change anyones minds or anything like that and you know it", "time": 1671267164, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14337974, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)03:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14337970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14337970</a><br>Muh boonker", "time": 1671267269, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14337992, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)03:59:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14337974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14337974</a><br>this board sucks because of people like you baiting political arguments", "time": 1671267560, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14337996, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)04:00:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14337974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14337974</a><br>https://leftypol.org/<br>C\u00b4mon, off you go.", "filename": "targetaudience", "ext": ".png", "w": 743, "h": 905, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671267617675284, "time": 1671267617, "md5": "JYKDjG89U1blfIMQZdhC/w==", "fsize": 1180236, "resto": 14337201}, {"no": 14338366, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)06:47:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14337419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14337419</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i think cubas an interesting example of non toxic third world nationalism.</span><br>I think they&#039;ve been pretty consistent about it at the level of principle (tactically a bit more flexible), that it&#039;s kinda remarkable.

Essentially, leave people alone unless they&#039;re actively causing harm to others, is the overarching guiding ideal.

For people who consider themselves to be anarchists, they&#039;ll try to abolish as many government institutions as they can. But in the United States, mainstream Libertarians are fine with government in principle, they just want its regulatory apparatuses trimmed down (i.e. auditing and closing down some bureaus), and many of its prohibitive laws repealed. <br><br>The Libertarian ideal in the US can be summarized as a desire to remove bureaucratic institutions which exist largely to exact fines and fees from people by passing an ever increasing amount of prohibitions on the public, and replace them with courts that serve to redress and mediate disputes between citizens. <br><br>A major tenet of Libertarian belief is that democratic processes are fundamentally subject to corruption so it is better to disperse effective power as widely as possible to mitigate the effects of corruption and to also make corrupt officials more immediately answerable to the people. Centralizing power means you only have to bribe a handful of people to pass sweeping legislation that covers the whole country. Decentralizing means you now have to bribe potentially hundreds of people, and get them to coordinate across dozens of different legislatures.

This was the first Protestant denomination. After Lutheranism was established, this is where things got out of hand. Some of the other earlier denominations from the next 200 years would be the Anglicans, the Methodist, and the Baptist. <br>You see, Luther had rebelled against the state and political power of the Catholic Church, which he viewed as inherently corrupt.

The violators have no right to complain at such punishment, as Paul showed by his words before Caesar\u2019s judgment seat. (Acts 25:11) Hence the Christian congregation cannot protect any of its members if they steal, smuggle, commit bigamy, murder, libel, defraud, and so forth. The congregation must release such guilty members to punishment by worldly authorities.

We cannot hinder, oppose or condemn the execution of the krima or judgment by aiding or shielding lawbreakers. To do so would put the Christian congregation also in opposition to God\u2019s arrangement. Besides letting the krima or \u201cjudgment\u201d take its course upon offending members who bring reproach upon God\u2019s people, the congregation may disfellowship such lawbreakers.

They just got absorbed into the greater English Protestant mass which melded together to form Yankees/New Englanders, which brings us to WASPs as a whole. Some groups, the Quakers in particular, one could very well argue inspired American progressivism (anti-slavery, pacifist, undermined gender roles, they were teetotalers and so on). However, they were a minority overall. Yankeedom produced Madison Grant, Lothrop Stoddard, Teddy Roosevelt etc. none of these people were &quot;progressive&quot; in the way we would describe the term now. People like them are not the reason things are the way they are now. Were some WASPs supporters of what would be a precursor to modern progressivism or parts of that agenda? Yes, but of course there&#039;d be at least some because they were at one point the demographic majority and there&#039;s always outliers. However, speaking of demographics, we can&#039;t focus on them exclusively because that would ignore the massive immigrant populations that swamped the place. JFK was not a WASP.

Just some trading posts and native partners, and there you go. And that&#039;s just the new world.

After November 1914 Ottoman policy towards the Greek population shifted; state policy was restricted to the forceful migration to the Anatolian hinterland of Greeks living in coastal areas, particularly the Black Sea region, close to the Turkish-Russian front. This change of policy was due to a German demand for the persecution of Ottoman Greeks to stop, after Eleftherios Venizelos had made this a condition of Greece&#039;s neutrality when speaking to the German ambassador in Athens. Venizelos also threatened to undertake a similar campaign against Muslims that were living in Greece if Ottoman policy did not change. While the Ottoman government tried to implement this change in policy, it was unsuccessful and attacks, even murders, continued to occur unpunished by local officials in the provinces, despite repeated instructions in cables sent from the central administration. Arbitrary violence and extortion of money intensified later, providing ammunition for the Venizelists arguing that Greece should join the Entente.</span><br><br>Also Venizelists escalade so called pro-democracy aggression: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natio<wbr>nal_Schism<br><br>Is right thing go war with murderer Turks or joined central powers?", "time": 1671132760, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14331727, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:30:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14322958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14322958</a><br>Battle of Narva so i could tell the king to burn St.Petersburg to the ground and kick russia out of the baltic", "time": 1671154255, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14331800, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)21:00:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Cavalry charge at the Battle of Arsuf, 1191, Third Crusade.", "filename": "tumblr_inline_nubm1xIBxw1tu5ouf_500", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 487, "h": 286, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 73, "tim": 1671156028925016, "time": 1671156028, "md5": "izxcj8+kfNDYkfvK82mQ2Q==", "fsize": 59988, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14332024, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)22:16:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14327785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14327785</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Losers</span>", "time": 1671160580, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14333442, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)08:26:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14323173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14323173</a><br>Cringe", "time": 1671197178, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14333496, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)08:53:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14330339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14330339</a><br>More worsened", "time": 1671198827, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14333501, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)08:56:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Travel back in time to the Enola gay<br><br>See if I could fly out to california and drop the bomb on my ancestors for the lols", "time": 1671198967, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14333505, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)08:57:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14322964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14322964</a><br>based but cringe", "time": 1671199066, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14334607, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)13:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14322958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14322958</a><br>American GI in Vietnam between 1967-1969.", "time": 1671214907, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14335235, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:13:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14333501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14333501</a><br>lmao pls do<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. californianon</span>", "time": 1671221590, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14335255, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:17:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14322958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14322958</a><br>any bronze age war", "time": 1671221828, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14336497, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)19:45:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14334607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14334607</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><br>For me, Join Vietnamese against 1979 invaders.", "time": 1671237921, "resto": 14322958}, {"no": 14336596, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:19:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14322958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14322958</a><br>Battle of Manzikert.

Understanding the cultural context will help. First, Jesus\u2019 mission was first to the people of the covenant, i.e., the Jews, who were awaiting the Messiah. Technically, the mission to the gentiles was not granted until the Ascension, when Our Lord said, \u201cGo out and make disciples of all the nations\u201d (Mt 28:18-20).

The Jews used phrases like, \u201cgentile dog,\u201d \u201cinfidel dog\u201d and later, \u201cChristian dog.\u201d However, Jesus used the diminutive form for \u201cdog,\u201d better translated as \u201cpuppy.\u201d So instead of calling her the insulting \u201cjunk yard dog,\u201d He calls her \u201clovable puppy.\u201d (Keep in mind the English translation misses this distinction from the original Greek text.)<br><br>https://www.biblegateway.com/passag<wbr>e/?search=Matthew%2015%3A21-28%2CMa<wbr>rk%207%3A24-30&amp;version=NIV", "time": 1671156831, "resto": 14330831}, {"no": 14331834, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)21:13:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14331813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14331813</a><br>Jesus was testing the Canaanite woman when he said that.
