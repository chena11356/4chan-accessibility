Napoleon&#039;s army (1/6th of what the Wehrmacht sent to Russia) sourced almost all of their supplies locally, because almost all of their supply needs were food and fuel.

An infantry division in combat required 1,100 metric tons of supply EVERY DAY. Barbarossa committed 153 divisions; and while not all of them were fighting every day of the operation, on any given day quite a lot of them were. German tonnage movement requirements were in the tens of thousands. Napoleon&#039;s quartermasters couldn&#039;t move anything close to that. And EVERY army of WW2 stuck to railroads whenever it could, and the ones that had to stray from them for any reason ran into problems almost immediately. Reliance on the Via Balbia made invading out of Libya and into Egypt a fucntional impossibility, and it also doomed the British to overextension and crushing defeat in the aftermath of Compass and Crusader, for all of their greater mechanization. The single biggest thing stopping the rout of German forces in France in August and September 1944 was the Transportation plan&#039;s damage to railroads that hobbled the Anglo-American forces. Soviet doctrine called for engineering units to build railroads to support advances if there weren&#039;t any nearby ones to appropriate. The Japanese offensives into China ran into immediate and remarkable difficulties once they seized the railroad networks up and down the east coast and tried to push west into far less developed territory.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Railroads only help when you&#039;re actually near them</span><br>meant that WW2 armies stayed near railroads, at least when they wanted to concentrate into meaningfully large formations.", "time": 1675226346, "resto": 14558962}, {"no": 14561243, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:52:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Communism has better morale and production bonuses.", "time": 1675227161, "resto": 14558962}, {"no": 14561285, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:11:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14560657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14560657</a><br>/k/ is definitely edgy. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;/k/ is moderate </span><br>lol<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Edgy totalitarians are now identified with Moscow and /k/ hates the Russians. </span><br>Being totalitarian =/= being edgy, liberals can be edgy when talking about killing whites and shit like that.", "time": 1675228299, "resto": 14558962}, {"no": 14561358, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:46:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14561285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14561285</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Being totalitarian =/= being edgy</span><br>I kinda feel that real totalitarians aren&#039;t edgy.

Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ\u2019s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort\u2014opposed as they are to our religion\u2014shall not be hung up in any church of Christ.

The Pharoah who took the throne after the various succession crises following Akhenaten and Tutankhatens early deaths was Horemheb. Though he is considered to be of the same dynasty as Akhenaten, he was entirely unrelated to them. It was Horemheb who began the persecution of Atenism with the support of the old priest caste. It was Horemheb who tried to erase akhenaten from the record.

Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, on May 17, 1954. Tied to the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the decision declared all laws establishing segregated schools to be unconstitutional, and it called for the desegregation of all schools throughout the nation.[1] After the decision, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attempted to register black students in previously all-white schools in cities throughout the South. In Little Rock, Arkansas, the school board agreed to comply with the high court&#039;s ruling. Virgil Blossom, the Superintendent of Schools, submitted a plan of gradual integration to the school board on May 24, 1955, which the board unanimously approved. The plan would be implemented during the fall of the 1957 school year, which would begin in September 1957.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When integration began on September 4, 1957, the Arkansas National Guard was called in to &quot;preserve the peace&quot;. Originally at orders of the governor, they were meant to prevent the black students from entering due to claims that there was &quot;imminent danger of tumult, riot and breach of peace&quot; at the integration.

Actually having a better alternative is what differentiates critique in some positive sense from denigration. <br>Probably the most absurd example I&#039;ve seen is the &quot;critique&quot; that China has too much high speed rail.

With Napoleon in France, who enacted similar reforms to industrialize France in relation to the UK and Germany, this began a series of events that would kill both Empires in the same way they started: an extremely violent genocidal war that, ultimately, would be decided by western powers. By this point the west had formalized all their internal relations into the Peace of Westphalia, which prevented the Napoleonic Wars from wrecking a similar havoc on Western internal relations.<br><br>Going back to the start: The Roman Empire had similar conflict resolution mechanisms enabling pan-European and some pan-Asiatic trade. Most of this was done through marine shipping and waterways. The breakdown of such systems in the west permitted Ottomans increased, and more aggressive, expansion of such trade in the east (usually overland but not entirely) making them wealthy. Many were still farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, etc but a larger middle class developed and remained until discovery of the new world. The Ottomans were consistently wealthy until ~1600. Which, not coincidentally, was around the same time the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia was planned and setup in 1607. By this point all Western powers had navies whereas the Ottomans and Russians didn&#039;t. Industrial development resulting from this would prove to be hugely consequential over the next 400 years.", "time": 1675149811, "resto": 14554439}, {"no": 14557205, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)08:00:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1675170032, "resto": 14554439}, {"no": 14557259, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)08:24:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;What was their daily life like?</span><br>basicallly similar to muslims today i imagine. lots of tea and coffee, lots of tobacco, sometimes mosque visiting. good hygiene thanks to cleanly streets, developed sewer system and turkish bathhouses. diet usually similar to modern turkish diet, rich with vegetables but not a lot of meat, also lots of pastries. man grew beards and mustaches, only urbanite women had niqabs, other women wore traditional turkic clothing. idk what more to tell.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did Turks do for a living?</span><br>many of the trade related roles were occupied by armenians, greeks and sephardic jews, who were exempt from military service but paid higher taxes. turks and turkified devshirmes served in the army and the state ranks a lot, but devshirme gained more tract in state offices as the empire grew older, due to them supporting each other. most turks were hence nomadic tribesmen or farmers.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;were most hicks or urbanites?</span><br>urban centers were underdeveloped in the ottoman empire, a primarily agricultural realm.<br>most prominent cities were salonica, beirut, <br>izmir and of course istanbul. city centers had more dhimmi jews and christians than muslims usually, so turks were predominantly hicks.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did hicks do pastoralism or agriculture the most?

It&#039;s very possible that many simple civilisations began and fizzled out in forgotten prehistory, but the middle-eastern civilisations only flourished because by pure chance multiple civilisations appeared close together by chance, allowing for the trade of goods and ideas, kickstarting the exponential growth that led us to today.", "time": 1675226252, "resto": 14560237}, {"no": 14561198, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:37:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14561186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14561186</a><br>The first black famers orginated in the rainforest belt.

On December 10, 1994, the two were attending a GM executive party at the Atheneum Hotel in the Motor City. They retired to their room around 4:30 in the morning. A couple hours later, Lowell called Bert Crabtree, another GM manager, and looked distraught. Crabtree and a friend named Daniel Porcasi, went to the room where Lowell announced that Robert had died in an accident. He said he had to clean up the room before police got there, and told Porcasi to take his sport coat.<br><br>The next morning, Porcasi was heading home when he casually peeped inside the breast pocket of the coat. Inside was a small black leather case which contained a syringe with no needle. An extremely bad-smelling washcloth was jammed inside it. Repulsed by this discovery, Porcasi closed it back up. He gave the coat back to Amos the next day, who claimed the syringe was for a saline substance.<br><br>Police meanwhile were talking to Amos about the discovery of Roberta&#039;s body. They arrived at the hotel to find him shirtless, a cigarette in one hand and a towel in the other, as he remarked &quot;She&#039;s in the other room, cold as a fish.&quot; He told them the two had had a cocaine-fueled sex party the night of December 10-11 and he awoke to find Roberta dead. Amos claimed his wife had a sinus problem and was not able to snort the coke, instead she &quot;took it inside her.&quot; Indeed there was cocaine sprinkled on the bed linen and under the mattress.

In English the KJV does this job well. The only real reason some people stopped using it is because they were convinced that we have lost the original text by some scholars, and were sold a bill of goods to buy their version instead, and then dozens of different base texts were created based on some very deviated manuscripts that don&#039;t even agree with each other as much as they differ, which is very different than the situation you have with the received text, which is very uniform within its text type manuscripts. The main differences within the received text line are spelling differences and some other minor things in the Greek grammar that would translate to the same thing regardless.

In the Old Testament it is a translation of the Greek Septuagint; however it deviates from the Greek in some places such as Genesis 5. The Septuagint says &quot;167 years&quot; in Genesis 5:25 and &quot;188 years&quot; in Genesis 5:28, for example. This is significant because it means Methuselah outlived the flood (by 14 years) according to this variant. However the Hebrew version has the numbers 187 and 182 in these two places, resulting in Methuselah dying the same year as the flood.<br><br>The OSB follows the Hebrew in these verses of Genesis, avoiding this issue. Although if you look at other translations of the Septuagint like the Brenton Septuagint of 1844, or a Greek edition, you will see the years 167 and 188 in these two verses. These versions at least stay true to their Greek source here, even if it contains an apparent error.<br><br>Among missing prophecies in the OSB, there is the messianic prophecy in Psalm 2:12, since the word &quot;Son&quot; (referring to the Son of God) is omitted. The OSB (and LXX) is also missing another major messianic prophecy in Isaiah 9:6\u2013<br><br>Compare the two translations:<br>&quot;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&quot;<br>- Isaiah 9:6 KJV<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. His name will be called the Angel of Great Counsel, for I shall bring peace upon the rulers, peace and health by Him.&quot;</span><br>- Orthodox Study Bible (2008)<br><br>Notice the difference: The Septuagint does not include any mention of the title in the second part of Isaiah 9:6. I could name several more messianic prophecies also missing in the Septuagint, for instance Jeremiah 33:15, Daniel 9:26, Hosea 11:1, Habakkuk 3:13, Zephaniah 3:17, Haggai 2:7; all of these are found in the KJV.", "time": 1675226863, "resto": 14560070}, {"no": 14561271, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:03:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14561226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14561226</a><br>Generally speaking with the Septuagint in the Old Testament, about 1/8 of the book of Jeremiah is missing, including the entire second half of chapter 33. In the book of Proverbs, there are drastic changes to the verse counts, resulting in about thirty entire Proverbs missing, by my count. This is a conservative estimate on my part as many more are changed nearly to the point of being unrecognizable. There are at least thirty proverbs in the LXX that have absolutely no mention whatsoever, where they can be found in the Hebrew-based Bibles like the KJV. For instance the Septuagint\u2013 and by extension the OSB\u2013 is missing the entire verses of Proverbs 15:31, Proverbs 16:1, 3-4, 6-9, Proverbs 18:23-24, and Proverbs 19:1-2, 7, just to name a dozen or so.<br><br>Another issue with the Septuagint is with apparent New Testament synchronizations. Since the version we have was edited by Origen, it was possible that some of the changes (that he is known to have made) would include when the Old Testament text was harmonized with the New Testament to make it match. The most egregious example might be in Genesis 46:27 and Exodus 1:5, where the number 70 was changed to 75, in order to match the tally given by Stephen in Acts chapter 7. The only problem is that the text in Deuteronomy 10:22 still says 70 in the Greek, while it should have been changed to 75 (!) as it was in the first two passages, to remain consistent. There is also no reason to change the number from 70 to 75, in Genesis 46:27 and Exodus 1:5 in the first place, since the groups of people being mentioned are not exactly the same. In Acts we have mentioned the 75 people whom Joseph invited into Egypt, which included his brothers&#039; wives, but not himself or Ephraim and Manasseh. But in Genesis the number of people who comprised the 70 people includes Joseph and his two sons, but the wives are NOT mentioned within this group (not of Jacob&#039;s house), bringing the number down to 70.<br><br>Hope some of these details helped.", "filename": "741B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 424, "h": 561, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675227806639418, "time": 1675227806, "md5": "qpuBBM7ExJzhbJ50fYBPIw==", "fsize": 13500, "resto": 14560070}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14559598, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:19:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why is the south of Italy poorer and since when?", "filename": "1675202885000911", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 1416, "tn_w": 211, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675203555884189, "time": 1675203555, "md5": "pRLKqsx9yYkliSqffKEzJw==", "fsize": 164982, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-is-the-south-of-italy-poorer-and-since-when", "replies": 52, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 14559608, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:20:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14559598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559598</a><br>North Italy: 6&#039;2 Germanic Chads with 110 IQ<br>South Italy: 5&#039;6 brown Arabs with 80 IQ", "time": 1675203652, "resto": 14559598}, {"no": 14559616, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14559608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559608</a><br>Why do I even bother", "time": 1675203714, "resto": 14559598}, {"no": 14559620, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:23:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14559598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559598</a><br>the north industrialised while the south stayed hicks", "time": 1675203813, "resto": 14559598}, {"no": 14559636, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:26:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14559598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559598</a><br>Why do the northlets insist in putting the rightful heart of southern Italy (Roma) as part of the barbaric north?", "time": 1675203983, "resto": 14559598}, {"no": 14559661, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:31:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14559608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559608</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;germanic</span><br>More like celtic-etruscan<br><br>The real reason for the divide is that the south was byzantine, islamic and spaniard controlled while the north enjoyed semi-independence from the holy roman empire", "time": 1675204311, "resto": 14559598}, {"no": 14559701, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:38:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14559661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559661</a><br><a href=\"#p14559608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559608</a><br>They are mycenaean-lombard-italoceltic mutts<br>If you believe the eastern armenoids didnt moved there as well during the antiquity you are wrong<br>However they were drifted north again by lombard rape and a bunch of migrations", "time": 1675204731, "resto": 14559598}, {"no": 14559703, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:39:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14559661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14559661</a><br>Kek<br><br>I really enjoy reading New World Mutt knowledge of European history.

It is a way of approaching the &quot;convert me&quot; question outside of a dry logical proof.<br><br>People come to belief in different ways. For instance, a man named Whittaker Chambers, a convinced atheist who was once quite famous as a Soviet spy, experienced an epiphany while holding his infant daughter:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My eye came to rest on the delicate convolutions of her ear -- those intricate, perfect ears. The thought passed through my mind: No, those ears were not created by any chance coming together of atoms in nature... They could have been created only by immense design.</span><br><br>Now, from my perspective, Chambers experienced God&#039;s grace at the moment.<br><br>And, interestingly, God&#039;s grace is something you are in a position to be proactive about. Thus, you can say to God, &quot;Convince me.&quot;<br><br>That is, you can pray, to the God who may or may not exist. And this is an approach that I can recommend from my own experience, because I tried this, and it did work for me.<br><br>Ask for guidance and light. Ask for the grace of faith -- to understand, to see the truth that you cannot now see. Trust that God is good when you pray for these things... which can be a difficult thing to do, to be quite honest. But it&#039;s important.
