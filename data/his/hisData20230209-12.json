evidence. Look up the remains of Yeha temple at D&#039;mt. Its clearly related to Sabaean architecture. The Axumite elites worshiped South Arabian gods. They have inscriptions in both proto-ethiosemitic and sabaean. I already shared with you the beysian statistical analysis showing the introduction of PES into the Horn at that time around 800BC. Even phenotypically, look at Yemenite Jews and Yemeni highlands, and I&#039;m not talking about the ones with Cushitic admixture. Your scenario is just very far-fetched. Were these anatolians in your mind semitic speakers? Or did they assimilate into the same language family and religion of those across the sea?<br><br> furthermore, you say they arrived around 1200-900BC but Aksum is a later heavily cushitized stage culture. you think Axumites were pure Eurasian but there is no way they remained pure for that long. I suggest the Proto-Ethiosemites arrived 1000-800BC. Your idea of Axum to me more resembles the D&#039;mt kingdom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%CA%<wbr>BFmt which probably had a eurasian (albeit Yemeni) elite of Proto-Ethiosemites.

But a lot of online anti-colonialists seem to think that the last five centuries of European endeavor begins at genocide and ends there. Take the Columbian exchange, for example. The introduction of crops from the New World was a boon to Old World agriculture and many world cuisines would be unrecognizable without it. The Americas also became a refuge for many fleeing religious and ethnic persecution, and the flow of new ideas this allowed was vital to the overthrow of feudalism and the rise of liberalism, which even hardline Marxists admit is a vital step on the road to communism. I must admit it amuses me to see white American progressives in particular shit on colonialism, confident that they&#039;d be living the high-life in modern Europe when without colonialism modernity as we know it probably wouldn&#039;t exist, and they&#039;d be stuck as some illiterate dung-farming serf with incurable TB.<br><br>In the end, I don&#039;t know if the world would&#039;ve been better or worse if Europeans had just stayed in Europe.

Now the reason for that changing isn&#039;t easily explained but a big part of it is the european empires falling, up till that point promoting colonialism had a direct benefit and was to an extend necessary to justify colonial empires. Take portugal schoolbooks until the fall of the dictatorship they described portugal several times larger since their count included all their massive oversea holdings in africa for example. This lead to the simple truth that the majority of colonies existed for the benefit of the heartland often at the expense of those colonies to become more commonly accepted. This coencided with a general shift in the historical, social and cultural sciences, which led to the desire to tell the other side of the story and narratives outside of the european perspective. Now as these things tend to go, when you are the new kid on the block you tend to make a lot of noise as tends to happen when you go up against hundred of years of well established colonial history and what you are seeing now is that conflict shaking out in favor of a post colonial history. However this isn&#039;t true across the board it really depends on the indivdiaul country, as you might imagine the UK is very reluctant when it comes to adressing its colonial past at least for now, while places like Germany are far more open about it, naturally places that never had an empire or were colonized have even more reason to tell the story predominantly from their perspective, if not exclusively, which can be just as dishonest but more understandable. Most interesting are places like France which still hold on to their empire or China who manage to be both the colonizer and the colonized in their history.", "time": 1675944559, "resto": 14595247}, {"no": 14602413, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)07:12:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595247</a><br>Mostly gay teen who live on rant or off leech their family.", "time": 1675944749, "resto": 14595247}, {"no": 14602426, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)07:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595320</a><br>Colonize just means to &quot;settle.&quot; It has pretty much nothing to do with robbery.", "time": 1675944994, "resto": 14595247}, {"no": 14602452, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)07:22:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595247</a><br>Because the TV guy told them to.", "time": 1675945376, "resto": 14595247}, {"no": 14602466, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)07:29:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14601185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601185</a><br>You will never have a real ethnostate", "time": 1675945795, "resto": 14595247}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14601204, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)23:00:09", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Explain my DNA results?", "com": "Not sure if this is appropriate for /his/ but I&#039;m curious about my DNA results.

So for example, a homosexual who at times fails in his struggle is not doing something different in principle from one who fails at some other sin, but the homosexual is de facto excluded where the other may not be. Francis is not trying to advocate for a change in doctrine, which is clear from his opposition to the heretical German bishops, who are doing such a thing.

You will arise and have compassion on Zion\u2014 For it is time to be gracious to it, for the appointed time has come.

This will be written for the generation to come, and a people yet to be created will praise Yah&quot;. It seems clear this messianic character is the primary relation to Jesus for which reason the apostle identifies Him as the one whom it is about: for in Jesus it has fulfillment, He has had compassion on Zion, He has been gracious to it, the appointed time came, through Him the nations and the kings of the earth have learned to fear Yahweh, through Him a nation other than the Jews, which had yet even to be created, praise His name; the Son is the appearance of Yahweh in His glory.", "time": 1675901133, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600018, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:06:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14599778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14599778</a><br><a href=\"#p14600008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600008</a><br><a href=\"#p14600013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600013</a><br>Thus it is not only the part which the apostle quoted, which is about Yahweh&#039;s eternal unchanging nature in contrast with His own creation, that is about the Son, for if that were so the section I quoted would undeniably be the more applicable.

This is further demonstrated by the fact the apostle&#039;s quotation includes the word &quot;Lord&quot;, which the entirety of Psalm 102 does not. It is well known that in the last few centuries leading up to Christ out of superstition the Jews ceased to pronounce the divine name, or even to write it except when transcribing scripture. When they translated the Old Testament into Greek they did not render the divine name but translated it as &quot;kyrios&quot; (Lord) which is why the New Testament even in quoting the Old Testament never used the divine name outright but only under this title.

Remember: jesus came to jews to show them the correct example and correct way to live. During his time among them, he worshiped &quot;god the father&quot; not as his father but as a god. He did not worship himself and did not ask to be worshiped. All the apostles agree that idolatry is bad even after jesus. Corinthians, jonah, john, isaiah, galatians... idolatry is repeatedly called out. Jesus says love the Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, mind, soul, and strength, which you obviously won&#039;t be able to do if you&#039;re split up having to worship marry and jesus and st suckit. You can&#039;t just cope about it and say that worshiping one is worshiping the other, either.", "time": 1675902969, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600189, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:37:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14600096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600096</a><br>Your usage of idol is so loose here that you could easily say the bible is an idol.", "time": 1675903040, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600203, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:41:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14600189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600189</a><br>A lot of christian do, in fact, treat the bible as an idol rather than the manual it&#039;s supposed to be.

The United Bible Societies (composed of the American Bible Society, The National Bible Society of Scotland, The Netherlands Bible Society, and the Wurttemberg Bible Society) appointed an international and interdenominational committee (but trinitarian, of course) of textual scholars to determine the most accurate text possible of the Greek New Testament.<br><br><br>To do this they examined hundreds of variations in the many thousands of ancient New Testament manuscripts and compared other existing texts by Westcott and Hort, Nestle, Bover, and Vogels.<br><br>n 1971 the UBS published A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament which explained why the committee had chosen certain readings as being correct and rejected others.", "time": 1675907353, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600593, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:49:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14600581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600581</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NWT</span><br>Jehovah&#039;s witness confirmed", "time": 1675907383, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600597, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:50:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14600589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600589</a><br> In choosing the text they believed to be closest to the original manuscript of the book of Hebrews, the UBS committee looked at the very oldest and best manuscripts still in existence today.

One, of course, is how many of the very oldest and best manuscripts agree.<br><br><br>Another method is to determine which of the variations were most likely to have been changed by later copyists. For instance, when a NT writer is referring to an OT quotation, he often has it worded slightly differently from the exact quote in the Septuagint (Paul is especially noted for this).<br><br><br>So, if one NT manuscript has an OT scripture quoted exactly as it appears in the Septuagint, and another has a slightly different wording, the manuscript that differs slightly is more likely to have the proper, original wording. (Later copyists strongly tended to \u201ccorrect\u201d the original NT manuscripts by making their OT quotes conform exactly to the wording in the Septuagint version.)<br><br><br>Another consideration is that later Church copyists would often change the wording of a scripture if it seemed to contradict a teaching of the Roman Church.[1] Therefore, if the wording of an ancient manuscript seems to contradict a later teaching of the Roman Church, it is more likely to have the original wording than another ancient manuscript which (at the same verse) seems to agree with that Church teaching.<br><br><a href=\"#p14600565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600565</a><br><a href=\"#p14600593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600593</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally 0 argument</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh jw boogeyman</span><br>Every time.", "time": 1675907414, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600600, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:50:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14595649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14595649</a><br>about 60%", "time": 1675907445, "resto": 14595649}, {"no": 14600602, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:51:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14600597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14600597</a><br>Using these criteria, the UBS Committee unanimously agreed with all the wording of Heb. 1:8 except for one word.

D. and certainly written well before it was popularly accepted through the efforts of such men as Augustine in the early 5th century) use the word autou which will not properly allow for the trinitarian-preferred interpretation.

(Matthew 17:5). There can be no higher validation than these. John says: \u201cIf we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God which He has testified of His Son.\u201d (I John 5:9). Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.<br><br>Jesus existed \u201cbefore the foundation of the world.\u201d (John 17:24). Then he became a man. (John 1:14). But God does not change. (Malachi 3:6). Jesus is a man. (John 8:40). But God is not a man (Numbers 23:19). Jesus died. But God cannot die. Jesus died but God raised him from the dead.<br><br>Jesus calls himself \u201cthe beginning of the creation of God.\u201d (Revelation 3:14). God confirms this, declaring to Jesus: \u201cYou are My Son, today I have begotten You.\u201d (Psalm 2:7). But the Father himself is not begotten. He has no beginning but is from everlasting. The psalmist declares: \u201cEven from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.\u201d (Psalm 90:2).<br><br>Jesus has a Father. But God has no Father. Jesus has a God. But there is no other God but God. Jesus says to Mary: \u201cI am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.\u201d (John 20:17).

A peasant could not leave the manor without permission from their lord. While under some forms of serfdom a lord could force you to fight, especially as time went on, this burden fell on freemen and later professional mercenaries. On the other hand it was not unheard of for villages to suffer raids from knights without wars to fight. Hunting was for nobles, a peasant could get in big trouble if they were caught hunting. Fishing however was OK. Most meat peasants ate was preserved. They did get some meat and fish but the vast majority of their diet was grain based.

These helmets were indispensable for the Greek hoplites, the famous foot soldiers of the phalanxes, as they were highly protective because they completely covered the headOften their crest was surmounted by a crest (lophos) with a horsehair plume. The one found is corroded and highly fragmented, but its discovery is extremely significant for historical purposes.

The word &quot;Ethnos&quot; is litterally a ethnic group, you might say this is a &quot;race&#039; , but that still doesn&#039;t cut it. Greeks used ethnos to signify basically a tribal group of people. However because Greeks spoke different dialects of Greek, and because they were never unified politically and defined their differences in what political systems they used there was never a Greek nation in the ethno-political sense nor exactly in the precice cultural sense. Rather the interesting thing with Greeks is that although they had no uniform national-ethnic identity , they certainly used a term as an exonym to define anyone who was not Greek, that is the &quot;barbarian&quot;. Thus this exonym was the defining factor, rather than defining the characteristics of a &quot;Greek race&quot;, since this would devolve into too many confusions. For example Plato says that the &quot;ideal&quot; Republic would be a unified &quot;Greek state&quot;, but that is mainly to protect the Greeks from being enslaved by barbarians. Thus the classical Greeks intellectuals did not recognize the inborn state of nationhood and polities of barbarians as some kind of natural political entity (like John Locke would argue), but as theologically opposed to them. This was not so different in how the Jews defined themselves against the &quot;idolatrus&quot; non-Jews.

It\u2019s no different than USA vs Canada or Sweden vs Norway or Spain vs Portugal or Australia vs New Zealand. The idea of modern Scottish freedom against the \u201ccrown\u201d or \u201croyalty\u201d is fairly new and recent. Even Aussies are slowly turning that way quicker than Canadians have. There\u2019s also a weird subconscious obsession with Scottish culture in America that might have to do with the wild frontier and the clan culture that formed from coming into contact with the Indian tribes. The bulk of Anglo Americans are from Wessex Anglo Saxons and Anglo Scottish Borders.", "time": 1675933785, "resto": 14592873}, {"no": 14602061, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)04:12:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14598119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14598119</a><br>Other than the Celtic larping, their wanting independence isn\u2019t refuted because they supported the English though.

No &quot;element of reality&quot; should be missing from the mathematical formalism of physics, i.e. relativistic quantum field theory or its more speculative extension, M-theory. On pain of magic, every gross property of the natural world must be theoretically reducible to fundamental physics. The Standard Model in physics is experimentally well tested. Within its conceptual framework, consciousness would seem not only causally impotent but physically impossible. Hence the &quot;explanatory gap&quot; and the Hard Problem of consciousness.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In recent years, a minority of researchers have proposed that the Hard Problem is an artifact of materialist metaphysics. Contra Kant, but following Schopenhauer, Bertrand Russell, Grover Maxwell, Michael Lockwood, Galen Strawson, et al., the new idealists conjecture that the phenomenology of one&#039;s mind reveals the intrinsic nature of the physical \u2013 the elusive &quot;fire&quot; in the equations about which physics is silent. Mathematical physics yields an exhaustive description of the relational-structural properties of the world. This description may ultimately be encoded by the universal wavefunction of post-Everetta quantum mechanics: our best mathematical description of reality. However, our presupposition that the intrinsic character of the physical lacks phenomenal properties is an additional metaphysical assumption. The assumption is hugely plausible, but it&#039;s not a scientific discovery. Perhaps most tellingly, the only part of the &quot;fire&quot; in the equations to which one ever enjoys direct access, i.e. one&#039;s own consciousness, discloses phenomenal properties that are inconsistent with a materialist ontology. For reasons unexplained, the natural world contains first-person facts. The world supports at least one non-zombie. And natural science gives no reason to believe that one is special.</span>", "filename": "David_Pearce", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1067, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675895865518705, "time": 1675895865, "md5": "rTLoH8hSTD9EjsVCeKT7LQ==", "fsize": 65961, "resto": 14599518}, {"no": 14599708, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)17:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "unbiblical", "time": 1675896312, "resto": 14599518}, {"no": 14599723, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)17:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14599558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14599558</a><br>We are in desperate need of a philosophy and religion board.

Firstly, to think of reality is God&#039;s dream seems more consistent with Hindu paganism than Christian theism. It seems to make God and man of a similar substance, but the central core of the prophets&#039; attack on paganism was that God was totally transcendent to this world. Furthermore, if his world is of a mental substance in that way, how is it distinct from the being of God? It seems to put us on the horns of a dilemma: either I am identified with God, or I do not really exist. Again, more like Hinduism. It also seems incoherent for God to incarnate in this system: what would it even mean for God to invade His own creation? It doesn&#039;t seem incarnational so much as avataric. This is without other inconsistencies with orthodox theology, such as when scripture says God breathed into man &quot;and he became a living soul&quot;, this seems to very clearly say that the body and spirit of man exist independent of each other.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Check out Bishop George Berkeley</span><br>Wasn&#039;t he an empiricist, and justified his idealism through his empiricism?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are objects in dreams material objects?</span><br>I think they are illusory<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They look like they&#039;re extended in space</span><br>I don&#039;t think reality is identical to sensation", "time": 1675921709, "resto": 14599518}, {"no": 14601695, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:07:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14601389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601389</a><br>kek<br><a href=\"#p14601599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601599</a><br>What does it mean to be material?

Another song that served as soundtrack to the immediate post-Tito years was Comrade Tito We Pledge Ourselves to You (Dru\u017ee Tito mi ti se kunemo), a song which had its origins in the Partisan period but which became a radio hit when covered by pop heartthrob Zdravko \u010coli\u0107 in 1977.

Judo is a type of jiujutsu that became a competition in this way, but it was adopted by police forces in many countries because its ability to subdue without killing the opponent made it suitable for the use of force by law enforcement agencies.", "time": 1675942820, "resto": 14601361}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14591004, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)22:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The fool thinks, \u201cI am the body.\u201d<br><br>The intelligent man thinks,<br>\u201cI am an individual soul united with the body.\u201d<br><br>But the wise man, in the greatness of his knowledge and<br>spiritual discrimination, sees the Self as the only reality,<br>and thinks, \u201cI am Brahman.\u201d<br><br>- Vivekachudamani", "filename": "Adi_shankara", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 864, "tn_w": 173, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675740042632761, "time": 1675740042, "md5": "inDsAJCehxBpFA1m+uH4kg==", "fsize": 257813, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-fool-thinks-i-am-the-body", "replies": 131, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 34, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 14591042, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)22:25:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t know, man, I heard the wise guy knows he don&#039;t know.

Since this is totally non-reciprocal, it&#039;s not an interaction. In the Hindu schools of Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya, the mind and intellect are made out of the subtle elements (tanmatras) which are capable of interacting causally with the physical world, experience takes place when this intellect and its workings receive or are bathed in the light of Brahman&#039;s awareness which itself stays unchanged.

By including mind in the real of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy, and are thereby able to directly initiate bodily motions. And, conversely, material objects are able to have genuine mental effects, as required by normal accounts of, say, the flow of information involved in perceptual awareness of the environment. The representational content of sensory experiences, such as those which attend perceiving the blueness of the sky or the pungent flavor of espresso, can now be treated as straightforward consequences of the physical environment&#039;s causal impingements upon the mind. </span><br>https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portal<wbr>files/portal/28892783/Schweizer_con<wbr>sciousness_and_space_1.pdf", "time": 1675786871, "resto": 14591004}, {"no": 14593148, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)11:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14593111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14593111</a><br>the universe is not an object, and oneness is a human concept, a mathematical abstraction. <br><br>If you are saying something is &quot;one&quot;, that always means there is some other &quot;one&quot; which is not the first one / they are not each other.

Napoleon committed plenty of atrocities, had a secret police, broke treaties, the whole nine yards, but his career and regime wasn&#039;t intrinsically tied to the atrocities the way the Nazis were. The Nazis weren&#039;t the Nazis without their hatred of Jews. It was an obsession in all their literature and speeches, you didn&#039;t get promoted within the regime unless you were also a rabid Jew hater, the atrocities were front and center for the Nazis in a way they never were for the French.<br><br>Also, it&#039;s because in Napoleon the tyrannical dictator and military genius were one and the same man. Napoleon demonstrated over and over again that he was an absolute tactical mastermind. That claim is often exaggerated of historical figures, but it&#039;s really hard to overstate how true it was of Napoleon in his prime. In Hitler&#039;s case, he made a couple good strategic decisions early on, but for the most part the tyrant and the military geniuses were separate people. Without his marshals, Napoleon would have been less but still incredibly formidable.

She walked over to me, with a handful of pubic hair, compacted into something resembling a large artist\u2019s paint-brush. She pushed this at my face. I raised my arm, several times, to deflect her hand; finally, unwilling to hurt her, or interfere with her any farther, I let her have her way. She stroked my face with the brush, gently, and said, like a child, \u201cisn\u2019t it soft?\u201d I looked at her ruined face and said, \u201cyes, Grandma, it\u2019s soft.</span>", "time": 1675569829, "resto": 14579849}, {"no": 14580130, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:04:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14580118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14580118</a><br>https://twitter.com/PatroniusArbitr<wbr>/status/1619771957175795713", "time": 1675569866, "resto": 14579849}, {"no": 14580253, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:33:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14579849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14579849</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YOU CAN&#039;T WRITE ABOUT YOUR BODY IN YOUR DIARY NOOOO</span>", "time": 1675571634, "resto": 14579849}, {"no": 14580260, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:35:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14580253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14580253</a><br>To the philosemite, Jews can do no wrong", "time": 1675571744, "resto": 14579849}, {"no": 14580264, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:36:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14580260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14580260</a><br>Unironically kys", "time": 1675571818, "resto": 14579849}, {"no": 14580271, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:38:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14580260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14580260</a><br>I have a feeling that anon would&#039;ve said the same thing no matter what her ethnic or racial background, and I agree.

Comets were the incidental spaceships of aryans, on impact creating accelerated localised abiogenesis. The process occured over a great, geological timespan. Hyperstitionally, they automatically took the form of hominid creatures, being that their potential for opposable thumbs meant that they were most likely to have an impact on the state of the planet. Then, as the weather cooled, the aryans went into hibernation/suspended animatio. During this time, buried under miles of ice, they underwent homogenous changes to their physiology. At the beginning of our current warming period, the aryans were thawed out of the ice by the warmth of the sun, revealing in it&#039;s rays the progenitors rich golden hair, striking eyes of opaline and mineral colors, and fair skin, as if to camoflague themselves in the world, the snow, from their internal solar blood, which in the beginning times, radiated through their skin, glowing, like sunrays. The ingenuinity and nobility of the aryan is the product of their deep dream cycles. <br>The aboriginals, similar to those of australia, were aryans whose comets splashed, rather than exploded. The aboriginals took the form of hominids, but, being located closer to the equator, and being distinguished from their phoenix bretheren, remained as caretakers of the development of the human race. What they saw happen while the the hyperboreans slept, drove them into a schizophrenic frenzy - the dream time - a congruent astral connection between the icy lands and the hot equatorial sun. The aboriginals, then, went into their own &#039;stone&#039; slumber upon the awakening of the hyperboreans. Thus, the races of man; those descended from aboriginals, and the aryans, who are so sparesely but thoroughly intermixed, that they have integrated into humanity as the few rare &#039;drivers&#039; of history, pulling the strings so as for history to appear as fate itself.", "time": 1675930393, "resto": 14597892}, {"no": 14601973, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)03:16:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14598439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14598439</a><br>Not african black, but pretty dark by our standards.

Only through these acts of obedience, as they call them, can we progress to higher levels of glory. The highest level being full exaltation to godhood and having an eternal family.

They do not believe in original sin because they say Jesus&#039;s suffering atoned for everyone&#039;s inheritance of Adam&#039;s sin as well as personal sin, hence why Mormons believe almost all humans Mormon or non-Mormon will at least go to a heaven.

Also, Northeast Asians are closer to Nganasans than they are to either Beringians, Native Americans or ancient Baikal populations, and the ANE affinity in East Asians is correlated well with their affinity with Nganasans (Supplementary Fig. 8).

In contrast, admixture modeling finds that no contemporary steppe-forest cline population is required to have additional ANE ancestry beyond what a mixture model of Bronze Age steppe plus present-day Eastern Eurasians can explain (Supplementary Table 5). This suggests that both western and eastern Eurasian ancestries of the steppe-forest populations are largely inherited from later gene flows since Late Bronze Age: Srubnaya-like WSH ancestry for the western Eurasian part and present-day Tungusic speaker-related ancestry for the eastern Eurasian part.

The same could be argued about Kets, Amerindians, etc. We have no way of knowing which percentages of their genes are determining which phenotypical traits because we&#039;re only figuring out their haplogroups and genetic distances from other samples, rather than figuring out which genes that they&#039;re carrying code for different physical features.", "time": 1675923963, "resto": 14596867}, {"no": 14601747, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14601651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601651</a><br><a href=\"#p14601743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14601743</a><br><br>Different genes code for different phenotypical traits, just because someone is genetically close to me it doesn&#039;t mean they are going to look the same as me.

It can go both ways.<br>If ANEs are the great Siberian mammoth hunters that contributed to European DNA and civilisation, surely it would show in their material culture? What does their appearance tell us about their intellectual capacity? It seems to me that they were one of many ancestral Paleolithic genetic groups that contributed to European and Siberian populations, and no single one of these is the &#039;key&#039; to European civilisation.
