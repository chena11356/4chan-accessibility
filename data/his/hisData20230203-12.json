The problem is that I don&#039;t know what his worship was like, but only his mythos.<br>The most famous one says that at the beginning of time there were two beings in the world, Tup\u00e3 and Jurupari, Tup\u00e3 was &quot;a kind of saint, a moral summit, devoted to doing good, who had very few followers&quot; and Jurupari was &quot;the incarnation of the devil who dedicated himself to partying, dancing, drinking, music and pleasure, who was followed by many people&quot;. Tup\u00e3 was jealous of Juripari and on an unlucky day he decided to burn him in a bonfire, so women followers of Jurupari came to collect his ashes, but instead they found a palm tree that they felled and used to make flutes that reproduced Jurupari&#039;s voice. Women used these magic flutes at parties where they got drunk and danced erotically with men. The Sun sent Jurupari to be reborn on Earth through a virgin and he became a lawgiver very similar to Moses among the natives who transformed their matriarchal society into a patriarchal one.

After Jesus was born, some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem. They asked people, \u201cWhere is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? We saw the star that shows he was born. We saw it rise in the sky in the east and have come to worship him.\u201d When King Herod heard about this, it upset him as well as everyone else in Jerusalem. Herod called a meeting of all the leading Jewish priests and teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah would be born. They answered, \u201cIn the town of Bethlehem in Judea, just as the prophet wrote: \u2018Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are important among the rulers of Judah. Yes, a ruler will come from you, and that ruler will lead Israel, my people.\u2019\u201d Then Herod had a private meeting with the wise men from the east. He learned from them the exact time they first saw the star. Then he sent them to Bethlehem. He said, \u201cGo and look carefully for the child. When you find him, come tell me. Then I can go worship him too.\u201d After the wise men heard the king, they left. They saw the same star they had seen in the east, and they followed it. The star went before them until it stopped above the place where the child was. They were very happy and excited to see the star. The wise men came to the house where the child was with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened the boxes of gifts they had brought for him. They gave him treasures of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. But God warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they went home to their own country a different way. After the wise men left, an angel from the Lord came to Joseph in a dream. The angel said, \u201cGet up! Take the child with his mother and escape to Egypt. Herod wants to kill the child and will soon start looking for him.

That&#039;s been the argument for centuries. A strong central government is a tradeoff, and as against it as I am I will admit that the upside is being able to create a strong, coordinated national response in times of crisis.<br><br>I believe that the harms of a strong central government tend to outweigh the benefits. The characteristics that make a government ill equipped to tackle large-scale problems like climate change, pandemic or foreign invasion, are the ones that shield the people against government misuse of that power--say, involvement in unnecessary foreign wars (cough, cough, Vietnam), gross infringements of individual liberties nationwide (assault weapon bans, the War on Drugs, the NSA and illegal surveillance just to name a few) and gross misallocation of tax revenue motivated by short-term political strategy rather than the long-term interest of the nation (agricultural and energy subsidies come to mind). The real-world harm that has been done to us by those things--and it is a lot of harm, just because it has been normalized in the public opinion today doesn&#039;t make it okay--is not worth the benefit.<br><br>The other problem with a strong national government is that it causes everyone to think nationally on all issues. The whole fucking point of having states is an acknowledgement that people living in different regions in the US want to be governed differently. No one in California wants to live under the same rules that they want in Kentucky, for cultural as well as material reasons. But with a strong national government--especially since the Civil War--activists on all issues skip straight to the federal level on issues that really ought to be handled by the state. Abortion, marijuana, all kinds of shit really should be handled at the state level but instead you have California liberals and Kentucky conservatives fighting over having one policy on the issue for the entire nation.

The most appropriate ways for a state to tax are on the consumption of goods, because you can&#039;t dodge or cheat your way out of that as easily as you can with income, and on property. For income you can take your income as stocks or some other instruments and use all kinds of loopholes and writeoffs to make it not appear as &quot;income&quot; in a traditional sense, it&#039;s way simpler to say that any time anyone pays anyone else for a good or a service, the government takes a (tiny) percent of that transaction. And for property, I believe that the government is justified in taxing property because it&#039;s a finite resource that&#039;s inherently part of the nation. Your real estate isn&#039;t &quot;yours&quot; the same way your car or your microwave or your toothbrush is, because no matter what you want it&#039;s still a part of the geographic area that is America.

You win voters by increasing subsidies, but never by rolling them back, unless they&#039;re budget hawks in which case the right has them in the bag anyway and doesn&#039;t feel the need to pander to them.<br><br>First of all, I think subsidies are not a legitimate use of taxpayer money. It should not be a role of government to take money from the people and distribute it to industry to prop those industries up or alter the spending patterns of citizens. <br><br>But more importantly, the subsidies are causing real-world harm--most notably corn. Because the corn industry is now incentivized to grow a shit fucking pile of corn, they turn it into high fructose corn syrup and put it in all our fucking food. You can make a convincing case linking agricultural subsidies to the obesity epidemic. Also, they put ethanol in our gas, which was not great for automobiles until they were designed specifically for it, is terrible for small engines, and reduces the shelf-stability of the gas. It environmental benefits--supposedly why it was introduced to begin with--are negligible, because it reduces efficiency as much as it cleans up pollution, making you burn more gas to get places.

The site was a human-edited web directory, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, &quot;Jerry and David&#039;s Guide to the World Wide Web&quot; was renamed &quot;Yahoo!&quot; and became known as the Yahoo Directory. The &quot;yahoo.com&quot; domain was registered on January 18, 1995. The word &quot;yahoo&quot; is a backronym for &quot;Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle&quot; or &quot;Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle&quot;. The term &quot;hierarchical&quot; described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term &quot;oracle&quot; was intended to mean &quot;source of truth and wisdom&quot;, and the term &quot;officious&quot;, rather than being related to the word&#039;s normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a &quot;yahoo&quot; (used by college students in David Filo&#039;s native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): &quot;rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.&quot; This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver&#039;s Travels. Yahoo was incorporated on March 2, 1995. In 1995, a search engine function, called Yahoo Search, was introduced. This allowed users to search Yahoo Directory.

The 12th Congressional district of California was then held by Democrat Jerry Voorhis, a convinced New Dealer who&#039;d rode into office a decade earlier on the coattails of FDR&#039;s landslide 1936 reelection. The son of the Nash Motors president, Voorhis was a dilettante and not much of a hands-on politician--he hated wheeling and dealing and the more dirty side of politics. An avid writer and thinker, he authored three long-forgotten books on monetary reform, one of his pet subjects, and he eagerly supported all vaguely left-of-center causes. Skilled at marketing himself to whatever constituents he was addressing, he could don a straw hat and sandals and smoke a pipe as he sat down on a street corner to chat with Mexican farm workers, and the next day wear a suit and tie as he spoke to a businessman&#039;s club.<br><br>Despite having a rather negligible voting record and being a vague, long-winded speaker who seldom got a clear point across, Voorhis was easily reelected four times against tomato can Republican opponents and had no idea how to face an actual challenger. By 1946, the times were changing and California voters wanted to put the New Deal behind them. Shortages, rationing, and top-down government management had outstayed their welcome, and the five term Congressman might be vulnerable.

This was unfair because these people were never the majority of the PAC, and Voorhis himself was relatively moderate in his views and openly disavowed communists.<br><br>By late October, most of the newspapers in the 12th district had endorsed Nixon, including the powerful Los Angeles Times. Nixon did not repeat the mistakes of past Republicans who ran against Voorhis, most of whom championed abstract right wing talking points with no real, practical message that would appeal to voters. Nixon for comparison openly talked of the disorder gripping California in the aftermath of V-J Day and its effect on people&#039;s daily lives.

Nonetheless, Locke adhered to the Protestant doctrine of &quot;sola Scriptura,&quot; according to which the Scriptures contain all that is needed for salvation. Thus, he always made sure that his conclusions were consistent with, and indeed grounded in, Scripture) The Intrinsic theory of value an erroneous central concept of capitalism was developed by Adam Smith a Calvinist that was heavily influenced by the doctrine (Adam Smith as Theologian. Paul oslington), his successors in the Classical economics make things even worse saying that the economic value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of \u201csocially necessary labor\u201d required to produce it. This of course is central to Marxist theory and we all know how disastrous Marxism has been.

Both class and ethnic-based accents are derided due to their associated status, typically with wealth and power. In Australia, three class accents exist, Broad, mostly spoken by working class suburbanites and rural people (think Steve Irwin), General, mostly spoken by middle class urbanites and suburbanites (think Hugh Jackman); and Cultivated, spoken mostly by those deridedly called the &#039;bunyip aristocracy&#039;, typically generationally wealthier people (think Geoffrey Rush or PM Malcolm Turnbull). <br>People here will associate class origin with these accents, being able to to tell new money from those who were born into it, etc. On top of this, you&#039;ve got slight variations owing to the subtle nature of our regional accents, and stereotypes associated with each state. Queensland is regarded as the more uncouth state, and make an odd noise when pronouncing anything word with &#039;-ool&#039;, as &#039;-ewl&#039;, so pool become pewl. South Australians are typically mocked for wanting to seem fancier but are one of the more working-class states, and pronounce dance with an &#039;a&#039; sound like palm, whereas the rest pronounce dance as dantz. <br>Then you&#039;ve also got the various accents associated with ethnicity. You&#039;ve got the Ethnic or &#039;Wog&#039; accent, mostly spoken by peoples of Mediterranean descent, this accent is typically associated with crime, or occasionally ignorance, mostly due to many being of working class origin, with those having reached the middle or upper echelons in a generation or two and still being new money. Then you&#039;ve got Asian Australian accents, Pacific Islander accents, Aboriginal Australian accents, and now even an African Australian accent. Most of these are associated with working class backgrounds, and many who want to progress in a profession tend to make their accent more General Australian so as to seem less foreign, ironically, even when the office is of a diverse background too.", "time": 1675395160, "resto": 14568321}, {"no": 14570805, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:36:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14568321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14568321</a><br><a href=\"#p14570799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14570799</a><br>This guy&#039;s a somewhat known comedian who I find explains the accents well.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH<wbr>4ZQH_3_pE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc<wbr>hzw5yL9xo</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF<wbr>dL_jmJE-A</span><br>I wanna add, the Aboriginal accent isn&#039;t considered a working class one, it&#039;s considered the as beneath that, an almost unemployed accent if you will.
