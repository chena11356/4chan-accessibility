(The Neolithic was the last period of the Stone Age, and metal tools didn&#039;t exist.) The boatwrights left four transverse stripes of oak, an inch or so high, at intervals along the floor. Those must have acted as ribs to strengthen and stabilize the canoe. Three trapezoidal blocks of wood with holes pierced in them were also found loose in the bottom of the canoe; they may have been used for fastening sails\u2014though the only direct evidence are a few small fragments of fabric found nearby. &quot;These people navigated up and down the Mediterranean,&quot; Fugazzola believes. &quot;They knew about sails.&quot; They may also have fastened two canoes together to make a catamaran, she says, with a deck of planks. With or without sails, as a catamaran or a monohull, there is no doubt the settlers&#039; canoe was seaworthy, not just lake-worthy. Several years ago, a team of Czech archaeologists led by Radomir Tichy built a copy of it, using replicas of Neolithic stone tools. They proceeded to sail their dugout nearly 500 miles along the Mediterranean coast, from Italy to Portugal. Head winds forced them ashore on occasion.

They cultivated flax to make linen. They planted opium poppies, and whether they used the opium for medicinal or ritual purposes, or maybe just for fun, is difficult to say. Fugazzola has some evidence that they made wine too. It was a big village\u2014Fugazzola&#039;s surveys suggest it covered more than five acres. The 3,000 pali, or oak posts, she has found so far give an idea of the scale of the place. The people lived in rectangular houses held up by those posts. The houses were roughly six by eight meters, or 20 by 26 feet, though Fugazzola is now excavating a 32-foot-long building. (It may have served a ritual function; the goddess statuette was found there.) The six or so houses she has dug up so far appear to have been laid out on a single street, which may have been joined at right angles by little alleys. &quot;It was a well-organized village,&quot; she says. &quot;There was a plan. It wasn&#039;t just a hut here and a hut there.&quot; She guesses that maybe 500 people lived at La Marmotta.

They had brains as large as Homo sapiens today and had traits that were deemed intermediate between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens, which could suggest that they might be either a transitional species akin to Homo heidelbergensis in Europe and Asia, or a closely related sister species to our pre-Sapiens, post &quot;Neandersovasapiens&quot; ancestors.", "filename": "Bodo_cranium", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1023, "h": 1334, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672824333599995, "time": 1672824333, "md5": "VNoKEH9YljsacUJXqhy5zA==", "fsize": 107259, "resto": 14412265}, {"no": 14419442, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)04:35:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14419396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14419396</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m really curious to know if there has been actual study on uniquely African inheritance of ancestral hominid traits.</span><br><br>Oh, I thought you were asking this in bad faith.

This quickly resulted in four front-page stories in the Daily Princetonian, a major article in the New York Observer, and extensive national coverage in both the New York Times and the Chronicle of Higher Education.108 These articles included denunciations of Princeton\u2019s long historical legacy of anti-Semitism and quickly led to official apologies, followed by an immediate 30 percent rebound in Jewish numbers. During these same years, non-Jewish white enrollment across the entire Ivy League had dropped by roughly 50 percent, reducing those numbers to far below parity, but this was met with media silence or even occasional congratulations on the further \u201cmulticultural\u201d progress of America\u2019s elite education system.</span><br>lmao", "time": 1672807583, "resto": 14410964}, {"no": 14418759, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)23:54:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14418741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14418741</a><br>Elite universities like Harvard draw students from all over the US, maybe the overrepresentation of Jews is in fact one of the factor decreasing the % of non local students.<br>The idea that higher verbal IQ is the only reason of overrepresentation is convenient but it relies on assuming the highest values you can find are true and that somehow only verbal IQ matters.<br>Also it doesn&#039;t explain the discrepancy between enrollment and high performing students which according to the source the graph comes from are a similar sample size to Ivy league undergraduates:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyway, the numbers alone render this explanation implausible.

Consider the ratio of the recent 2007\u20132011 enrollment of Asian students at Harvard relative to their estimated share of America\u2019s recent NMS semifinalists, a reasonable proxy for the high-ability college-age population, and compare this result to the corresponding figure for whites. The Asian ratio is 63 percent, slightly above the white ratio of 61 percent, with both these figures being considerably below parity due to the substantial presence of under-represented racial minorities such as blacks and Hispanics, foreign students, and students of unreported race. Thus, there appears to be no evidence for racial bias against Asians, even excluding the race-neutral impact of athletic recruitment, legacy admissions, and geographical diversity.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, if we separate out the Jewish students, their ratio turns out to be 435 percent, while the residual ratio for non-Jewish whites drops to just 28 percent, less than half of even the Asian figure. As a consequence, Asians appear under-represented relative to Jews by a factor of seven, while non-Jewish whites are by far the most under-represented group of all, despite any benefits they might receive from athletic, legacy, or geographical distribution factors. The rest of the Ivy League tends to follow a similar pattern, with the overall Jewish ratio being 381 percent, the Asian figure at 62 percent, and the ratio for non-Jewish whites a low 35 percent, all relative to their number of high-ability college-age students.</span>", "time": 1672815289, "resto": 14410964}, {"no": 14419064, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:57:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14419063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14419063</a><br>more<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Just as striking as these wildly disproportionate current numbers have been the longer enrollment trends. In the three decades since I graduated Harvard, the presence of white Gentiles has dropped by as much as 70 percent, despite no remotely comparable decline in the relative size or academic performance of that population; meanwhile, the percentage of Jewish students has actually increased. This period certainly saw a very rapid rise in the number of Asian, Hispanic, and foreign students, as well as some increase in blacks.

But Americans of English, Welsh, Scottish, Swedish, and Catholic Irish ancestry also have fairly high mean IQs of 104 or above, and their combined populations outnumber Jews by almost 15-to-1, implying that they would totally dominate the upper reaches of the white American ability distribution, even if we excluded the remaining two-thirds of all American whites, many of whose IQs are also fairly high. Furthermore, all these groups are far less highly urbanized or affluent than Jews,67 probably indicating that their scores are still artificially depressed to some extent. We should also remember that Jewish intellectual performance tends to be quite skewed, being exceptionally strong in the verbal subcomponent, much lower in math, and completely mediocre in visuospatial ability; thus, a completely verbal-oriented test such as Wordsum would actually tend to exaggerate Jewish IQ.</span>", "time": 1672819281, "resto": 14410964}, {"no": 14419196, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)03:01:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14419171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14419171</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are lol</span><br>no they aren&#039;t.

I don&#039;t think any side of the political spectrum likes this much, but the traditional inception of &quot;democracy&quot; was with Cleisthenes reforms in Athens. Cleisthenes was responding to the fallout of the overthrow of the Peisistratids. The Peisistratids were the family of the tyrant of Athens Pisistratis, who installed himself not long after Solon&#039;s reforms. &quot;Tyranny&quot; back then wasn&#039;t as loaded as it is now, to be a tyrant was merely to be a ruler outside the bounds of normal law or constitutional order. But tyrants weren&#039;t always perceived as de facto &quot;bad&quot;. While they were understood to be ultimately illegitimate under normal law, tyrants were often understood to be agents of divine intervention to set right a rotting political culture. So sometimes tyrants were considered necessary or even agents of justice, but they were still doomed to die or be expelled in order to return the city to lawfullness.<br><br>So the repressed thing here is that Pisistratis was actually considered a good governor, and he was largely a popular one because he favored common farmers and such. He maintained his rule until he died, and his sons were overthrown by some angry aristocrats. Cleisthenes was basically tasked with doing what Solon did but more effectively, so another tyrant wouldn&#039;t arise. He set about changing the political divisions of the state from old tribal divisions to more arbitrary geographic ones resembling census districts (the &quot;demes&quot;), basically jumbling the tribes together. The move was to weaken kinship ties and create more loyal ties to the state as &quot;citizens&quot;. A part of this process was deciding who was and was not a &quot;real&quot; Athenian, and the question was won by the Athenian movement for autochthonism. The majority was allowed to vote on whether you were a real Athenian, and if they voted no you were enslaved. <br><br>Cont.", "time": 1672782637, "resto": 14413994}, {"no": 14417165, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)16:56:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14417085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14417085</a><br>Monarchs during the Middle Ages didn\u2019t have that kind of power.

There was a lot of immigration into Athens due to the propserity and Pisistratis welcomed it and used it to help bolster his power. So the Athenian democracy partially responded to this immigration and the existence of a larger populace by allowing for votes on enslaving people to properly define Athenian citizenship. This is an unhappy history for liberal democrats who profess a love for democracy, because ironically the democracy and its emphasis on &quot;real Athenians&quot; was also used as an argument for essentially the racial superiority of Athenians. In order to bind Athenians together in a civic identity, the concept was promulgated that Athenians had lived in Athens for a very long time, were &quot;of the land&quot;, and were more pure than other Greeks. So Athenians were justified in dominating the impure Greeks. This has parallels with the creation of white identity in the colonial Era, the thing that made a bunch of disparate European colonists start to identify with the colonial project instead of their other identities. <br><br>So you can see why this seems contrary to liberal democratic values, why do they love democracy so much? Well for one they repress all of this about democracy, they just take for granted that there are states and citizens and &quot;the people should rule its only fair&quot;, but the REASON they repress this is because they are afraid of the alternative. They&#039;re still implicitly afraid of the tyrant, they&#039;re afraid of the popular tyrant that turns the power of the state and &quot;people&quot; against them. The concept of democracy is how the more aristocratic and powerful families win the loyalty of the groups of people they want to protect them from a tyranny. <br>Cont.", "time": 1672783341, "resto": 14413994}, {"no": 14417212, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:06:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14413994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14413994</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Democracy fucking sucks.</span><br>It does.

Let me describe the barbarian&#039;s appearance more particularly \u2013 he was so tall in stature that he overtopped the tallest by nearly one cubit, narrow in the waist and loins, with broad shoulders and a deep chest and powerful arms. And in the whole build of the body he was neither too slender nor overweighted with flesh, but perfectly proportioned and, one might say, built in conformity with the canon of Polycleitus. His skin all over his body was very white, and in his face the white was tempered with red. His hair was yellowish, but did not hang down to his waist like that of the other barbarians; for the man was not inordinately vain of his hair, but had it cut short to the ears. Whether his beard was reddish, or any other colour I cannot say, for the razor had passed over it very closely and left a surface smoother than chalk... His blue eyes indicated both a high spirit and dignity; and his nose and nostrils breathed in the air freely; his chest corresponded to his nostrils and by his nostrils... the breadth of his chest. For by his nostrils nature had given free passage for the high spirit which bubbled up from his heart. A certain charm hung about this man but was partly marred by a general air of the horrible.

Faced with low voter turnout to the Parliament in Strasbourg, the blue and gold flag was lifted from the (unrelated) Council of Europe of 1949, with its nearly fifty members, and ceremonially displayed whenever and wherever bureaucratically possible; Beethoven\u2019s music to Schiller\u2019s \u2018Ode to Joy\u2019 was adopted as an official anthem; a pantheon of Founders created to baptise squares, buildings, chairs. Euro coins with appropriate symbols were minted; European values declaimed; European \u2018criteria\u2019 for accession codified. All attempts to give a cultural and historical grounding to the political construct of the Union, however, remain somewhat arbitrary so long as it still does not actually encompass geographical Europe.

To become engaged, it needs conflict and drama, but the Union proceeds by consensus. In the past, de-dramatisation of the European project was a great merit of the Commission \u2013 Monnet\u2019s \u2018flight from history into bureaucracy\u2019 was far-sighted, allowing Brussels to operate out of sight on economic issues after more ambitious schemes like the European Defence Community collapsed. Meetings of the Council are more visible, but in these too disagreements are muffled. So the public still has its doubts about the project. But it is necessary to be realistic. In an existing democracy, citizens come first, electing representatives who come into being at their decision. But the foundation of a democracy reverses this order: first come the representatives, who speak before they are appointed to be such, then come those whom they will represent in the polity they found ...

They are the largest Church in the Oriental Orthodox communion, they gained independence from the Coptic Orthodox Church in the 1950s.

Their devotion to the Holy Trinity is extremely strong, maybe more so than any other form of Christianity. Mary is venerated very highly for being the Mother of God. They have a clergy made up of bishops, priests, and deacons, as well as itinerant folk healers called Debtera (who are in almost all cases deacons) who do exorcism and heal people from their sicknesses (imitating Jesus). Some of the debteras, especially those that do magic, compete with the clergy in the Church. They believe the Ethiopian nation was founded by the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, King Menilek. They claim to have the Ark of the Covenant hidden in one of their churches, but the clergy hide it out of fear for its powers (described in the Hebrew Bible) so every church in Ethiopia has a replica of the ark, but only one of those arks is the true ark but no one knows which. Their Biblical canon is the largest in the world with 81 books, they use the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, the Didascalia, and more as scripture. Their most important festival (other than Faska/Easter of course) is Timket/Theophany, it celebrates the Baptism of Jesus and happens January 19th, 13 days after Orthodox Christmas. Ethiopian Orthodox follow some of the dietary laws of the Torah, like avoiding pork. Many also practice circumcision and keep the sabbath, keep women out of church during menstruation, and remove their shoes when in a sacred space.", "filename": "83383162_2488267694758803_5518604968984051712_o", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 768, "h": 960, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672762682847602, "time": 1672762682, "md5": "meKz0E6BSlnLoucRuCvoeA==", "fsize": 174919, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "thoughts-on-the-ethiopian-orthodox-tewahedo", "replies": 23, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 17}, {"no": 14415862, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)11:19:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Please use paragraphs next time.<br><br>Anyway, they have the book of Enoc as canon, which is kino.", "filename": "454660_1_ftc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 454, "h": 728, "tn_w": 77, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672762784689299, "time": 1672762784, "md5": "1evmfpQXEg7iy6SGr28aUQ==", "fsize": 133632, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14415867, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)11:20:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14415854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14415854</a><br>I like them", "time": 1672762816, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417353, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:44:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1672785857, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417392, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:51:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14415854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14415854</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The term &quot;Tewahedo&quot; means &quot;Unified&quot;</span><br>sounds like Tawhid, Semitic languages are cool :)", "time": 1672786284, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417404, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:55:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14415854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14415854</a><br>Aren&#039;t they the denomination with the most books in the bible?", "time": 1672786502, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417499, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)18:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14415854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14415854</a><br>nigga aksum bout it", "time": 1672788000, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417506, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)18:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14415854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14415854</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Their devotion to the Holy Trinity is extremely strong, maybe more so than any other form of Christianity</span><br>What does this mean, how does it show in practice.", "time": 1672788114, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417668, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)19:03:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "look at their birth rates in comparison to the muslims in the country. combine that with the tigray war/crisis and amhara genocide in addition to their irreligious diaspora\u2026", "time": 1672790622, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417682, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)19:06:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ethiopian </span><br>It\u2019s Abyssinian chud", "time": 1672790773, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417712, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)19:13:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14415862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14415862</a><br>They quite literally saved both Enoch and Jubilees from being lost.", "time": 1672791197, "resto": 14415854}, {"no": 14417719, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)19:14:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14417392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14417392</a><br>Yes it is cognate.
