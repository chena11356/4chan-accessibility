That was back before mass media really dizzied the public, but it\u2019s like that whole movement just disappeared overnight. What really gets me is how modern politics seems to be divided straight down the middle, and it almost justifies governmental stalemates. Picrel, older elections had clearer majorities. Now, elections are won on 51%/49% margins, which is to say that half the people are going to be upset regardless of who wins. If I had to guess, the break up of older social groups caused all those once-unified members to identify with whichever party sponsors their issue of choice (divide and conquer).

African Americans becoming Christian was a major convergence of two seemingly opposite cultures, and it could only be managed by focusing on immaterial qualities, such as humans (especially Americans) wanting freedom.

Hello?), manwhas/webtoons (they make good comics, I give you that, even better than most current mangas, I&#039;d say), doramas (just watched Squid Game) and movies (watched Parasite and a heart-wrenching movie about deaf kids and some rape history.)", "time": 1673498345, "resto": 14455635}, {"no": 14455880, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)23:46:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14455855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14455855</a><br>Honestly, I just started from a fascination with Hangul.

The problem is he actually pisses off a lot of historians because the history is all over the place. He&#039;s mixing in bronze age with 16th century at times and it makes no sense. The worst part about A Song of Ice and Fire is that characters do not think or act medieval but rather they think and act more modern without a faint of morality or religion. Much of the themes of family read like a lecture of the patriarchy. The books will have you believe that medieval women in the nobility were so oppressed when in fact historically women in the gentry had a immense amount of power. It&#039;s really quite silly to believe that a world with long winters would in any way function like our own or be a possible explanation why they have been functioning in the middle ages for thousands upon thousands of years. Which brings me to one of the most stupid concepts in the books being that medieval families are able to say so homogenized for generations with the same holdings longer than some of the longest medieval families in history.

BAC was mostly R1a. But late Neolithic Scandinavia, some parts were 100% R1b. How can this be? Maybe technological advantages, maybe generations of hatred, those R1a were constantly pushing into lands long conquered by R1b for centuries. The fact is it wasn&#039;t so clear cut. It varies region by region for centuries, R1a and R1b in a struggle for dominance in the peninsula.<br><br>If Koryos-type traditions existed, which, they absolutely did, having to recite the story of your ancestors from memory in weird psychedelic rituals before going out into the world (to become like a predator upon it) it does certain things to your how you see the world forever. So if I1 was from a Battle Axe Culture-like population, in every generation they were reciting what happened, how the R1b Beakers took the lands, raped everyone including the PWC hunters who the BAC lived with side by side for almost a millennia, etc. The same SHG-like populations I1 may have come from. So just feeding into generations of unfathomable ancestral hatred, plus possibly bringing some technological advantages with them. <br><br>If I1 was from the Western Mediterranean in the middle/late bronze age and has no SHG-origin as some have speculated recently, that only throws off my guess slightly. Have you ever wondered why no Germanic culture has a &quot;smith god&quot; like basically every other IE culture? Sure they shoehorned dwarves into the myths but that&#039;s not what I mean. In the mind of this I1-dominant culture pushing into Scandinavia certain norms were simply over, no more stone tool regressions due to trade breakdowns, no more arsenic bronze to make your best craftsmen diseased mutants, nothing fake and gay anymore.

There\u2019s nothing inherently gay about being promiscuous, but being gay makes you inherently promiscuous (and thus prone to high-risk of STD behavior).<br>Like I said, homosexuality is less about liking men than it is about liking sex.

I\u2019d go so far as to say women are never fully gay (in the Kinsey sense), so its safe exclude them from this concept. Since men are the only true homosexuals, the female lack of libido isn\u2019t proof against homosexuality being a different name (or subset of) hypersexuality. If a woman was \u201chypersexual,\u201d she could easily find a heterosexual partner; a man could not, so he embeds this (destructive) idea in his mind that sex with men is normal. It\u2019s such a deep-seated idea that he\u2019ll say he\u2019s \u201cborn this way,\u201d as if that logic would apply to anything else about him. Even personality/temperament changes over time. In truth, the man just wanted to fuck something, and homosexuality developed later as his fetish for men (he was born hypersexual). <br><br>By you saying there\u2019s a strong discrepancy between male and female sex drives, you imply that men are more sexual; therefore, sex with men is a strategy to be able to have more sex (as a man)<br><br>In conclusion: you\u2019re not gay, you\u2019re a sex addict with a fetish for men, which correlates to having more diseases.

Many people have been taught that the second of the Ten Commandments prohibits icons. However, if correct, all artistic representations of anything would be forbidden. The Lord Himself in the same book of Exodus commanded Moses to make two gold cherubim (angels) \u201cof hammered work,\u201d and to place them at each end of the mercy seat on the ark of the covenant (Ex 25:17\u201321). The Lord also stipulated that the ten curtains of the tabernacle be woven with images of cherubim on them (Ex 26:1), and likewise the veil (Ex 26:31).<br><br>When King Solomon built the temple, the huge basin, or \u201csea,\u201d was set upon twelve statues of oxen (3Kg 7:13, 30). And upon the ten bases of the sea were cast or engraved \u201clions, oxen, and cherubim\u201d (3Kg 7:16), as well as palm trees (3Kg 7:22). The Lord bestowed His blessing upon all these artistic representations first by filling the new temple with His Glory (3Kg 8:10, 11), and then by declaring to Solomon, \u201cI have consecrated this house which you have built to put My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually\u201d (3Kg 9:3).<br><br>Perhaps a most striking example of an image made at God\u2019s command in the Old Testament is the bronze serpent that God ordered Moses to make and put on a pole in order to protect the Hebrews bitten by the deadly serpents (Nm 21:4\u20139; see Jn 3:14, 15). Hundreds of years later, when the Israelites were offering incense to this same bronze serpent in a kind of idol-worship, King Hezekiah, who \u201cdid what was right in the sight of the Lord,\u201d had the serpent smashed into pieces (4Kg 18:3, 4).<br><br>Part1", "filename": "25DF1496-08C7-4F0D-BDC6-575899ECCFCC", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1046, "h": 1279, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673626848495184, "time": 1673626848, "md5": "+aGoiGbjiXSZ5ExbJ2Jt6w==", "fsize": 481910, "resto": 14463237}, {"no": 14463255, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)11:21:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14463249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14463249</a><br>So it is not the image itself which is faulty or prohibited, but rather its improper use. The prohibition in Exodus 20:4 is not against all artistic representations. Rather, it is against images, whether in human form or not, which would be worshipped as gods and goddesses\u2014\u201cgods of silver, and gods of gold\u201d (Ex 20:23). For the Lord knew that such images would tempt the Hebrews to depart from worshipping Him, the One true God (Ex 20:3\u20135).<br><br>Certainly, before the invisible and limitless Lord God of Israel became incarnate, it was impossible to make an image of Him. However, after God the Son assumed a visible and tangible human body, it was natural and beneficial for the Church to create artistic representations of Him\u2014and of His holy Mother, and of the saints and angels\u2014from the earliest times. According to tradition, St. Luke the Evangelist made at least three icons of Christ and His Mother.<br><br>Every image, or icon , of Christ has significant theological content. For it proclaims anew the Incarnation of God, who \u201cbecame flesh\u201d for our salvation (Jn 1:14). Recognized icons of our Savior, prayerfully made, provide us with inspired, trustworthy representations of Him.<br><br>The Seventh Ecumenical Council, held in Nicea in AD 787, condemned the heresy of iconoclasm (the rejection, and even destruction, of icons). These Holy Fathers articulated the critical distinction between the worship reserved for God alone, and the veneration/honor/ reverence given to the icons. In addition, this Council declared that \u201cthe honor given to the image passes on to that which the image represents.\u201d<br><br>Through icons, Orthodox Christians are drawn closer to Christ.

Ibn Sina/Avicenna even postulated that the desire to be a bottom was a disease caused by an itchy anus, which was also satisfied by being fucked in the ass. Western influence also play a big role during the colonial period, European Christians were far less accepting and the laws they put in place as well as the Muslims influenced by them became less tolerant as a result. Salafism/Wahhabism only made things worse as they sought to fix what they saw as corruptions to the religion of Muhammad, and actually instituting punishments like being thrown from roof tops that had never really been used.

Within just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the &quot;National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy&quot; and the campaign for &quot;Compulsory Free Education in Iraq,&quot; and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers.

Now it&#039;s argued that only one thing is self-existent. But if you consider the nature of pure Chaos, it&#039;s obvious that if anything is self-existent, it&#039;s chaos. I believe this for more complicated reasons, but it&#039;s obvious from the fact that Chaos is precisely that which is uncaused, and whatever needs no cause is clearly able to actualize itself from only potentiality. Now Chaos is nothing more than an manifold of infinite interconnected things. Basically, through Proclean metaphysics of participation of Unity and other arguments, I can show that pure chaos is identical to the One, that is, the absolute manifold is identical to the absolute Unity. So in the end, the One and Chaos are both self existent, which only contradicts the principle that there can only be one self existent thing until you realize that the One and Chaos are the same. <br><br>it&#039;s just modal collapse. at first it seems that only what is potentially self existent can actualize itself from potentiality, but then you realize that potentiality = actuality in all cases due to the modal collapse implied by G\u00f6del&#039;s ontological argument.<br><br>Now, do to the tautological nature of evolution, as soon as absolute chaos exists, it will start to refine itself into more stable states that exist temporarily. This causes us to evolve the illusion of time, and our locality and this illusion of time is what causes us to perceive a difference between Chaos and the One, when in fact they are the same. We perceive stages on the evolution of the One, we perceive it&#039;s explosion into chaos and it&#039;s refinement back into the One as separate, when in fact they are simultaneous.

God certainly can&#039;t have conceptualized them from the nature he supposedly willed into being, and he can&#039;t have gotten them from the formspace he must have willed too.

Without a market to allocate goods</span><br>Even from a Marxist perspective, the marketplace is fair though. You buy and sell at a price reflecting cost of production into that price. The capitalist provides goods and reasonable prices according to what they&#039;re worth, and the worker exchanges their labor power to the capitalist for what it costs to reproduce it. This is sort of where the liberal analysis ends, though. The liberal analysis just sees the transaction, decides it&#039;s fair, and moves on. The billionaire contributes his capital, the worker contributes his labor, commodities are produced, and then exchanged for fair prices. Everything is fair and everyone is happy!<br><br>But Where the Marxist criticism comes in is that focusing purely on the marketplace only focuses on a relationship between things bought and sold on the market, but ignores the social relationships between the people themselves.

Many of the senior officers in the Imperial Japanese Army were natives of Choshu, and this lead to tensions with the Imperial Japanese Navy, where men from Satsuma occupied the top jobs. The two domains had a long traditional enmity, and this continued as a not-so-covert struggle for dominance in Japanese affairs between the Army and the Navy. Favouritism in both services made sure that men of Choshu and Satsuma were usually favoured for promotion in the services, further entrenching the rivalry. This was to have profound consequences for Japanese politics, diplomacy, and even the course of the Second World War. Well before then, however, the situation became so bad that Army officers from regions other than Choshu actually formed a secret society, the Double Leaf Society, to root out \u201ccorrupt\u201d officers. Their fanaticism, and the fanaticism of other secret groups, also spilled out into wider politics.</span>", "time": 1673686926, "resto": 14463425}, {"no": 14467135, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:40:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467044</a><br>beat me to it anon, was just reading about it for the first time a few days ago", "time": 1673689237, "resto": 14463425}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14467079, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:16:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brown people think iraq won the war against america.", "filename": "victorias burrito caliente", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3820, "h": 2148, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673687780634819, "time": 1673687780, "md5": "9IAo1+07pL5GsRKtL8z4+w==", "fsize": 373812, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "brown-people-think-iraq-won-the-war-against", "replies": 7, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 14467083, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:19:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467079</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brown people think</span>", "time": 1673687980, "resto": 14467079}, {"no": 14467089, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:24:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467079</a><br>no, they don&#039;t. what makes you think they would? iran won the war, everyone in the middle east unironically knows that. there&#039;s two great victors of that war, the Barzani Clan that rules the autonomous region of Norther Iraq/Kurdistan, and Iran/the Iraqi Shia", "time": 1673688255, "resto": 14467079}, {"no": 14467106, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:30:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467089</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slap me up senpai</span><br>no, we&#039;ve had enough", "filename": "1642442997424", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 618, "h": 597, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1673688622466363, "time": 1673688622, "md5": "h3QHj+cEeHPOo3NYNdOPpA==", "fsize": 42873, "resto": 14467079}, {"no": 14467108, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:31:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467106</a><br>Maybe try and lay off the meme speech for a second if you want to say something", "time": 1673688680, "resto": 14467079}, {"no": 14467118, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:34:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467108</a><br>america has no interest in geting involved in another stupid middle eastern fight. good job to the ooga-boogas one or two in iraq. we don&#039;t have to babysit you for all eternity for a victory.", "time": 1673688843, "resto": 14467079}, {"no": 14467128, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:37:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467118</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good job to the ooga-boogas</span><br>it&#039;s not like they &quot;actively&quot; did a good job, it&#039;s just that the US eliminated Hussein and then put a pro-Shia ruler in place for some reason. that&#039;s all they had to do to make it a huge win for iran.<br><br>the kurds did a good job though, yeah. they supported the US and actively fought the Iraqi army, now they have a Kurdish homeland with it&#039;s own laws and army within Iraq that&#039;s actually one of the safest places in the region, statistically even safer than Turkey", "time": 1673689042, "resto": 14467079}, {"no": 14467133, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:39:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14467128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14467128</a><br>w/e. not my problem.

Adi Shankara&#039;s Advaita Vedanta school was the first Vedanta school chronologically to write a systematic set of commentaries on the main scriptures that still survive to today, pic related is the guide to reading his writings. His school is one of the most widely-studied and influential types of Hindu philosophy, it&#039;s traditionally only practiced by monks though and most Hindu laypeople follow more devotional kinds of Hindu schools of thought that disagree with Advaita. <br><br>Some people see later, more devotional schools of Vedanta as closer to the Upanishads and see Advaita as less Vedic, but others who disagree will say in response that the central devotional focus in these schools is relatively absent from the Upanishads and that it comes from later texts like Puranas etc and that their own teachings of Advaita accurately reflect the doctrine of the Upanishads. A good representative of the more devotional type of Vedantic philosophy to read would be Ramanuja, whose works have been translated along with Shankara&#039;s. I think Ramanuja&#039;s and Shankara&#039;s writings are both philosophically interesting and worth reading, but I would read Shankara first, both because he came first chronologically and Ramanuja tries to respond to his ideas somewhat, and also because unlike Ramanuja Shankara wrote a comprehensive series of Upanishad commentaries.", "filename": "Adi Shankara guide", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3108, "h": 2840, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1673677415169208, "time": 1673677415, "md5": "lNnQslpGQk9N+x8oQ5Ja0g==", "fsize": 2049194, "resto": 14458851}, {"no": 14466595, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)01:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14466579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14466579</a><br>Have you even watched a single video on Hinduism?

The Rome and its allies model was getting too difficult to manage, so eventually various opportunities were started being used to turn &quot;Roman&quot; into something encompassing whole of Italy, which was achieved in the 1st century BC. The benefits of it included direct access to the manpower of the rest of the peninsula as well as ability to tax it more efficiently. You will notice however that this waters down what Roman means. Now Greek colonists in the south were Roman. Celts and Etruscans in the north were Roman. This wasn&#039;t the end of the world because due to proximity the Herodotus definition was still sort of working - they were so close for so long that they did have a degree of shared lineage, their culture and language have started to coalesce into singularity etc.<br>Later on the citizenship was extended to the entire empire, again for fiscal and military reasons and now we can safely say that &quot;Roman&quot; became a farce.

As a consequence they are obliged to continue working for the creditor or his assignees until the debt is repaid, and are often further coerced to borrow more or to agree to other obligations or entanglements. These individuals, once indebted, whether because of inadequate wages or employer fraud, were reduced to servitude and, in theory, to an inability to leave the workplace to which they have contracted.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As it developed, colonial debt peonage embraced several systems of labor recruitment. In its seasonal form, recruiters advanced money or goods (enganche) to induce Indians and peasants, usually from the highlands, to go to the lowlands to work the harvest season on monocultural plantations. Advances of money or the goods to be worked on were also behind many of the &quot;putting out&quot; derramas or repartos de efectos of the eighteenth century.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries debt peonage took new forms. In isolated or peripheral areas of the new nations, especially in semideserts or jungles, local landowners and political bosses became very powerful, and their mines or haciendas were able to recruit and control labor through the tienda de raya [truck wages], a system characterized by the &quot;company store&quot; and the &quot;running tab.&quot; In some places private police forces prevented escape; in others the national army or police cooperated by pursuing and punishing those who fled. Rubber plantations were especially notorious, and were the scenes of scandalous brutalities, backed up by the indifference or cooperation of the government. While debt may have been the official excuse for detention of workers in these cases, conditions were more like chattel slavery backed up by brute force.</span>", "filename": "kaiji bender", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 479, "h": 1148, "tn_w": 52, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673684138962699, "time": 1673684138, "md5": "Gc7nAQJtrh3mqeS8+udRKw==", "fsize": 165400, "resto": 14466275}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14466470, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)00:55:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The only cool papist", "filename": "Archbishop-Sheen-CNS-28310", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 741, "h": 494, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673675756524404, "time": 1673675756, "md5": "DbNRv1ycvZC4OOuiD5iDRA==", "fsize": 232485, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-only-cool-papist", "replies": 4, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 14466581, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)01:21:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wasn\u2019t born in the 1910\u2019s to a tight knit Italian-American Catholic family, served in ww2, and died nodding my head along to his lectures and JPII anti-communist speeches</span><br><br>VGH WHY BOTHER", "time": 1673677284, "resto": 14466470}, {"no": 14466871, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)02:59:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m an atheist and I love Fulton Sheen.", "time": 1673683192, "resto": 14466470}, {"no": 14466878, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)03:02:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14466871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14466871</a><br>He was right about everything<br>https://youtu.be/Sog1oZtt-Q4?t=528", "time": 1673683369, "resto": 14466470}, {"no": 14466896, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)03:09:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14466878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14466878</a><br>With a lot of work I think we can halve that rape number. <br>We can easily get it down to every 1.5 minutes.", "time": 1673683781, "resto": 14466470}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14464809, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)18:15:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Apologize.", "filename": "18_ulysses_s_grant", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673651755603470, "time": 1673651755, "md5": "5z5EO42KFBOvdtwx8XZ95w==", "fsize": 209229, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "apologize", "replies": 14, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 14464835, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)18:27:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14464809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14464809</a><br>No, I think you should be the one to apologize, Grant.<br>You should\u2019ve stayed in the military like Sherman.", "time": 1673652426, "resto": 14464809}, {"no": 14464996, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)19:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;fucks up reconstruction beyond repair</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;b..b..but it&#039;s the thought that counts&quot;</span>", "time": 1673655103, "resto": 14464809}, {"no": 14465242, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:17:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14464835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14464835</a><br><a href=\"#p14464996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14464996</a><br>The attempted coup against Johnson and him not even being renominated is one of the worst things to ever happen to this country.

None of these instances demands the meaning \u201cvirgin,\u201d but neither do they deny the possible meaning of \u201cvirgin.\u201d There is no conclusive argument for \u201calmah\u201d in Isaiah 7:14 being either \u201cyoung woman\u201d or \u201cvirgin.\u201d However, it is interesting to note, that in the 3rd century B.C., when a panel of Hebrew scholars and Jewish rabbis began the process of translating the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, they used the specific Greek word for virgin, \u201cparthenos,\u201d not the more generic Greek word for \u201cyoung woman.\u201d The Septuagint translators, 200+ years before the birth of Christ, and with no inherent belief in a \u201cvirgin birth,\u201d translated \u201calmah\u201d in Isaiah 7:14 as \u201cvirgin,\u201d not \u201cyoung woman.\u201d This gives evidence that \u201cvirgin\u201d is a possible, even likely, meaning of the term.<br><br>Part1", "time": 1673535912, "resto": 14457345}, {"no": 14457590, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)10:12:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14457560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14457560</a><br>Jesus as the promised Messiah, which means He had to be of the lineage of David. Matthew 1 gives the genealogical proof that Jesus, in His humanity, was a direct descendant of Abraham and David through Joseph, Jesus\u2019 LEGAL father. The genealogy in Luke 3 traces Jesus\u2019 lineage through His mother, Mary. Jesus is a descendant of David by adoption through Joseph and by blood through Mary. \u201cAs to his earthly life [Christ Jesus] was a descendant of David\u201d (Romans 1:3).<br><br>For the Jeconiah curse, that could be a limited reference to the king\u2019s own children\u2014his immediate offspring. On a related note, the phrase \u201cin his lifetime\u201d could apply to the entire verse. The curse would only be in force while the king lived. This is exactly what happened, as Jeconiah was not successful as a king (he only reigned for three months before he surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s forces), and none of his sons (he had seven of them, 1 Chronicles 3:17\u201318) reigned over Judah.<br><br>Another solution concerns the virgin birth. Jesus only had one human parent, Mary. His mother was of David\u2019s line, but not through Jeconiah (Luke 3:31). Joseph was Jesus\u2019 legal father, but not His physical one. Thus, Jesus was of royal blood through Mary, but the curse of Jeconiah stopped with Joseph and was not passed on to Jesus.<br><br>A third possible solution is that God reversed the curse on Jeconiah\u2019s family. This is hinted at by the prophet Haggai, who told Zerubbabel, Jeconiah\u2019s grandson, that God would make him a \u201csignet ring\u201d on God\u2019s hand (Haggai 2:23). Zerubbabel was blessed by God as the governor of Judea, and he prospered in that role when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem. The \u201csignet ring\u201d imagery of Jeconiah\u2019s curse is repeated in Zerubbabel\u2019s blessing, which must be more than coincidence. Several rabbinic sources teach that Jeconiah repented in Babylon and that God forgave him and lifted the curse.<br><br>Part Final.", "time": 1673536372, "resto": 14457345}, {"no": 14457607, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)10:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14457590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14457590</a><br>/Thread", "time": 1673536478, "resto": 14457345}, {"no": 14457612, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)10:16:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14457548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14457548</a><br>These problems have been addressed already.

The Epistle to the Hebrews is often cited in support of this view: the temple sacrifices are described as being imperfect, since they require repeating, and as belonging to a covenant that was &quot;becoming obsolete and growing old&quot; and was &quot;ready to vanish away&quot;. Christ&#039;s crucifixion, being a sacrifice which dealt with sin once and for all, negated any need for further animal sacrifice. Christ himself is compared to the High Priest who was always standing and performing rituals and sacrifices. Christ, however, having performed his sacrifice, &quot;sat down&quot; \u2014 perfection having been finally attained. Further, the veil or curtain to the Holy of Holies is seen as having been torn asunder at the crucifixion \u2013 figuratively in connection with this theology, and literally according to the Gospel of Matthew. For these reasons, a third temple, whose partial purpose would be the re-institution of animal sacrifices, is seen as unnecessary and thus superseded. Irenaeus and Hippolytus were among early church writers who foresaw a rebuilding of the Temple, as necessary for the preparation for the reign of the Antichrist.<br><br>Additionally, Jesus himself stated, in response to a Samaritan asking whether it is right to worship on Mount Gerizim or Mount Zion, that &quot;a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem...

Not that it makes people less violent (it doesn&#039;t. Look up Zen Buddhism or Militant Buddhism), but that it makes people fine with having less. Buddhist peasants were typically much more comfortable with their poverty.<br><br>-Buddhism did a really great job of compiling and adopting local folk beliefs into a formal organized religious institution. Wherever Buddhism went it turned shamans and druids into priests and monks and got busy sanctifying local demigods as &quot;Bodhisattvas&quot; and local deities as &quot;Dharma-protecting gods&quot;. Shinto is the example everyone uses, but this happened all over East Asia and South East Asia. <br><br>-?It weirdly discouraged East Asians from drinking milk and eating beef? I don&#039;t exactly know what this one was about, but when Buddhism was brought over into Japan the singular odd Indian carry-over that was brought with it was the loosely sacred status of cattle. In Japan this translated into the Japanese only using cattle for labor, burying them when they died, and not even drinking their milk or making dairy products. This is strange to me because Indians eat copious amounts of yogurt, cheese, and milk.", "time": 1673651355, "resto": 14464265}, {"no": 14464801, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)18:13:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Buddhism can result in the complete collapse of a civilisation see Angkor Wat.", "time": 1673651630, "resto": 14464265}, {"no": 14464803, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)18:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The problem is that only non-White societies took up Buddhism as a major religion.

Buddhism in general is a religion built around monks and if you aren\u2019t a monk you\u2019re going to interact with the religion quite differently. Unlike Christianity or Islam laypeople don\u2019t have to worry about dumped into heaven or hell when they die, they\u2019ll just reincarnate based upon their karma. Buddhism does have hells (, like a cold hell where your body blisters and pops and freezes in the shape of lotus\u2019s) but they are like temporary torture dungeons where you pay off your bad karma with suffering instead of places of eternal damnation. Thus a lay Buddhist is generally just concerned with gaining good karma through good deeds and avoiding bad karma, then in another life become a monk in order to achieve enlightenment. Pure Land Buddhism is a bit different though since the average person can attain enlightenment via faith and devotion to get into a Buddha\u2019s pure land. Monasteries tended to accumulate a lot of money and land over time like the Catholic Church did in Europe, with everyone from lowly peasants to kings giving to them for long periods of time. In Tibet about a quarter of the male population were monks, which was probably to conserve land amongst families due to the shitty fertility of Tibetan land. (Tibet also has a tradition of polyandry arising from this, where brothers share a wife in order to keep the families lands from splitting to the point where they\u2019d be worthless.) During the Sengoku Jidai in Japan monasteries even raised armies of their own in order to defend their interests with the collapse of central authority, and in general monasteries had a good deal of political power and influence. (Buddhist sects and even different temples or monasteries were often in conflict with one another, sometimes simply competing for followers and government patronage, or literally fighting each other)", "filename": "E5EC318B-E5EE-4E87-9BDF-531EB6340DC6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 506, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673673472054893, "time": 1673673472, "md5": "ONVeNvI95jiMnW5u7v+PrQ==", "fsize": 796167, "resto": 14464265}, {"no": 14466390, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)00:36:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14464781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14464781</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weirdly discouraged East Asians from drinking milk and eating beef?</span><br>Isn&#039;t the milk thing a genetic predisposition towards lactose intolerance in Asian genes?", "time": 1673674590, "resto": 14464265}, {"no": 14466480, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)00:58:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14466390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14466390</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t the milk thing a genetic predisposition towards lactose intolerance in Asian genes?</span><br><br>That might not be entirely true anymore. <br>Japan has had cattle for a very long time, they&#039;ve also had goats.

(Their corruption was evident because they were wearing black, looking at their cell phones, and, in the case of two men, holding hands.)
