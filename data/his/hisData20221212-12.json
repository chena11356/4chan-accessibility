I remember once talking to Xisaoxoi, a Piraha man in his late thirties, when a nine or ten year old girl was standing beside him. As we talked, she rubbed her hands sensually over his chest and back and rubbed his crotch area through his thin, worn nylon shorts. Both were enjoying themselves. &quot;What&#039;s she doing?&quot; I asked superfluously. &quot;Oh, she&#039;s just playing. We play together. When she&#039;s big she will be my wife&quot; was his nonchalant reply - and, indeed, after the girl went though puberty, they were married.&quot;</span>", "filename": "RindConceptValidity", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1612, "h": 711, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 55, "tim": 1670846259887789, "time": 1670846259, "md5": "vrnA1FvlObgYsfuR76nudw==", "fsize": 383040, "resto": 14315777}, {"no": 14315855, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)07:06:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14315825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14315825</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unironically digging through anthropological studies so you can defend grooming </span><br>Does your study examine mental health of the subjects?

In fact, he didn&#039;t readmit them at all. Certainly they&#039;d been expelled, by Edward I in 1290. In 1655, Menasseh ben Israel, a leader of the Jewish community in Amsterdam, came to England to persuade Cromwell to let them back in. In December that year, a conference of lawyers, merchants and theologians met to discuss the issue, but failed to reach a verdict.

This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on U.S. transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the West. In 1946 alone, Yugoslav air-force shot down two U.S. transport aircraft. The passengers and crew of the first plane were secretly interned by the Yugoslav government. The second plane and its crew were a total loss. The U.S. was outraged and sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government, demanding the release of the Americans in custody, U.S. access to the downed planes, and full investigation of the incidents. Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when U.S. had operational nuclear weapons whereas the USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the Greek Civil War, while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council.</span>", "filename": "tito-PICT1008", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 596, "h": 795, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670823649373322, "time": 1670823649, "md5": "o2N8YpwBZXOtCMc20422jQ==", "fsize": 86780, "resto": 14314807}, {"no": 14315018, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)01:04:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14314807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14314807</a><br>In the 1920s the USSR was a &quot;rump state&quot; because they signed away 1/3 of their population and 90% of their industry in the Brest-Litovsk treaty.
