The difference to wage-labor is you don&#039;t have to work to survive, and there is no coercive means to force you to work just for sustenance. All work becomes a positive thing, with only positive rewards and motivation. The big difference is to the capital owning class.

Here, the descendants of societies associated with steppe pastoralists form Early Bronze Age (EBA 2400-1800 BC) were followed by Middle Bronze Age (MBA 1800-1200 BC) populations displaying unique characteristics. Particularly, the predominance of collective burials, the scale of which, was previously seen only in the Neolithic. To study kinship of those MBA societies and to test whether the re-emergence of those old traditions was a result of genetic shift or social changes, we generated and analyzed 91 genomes from individuals associated with EBA and MBA from modern day Poland and Ukraine. Our results indicate that while EBA people in East-Central Europe were most likely direct descendants of the preceding populations, the MBA populations were formed by an additional admixture event involving a population with relatively high proportions of genetic component associated with European hunter-gatherers. Additionally, our data shows that MBA collective burials contained numerous individuals related to each other, and the prevalence of close kinship among adult male descendants over adult female suggests that patrilocality was dominating form of marriage arrangements in these societies.</span><br>Found it.", "time": 1672904531, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423666, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:48:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423660</a><br>Was this HG-admixture from females if haplogroups weren&#039;t changed?", "time": 1672904907, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423670, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:50:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423659</a><br>Maybe there&#039;s more HG in Baltic CWC, also GAC isn&#039;t the same as LBK.", "time": 1672905030, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423678, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:53:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423670</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GAC isn&#039;t the same as LBK</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more HG in Baltic CWC</span><br>The Baltic ones have more WHG, but not EHG, and less ANF than the others, and GAC there have more WHG too while LBK/Barcin have not.

They are not tied to the land because, for the most part, their job requires them to be nomadic and rootless. They have no culture, for the most part, because their job requires them to live among others and adopt their customs to do business. They are greedy so they try to get out of contributing to the country when called upon. They are overeducated and wealthy yet lack the accumulated wisdom and power of the true upper class so they constantly seek to overthrow traditional power structures, often leading to absolute disaster for everyone involved. All of these combine to establish the simple fact that the merchant, unlike the nobility and peasant classes, have essentially no stake in the future of the nation.

For the Court had much to offer: not only places in the households of nobles, and even, with luck, in the palace, but places also in the proliferating bureaucracy of the Spanish Monarchy. The only drawback to service as a royal official was that it required a modicum of education; but, over the course of the years the expansion of the educational establishments of Castile had amply catered for this need. According to one arbitrista, Fern\u00e1ndez Navarrete, there were thirty-two universities and 4,000 grammar schools in Spain, turning out far more educated, or semi-educated, students and graduates than could ever hope to find employment in the professions.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Influence, favour, recommendation, were therefore essential passports.

The future for Matthew looked doubtful, and in my anxiety I formed the habit of dropping in at a rather tawdry little Catholic church which lay on my route home. I didn&#039;t go to pray, to plead or to worship - just to sit quietly for ten minutes and gather what peace of spirit I could.<br><br>&quot;After I had done this several times I struck a negative bargain with God. &#039;Let him recover&#039;, I said, &#039;and I will never put an obstacle in his way should he ever wish to become a Catholic.&#039;<br><br>&quot;It sounded to me like a supreme sacrifice on my part.<br><br>&quot;About three months later he was able to walk in a stilted way. By Christmas he could play football. And not long afterwards I was taken up on the side of the bargain. We wanted to move out of London to the country, and we found only a Catholic school. The Rector explained to us: &#039;We only have three non-Catholic boys, and if he comes here I have no doubt that by the time he is sixteen he will wish to conform. They all do. No pressure will be put on him, I assure you, but it is most likely he will express the wish to be received. Would you object?&#039;<br><br>&quot;I hesitated, and then said, &#039;No.&#039;<br><br>&quot;Matthew went to Beaumont and at the age of fifteen announced that he was going to submit himself to the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church.<br><br>&quot;I later went to spend some days in a Trappist monastery. The life at the Abbey impressed me deeply. If this was the worst that Rome had to offer, it was pretty good. On March 24, 1956, Fr Clarke accepted my reconciliation with the Church, with tact and kindness.

As Shirley&#039;s pregnancy developed, Richard started to be turned off by her. She&#039;d been his perfect virginal teen love interest when they started seeing each other, but now he just saw her and their baby as parasitic creatures trying to leech off of him. One evening, after work, Richard came home to find his wife curled up in bed. He undressed and got on top of her. Shirley awoke and to his dismay said she didn&#039;t feel like it tonight. Richard was angered immensely; she&#039;d never turned him down before. He began hitting her and slapping her, and despite her frantic protests that he was going to hurt the baby, he pinned her down and had intercourse with her.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The honeymoon was pretty much over from that point onward; Shirley became cold to Richard and tried to avoid being alone with him. Since she wouldn&#039;t voluntarily have sex with him, he simply took it by force. Shirley had nowhere to run to; her parents wouldn&#039;t take her back and she had no means to support herself. Carolyn and Mary were also thoroughly useless as emotional support. He began skipping work at the bottling plant and drinking more heavily, and also using pills. Richard spent much of his time in taverns or in jail.

Days ticked by with no sign of him; unbeknownst to her he was spending 22 days in jail for assault after a barroom brawl. When he did get back home, Shirley was AWOL. Carolyn and Mary wouldn&#039;t say where she was hiding, and Richard was haggard and not in the best shape after his jail sentence so unable to use physical force to get information out of them other than learning about his daughter&#039;s birth.

Although Richard had never been much for school, he had decent enough handwriting, at least good enough to forge his co-worker&#039;s signature and cash the check.

He adapted to prison life fairly well, as he knew how to read minds and he was also tough and mean enough that fellow inmates knew to not fuck around with him. He bullied weaker inmates while being respectful to those who were physically stronger than him. Richard still was obsessed with being the perfect dad to Robbie Lynn when he got out of jail and had her name tattoed on his arm, and although he disliked the nascent weed and acid-heads, preferring alcoholics and hard drug users, he generally avoided using substances himself during his prison time.

In time, she found a new love interest. Although Richard bragged to his drinking buddies that he could hunt down his whore of a wife and gut her like a fish any time he wanted, he did nothing.

She tried to hook up up with the owner of the lounge, Ginny, a divorced single mom and ex-pro wrestler. But although Ginny was glad to have Richard in her life, it became clear that her interest in him was more functional than romantic. Sex was strictly business and not the passionate lovemaking he remembered with Shirley. But he was still possessive as hell, and one evening when Ginny spent a little too much time brushing against a bar patron&#039;s hand as she took his money, Richard flew into a rage. He took a knife and slashed at the man in a ferocious assault. They wrestled on the barroom floor, the man cut and bleeding, as Ginny frantically called the cops.

Indeed, the Lord had St. Peter slaughter and eat animals that were unclean according to the Law (Acts 10:12-15). Jesus even summed up the Law and prophets as loving God and neighbor (Matthew 22:40), and declared the weightiest matters of the Law to be justice, faithfulness, and mercy (Matthew 23:23). This is the Law written on our hearts, that is the Gospel, not the ceremonial Law which was but a foreshadow of the things that were to come (Hebrews 10:1). <br><br>Continued below...", "filename": "0_hOrFb30JKRajSapL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 541, "tn_w": 184, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673057962223195, "time": 1673057962, "md5": "2CwppWf3GwMKIEpyvvwMpA==", "fsize": 53675, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "islam-is-a-demiurge-religion", "replies": 6, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 14432177, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:19:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If anyone is circumcised it profits him nothing, therefore Muslims have already forfeited their salvation and have shown themselves enemies of God and Christ when they command this to be done (Galatians 5:2-6).
