Ruby gave birth to her son, Sam Jr. there, but missing Florida, returned there after 5 years, Two daughters, Kay and Sonja, followed. They moved to Bolita, where her brother-in-law Buck McCollum ran local gambling dens and was reputed to be involved with organized crime. Local police accepted bribes to look the other way, and the gambling business flourished. The McCollums also ran a funeral parlor and sold burial plots. With all these sources of income, they became quite wealthy.<br><br>Sam and Ruby soon owned a stately two-story home which belonged to a previous gambling baron in Bolita until he was run out of town. They also farmed one of Florida&#039;s largest tobacco plantations, sold illegal liquor, and owned a couple of juke joints.
