Reality ultimately reduces to a medium in which there is infinite (unbounded) informational potential, or a total lack of informational constraint. This is what the informational part of reality needs in order to be coherently identifiable as information. Deny as much, and you&#039;re saying that it&#039;s contingent on something which is informational in nature (that&#039;s what you&#039;d have to be saying because no alternative exists). So the identifiable existence of any coherent X automatically implies the negation of X, making the distinction both evidential and conceptual. This is why reality isn&#039;t completely deterministic in nature and explains much of what has been empirically verified in QM. Many mystics have intuited this medium and have tried to explain it, variously using terms such as &quot;abyss (Ungrund)&quot;, &quot;emptiness (Sunyata)&quot;, and &quot;Ayin&quot; in their attempts to do so.

Although reality isn&#039;t entirely analogous to a computer because of reasons stated above, it describes informational reality as existing under the auspices of a Self-Configuring-Self-Processing Language, and it is very detailed in its description of the syntax and dynamic properties of it) More notably, it can even prove some of the things you&#039;ve said to be correct.

I inherently, just as a baseline, reject all prophetic religions. There is nothing more venomous to the minds of men and women then Prophecy. Prophecy is a mold that grows on a person, smothers their ability to think, and takes away all their reason. Nothing has done more to mindlessly lead people to waste their lives and kill themselves than the empty promise of prophecy. <br><br>2. I don&#039;t know much about Islam, but from what I&#039;ve heard their Heaven sounds extremely pedestrian. By that I mean their eternal afterlife is occupied by material pleasures: women, ?virgins? drink, food, palaces with fine jewelry, etc.. These are things people can already have in this life. I&#039;ve already had some of these things. Arguably, some people do have them and are miserable regardless. The idea God would command absence for the sake of piety in this life, and then reward &#039;excess&#039; in the next life, is silly and incongruent. <br><br>3. All Islamic countries seem to be some combination of ignorant, unwise, dysfunctional, shit holes; occupied by violent, militant, and unhinged individuals. I have seen clean, polite, kind, and functional Pagan societies and Christian societies, but I have never seen these qualities in Islamic societies in my time. Thus, I have no reason to believe their influence is anything but degenerate and uncivilized. <br><br>4. Islamic&#039;s hatred of iconography makes them an enemy of art, beauty, and thus my enemy.

They believe that the cultic use of images (bowing, kissing, processing, praying) is justified by God becoming man, as Christ&#039;s human body is understood as an image in a manner that is analogous to man-made images. I won&#039;t be making an argument that these distinctions are false, but examining where their logic leads, particularly in relation to man-made images of Christ. I am not also seeking to demonstrate that man-made images in themselves are wrong. Definitions: &quot;worship&quot; is the degree of honor due only to God; &quot;veneration&quot; is a lesser degree of honor which can be given to creatures and objects.<br><br>1. If the honor paid to a man-made image passes to its prototype, then worship paid to a man-made image would pass to its prototype. So if a person worshiped a painting of Jesus as if it were God, this worship would pass to Jesus. Catholic/Orthodox theology would state that it is forbidden to worship a man-made image, a piece of wood or stone, as if it were God; but this is still the logic of this understanding of the relation between image and prototype.<br><br>2. Given that worship given to a man-made image of Jesus would pass to Jesus, but this is forbidden, it means that there is a fundamental distinction between man-made images and the image of Christ&#039;s human body. No one would claim that if Jesus were standing physically in front of them, that the proper response would not be to worship him as God, despite him being present in an image. But this is denied for man-made images. So man-made images and Christ&#039;s body are both &quot;images&quot; only in the broadest sense of the term, and are not actually analogous to each other.<br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "christ-pantocrator", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1492, "tn_w": 134, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673525539765494, "time": 1673525539, "md5": "Qxe+mxEMOJbCZJIfQguX6Q==", "fsize": 499270, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "simple-argument-against-images", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 14456951, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:12:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14456947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14456947</a><br>3. If worship cannot be paid to a man-made image of God, that is, if one cannot worship a painting or statue as if it were God, this means that God can only be worshiped without images. If one wishes to worship God, they cannot do so by utilizing a man-made image. One could venerate God through a man-made image, but one cannot worship God through a man-made image. God can only be worshiped without man-made images. Frankly, I think this point alone vitiates the fundamental claim of iconoclasts.<br><br>4. This begs the question of why I would want to venerate God through a man-made image when the proper response of the soul to God is to worship him. If Christ were physically before me, I would not want to simply venerate him, that is, to give him the honor I would give to merely a man. He is my God, and I would want to worship him as my God. So by utilizing a man-made image of Christ, I am actually unable to pay Christ the honor that he is properly due. Perhaps one could say there is worth in, at times, giving God less honor than what he deserves; this strikes me as impious.<br><br>5. A way around this would be to claim that worship of images is actually acceptable. In which case, you are worshiping a rock or a piece of wood as if it is your God. Your intention is indeed that the true God is worshiped, but you are still paying the worship due to the living God to a rock or to a stone.

The most you can get out of these people is rationalization, but it&#039;s not about making new rules of right and wrong, it&#039;s about desensitizing people to what&#039;s wrong so that you can push the window a little further and make people a little easier to manipulate. <br>Your assessment of liberalism is off base because liberalism isn&#039;t about &quot;having no rules&quot;. The puritans used to execute people for less than being homosexual, and they were liberals. Liberalism was originally about giving people freedom to practice their religion the way they wanted to. It was not about allowing perverts to run rampant and spread anti-social practices among the populace. I would also go further and say that morality is not about &quot;the group&quot;, it&#039;s about personal conduct. <br>In short, your assessment of liberalism is wrong. Liberalism began arguably with the protestant reformation which sowed the seeds of secularism which we see today, but modern day secularists would see the reformists as backwards religious yokels who don&#039;t even support child grooming. If you want to develop arguments for or against liberalism, I just recommend reading about modern governments that are opoosed to it and developing your thoughts on that.

The foundation of a monastery gave the ruler support for his administration (for example, schools to educate competent scribes). It also provided a library, a hospice and old age home, architects, educated men, and priests to conduct services in the new ducal city.

I&#039;ve said that I have a gift of language, but it was only when I came to India that I realised this. My Latin and Greek had been weak at school, for I paid little attention to them, but a tongue that you hear spoken about you is a different thing. Each language has a rhythm for me, and my ear catches and holds the sounds; I seem to know what a man is saying even when I don&#039;t understand the words, and my tongue slips easily into any new accent. In any event, after a fortnight listening to Timbu and asked him questions, I was speaking Hindustani well enough to be understood, and I paid him off. For one thing, I had found a more interesting teacher. Her name was Fetnab, and I bought her (not officially, of course, although it amounted to the same thing) from a merchant whose livestock consisted of wenches for the British officers and civilian residents in Calcutta. She cost me 500 rupees, which was about 50 guineas, and she was a thief s bargain.

Then there was ease, and time for any amount of sport, and good company, and none of the restrictions of home. You could live as you pleased, and lord it among the niggers, and if you were well-off and properly connected, as I was, there was the social life among the best folk who clustered round the Governor-General. And there were as many women as you could wish for. There was money to be had, too, if you were lucky in your campaigns and knew how to look for it. In my whole service I never made half as much in pay as I got from India in loot - but that is another story. I knew nothing of this when we dropped anchor in the Highly, off Calcutta, and I looked at the red river banks and sweated in the boiling sun, and smelt the stink, and wished I was in hell rather than here. It had been a damnable four-months voyage on board the crowded and sweltering Indiaman, with no amusement of any kind, and I was prepared to find India no better. I was to join one of the Company&#039;s native lancer regiments(9) in the Benares District, but I never did. Army inefficiency kept me kicking my heels in Calcutta for several weeks before the appropriate orders came through, and by that time I had taken fortune by the foreskin, in my own way. In the first place, I messed at the Fort with the artillery officers in the native service, who were a poor lot, and whose messing would have sickened a pig.

Muhammad spoke Satan&#039;s words as the word of God. This event is documented by several early Muslim scholars and referenced in the Hadith and Quran. Later Muslims, ashamed that their self declared prophet spoke Satan&#039;s words, denied the event occurred. A myriad of excuses and denials have been put forth by these later Muhammadans to cover up Muhammad&#039;s sinful error.<br><br>It must be pointed out again that the &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; event is not something made up by non-Muslims. The event is recorded by the earliest Islamic sources available on Muhammad&#039;s life. No one should think that it is a story made up by people who are critical of Islam. It is an episode directly found in the early Islamic records.<br>This topic is one of the most controversial in Islam. Satan caused Muhammad to recite his words as God&#039;s words. The background to this event is that Muhammad and his followers were being persecuted for attacking the pagan faiths of Mecca, and he did not want to further offend his Arab tribesmen, and, he wanted them to become his followers, i.e. Muslims. In fact Muhammad wished that God would not reveal anything further to him that would further alienate his fellow Arabs. So when opportunity arose, he spoke what Satan put into his heart and mind as God&#039;s word.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the Old Testament (OT), if someone caused the people to worship other gods he was put to death - Deuteronomy 13:1 - 5:</span><br><br><br>yet mo&#039; got away scott free... i bet the situation wouldnt have gone like that if it was a woman who had a false revelation", "time": 1673409686, "resto": 14451035}, {"no": 14451115, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:04:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14451085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14451085</a><br><a href=\"#p14451105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14451105</a><br>The satanic verses in ibn Ishaq is weak, anons, nice try though!

The curtains are dimly and bleakly sheltering the musty shell of a hovel from the equally dim and bleak exterior - a landscape of pure deracinated cultureless. Looking around the room we see unread books. The spines have not yet been bent though the scant little money gained from mother&#039;s coffers have been spent. The computer has dozens of tabs open, half of them related to this weeks porn fetish. Chips of various caliber and flavoring are dispensed across the deck and between the crevices along the walls and doorways.

We see an image of the man (?) sitting isolated, whose lighting is derived from the lonesome glow of his computer. His unfit, unworked physique a testament to mankinds recent decline. A degenerated form whose strength has depleted from years wasted away playing pointless video games and masturbating pitifully yet dutifully to today&#039;s icon of soulless debauchery. His head is a small thing relative to a normal mans and it rocks from side to side when engaging in debate as if viscerally agitated. His fingers, also disproportionate, are only apt at correcting mistakes along a keyboard and misshapen, though he himself is not aware. A sunken chest rests above a gut filled with today&#039;s vittles from his parent&#039;s last grocery shopping.

The closest thing for left-wing radicals was perhaps beheading, having been the main method of regicide right up to the French Revolution, removing the head as a symbol of power, but has since been the summary shootings of Communist regimes. I have two theories for why it&#039;s such a strong motif among the Hard-Right.<br><br>One is that it originates from the liberal use of breathing as a symbol of freedom, like Emma Lazarus&#039; huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Unlike other necessities such as food, water and shelter which require an effort to attain, air is more difficult to deny than to provide, making it the most common freedom. Instances of breathing being denied are more easily politicized than other causes of death, such as videos of blacks being suffocated by police or pictures of drowned migrants washing up on the beach. Right-Wing extremists have often appropriated this imagery as a threat of oppression against their subjects.<br><br>The second theory is that it&#039;s more contemptable to insult somone&#039;s breathing than anything else. Being the most basic human function, it seems the last thing you could assume of and take away from someone far beneath you, someone you consider lesser and only capable of breath. Conservatives are known to have higher senses of conscientiousness and disgust and perhaps express this in concerns of airborne disease around those they dislike and the right of others to &#039;breathe the same air as them&#039;.<br><br>What do you think?

While climbing up steep terrain, however, the 1/24th reportedly collapsed under Chinese fire and withdrew in disorder. When the Division commander learned of that action, his confidence in the 24th plummeted. Many soldiers of the 24th ran away from the fighting, tossing their weapons and equipment aside. A derisive poem throughout the U.S. Army stated: &#039;When the Chinaman&#039;s mortars begins to thud, the Deuce-Four Niggers begin to bug.&#039;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Although the 24th performed well in the attack north of the Han and the subsequent general withdrawal of the Eighth Army after the Chinese Spring Offensive of 1951, its reputation was somewhat tarnished.

Kean, requested that it be disbanded because it was &quot;untrustworthy and incapable of carrying out missions expected of an infantry regiment.&quot; By 1 October 1951, the 24th was dissolved.</span>", "filename": "General_Douglas_MacArthur", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 350, "h": 282, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 201, "tim": 1673317088075985, "time": 1673317088, "md5": "J8twxK5evl0wsgKQcEPf4w==", "fsize": 21691, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-substandard-performance-of-the-24th-regiment", "replies": 77, "images": 19, "unique_ips": 26}, {"no": 14446278, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)21:21:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;hey mao check out all the pet niggers i&#039;m willing to throw at your troops, pissing your pants yet</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;-general Dumbass MuttcArthur</span>", "time": 1673317305, "resto": 14446258}, {"no": 14446298, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)21:25:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14446258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14446258</a><br>And you are reposting again why?", "time": 1673317535, "resto": 14446258}, {"no": 14446300, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)21:25:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14446298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14446298</a><br>i got no yous the first time", "time": 1673317554, "resto": 14446258}, {"no": 14447487, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)04:05:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14446298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14446298</a><br><a href=\"#p14446300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14446300</a><br>lol bump", "time": 1673341505, "resto": 14446258}, {"no": 14447823, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:22:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "yes, for anyone who is remotely interested in history, blacks being the worst soldiers in the world is not news.

Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, \u201cLet me not see the death of the boy.\u201d So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept. But God heard the voice of the lad from the place where he was. Then the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, \u201cWhat is the matter, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.\u2020 Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.\u201d\u2020 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink. Thus God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the desert, and became an archer. He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.

To give an answer, let us first address what deification is not, and then describe what it is.<br><br>What deification is not. When the Church calls us to pursue godliness, to be more like God, this does not mean that human beings become divine. We do not become like God in His nature. That would not only be heresy, it would be impossible. For we are human, always have been human, and always will be human. We cannot take on the nature of God.<br><br>St. John of Damascus makes a remarkable observation. The word \u201cGod\u201d in the Scriptures refers not to the divine nature or essence, for that is unknowable. \u201cGod\u201d refers rather to the divine energies\u2014the power and grace of God that we can perceive in this world. The Greek word for God, theos, comes from a verb meaning \u201crun,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d or \u201cburn.\u201d These are energy words, so to speak, not essence words.<br><br>In John 10:34, Jesus, quoting Psalm 81:6, repeats the passage, \u201cYou are gods.\u201d The fact that He was speaking to a group of hypocritical religious leaders who were accusing Him of blasphemy makes the meaning doubly clear: Jesus is not using \u201cgod\u201d to refer to divine nature.

So Saul, his three sons, and his armor-bearer died together that same day. And when the men of Israel, those on the other side of the valley and those on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled. The Philistines came and settled in them. So the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

But the war wasn\u2019t fought only in the Andes. From early on, Sendero had established a presence in the poor neighbourhoods of Lima, and as its influence increased it began to direct its fire against community organisations, NGOs and the rest of the Peruvian left. Not only did Sendero not want allies; it targeted other leftists for intimidation or assassination. Its detachments were often armed with little more than rocks, machetes or sticks of dynamite they had stolen from foreign mining concessions. More than once they loaded donkeys with explosives and sent them into crowded marketplaces (these were known as burrobombas; other homemade devices included the queso ruso, \u2018Russian cheese\u2019, a crude bomb with a timer). All told, according to the final report of Peru\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, issued in 2003, Sendero was responsible for 46 per cent of casualties in the war, making it an unusually lethal guerrilla army \u2013 and an exception to the worldwide norm.

Sendero went against the tide in its Maoism, too: Mao had died in 1976, and China had begun its \u2018reform and opening up\u2019 two years later (hence the animus against Deng Xiaoping). Yet Sendero\u2019s very status as a historical and political anomaly \u2013 seemingly out of place, out of time \u2013 only deepens the enigma.

These features would eventually be subordinated to a grotesque cult of personality, in which Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 \u2018President Gonzalo\u2019 \u2013 was hailed as the \u2018Fourth Sword of Marxism\u2019 (after Marx, Lenin and Mao). But in the meantime they had made Sendero a formidably disciplined political and military force. This is especially striking given that, unlike many other guerrilla insurgencies, Sendero had no practical support at all from outside the country; according to Starn and La Serna, most of its shoestring budget came from tuition fees from a small private school in Lima (they reject the idea that Sendero made fortunes from the drug trade in the Huallaga Valley). There is another respect in which its isolation made a difference. Much of the global left experienced perestroika, the fall of the Berlin Wall and Tiananmen Square as deep ideological shocks, prompting a re-evaluation of strategy as well as basic principles. Sendero by contrast saw these events as confirmation of its worldview: it had already identified both the USSR and China as \u2018revisionist\u2019 powers hostile to the true revolutionary cause, and now destined for the same scrapheap of history as the capitalist world.</span><br><br>The insurgency took place at a moment of great tension in the Peruvian countryside...<br>https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41<wbr>/n13/tony-wood/even-hotter-even-lou<wbr>der", "filename": "81s5ZqagfXL._AC_UL900_SR615,900_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 615, "h": 900, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673489610510480, "time": 1673489610, "md5": "fSgmL+/71GzvxwV8N7py4A==", "fsize": 98659, "resto": 14455204}, {"no": 14455357, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)21:16:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "They were basic leftists.

Social, Religious, and Political/Economic. The religious aspect should be outside the realm of government - and if a church wants to preform a ceremony for gay couples then that&#039;s a matter for that church&#039;s leadership and congregation. The social aspect is to announce to your friends and family that you think that this relationship is the one you want to keep from now on (although given divorce stats there&#039;s some debate about how much this applies now), but again that&#039;s not something that you need a government&#039;s or church&#039;s permission for, just throw a party and announce it. The reason that marriage has legislation around it is for the last one there, the economic factor. A stable, loving, supportive heterosexual family has been proven time and time again to be the best scenario to breed and produce children (the next generation of citizens and workers, hence the government&#039;s interest in it). There isn&#039;t sufficient data to tell us how gay parents will compare to that just yet - and for such a polarising issue it is almost impossible for a fair and honest study to be conducted/published - but let&#039;s be real and acknowledge that at its best it can only be as good as a functional heterosexual marriage, just without the ability to actually breed their own children. <br><br>As such it is, in the absolute best possible case, a second rate set up for fulfilling the task of a marriage (from the perspective of the government, the people you are arguing should be involved). Why are you in favour of the state wasting its limited and already overstretched resources on an, at best, second rate set up OP? Your fee-fees are not a political issue. Grow up.

Moscow chafed at this strong-armed action as they would be forced to spend resources on their own ABM system, and they knew Nixon meant business.<br><br>The next great move came nearly three years later when, on May 20, 1972, Nixon became the first sitting president to visit the Kremlin (FDR had set foot on Soviet soil at Yalta). He was installed in a entire floor of the Grand Palace of the Kremlin as he prepared to meet with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and an interpreter. Nixon quickly realized that Brezhnev was no pushover; he was a formidable negotiator, and he wrote in his diary &quot;Anyone who dismisses [Brezhnev] as either a fool or a simplistic brute is making a mistake.&quot;<br><br>Here was an important aspect of Nixon&#039;s diplomatic skills; he knew that communist leaders were tough characters and not to be underestimated, and in his negotations with them always treated them politely, respectfully, and did not talk down to them. Dmitri Simes, who was a Soviet policy advisor at the Moscow Institute of World Economy in 1972, praised Nixon as a negotiator. He was tough, but all business. &quot;[Nixon] didn&#039;t go into lofty polemics or scolding about human rights and democracy as President Carter did.
