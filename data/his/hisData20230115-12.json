Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl&#039;s toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and, later, the smell may have come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds.[81] Most of the women receiving treatment did not go out often and were disabled.[35]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from footbinding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.[82]</span><br><br>cont", "time": 1673739904, "resto": 14470536}, {"no": 14470650, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:46:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470644</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to rebreaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls&#039; feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable.[83] Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.[84] Other issues that may have arisen from footbinding included paralysis and muscular atrophy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In some areas, footbinding raised marriage prospects. It has been estimated that, by the 19th century, 40\u201350% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, rising to almost 100% in upper-class Han Chinese women.</span>", "filename": "1475867353803", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 385, "h": 398, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673739966790101, "time": 1673739966, "md5": "9re+uhBC55BXr6w92DnKLg==", "fsize": 17586, "resto": 14470536}, {"no": 14470653, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:47:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470619</a><br>One of their saints said it&#039;s actually a good thing.", "filename": "orthogroomers", "ext": ".png", "w": 1140, "h": 320, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 35, "tim": 1673740023794829, "time": 1673740023, "md5": "ISV7wJoW8491Tu7YSNxGgQ==", "fsize": 51779, "resto": 14470536}, {"no": 14470702, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:02:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470653</a><br>The eternal gayreek reemerges naturally even in the absence of paganism, ya hate to see it.", "time": 1673740973, "resto": 14470536}, {"no": 14470704, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470592</a><br>Lip plates aren&#039;t harmful.", "time": 1673741036, "resto": 14470536}, {"no": 14470710, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:05:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470539</a><br>MRI chambers freak some people out", "time": 1673741104, "resto": 14470536}, {"no": 14470733, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470650</a><br><a href=\"#p14470644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470644</a><br>Worse than slave collars.

Faulk doesn&#039;t tell us this, he simply takes Sanning&#039;s numbers at face value because he&#039;s either too stupid or too lazy to do any research of his own, but Sanning gets this number because he uses an estimate of Jewish fertility two times too low (because he doesn&#039;t bother to account for the fact that half of Jewish births in pre-war Poland went unreported (see Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919-1939 by Joseph Marcus, chapter 10 ,for details on this). <br>He then takes a number of 100,000 Jewish emigrants from Poland per year from 1931 to 1939, a number that is more than five times too high. In reality, emigration from Poland in TOTAL in these years probably did not even crack 500,000, and 80% of these were gentile Poles (see Europe on the Move by Eugene Kulischer for this, in particular pages 137 to 145). A number like 100,000 Jewish emigrants for this entire period is more realistic. <br>Faulk then proceeds to take this (wrong) emigration rate of 3.1% for Polish Jews, and apply it to the Jewish population of every other country in Eastern Europe whatsoever, with absolutely no justification whatsoever. <br>1/2", "time": 1673771622, "resto": 14472413}, {"no": 14472658, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:36:58", "name": "Mishkan of G-D traveller Miners", "com": "<a href=\"#p14472529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14472529</a><br>King George VI the German from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ordered the 1st hit, and<br>Queen Elizabeth II the German from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ordered the 2nd hit.<br><br>Mishkan of G-D traveller Miners", "filename": "Wiltshire Constabulary", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 394, "h": 510, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673771818581932, "time": 1673771818, "md5": "0Lk+sNXrzR6bDrazkdnunw==", "fsize": 51937, "resto": 14472413}, {"no": 14472660, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:37:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14472643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14472643</a><br>Then he gives a number of 750,000 Polish Jews deported to Siberia, citing a testimony before the US congress in 1954 and the statements of random people who were not in Russia at the relevant time and had no access to any relevant information.

But over the last few years that is precisely what has happened: Just look at the recent debates over America\u2019s legacy of slavery, what can be taught in public schools about the nation\u2019s founders and even the definition of what constitutes fascism.

That provoked, perhaps inevitably, a right-wing backlash in the form of \u201cThe 1776 Report,\u201d a triumphalist, Donald Trump-directed effort. Then came a raft of laws in conservative-governed states across the country aiming to restrict and control how history is taught in public schools.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;History, as the historian Matthew Karp has written, has become \u201ca new kind of political priority\u201d for people across the political spectrum, a means to fight over what it is to be an American: which values we should emphasize, which groups we should honor, which injustices we should redress.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The historical profession has likewise been roiled by controversy. Last August, James H. Sweet, the president of the American Historical Association, published an essay in which he argued that present-focused narratives of African slavery often represent \u201chistorical erasures and narrow politics.\u201d The piece engendered a firestorm of reproach, with scholars variously accusing Dr. Sweet of attempting to delegitimize new research on topics including race and gender; some even accused Dr. Sweet of outright racism.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet as Americans fight over their history, the historical profession itself is in rapid \u2014 maybe even terminal \u2014 decline. Twelve days after Dr. Sweet published his column, the A.H.A. released a \u201cJobs Report\u201d that makes for grim reading: The average number of available new \u201ctenure track\u201d university jobs, which are secure jobs that provide living wages, benefits and stability, between 2020 and 2022 was 16 percent lower than it was for the four years before the pandemic.</span>", "time": 1673741427, "resto": 14470724}, {"no": 14470727, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:11:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470726</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The report further notes that only 27 percent of those who received a Ph.D. in history in 2017 were employed as tenure track professors four years later. The work of historians has been \u201cde-professionalized,\u201d and people like myself, who have tenure track jobs, will be increasingly rare in coming years. This is true for all academic fields, not just history. As Adrianna Kezar, Tom DePaola and Daniel T. Scott note in their book \u201cThe Gig Academy,\u201d about 70 percent of all college professors work off the tenure track. The majority of these professors make less than $3,500 per course, according to a 2020 report by the American Federation of Teachers. Jobs that used to allow professors to live middle-class lives now barely enable them to keep their heads above water.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is to blame? In the past generation the American university has undergone a drastic transformation. To reduce costs, university administrators have dramatically reduced tenure. And as the protections of tenure have withered away, the size of nonteaching university staffs have exploded. Between 1976 and 2018, \u201cfull-time administrators and other professionals employed by those institutions increased by 164 percent and 452 percent, respectively,\u201d according to a 2021 paper on the topic. Professors have been sacrificed on the altar of vice deans.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, in an effort to fund research that might redound to their financial benefit and to demonstrate their pragmatic value to politicians and to the public, universities have emphasized science, technology, engineering and math at the expense of the humanities. As the American Academy of Arts and Sciences reported, citing data from 2019, \u201cspending for humanities research equaled 0.7 percent of the amount dedicated to STEM R.&amp;D.\u201d</span>", "time": 1673741487, "resto": 14470724}, {"no": 14470732, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470727</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The humanities, including history, are often considered more an object of ridicule than a legitimate lane of study. Look no further than statements from politicians: Rick Scott, the former governor of Florida, assembled a task force in 2012 that recommended that people who major in history and other humanities fields be charged higher tuition at state universities. In 2016, Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky said that \u201cFrench literature majors\u201d should not receive state funding for their degrees. Even more recently, in 2021, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida mocked people who go into debt to \u201cend up with degrees in things like zombie studies.\u201d And it\u2019s not just Republicans: President Barack Obama remarked in 2014 that \u201cfolks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree,\u201d implying that if a degree didn\u2019t make money it wasn\u2019t worth it. (Mr. Obama later apologized to a University of Texas art historian for his remarks, clarifying that he did believe art history was a valuable subject.)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These material and ideological assaults have engendered a steep decline in undergraduate humanities majors. In the 2018-19 academic year, only 23,923 graduating undergraduates received degrees in history and related fields, which, the A.H.A. notes, is \u201cdown more than a third from 2012 and the smallest number awarded since the late 1980s.\u201d</span>", "time": 1673741595, "resto": 14470724}, {"no": 14470738, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:14:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470732</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Private groups, which traditionally provided significant financial support to budding humanities scholars, have taken the hint and increasingly stopped supporting the humanities and soft social sciences. The Social Science Research Council recently ended its International Dissertation Research Fellowship program, which in the last 25 years funded over 1,600 scholars exploring \u201cnon-U.S. cultures\u201d and \u201cU.S. Indigenous communities,\u201d declaring that the program \u201caccomplished many of the goals it had set for itself.\u201d The Ford Foundation has similarly decided to conclude its long-running National Academies fellowship program for historically marginalized scholars in order, the foundation\u2019s president declared, \u201cto invest more deeply in movement-building work.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s the end of history. And the consequences will be significant.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entire areas of our shared history will never be known because no one will receive a living wage to uncover and study them. It\u2019s implausible to expect scholars with insecure jobs to offer bold and innovative claims about history when they can easily be fired for doing so. Instead, history will be studied increasingly by the wealthy, which is to say those able to work without pay. It\u2019s easy to see how this could lead American historical scholarship to adopt a pro-status-quo bias. In today\u2019s world, if you don\u2019t have access to elite networks, financial resources or both, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to pursue a career in history. In the future, history won\u2019t just be written by the victors; it\u2019ll also be written by the well-to-do.</span>", "time": 1673741656, "resto": 14470724}, {"no": 14470742, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:15:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;have your department become overrun with marxist radicals during the 60s and 70s</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;become extremely exclusive, cliquey and nepotistic with other professors who you don&#039;t like, even going as far as to blacklist them</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;abandon the enlightenment values of reason and objective truth in favor of deconstructionism, critical theory, and social justice</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;create a million niche hobby study programs with no real-world value outside of the classroom (knowing everything there is to know about late 19th century ocean liners is not going to put food on the table)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leave graduates saddled with thousands of dollars of debt and very little job opportunities</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wonder why nobody takes you seriously or wants to fund your research anymore</span><br>You get what you fuckin&#039; deserve.", "filename": "unnamed", "ext": ".png", "w": 650, "h": 650, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673741713660330, "time": 1673741713, "md5": "AZG9Y9+PBQcDz33Po9LBFA==", "fsize": 649010, "resto": 14470724}, {"no": 14470744, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:15:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14470738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14470738</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If Americans don\u2019t seriously invest in history and other humanities disciplines, we encourage the ahistoric ignorance upon which reaction relies.

The &quot;form-world&quot; (rupa-loka) in Buddhism refers to a world like ours which is composed of names and forms, where names associate with forms which are always changing.

The buddhadharma focuses on the lack of form in the platonic sense in phenomena, the not-mineness, changingness and dissatisfying in them, and bodhi is not the faculty which engages in dialectic. There is instead the analysis of dependent origination and putting an end to it, which is a process of knowing and changing what is fully within our control.

The moral precepts upheld by Platonism and Buddhism are similar in far more respects than they are different, and differ in some albeit without being exclusive (the only obvious example I can think of is Plato&#039;s emphasis on courage in battle as [albeit the lowest] virtue, which I don&#039;t think the Buddha espouses.

Plato strongly chastises the sense faculties, notably in Philebus, where he calls them the lowest of the low, and admits that he wishes to argue that they are actually worth nothing in the grand scheme of things, and should be entirely steered clear of if one wishes to reach noesis. Plato even refers to the sense pleasures as Aphrodite&#039;s gift, the conniving goddess of pleasure and love, much like Buddha refers to Mara and his seductive daughters who represent the sense desires.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and desire for the good</span><br>Are you aware that in Buddhism there is an apparently contradictory admission that the desire for enlightenment is itself a desire? Buddhist teachers are openly ok with admitting that this is a &quot;good desire&quot;, even though it appears to contradict some of the principle teachings. Naturally, when one has attained enlightenment, one no longer harbours desire, because one has what one wanted. Compare this to Plato&#039;s Symposium, in particular Diotima&#039;s speech, where love (of the Good) is said to be limited only to those mortals who are not actually in possession of the Good. In other words, according to Plato&#039;s Diotima, desire would be necessary for a mortal, as the gift given to us by the daemons, to reach the actual possession of Goodness.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The buddhadharma focuses on the lack of form in the platonic sense in phenomena</span><br>Plato did not say there were Platonic forms in phenomena.

It&#039;s one of the tendencies that it&#039;s necessary to purge from your heritage.<br><br>As for Plato&#039;s political aspirations, this is obviously a difference in comparison to Buddhism. I would not say it is an exclusive difference however, as we can see that in Tibet there are monastic Buddhist governing entities which follow their own precepts.

Plato&#039;s idea of ultimate knowledge is ultimately beyond discursive reasoning as well, which is noesis as opposed to episteme.

It is established in the Canon that the only doctrines he asserts are absolutely true are the Four Noble Truths and the validity of the Eightfold Noble Path. Everything else, he states, is just an accessory to reaching nibbana.

If you wish, then, to understand what I am now saying, take a single example and learn from it what applies to all. There is an object called a circle, which has for its name the word we have just mentioned and, secondly, it has a definition, composed of names and verbs; for \u201cthat which is everywhere equidistant from the extremities to the center\u201d will be the definition of that object which has for its name \u201cround\u201d and \u201cspherical\u201d and \u201ccircle.\u201d And in the third place there is that object which is in course of being portrayed and obliterated, or of being shaped with a lathe, and falling into decay; but none of these affections is suffered by the circle itself, whereto all these others are related inasmuch as it is distinct therefrom. Fourth comes knowledge and intelligence and true opinion regarding these objects; and these we must assume to form a single whole, which does not exist in vocal utterance or in bodily forms but in souls; whereby it is plain that it differs both from the nature of the circle itself and from the three previously mentioned.

States in america are technically sovereign (even though we don&#039;t think about them like that anymore), and part of their sovereignty is the ability to enact certain laws that attempt to effect the &quot;health, welfare, or morality&quot; of its citizenry. The authority to pass these types of laws is called &quot;police power.&quot; The catch with police powers is that they can&#039;t be used to abridge a fundamental right (bill of rights + a couple unenumerated things like marriage) or to create an undue burden on the exercise of a liberty interest (something below a right, but more than just mere permissible conduct). <br>So states do have the authority to pass anti-BDS laws via their police powers, so the question becomes does the withdrawal of benefits constitute abridging the fundamental right to free expression? I would say probably not. Losing out on benefits is probably one of the least intrusive ways a state could enforce a law when considering other punishments for legal violations, like fines, jailtime, and death.

Adi Shankara&#039;s Advaita Vedanta school was the first Vedanta school chronologically to write a systematic set of commentaries on the main scriptures that still survive to today, pic related is the guide to reading his writings. His school is one of the most widely-studied and influential types of Hindu philosophy, it&#039;s traditionally only practiced by monks though and most Hindu laypeople follow more devotional kinds of Hindu schools of thought that disagree with Advaita. <br><br>Some people see later, more devotional schools of Vedanta as closer to the Upanishads and see Advaita as less Vedic, but others who disagree will say in response that the central devotional focus in these schools is relatively absent from the Upanishads and that it comes from later texts like Puranas etc and that their own teachings of Advaita accurately reflect the doctrine of the Upanishads. A good representative of the more devotional type of Vedantic philosophy to read would be Ramanuja, whose works have been translated along with Shankara&#039;s. I think Ramanuja&#039;s and Shankara&#039;s writings are both philosophically interesting and worth reading, but I would read Shankara first, both because he came first chronologically and Ramanuja tries to respond to his ideas somewhat, and also because unlike Ramanuja Shankara wrote a comprehensive series of Upanishad commentaries.", "filename": "Adi Shankara guide", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3108, "h": 2840, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1673677415169208, "time": 1673677415, "md5": "lNnQslpGQk9N+x8oQ5Ja0g==", "fsize": 2049194, "resto": 14458851}, {"no": 14466595, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)01:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14466579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14466579</a><br>Have you even watched a single video on Hinduism?

So Jesus can only know what his immediate context in early 1st century Judea, he can have no supernatural abilities or knowledge, he cannot state anything that is a prophecy or that has relevance to the future, which he cannot know.

And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whole house like the sun, and the whole house was very bright. 3. And thereupon he arose in the hands of the midwife, opened his mouth, and \u2020conversed with\u2020 the Lord of righteousness. 4. And his father Lamech was afraid of him and fled, and came to his father Methuselah. 5. And he said unto him: &#039;I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unlike man, and resembling the sons of the God of heaven; and his nature is different and he is not like us, and his eyes are as the rays of the sun, and his countenance is glorious. 6. And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me but from the angels, and I fear that in his days a wonder may be wrought on the earth. 7. And now, my father, I am here to petition thee and implore thee that thou mayest go to Enoch, our father, and learn from him the truth, for his dwelling-place is amongst the angels.&#039; 8. And when Methuselah heard the words of his son, he came to me to the ends of the earth; ...10. And now, my father, hear me: unto Lamech my son there hath been born a son, the like of whom there is none, and his nature is not like man&#039;s nature, and the colour of his body is whiter than snow and redder than the bloom of a rose, and the hair of his head is whiter than white wool, and his eyes are like the rays of the sun, and he opened his eyes and thereupon lighted up the whole house. 11.

The &quot;Ur Kasdim&quot; from which he comes was probably Urkesh in northern Mesopotamia, which is a known Hurrian city. If he was from the Sumerian Ur, it wouldn&#039;t make sense for him to pass by Haran on his way to Canaan. Moreover, after Abraham arrived in Haran, God told him to leave the &quot;land of his birth,&quot; which suggests he was born in that same region. We know there was a mass exodus of people in northeastern Syria around 2000\u20131500 BC because the climate became very dry. The city of Urkesh was abandoned. The people very likely travelled toward Egypt where the economy was booming, and the Hyksos may have been among them, and perhaps some of the migrants stopped in Canaan during their journey. In the Bible, Abraham&#039;s family was already travelling toward Canaan before God spoke to him, for an unspecified reason. Abraham is said to have lived in the 1700s BC, so he could have been part of that migration.

Campaigns against the Gauls and barbarians were kind of rofl-stomps, but they were decisive and destructive campaigns. His victories in the Roman Civil War, especially at shit like the Battle of Pharsalus against near peer (tech and training wise) enemy army that had numerical advantage was brilliant.<br><br>Cao Cao mostly won battles where he had the numerical advantage. His greatest triumph was Guandu against Yuan Shao but it was mostly a siege-like stand-off for months until Cao Cao broke the stalemate with his Wuchao raid. Even then, the Yuan army was still a threat and Cao Cao couldn&#039;t just steamroll the northern provinces until after Yuan Shao died and his sons started infighting. Other than Tong Pass, which was a bitch-slap to Western Barbarians, Cao Cao is far more known for his defeats, especially at Hanzhong and Red Cliffs.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who was the best politician?</span><br>Cao Cao. Managed to make all the right political moves and live to the end of his natural life and have a designated successor take over. His post-Guandu/Yuan Shao death moves were brilliant and he played Yuan Shao&#039;s eldest son and his third son (and and heir) against each other to cause a Yuan Clan civil war. Cao Cao promptly exploited it. Same shit with convincing Liu Bang&#039;s son to invite Cao Cao into Jing Province after Liu Bang&#039;s death. On top of controlling the emperor and having capable ministers like Xun Yu at court. I am also fond of certain theories, like Cao Cao deliberately setting up Yang Qiu to fail (Yang Qiu supported his third son Cao Zhen) because he wanted his 2nd son Cao Pi to inherit the throne. If Cao Ang didn&#039;t die, he&#039;d probably be the first Wei Emperor.<br><br>Julius Caesar was popular, but he pissed off the wrong people and got shanked.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who was the better ruler?</span><br>Cao Cao.

There&#039;s also the fact that some people have more daughters than sons. Daughter will pass on their genes more then men. Yamnaya married european women and their genes were absorbed into the european women pool. Look at R1B Iberians for example or Italian r1b etc. Iberian of Yamnaya descent did this twice. First by being absorbed by the natives in Iberia and then mixing again with native american women and getting absorbed by them. There&#039;s also the fact that Early European Farmer + Native American + West African doesn&#039;t result in lighter skin since the lightest is EEF. Unlike Anglos (Yamnaya Majority) who have lighter skin so the bleaching results in whiter Anglo-Natives. They also don&#039;t have west african DNA like south americans. South Americans need more Yamnaya stock in their DNA for their european recessive traits to appear on the surface. Basically marry Germanic American women.

The problem is that I don&#039;t know what his worship was like, but only his mythos.<br>The most famous one says that at the beginning of time there were two beings in the world, Tup\u00e3 and Jurupari, Tup\u00e3 was &quot;a kind of saint, a moral summit, devoted to doing good, who had very few followers&quot; and Jurupari was &quot;the incarnation of the devil who dedicated himself to partying, dancing, drinking, music and pleasure, who was followed by many people&quot;. Tup\u00e3 was jealous of Juripari and on an unlucky day he decided to burn him in a bonfire, so women followers of Jurupari came to collect his ashes, but instead they found a palm tree that they felled and used to make flutes that reproduced Jurupari&#039;s voice. Women used these magic flutes at parties where they got drunk and danced erotically with men. The Sun sent Jurupari to be reborn on Earth through a virgin and he became a lawgiver very similar to Moses among the natives who transformed their matriarchal society into a patriarchal one. So only men could use Jurupari&#039;s magic flutes.<br>As I like Mesopotamian/Canaanite/Egyptian/Gre<wbr>co-Roman Paganism, I wanted to syncretize with that to fill this empty, but I also have the option of choosing Abrahamic Satanism because the Jesuits demonized Jurupari.

There\u2019s nothing inherently gay about being promiscuous, but being gay makes you inherently promiscuous (and thus prone to high-risk of STD behavior).<br>Like I said, homosexuality is less about liking men than it is about liking sex. The modern conception of homosexuality creates confusion, and saying that gays were \u201cborn this way\u201d is a novel way to obfuscate time-tested truths. After all, it was in the DSM, until politics casted it\u2019s opinion on science.<br><br>Idea: women, who have 0 refractory period and a different libido, experience sexuality totally different than men, so \u201chomosexuality\u201d for females is different than male homosexuality. I\u2019d go so far as to say women are never fully gay (in the Kinsey sense), so its safe exclude them from this concept. Since men are the only true homosexuals, the female lack of libido isn\u2019t proof against homosexuality being a different name (or subset of) hypersexuality. If a woman was \u201chypersexual,\u201d she could easily find a heterosexual partner; a man could not, so he embeds this (destructive) idea in his mind that sex with men is normal. It\u2019s such a deep-seated idea that he\u2019ll say he\u2019s \u201cborn this way,\u201d as if that logic would apply to anything else about him. Even personality/temperament changes over time. In truth, the man just wanted to fuck something, and homosexuality developed later as his fetish for men (he was born hypersexual). <br><br>By you saying there\u2019s a strong discrepancy between male and female sex drives, you imply that men are more sexual; therefore, sex with men is a strategy to be able to have more sex (as a man)<br><br>In conclusion: you\u2019re not gay, you\u2019re a sex addict with a fetish for men, which correlates to having more diseases.
