The &quot;learning English as an aspirational measure&quot; was strongarmed by the likes of O&#039;Connell and other pro-British rule leaders in the 1800s and opposed by others. <br><br>But the idea that being forced to learn English to not live in absolute poverty is somehow anyone&#039;s fault other than England&#039;s is also retarded.<br>Jesus christ, anon.<br><br>The actual answer is:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;despite Britain having left Ireland over 100 years ago?</span><br>The end of the Irish revolution was not a victory for the revolution, but the defeat of it. Yes, the IRA beat Britain-but then they were beaten by a counter revolution. Ireland emerged in 1922 as a partitioned dominion of the British Empire, with the corridors of power controlled by pro-Empire conservatives (and fascists) the vast majority of whom didn&#039;t care at all about a cultural revival, or at the very least cared more about making sure Republicans never got into power.<br><br>Ireland was remodelled away from revolution and toward economy, economy, economy, by design and not by fault. The Free State-and subsequently, the Republic of Ireland, took an extremely moderate approach to all politics and the cultural revolution fell by the wayside because it was often perceived as too hostile to Britain or too &quot;useless&quot; economically.<br><br>There&#039;s a reason that the strongest and best Irish language communities in Ireland are grassroots ones and not state-sponsored ones.", "time": 1675509339, "resto": 14572679}, {"no": 14576584, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:59:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14575518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14575518</a><br>being slaves to globohomo", "time": 1675511944, "resto": 14572679}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14576562, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:38:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Would Goebbels really hate Hans Landa like this?", "filename": "Screenshot_20230204_123632_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1153, "tn_w": 234, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675510734197616, "time": 1675510734, "md5": "eduEKIzime/GR+Vge9DleQ==", "fsize": 170343, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "would-goebbels-really-hate-hans-landa-like-this", "replies": 3, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 14576567, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:41:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14576562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14576562</a><br>Need a link to this AI", "time": 1675510869, "resto": 14576562}, {"no": 14576573, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:44:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14576567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14576567</a><br>https://beta.character.ai/chat?char<wbr>=91vwIfQFVTzDhvcLd98JolnZ8JJ3uAIK_n<wbr>AitVkgrtA<br><br>I can&#039;t believe this is actually a thing", "filename": "Screenshot_20230204_124251_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1079, "h": 1418, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675511041781923, "time": 1675511041, "md5": "r52rpRveZtZ4chumcssF4g==", "fsize": 393540, "resto": 14576562}, {"no": 14576583, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:58:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14576573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14576573</a><br>Thx", "time": 1675511897, "resto": 14576562}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14576126, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:02:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Built for BBC.", "filename": "1674572230060166m", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675494130910883, "time": 1675494130, "md5": "t/mUY8rLAugrTL/sW8wnqw==", "fsize": 96024, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "built-for-bbc", "replies": 4, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 14576139, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:07:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14576126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14576126</a><br>blacks are a race of dwarfs", "time": 1675494457, "resto": 14576126}, {"no": 14576151, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:12:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Imagine her giving birth to some ugly ass mulatto half breed, slowly africanizing the white race until only ugly african mutts remain of what once was the white race", "time": 1675494754, "resto": 14576126}, {"no": 14576159, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:16:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14576126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14576126</a><br>I&#039;ll tell you what&#039;s made for BBC. <br>Gonorrhea.", "filename": "built for bbc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 350, "h": 178, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 63, "tim": 1675494984930928, "time": 1675494984, "md5": "e15cHvyS3hE8t5Eui1uUKQ==", "fsize": 18836, "resto": 14576126}, {"no": 14576580, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:55:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14576151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14576151</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slowly africanizing</span><br>She is purifying the White race of its lowest elements by removing herself and her bloodline from the White genepool.

Corruption is the number one problem for most developing countries; Britain provided an administrative class that were both competent and honest.

Omniscience Paradox<br>Strict Determinist: If God is all knowing we don\u2019t have free will because he knows everything that we will do in the future, which means the future is predetermined. He already knows who will or will not die a sinner the moment they are born. If God is omniscient he already knows what he will do in the future too, which means he also lacks free will<br>Compatibilist: God can create a world where we theoretically could sin, but no one would actually want to do it so it never happens. However he hasn\u2019t done that<br><br>2. Heaven and free will<br>If Heaven has free will then God is capable of creating a world of eternal bliss with no suffering, that also has free will, yet doesn\u2019t do that<br><br>If Heaven lacks free will then free will isn\u2019t particularly valuable. We will spend eternity with no free will anyways, our short lives with free will is working towards this as a goal. Religion portrays Heaven as a reward, something desirable, so it is admitting that an eternity of bliss with no free will is preferable over a short life filled with suffering with free will.<br><br>3. Degree of evil<br>God can create an exact replica of our current world, but make one heinous evil impossible to commit, like rape. We would still have free will and live in an objectively better world<br><br>If you object and say that isn\u2019t free will, the rebuttal is God decides what is or isn\u2019t possible. I can\u2019t phase through walls or stop time in this world, does that mean I lack free will?

Her genital region was exposed, dimly; it had the appearance of a thick mat of hair. She was stroking herself, absent-mindedly.

It&#039;s funny, I think there is a natural affinity with Russians in China. I was reading comments on a fairly nationalistic Chinese site about this balloon, and they were posting &quot;Kirov reporting!&quot; like the fucking Red Alert blimp. This is why I think the CCP is gonna hold strong too because they saw what happened in Russia which led to a huge race to the bottom.<br><br>But look at it this way: an average Russian is in a weird situation right now. In the USSR after WWII, they were told &quot;war is bad&quot; after literal centuries of it, and the desire to live a life that&#039;s safe and where you can plan ahead for at least a year in advance. Boom, 90s, Chechen wars, 2008 financial crisis, 2014 sanctions, COVID, boom, another war. Absolutely outside your control, everything goes to shit again. If you can&#039;t afford to leave, you are now once again surrounded by enemies who want you dead or at least poor and humiliated. It&#039;s not even without merit, of course, but Russians can be like, if we lose this (even if our government started it), it&#039;s ~back to the 90s~ or maybe worse. That&#039;s what people think whether that&#039;s true or not. <br><br>With so much historical stuff happening with relatively small time intervals, the desire to be left alone is much more prevalent than certain ambitions to &quot;make it big.&quot; Even if you distrust what the government says (most are skeptical), most people simply don&#039;t care, because they want to be left alone. Russian patriotism is also weird. They have the hotheads and ultras, but there&#039;s a weird desire for self-expression, combined with the fear for the future, a &quot;not this shit again&quot; sorta feel, combined with the repressed desire to be proud of one&#039;s country. It&#039;s a strange cultural thing. You couldn&#039;t do it that much, in fear of being called a Nazi after around 2011-2012 when Putin locked up / repressed (and literally killed) &quot;ethnic Russian&quot; ultranationalists who were attacking immigrants from ex-USSR countries.<br><br>https://youtu.be/txh4CUmq4fw", "filename": "5039590-85903845035", "ext": ".png", "w": 849, "h": 466, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 68, "tim": 1675489942624471, "time": 1675489942, "md5": "BuBZZTHCa+LRgxeo/tBw1A==", "fsize": 399167, "resto": 14575142}, {"no": 14576171, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:21:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14575927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14575927</a><br>Another thing that I\u2019d like to hear your two cents on is the fact that I believe modern Russia combines stoicism with a lack of any real ideas. <br>Previously for centuries Russians were United in their orthodox faith, patriotism, loyalty to the tsar, etc etc. Then that set of right wing ideals was totally crushed under German industrial firepower in WW1.
