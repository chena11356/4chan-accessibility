However, this only accounts for the universe as it exists now. The singularity that became the universe had to have come from somewhere that much is true but, the conditions that caused this singularity to arise is a complete mystery. The ‘universe before the universe’ so to speak is and will most likely always be an unknown to us but I would like to put forward the idea that the ‘universe’ before our universe could have worked in a vastly different way than it does now. Just how metal will work differently when it is a liquid to when it is a solid, what makes the universe may work differently as it expands outwards compared to everything else outside of it. Perhaps that is why things become more ethereal as we go further back in our universe&#039;s history because things just stop working the same way. I should say this isn’t what I think happened, just an idea to demonstrate that this singularity can be made by an uncaused universe. In a way you are correct, this ‘universe outside the universe’ idea still makes a distinction between inside our universe and outside of it but it is still the universe being a mover in it of itself rather than an intentional creation by a mover.<br><br>As for your claims that this mover is the God of the Bible I am genuinely curious how you came to this conclusion because, as far as I can tell, your proof points towards A non-descript mover not the specific God of the Bible.', 'time': 1670666941, 'resto': 14305367}, {'no': 14306794, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:23:49', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p14306575"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;14306575</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;your proof points toward a non-descript mover and not the specific God of the Bible.</span><br><br>Perhaps a cursory reading of my posts might lead one to believe that the God that I&#039;m advocating for is one such Aristotelian abstraction, but that is not my intention. The purpose is irrefutably set forth that those who deny the existence of God go against the abundant testimony afforded to us by natural revelation. As Paul says, &quot;the known of God is manifest among them, for God has revealed it to them. For from the creation of the world His invisible qualities, both His eternal power and divinity, are clearly seen, being understood by the things made, for them to be without excuse.&quot; Romans 1:19-20. is that much of the physical phenomena relayed.<br><br>As to bridging the connection between the ill-defined, hypothetical deity of philosophical speculation and the Triune God of Christianity, there is abundant testimony in the Scriptures concerning specific physical phenomena related to God&#039;s governance over creation; phenomena otherwise undiscovered by man until the advent of contemporary scientific research. I&#039;ll list just a few examples.<br><br>Genesis 1:1-5 describes God&#039;s initial act of creation. This shining forth of radiant light as the first principle matches up with the cosmologists&#039; estimates that in the few picoseconds after the &#039;singularity&#039; there would have been a massive amount of energy released as heat and light. The CMBR is what remains of that initial creative act. The mention of God &quot;dividing the light from the darkness&quot; as though they were two distinct substances is especially relevant now that the existence and of dark matter and dark energy have been verified and become subjects of increasingly in-depth scientific research. This is but one example of Scripture&#039;s supernatural origin, but an extremely important one nonetheless.', 'time': 1670671429, 'resto': 14305367}, {'no': 14306869, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)07:09:00', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p14306575"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;14306575</a><br>Further testimonies include:<br><br>Genesis 22:17 and Jeremiah 33:22, which testify to the innumerable quantity of heavenly bodies that God has created. Most of these celestial entities would go unnoticed and undocumented until the invention of high power telescopes in the late 19th and the early 20th century. <br><br>Isaiah 40:22, Psalm 104:2, and Job 26:7, which disclose the spherical shape of the earth centuries before the Greeks attempted a formal proof, the gradual and increasing expansion of &quot;the heavens&quot; aka spacetime, and the attractive force of gravity in maintaining the earth&#039;s fixed place in the cosmos.<br><br>Ecclesiastes 1:6-7 and Job 26:8, 36:27-29 describe the water cycle with remarkable detail. Job 28:5 plainly teaches the molten core and hot mantle beneath the earth&#039;s surface. <br><br>Isaiah 45:18 likewise teaches the uniqueness of earth in the universe as being a place &#039;tailor-made&#039; for life to flourish. Cosmological fine-tuning is certainly in view. <br><br>Finally, Isaiah 24:4-6, Psalm 102: 25-26, and Romans 8:20-22 communicate that the entropy, disorder, and senescence are all linked to the curse placed on creation as a result of man&#039;s first transgression.<br><br>All of this factual knowledge conveyed by a religious book written hundreds of years before the first inklings natural philosophical investigation or scientific tools. How could it be anything else but the very Word of God? <br><br>The whole purpose of this thread was to examine whether or not a classically Theistic worldview is rationally coherent and evidentially supported. Not only is the answer a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot;, but it is an answer that points conclusively to the Living God of Christianity as the only historic deity that fulfills the criteria of an eternal, transcendent, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent supreme being. <br><br>Repent, therefore, and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the Holy Spirit.', 'time': 1670674140, 'resto': 14305367}]",88.0,0.0

An early report of 1535 refers that while the Emperor was considered the &quot;son of the Sun&quot;, the Vilaoma was the &quot;servant or slave of the Sun&quot;. <br>Although, it is reported that at the beginning of Guayna Capac&#039;s rule, the position of Vilaoma was removed from office and Guayna Capac personally assumed the role of High priest of the Sun.<br>However, the name took importance again in the government of Manco Inca, after European contact, this Vilaoma, who like Manco and Paullo, supposedly was one of the hundreds of sons of Guayna Capac, took a leading role in Manco&#039;s rebellion, as the chief commander in the siege of Cusco, his real name isn&#039;t known, the chronicles speak of him as if Vilaoma was his personal name (making a distinction between the historical title, &quot;the Vilaoma&quot;, and the right hand of Manco, Vilaoma), it was common to change names according to the stages of life, so this may be the case here.<br>Anyways, the name Vilaoma probably derives from the words: &quot;Willay&quot; which means to communicate, probably in relation to the sacred oracles or waka (super important for Incan religion), and his role as royal advisor, and &quot;Oma&quot; may come either from uma or head in Quechua or more probably oma/uma water in Aymara and specifically referring to the still existing province of Omasuyos (meaning water province), an area of intense religiosity in relation to the cult of Tunupa/Wiracocha, and just north of Tiahuanaco, where Manco Inca was supposedly born, and probably why he had more support from representatives of the Collasuyo (one of the 4 main divisions of the kingdom) than anywhere else.<br>In this drawing, he&#039;s seen with a chin adornment and a chacrahinca head insignia, both adornments were very characteristic of Collasuyu ethnic aristocracy.",vilaoma,.jpg,1148,1380,207,250,1670558572278156,1670558572,XXvtm+5DnJVIb1Undod7vA==,623634,0,,lets-talk-about-amerindian-religious,24,14,1670660672,0.0,0.0,"[{'no': 14303339, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)13:13:49', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p14303331"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;14303331</a><br>(cont.)<br>The people called these huancaquilli, that is, disinherited and detached from all riches, and withdrawn (from society) and there was even a time when the old sorcerers went to have another such solitude in the mountain. <br>There they contemplated the sun, the moon, the stars and reverenced them without ceasing.

Sometimes wakas were destroyed, and there were even people specialized in verifying that a waka still had power or that it was fake. <br>Other than that, among many others, the Incas worshipped Inti (Sun) and Wiracocha as their principal gods and erected lots of temples in honor of the Sun, each particular emperor could be more inclined to either of them and their worship was imposed over their vassals, not that it was much needed as many people already did worship them in some way or another, some didn&#039;t though, in the coast, the Chimu king questioned the Sun worship as in the hot desertic coast where he lived it brought droughts and famine, reasoning that his veneration was convenient for highland people but not for them. On rare occasions ancient local cults with their own independent clergy were left in place, and could even become favored wakas of certain emperors, this was pretty rare but it happened for Pachacamac and Catequil. But for its unfavorable predictions, the cult of Catequil would be eventually destroyed first by Wayna Qhapaq and later by Atahualpa who also planned on destroying Pachacamac.', 'time': 1670628064, 'resto': 14301149}, {'no': 14306395, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)03:24:32', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'based andean architecture anon (probably?)<br><br>maybe i&#039;ll dump stuff on Mesoamerican priesthood but i&#039;m pretty busy', 'time': 1670660672, 'resto': 14301149}]",19.0,13.0

Three days later, the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal was taken and burnt to the ground. The royal family perished in the fire, while the grand prince retreated northward.

Females fall into modern success via complacency, also the system of &quot;sit around and listen&quot; that schools have implemented is more attuned to their learning style. <br>Even with every advantage, females will never be the people who advance our species, and make the next great steps in thought, science, or art. Some small amount may, but the way our species works doesn&#039;t select for greatness or variability in females. Females have always been the sex that is there solely to continue the species. Evolution in humans is driven through male genetics. Male&#039;s are more likely to experience genetic mutation, and although genetics is 50/50 split between mother and father, the father&#039;s genetics are dominant. Both of these FACTS show that evolution in humans occurs through male genetics. It means that male genetics are more significant and influential. And the reason for that is because it is through males that our species makes advances. This means that having a genetically blessed mother is less beneficial than having a genetically blessed father. And the reason THIS occurred is because genetic competition for females is far less than genetic competition for males. The only requirement for a female to have offspring is &#039;be available and fertile&#039;. A beautiful smart woman is just as likely to have kids as a hideous idiot one, because straight men are pathetic. For males, genetic success indicates survival, capability, and being chosen as worthy, and for especially successful males, that can mean multiple children with multiple females. This is why 80% of females throughout human history have had children, where as only 40% of males have.', 'time': 1670641197, 'resto': 14302817}, {'no': 14305436, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)22:00:59', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p14305429"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;14305429</a><br>It honestly makes you wonder why are species births are 49% female and 51% male.

She said, &quot;If I am healed, I will go and worship all of the avodah zarah in the world.&quot; She was healed, and went to worship all of the avodah zarah in the world. But when she came to the avodah zarah of Peor, she asked [one of] the priests, &quot;How do you worship this one?&quot; He said, &quot;You eat and drink laxatives and defecate in its face.&quot; She said, &quot;I would rather be sick again than to worship avodah zarah like this!&quot;.&quot;</span>', 'filename': '1668183228964-0', 'ext': '.jpg', 'w': 300, 'h': 450, 'tn_w': 83, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670634863644639, 'time': 1670634863, 'md5': 'cer8uWjZgN9L5OJ/Sa+T5g==', 'fsize': 18863, 'resto': 14304313}, {'no': 14305091, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)20:22:06', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;14305082</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The question is: What was the appeal of Baal Peor?
