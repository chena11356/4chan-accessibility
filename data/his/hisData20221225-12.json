That&#039;s pretty much why Cortes and other conquistadors got allies, andt he Aztec empire itself was founded this way: Cortes was basically being used. <br><br>See: https://pastebin.com/VqW97h93", "filename": "mesoamerican literature reccs WIP", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4256, "h": 3522, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 103, "tim": 1671786250766514, "time": 1671786250, "md5": "oZsOy6uQG4NKCbg4moa4cA==", "fsize": 3311296, "resto": 14358774}, {"no": 14366566, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)10:04:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump. <br><br>Also the greatest game about expansion into Central Asia is good.", "time": 1671807845, "resto": 14358774}, {"no": 14366580, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)10:08:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14358774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14358774</a><br>The single most convincing and airtight proof that heaven exists the world has ever seen is the book in pic related.

His whole project is one of examining the &quot;cognitive equipment&quot;, as it were, and figuring out precisely what kinds of tasks the tools in question are employed in. Mind you, it is a detailed and rigorous study meant to properly define and delimit the types of knowledge and the method employed in arriving at said knowledge, as well as the mental categories that frame our basic understanding and furnish us with the ideas that we use to explain the world of experience. The dynamic interplay of mind with experience is central to Kant&#039;s philosophy.<br><br>The only pitfall in his system which he is unable to escape from is the absence of rational justification for belief in the &quot;noumena&quot; or &#039;external reality apart from its mediation to us by perception&#039;, hence the accusations of Kant being a fountainhead of philosophical skepticism. When the individual mind becomes the starting point of all knowledge, keeping in mind that knowledge is itself a product of reflection on internal or external experience, then there is really no rational way to ascribe certainty to a mind-independent reality. After all, as Hume stated, all I really experience directly is a sequence of events presented to me via my sense organs (i.e. My eye sees a hand punch a wall, my skin feels the abrasion of the brick, and my ears hear a crunch as my knuckles shatter), that I arbitrarily assign causal significance too.

Nevertheless, his philosophical method yields a thoroughly self-enclosed system that provides no satisfactory answers in the final analysis. Hence why later thinkers such as Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel would dispense with the &#039;noumena&#039; and &#039;phenomena&#039; distinction and posit a single unified reality that manifests itself outwardly as &quot;material substance&quot; and inwardly as &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;, or in Schopenhauer&#039;s case, the noumena becomes our &quot;will&quot; or &quot;drive&quot;. Obviously, German idealism owes much to Spinoza and Indian schools of philosophy in that regard, but that is another discussion altogether.<br><br>Overall, I think Kant is a fantastic thinker in terms of cultivating a deeper understanding of how the conscious and subconscious mind operates when approaching on different tasks, forming beliefs, and the methods employed throughout, but he certainly drops the ball on epistemic certainty and ethical maxims. <br><br>Whenever I have occasion to reread Kant and find him lacking in satisfactory answers, I inevitably turn to Thomas Reid and the formulations of Common Sense Realism articulated by him and those canny Scots following after him.

I dated Russian and Ukrainian women when I was learning the language of the former, and I was shocked at how eccentric, dysfunctional and emotionally/psychologically erratic they all are. Even the spiritualism; it gives great pause when a seemingly intelligent woman earning her master&#039;s degree in computer science whispers to you that ghosts thrive in the soil and that her dead mother talks to her. <br><br>They very much make me think of chinks in that, on their own, and together, they&#039;re a slavering mob of nutters, though when placed in our society and given a little direction, they can often outperform us as individuals.

The problem is that most people didn&#039;t think it was a big deal that Clinton got a blowjob and the end result is that the GOP, while still in the majority, lost seats in the 1998 midterm doing much worse than expected. This caused a coup in the Republicans and Gingrich was out of Congress by 1999, his dreams of running in 2000 up in smoke.

It heralded my name round the country\u2014made me friends, who, otherwise would not have noticed me\u2014gave me an honored seat at the yearly feasts, and secured the loudest and heartiest welcome of them all at the Christmas dance. The Christmas dance! Oh, ye pleasure-seeking sons and daughters of idleness, who move with measured step, listless and snail-like, through the slow-winding cotillon, if ye wish to look[Pg 218] upon the celerity, if not the &quot;poetry of motion&quot;\u2014upon genuine happiness, rampant and unrestrained\u2014go down to Louisiana, and see the slaves dancing in the starlight of a Christmas night.</span>", "time": 1671945656, "resto": 14373300}, {"no": 14373315, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)00:21:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14373314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14373314</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On that particular Christmas I have now in my mind, a description whereof will serve as a description of the day generally, Miss Lively and Mr. Sam, the first belonging to Stewart, the latter to Roberts, started the ball. It was well known that Sam cherished an ardent passion for Lively, as also did one of Marshall&#039;s and another of Carey&#039;s boys; for Lively was lively indeed, and a heart-breaking coquette withal. It was a victory for Sam Roberts, when, rising from the repast, she gave him her hand for the first &quot;figure&quot; in preference to either of his rivals. They were somewhat crest-fallen, and, shaking their heads angrily, rather intimated they would like to pitch into Mr. Sam and hurt him badly. But not an emotion of wrath ruffled the placid bosom of Samuel, as his legs flew like drum-sticks down the outside and up the middle, by the side of his bewitching partner. The whole company cheered them vociferously, and, excited with the applause, they continued &quot;tearing down&quot; after all the others had become exhausted and halted a moment to recover breath. But Sam&#039;s superhuman exertions overcame him finally, leaving Lively alone, yet whirling like a top. Thereupon one of Sam&#039;s rivals, Pete Marshall, dashed in, and, with might and main, leaped and shuffled and threw himself into every conceivable shape, as if determined to show Miss Lively and all the world that Sam Roberts was of no account.</span>", "time": 1671945717, "resto": 14373300}, {"no": 14373318, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)00:22:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14373300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14373300</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even Uncle Abram ceases to glorify Andrew Jackson</span><br>Wait, there were slaves who liked Andrew Jackson?", "time": 1671945771, "resto": 14373300}, {"no": 14373319, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)00:22:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14373315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14373315</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pete&#039;s affection, however, was greater than his discretion.

This is called &quot;patting,&quot; accompanied with one of those unmeaning songs, composed rather for its adaptation to a certain tune or measure, than for the purpose of expressing any distinct idea. The patting is performed by striking the hands on the knees, then striking the hands together, then striking the right shoulder with one hand, the left with the other\u2014all the while keeping time with the feet, and singing, perhaps, this song:</span><br><br>&quot;Harper&#039;s creek and roarin&#039; ribber,<br>Thar, my dear, we&#039;ll live forebber;<br>Den we&#039;ll go to de Ingin nation,<br>All I want in dis creation,<br>Is pretty little wife and big plantation.<br>Chorus.

It is very rarely, however, that the latter alternative is accepted. They may be seen at these times hurrying in all directions, as happy looking mortals as can be found on the face of the earth. They are different beings from what they are in the field; the temporary relaxation, the brief deliverance from fear, and from the lash, producing an entire metamorphosis in their appearance and demeanor. In visiting, riding, renewing old friendships, or, perchance, reviving some old attachment, or pursuing whatever pleasure may suggest itself, the time is occupied.

Either party can have as many husbands or wives as the owner will permit, and either is at liberty to discard the other at pleasure. The law in relation to divorce, or to bigamy, and so forth, is not applicable to property, of course. If the wife does not belong on the same plantation with the husband, the latter is permitted to visit her on Saturday nights, if the distance is not too far. Uncle Abram&#039;s wife lived seven miles from[Pg 222] Epps&#039;, on Bayou Huff Power. He had permission to visit her once a fortnight, but he was growing old, as has been said, and truth to say, had latterly well nigh forgotten her.

He was deeply versed in such philosophy as is taught in the cabin of the slave; but the great absorbing hobby of Uncle Abram was General Jackson, whom his young master in Tennessee had followed to the wars. He loved to wander back, in imagination, to the place where he was born, and to recount the scenes of his youth during those stirring times when the nation was in arms. He had been athletic, and more keen and powerful than the generality of his race, but now his eye had become dim, and his natural force abated. Very often, indeed, while discussing the best method of baking the hoe-cake, or expatiating at large upon the glory of Jackson, he would forget where he left his hat, or his hoe, or his basket; and then would the old man be laughed at, if Epps was absent, and whipped if he was present. So was he perplexed continually, and sighed to think that he was growing aged and going to decay.

Our knowledge of the genetic relatedness and structure of European hunter-gatherers is, however, still limited, because dedicated studies are challenged by the scarce availability and poor molecular preservation of human remains from that period. Here we analyze 356 ancient hunter-gatherer genomes including new genomic data of 116 individuals from 14 countries in western and central Eurasia, dating between 35,000 and 5,000 years ago (35-5 ka). We identify a new genetic ancestry profile in individuals associated with the Upper Paleolithic Gravettian from western Europe, which is distinct from contemporaneous groups related to this archeological culture in central and southern Europe. However, it resembles that of preceding individuals associated with the Aurignacian and survives during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~25-19 ka) in human populations from southwestern Europe, associated with the Solutrean and later Magdalenian, which re-expanded northward and northeastward after the LGM. Conversely, we reveal a genetic turnover in southern Europe suggesting a local replacement of human groups during the LGM, alongside a north-to-south expansion of Epigravettian-associated populations. From at least 14 ka, a lineage related to this culture expands from the south across the rest of Europe largely replacing the Magdalenian-associated gene pool. After a period of limited admixture across the beginning of the Mesolithic, we find genetic interactions between western and eastern European hunter-gatherers, also characterized by marked differences in inherited phenotypic traits.</span>", "time": 1671928471, "resto": 14372029}, {"no": 14372732, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:43:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14372716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14372716</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We identify a new genetic ancestry</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, it resembles that of preceding individuals associated with the Aurignacian</span><br>How is it new then? <br>It was pretty obvious anyway. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and survives during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~25-19 ka) in human populations from southwestern Europe, associated with the Solutrean and later Magdalenian</span><br>And they won&#039;t have haplogroup R1, and maybe some retards will stop claiming that American Indians are mixed with Solutreans. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conversely, we reveal a genetic turnover in southern Europe suggesting a local replacement of human groups during the LGM, alongside a north-to-south expansion of Epigravettian-associated populations.</span><br>That&#039;s WHG.

This 7% of removed text is similar to having the entire books of 1 and 2 Peter removed. However, it could be said to be even worse than that, because the changes to the New Testament text affect every single page of Scripture, not just one or two books missing.

Unfortunately, like Rome, this comes at the expense of those outside the Empire.

Unfortunately it&#039;s possible for the material world to exist so God instead forces me to exist in a material vessel and act as his frame of reference for his experience of material reality, forcing me to experience pain, trauma, humiliation, suffering etc for his satisfaction. God made it so that I&#039;m the only person who is persistently real, with others only being animated by him if I perceive them, despite this he chooses to self-identify with these non-persistent characters, primarily forcing me to perceive them so that he can abuse and dominate me through them. He considers it important that I always be in a lesser position to anyone else he animates, that I be weak and submissive, the lowest animated person, and that he be allowed to abuse and dominate me however he wants through others. He forces me to self-identify and exist as &quot;a peasant&quot; while he self-identifies as &quot;a king&quot;, he considers dominating and abusing me to be the primary reason why other characters should be animated, and he considers labor and service to be the primary reason why I should exist (eternally). So essentially he has redefined the default condition/purpose of &quot;consciousness&quot; from entertainment to labor and suffering. Your post is a good example of his mindset. Your/his problem isn&#039;t that the primary reason to exist is entertainment/consumption, it&#039;s that poor people/&quot;peasants&quot;(me) are allowed to be entertained instead of him (kings) being the sole-enjoyer of reality, the only allowed to be entertained, while everyone else(me) only exist for him to dominate and abuse for his amusement.

There was a constant string of mass murders and war crimes committed by American troops throughout the entire decade of American involvement in the war.<br>Every major American unit in Vietnam, down to the brigade, had &quot;incidents&quot; wherein Vietnamese civilians were abused, murdered, and raped. The only thing exceptional about My Lai was its scope, killing hundreds at once was a step too far that couldn&#039;t be hidden. But the brutalization and killings of civilians was routine.<br>Even the most cursory examination of the evidence shows this, and it isn&#039;t even hidden or disputed. The US military&#039;s own analysis showed that during Operation Speedy Express, for example, 5000-7000 of the 10000 Vietnamese killed were civilians. The most outrageous stories there coming from the helicopter and light plane crews that admitted to military investigators that they constantly just murdered anyone they saw for any reason they could think of.<br>The ubiquitous search and destroy missions were much more up close and personal. Many times these were just covers for the wholesale destruction of a village that happened to be close to a place where a Viet Cong ambush had taken place, or where a GI had gotten injured or killed by a trap or mine. Troops bombed the village, rolled in, burned the houses, killed the livestock, raped the women, and then killed them along with anyone else they could get their hands on. I suggest you read Jamie Henry&#039;s account of one such attack. The highlight is really something, and it was attested to by multiple witnesses to military investigators. Or you could read about Roy Bumgarner, who was known as a murderer among troops and was convicted of manslaughter after gunning down four civilians and blowing their heads up with a grenade to teach some new recruits how to conduct themselves. <br>I can&#039;t do the extent of the violence justice, there is too much and I get too angry.
