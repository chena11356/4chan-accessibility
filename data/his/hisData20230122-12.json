Unlike Russia, China, Italy, Germany and others who were united by the struggle of their populations, it was not Indians who united India. Indians inherited a country from Britain. In fact, India had never been united in history. You can go as far back in history as you like: there never was one and only one political and military authority in the whole of the Indian subcontinent (no, not even the Maurya) until the British conquest. China was united by Chinese revolutionaries (in a bloody civil war, but nevertheless). Russia was united by Russian czars (in a series of brutal wars of expansion, but nevertheless). Germany was united by Bismark. Etc The only other major country of Asia that was united and created by a colonial power is Indonesia (a former Dutch colony). Nigeria is another British invention, another country that one can view as either a model of multi-ethnic and multi-religious integration or as a legacy of the imperial age (most of African countries are colonial inventions).</span><br>https://www.scaruffi.com/politics/i<wbr>ndia13.html", "filename": "scaruffi", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674358772802544, "time": 1674358772, "md5": "pXvJb23CkJMiOZlvSGrhZw==", "fsize": 245188, "resto": 14510112}, {"no": 14510914, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)22:56:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14510112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14510112</a><br>Isn&#039;t it interesting how confident you are about your barely comprehensible post that is based on one of the only things you&#039;ve read all the way through: a reference book that covers fifty years of history?", "time": 1674359794, "resto": 14510112}, {"no": 14510928, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:07:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14510812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14510812</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;china is far superior to india</span><br>i wouldn&#039;t say superior, more so China is more dynamic.

It is a pity that the precious words which embody God\u2019s ordinance are to be found nowhere in the Bible today. The Talmud, however, does mention this subject in the following words:<br>To him who kills a single individual of Israel, it shall be reckoned as if he had slain the whole race and he who preserves a single individual of Israel, it shall be reckoned in the Book of God as if he had preserved the whole world. The Talmud also mentions that in trials for murder, the Israelite judges used to address the witnesses as follows:<br>Whoever kills one person, merits punishment as if he had slain all the men in the world.<br>This means that the survival of human life depends on everyone respecting other human beings and in contributing actively to the survival and protection of others. Whosoever kills unrighteously is thus not merely guilty of doing wrong to one single person, but proves by his act that his heart is devoid of respect for human life and of sympathy for the human species as such. Such a person, therefore, is an enemy of all mankind. This is so because he happens to be possessed of a quality which, were it to become common to all men, would lead to the destruction of the entire human race. The person who helps to preserve the life of even one person, on the other hand, is the protector of the whole of humanity, for he possesses a quality which is indispensable to the survival of mankind.", "time": 1674378917, "resto": 14510112}, {"no": 14511660, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:16:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14511483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14511483</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The best way to ensure this is a fragmented China</span><br>How do you even achieve that", "time": 1674379013, "resto": 14510112}, {"no": 14511664, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:18:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14511660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14511660</a>", "filename": "China_linguistic_map", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 896, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674379113634742, "time": 1674379113, "md5": "NwIyyPhpGPqC4BukEg5Vkg==", "fsize": 145837, "resto": 14510112}, {"no": 14511665, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:18:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14511529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14511529</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This was the purpose of Afghanistan as well.

Blame humans for taking things that were said out of context. I don&#039;t think the passages that are supposed to be about hell were describing a literal place and either the author or bible scholars or evangelist and readers of the word some how in their minds formed the idea that this was a literal place and that we really go there. The bible isn&#039;t a complete lie there&#039;s just a lot of things in it and about it that have taken out of context and misinterpreted. Hell seems so real because of the energy we all collectively put into believing it&#039;s real. When Moses was given the 10 commandments, there wasn&#039;t a special clause at the bottom that said, &quot;Oh yea, and if you break these you gotta do 180&#039;s in hell&quot;. There aren&#039;t sentences and penalties for things we do in life, just aren&#039;t. Much of the bible is true but certain things are just not. But that&#039;s not Jesus fault. People larped back then just like they do today. That&#039;s why you come here, to see you if could survive in a world with religion, crime, suffering, evil, negativity. When you get swallowed up by religion and truly brainwashed you become a lost soul until you awaken to the fact that there is no hell. We&#039;re all going to the same place when we die. Jesus was real but your fate isn&#039;t in Jesus hands and people that do evil aren&#039;t going to hell, there just bringing on bad karma on themselves and whatever they are doing has most likely been pre-planned. You&#039;re not better than those who don&#039;t believe what you believe and they aren&#039;t lost and there is sin but there aren&#039;t penalties for sin.

In the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will triumph. Within three to nine years.\u201d [ar-R\u016bm 30: 2-4] From 613-619 CE, the Byzantines were absolutely decimated by the Persian Empire, losing the territories of Antioch, then Damascus, then Armenia, then their most cherished Jerusalem, then Chalcedon, and finally Egypt. In his book, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon says, \u201cAt the time when this prediction is said to have been delivered, no prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment, since the first twelve years of Heraclius announced the approaching dissolution of the empire.\u201d2 Everyone saw Byzantium as on its deathbed; thus opponents of the Prophet \ufdfa like Ubayy b. Khalaf mocked this \u201cpreposterous\u201d foretelling in the Qur\u2019an. However, not long after, Heraclius led the Byzantine Crusade like a dagger into the heart of the Persian Empire, fulfilling the amazing prophecy 6-8 years after it was uttered.<br><br>here&#039;s another prophecy :<br>\u201cAnd if you see the barefoot, naked, shepherds of camels competing [for praise] in the construction of high-rise buildings, then this is from among the signs [of the Hour].\u201d<br>today we can see countries such as the uae and saudi arabia that were formerly shepherds competing for the tallest buildings in the world. <br><br><br>how did an illiterate man 1400 years ago know this?", "filename": "William Montgomery Watt", "ext": ".png", "w": 521, "h": 705, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674296591957405, "time": 1674296591, "md5": "rrTKmVn8V26ymoTUnqKPZw==", "fsize": 303460, "resto": 14506636}, {"no": 14506769, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)05:24:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14506742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14506742</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You said you see beautiful scenery but you don&#039;t if it made itself, if it&#039;s just a bunch of matter that exists and threw itself together because of pure random chance there&#039;s no beauty there it all, there&#039;s no meaning in it. </span><br><br>but everything isnt supposed to be beautiful? we are only humans, everything is meaningless to the law of the universe, but we as humans, animals with complex emotions give meaning to things, we see things as pretty. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ok, that&#039;s your belief, but why?

a group of Albanians who split off, settled in Attica and the periphery of the Peloponnese in the 13th Century, were Greek Orthodox, adopted the Greek identity, and were among the foremost groups participating in the Greek War of Independence. They spoke Arvanitika, a heavily Hellenized-dialect of Tosk Albanian. Athens was not the capital upon independence, that was Nafplion, but it was decided Athens would be re-established as a major city capable of sustaining a large urban population, and rebuilt from the village it had become. Parts of what is now Athens were primarily inhabited by Arvanites, who&#039;ve since largely abandoned their language in favour of Greek, and to distance themselves from Muslim Albanians. <br><br>As for the Kastellorizo one, I have no idea what point he&#039;s trying to make except the whole &#039;oh wow you can see the islands from the mainland&#039; shit. Kastellorizo during the Italo-Turkish War, threw out its own Ottoman governor and garrison, requested annexation, but was ultimately ceded back to the Turks who still couldn&#039;t occupy it, then during WWI at the locals request, garrisoned by the French. Post WWI per the Treaty of Serves, the islands were ceded to Italy, who kept them even after withdrawing from the Anatolian mainland, and integrated them into the Italian Aegean. The Italian Aegean was then ceded to Greece post-WWII, because they&#039;d actually fought in the war, and because the islands were homogenously Greek and hadni&#039;t been under Turkish authority since 1912.

I was a rebellious child, something of an edge lord who made it clear to whomever with an ear that tradition and religion was holding us back as a species. I used to lament the possibilities for mankind and dream myself away in the longing for a better future. Yet, as I entered puberty and had to interact with the opposite sex I came to know the true nature of woman. <br><br>Today my hatred for women has rendered it impossible for me to continue believing in the ideals of progress, at least in the context of women being co-pilots in the pursuit of progress.<br><br>I have a habit of pulling a Descartes on myself by using deductive reasoning to trace all my convictions to their origin. I have realized that origin for my worldview is not grounded in the belief of a god or some other metapsychical or ethical concept. It is rooted in the hatred of the feminine as represented in reality.<br><br>The concept of the feminine as an ideal is a lie conjured up by weak romantic men to lure themselves into the trap of female love and companionship. All women are dumb whores in nature. An ideal world would have society render women completely obsolete as a sex. Men unshackled from the oppressive and strangling nature of women. Society has to be order in this way. Anything good for women is ultimate bad for my fellow brothers. Progress leads to liberation of women and liberation for women means liberation from men. When you support progress you&#039;re cucking yourself. Only tradition has the means by which women are to be subjugated by men. Technological progress in the hands of women means a disaster for mankind.

Why? Because Hitler said so.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Further evidence that the Soviet Union was planning to attack Germany is provided by Andrei Vlasov, a Soviet general who had been captured by the Germans. During a conversation in 1942 with SS Gen. Richard Hildebrandt, Vlasov was asked if and when Stalin had intended to attack Germany. Hildebrandt later stated: \u201cVlasov responded by saying that the attack was planned for August-September 1941. The Russians had been preparing the attack since the beginning of the year, which took quite a while because of the poor Russian railroad network. Hitler had sized up the situation entirely correctly, and had struck directly into the Russian buildup. This, said Vlasov, is the reason for the tremendous initial German successes.\u201d[83]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;German intelligence officers also asked Stalin\u2019s son why the Soviet artillery, which had the best cannon and howitzers in the world, fired so poorly. Stalin\u2019s son truthfully answered: \u201cThe maps let the Red Army down, because the war, contrary to expectations, unfolded to the east of the state border.\u201d The Soviet maps were of territories in which the Red Army planned to advance, and were useless for defending the country. Storages of topographic maps located unreasonably close to the border were either destroyed by the advancing German army or by the retreating Soviet forces. In 1941, the Red Army fought without maps, and the Soviet artillery could not fire accurately without maps.[79]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stalin in May 5, 1941: Allow me to make a correction.
