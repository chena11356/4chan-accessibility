No study ever suggested that the ancient Egyptians were more closely related to Europeans. Schuenemann, 2007 suggested that Egyptians had more SSA ancestry in post-Roman, but again, they only had samples from Lower and Middle Egypt, and they didn&#039;t go back prior to the New Kingdom. Krause, one of the other authors of the study, even suggested that if they had samples from Upper Egypt, they likely would have gotten different results. The shitty headline is due to the writer misunderstanding what he read or deliberately misrepresenting it for clickbait. The study claimed that based on these samples, ancient Egyptians were more closely related to Middle Eastern, North African, AND European populations than Sub-Saharan Africans, but this is just a function of MENA groups being relatively closely related to Europeans, and Egyptians having minor (very minor) Southern European input.<br><br>The study that demonstrated R1b in the Amarnas got the same treatment. Haplogroups only account for a small % of a person&#039;s DNA. Many black Americans (who are on average roughly 75% SSA, 25% European) have European haplogroups. Doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re white. There are even clades of R1b originating from that peak among certain black-as-an-Ace-of-Spades Sub-Saharan groups (e.g., Chadians) that originates from Eurasian backmigration 8-5k years ago. Hitler was E1b1b, as was Napoleon. Does that mean they were black Africans? Of course not. The haplogroup originated in East Africa, the E. African pastoralists spread it to Egyptians, Egyptians spread it the Middle East, Middle East spread it to Greece/Rome (which it is still relatively common), they spread it to NW Europe. Something like that. All it likely means is that if you go far back enough, they both probably had a Roman ancestor, and if you back really, really, really far back, they had an African one.

He&#039;s an Orthodox Christian, married, with kids, and in a prestigious professional job. A few years back, he was visiting friends in a state where cannabis is legal, and was talked into trying a pot brownie (he had never done drugs). They told him the high would be very mild, as it usually is. It didn&#039;t work out that way for him. As he puts it, the drug opened his nous wide, and he was projected out of his body, into a terrifying realm. He remembers standing next to a big metal wall, and being aware that there was a being of indescribable evil behind the wall, and it wanted to get at him. He said an angel appeared to him, told him that he wasn&#039;t supposed to be there, and that there are a number of ways to access that realm, but they are forbidden to humans. Because this was an accident, the angel said, you will be protected from the demons. But if you come back here, you will be on your own.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I didn&#039;t write down all the details, but the man told me that he was shown later around a peaceful, beautiful realm he took to be Paradise. He was fully aware that his friends and family were standing around him as he lay on the bed, and he could communicate with them, even though he was elsewhere. He told me that the angel told him he could ask any question he wanted, but that he would forget the answer. He remembers vaguely asking about this or that theological claim within Orthodoxy. His wife and the others remember him lying on the bed, with a beatific look on his face, saying, &quot;It&#039;s all true!

Omniscience Paradox<br>Strict Determinist: If God is all knowing we don\u2019t have free will because he knows everything that we will do in the future, which means the future is predetermined. He already knows who will or will not die a sinner the moment they are born. If God is omniscient he already knows what he will do in the future too, which means he also lacks free will<br>Compatibilist: God can create a world where we theoretically could sin, but no one would actually want to do it so it never happens. However he hasn\u2019t done that<br><br>2. Heaven and free will<br>If Heaven has free will then God is capable of creating a world of eternal bliss with no suffering, that also has free will, yet doesn\u2019t do that<br><br>If Heaven lacks free will then free will isn\u2019t particularly valuable. We will spend eternity with no free will anyways, our short lives with free will is working towards this as a goal. Religion portrays Heaven as a reward, something desirable, so it is admitting that an eternity of bliss with no free will is preferable over a short life filled with suffering with free will.<br><br>3. Degree of evil<br>God can create an exact replica of our current world, but make one heinous evil impossible to commit, like rape.

At its peak the number of Allied soldiers was equal to that of Icelandic men. Many of the foreign soldiers would court Icelandic women and estimates of the number of local women who married foreign soldiers goes into the hundreds. Such interaction between Icelandic women and foreign troops was not always well received and the women involved were often accused of prostitution and betraying their home country.

Immediately discussions began over what effect this would have and minimal interaction with Allied troops was encouraged, but this proved to be difficult as many Icelanders had jobs which in some way led them to interact with the troops. A committee was formed at the behest of the Icelandic government, which published a report noting the prevalence of engaging with prostitutes among the troops.[1] The Icelandic government tried unsuccessfully to reduce the Allied soldiers&#039; encounters with Icelandic women but with time the issue lapsed, as all Allied forces evacuated the island upon the conclusion of the war in 1945.</span>", "filename": "9483AD74-9E2B-45D2-BAE3-30B6876F0B2F", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 709, "h": 640, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 225, "tim": 1675550840493114, "time": 1675550840, "md5": "EBHp3GctA2ADQHkwmsOiGA==", "fsize": 88533, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "standi-icelandic-the-condition-or-the-situation", "replies": 14, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 14578921, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)17:48:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The occupation required the building of a network of roads, hospitals, harbours, airfields and bridges across the country, and this did have an enormous positive economic impact.

It wasn&#039;t constant misery for everyone involved the way Hollywood sometimes portrays it--but very few systems are. Most types of society that made it into the history books were at least stable and not too uncomfortable (except for mass slavery which is its own issue), if they weren&#039;t the people would revolt and something else would emerge.<br><br>But relative to most other modes of organizing society throughout history, feudalism was very low on the social mobility scale, which is an important attribute to me. I don&#039;t like the idea of being legally bound to a certain trade or a certain piece of land. It usually coincided with censorship of speech and an enforced state religion. And even though in theory the lords were the stewards and protectors of the peasants in their domain, more often than not the lords abused their power and mistreated their serfs. Also, the feudal system existed to free up the nobility to fight constant, small-scale wars with each other. It has the benefit of protecting most peasants from mass conscription into armies as is the norm in most centralized societies, but you lose the benefits of centralization too. In a massive empire like the Ottomans, or the Romans or Chinese, during the height of their power, everyone pretty much lived in peace, unless you were near an active frontier. In feudal Europe, all the states were smaller, so everyone was in closer proximity to the constant small-scale wars and the abuses that always come along with that.

Weird.<br><br>I guess we&#039;re just fundamentally different people. If you want to live a lie to make yourself feel good, be my guest I guess. The point previously made in the thread was someone trying to make a claim of Truth, that God/Jesus really exists. To make a claim of something being True, it requires empirical evidence which you can then analyze and draw conclusions from. You can personally believe in a lie if you want but the problem comes when you claim it is actually the Truth, but have no evidence to suggest that it is in fact True.<br><br>Personally, I&#039;d rather live in Truth even if it is depressing. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s depressing. I want to live as close to the Truth as I possibly can within reason, or at least what is most likely True. I don&#039;t want to live my life based on something that winds up being wrong. This is such a fundamental thing to being a human that I really don&#039;t understand how to explain it, it should be self-evident. You shouldn&#039;t want to live a lie. It&#039;s a fundamental moral assumption and if you don&#039;t believe in that for whatever reason than I can&#039;t even talk to you.<br><br>And if you don&#039;t have sufficient evidence to back up a claim of Truth you should shut the fuck up because you need the evidence to suggest the conclusion, and extraordinary claims require equally extraordinary evidence to support them. This is another fundamental level idea. The burden of proof is a fundamental idea basically everyone in the world accepts, it&#039;s extremely strange that you seemingly don&#039;t which is why I asked sarcastically if you were serious.<br><br>I would suggest you see a therapist and talk about it.

Andrew Jackson ran for president a second time on charges that he&#039;d been robbed of a legitimate victory four years earlier and denouncing the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot; against unpopular incumbent John Quincy Adams. Although Adams himself was too highbrow to engage in personal attacks, his supporters had no qualms about charging Jackson with being a blood-stained barbarian who hanged prisoners-of-war without trial during campaigns in the War of 1812 and in Florida. Jackson supporters accused Adams of being an aristocratic elitist--(&quot;a man who fights versus a man who writes&quot;) and of several corrupt activities including charges that he had acted as a pimp while serving as US ambassador to Russia and had procured prostitutes for the tsar. Adams had also purchased a billiard table and a chess set for the White House, paid for out of his own pocket, which Jackson supporters magnified into an entire gambling parlor.<br><br>Worse than that were charges that Jackson had engaged in a bigamous marriage to his wife Rachel, as she had left her first husband and married him before the divorce was finalized. Rachel had not wanted to go to Washington DC or serve as First Lady, but she was spared from this when she passed away at the end of the year from a stroke. Jackson was heartbroken at her death and blamed his political enemies for it.<br><br>When the electoral votes were counted in December, Jackson had buried Adams in a huge landslide with 178 electoral votes to 83 and 55% of the popular vote to 44%.

There is a story of an elderly postmaster pleading with Jackson to let him keep his job as it was all he had. He had fought in the Revolutionary War, he explained, and to prove it opened his shirt to reveal a scar on his chest. Jackson remarked to an aide &quot;Do you see that?

His work in cooperation with the workers he employs is based not on mutual services rendered, but on the common work done for the nation. The employer&#039;s position as leader does not therefore mean that he is master in his own house and can do what he likes. It means rather that he is responsible for what his firm does for the community. The employer is bound to his workers by the fact that they are all participating in the labour of the nation. The essence of this cooperation lies in social honour, which means performances of duty, and respect for every kind of work. To offend against this principle of honour is to infringe the order of things embodied in the Labour Organization Act. The form given to the Works Community necessitates that it should be self-governing. The organ of this self-government is the Mutual Trust Council, which consists of the leader of the firm and members elected by the workers.

There is also the case of an employer who did not allow the workers to do their jobs in peace and quiet, but was continually bothering them and urging them on with abusive language. An employer was condemned for an offence against honour because he refused to have the sick children of a worker taken to hospital in a neighbouring town in accordance with the doctor&#039;s instructions; he said he wished to spare his horses. His action in this case was not an insult to honour within the meaning of the Criminal Code, but an offence against the honour due to every member of the working community.

He made a recommendation:I would dissolve the 16,000 local guilds, because they are totally worthless and only pose a stumbling block to our mutual cooperation; because \u2014 this is completely clear \u2014 these local guilds have no tasks whatever, neither sociopolitical nor economic. They are totally caught up in outdated customs . . . and, by the way, represent the last islands where our opponents, critics, and carpers can carry out their destructive work.</span><br>Ley to Schacht of February 4, 1937, in BAK, NS10/64, pages 26-9 cited in &quot;Robert Ley: Hitler&#039;s Labour Front Leader&quot; by Ronald Smelser page 242<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Several weeks later, on February 20, Ley went public with his offensive in the usual manner\u2014 a proclamation in the press; first, in one Berlin newspaper, then all over Germany.

No one will likely disagree with this as long as we stick to physical appearance. It is obvious that the \u201cred skins,\u201d the \u201cyellow people,\u201d the Negroes, and the whites are very different. And all whites are not the same. The careful observer can find differences in physical size and shape. The color of the eyes, hair, and skin also varies greatly.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But there are also spiritual differences between people. That is particularly clear when various people speak about a particular subject. For one person, work is a \u201ccurse,\u201d \u201cGod\u2019s punishment,\u201d a burden that one should remove as rapidly as possible. For the other, it is a necessary part of existence that gives human life its meaning. For one, bravery and loyalty are nothing but great stupidity. He would rather be \u201ca coward for a few minutes\u201d than to \u201cbe dead for the rest of one\u2019s life.\u201d For another, bravery and loyalty are the characteristics used to value and esteem people. He holds to his word, in good times or ill. He cannot live without honor and would rather die than be a coward.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People differ in more than their physical characteristics. Just as deep, and with no way of bridging the gap, is the differences in spirit and soul. body, spirit, and soul together make up the whole person, since they form a unified whole. Their inner relationships must therefore be studied. Then we will clearly recognize the vast difference between those of German blood and the Jews, although their physical characteristics might otherwise suggest that they were both members of the same human grouping. We then understand human inequality. We act according to this understanding.</span><br>https://research.calvin.edu/german-<wbr>propaganda-archive/hjhandbuch.htm", "filename": "hjhandbuch", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 262, "h": 358, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675545882583679, "time": 1675545882, "md5": "wItaoi4NWOhOrmyiSJfyUQ==", "fsize": 17390, "resto": 14578195}, {"no": 14578631, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:34:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14578579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14578579</a><br>you&#039;re wrong", "time": 1675546466, "resto": 14578195}, {"no": 14579383, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)19:38:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s difficult to answer because different Nazis had different beliefs.

This simply is not a universal imperative. For various reasons they feel as though their desires lead to no good. It is not a matter of logic. They simply dislike life and having desires, whereas people like me love desires. It\u2019s not even the object of my desires that I love, but the desire itself, the feeling of wanting more. And this can never be escaped, even by the greatest of Buddhists, because they never actually reach enlightenment. They are always stuck in the desire to cease desires. I know this because they still eat, which could only happen if they still desired to satisfy their hunger. So they preach about the superiority of a state of existence that they haven\u2019t even reached yet. To me it is no different than a Christian who prays and find exceeding joy in the idea of going to heaven one day. It is all just a self-delusion, squeezing every last drop of relief that comes with abandoning all your earthly duties, convincing yourself that you\u2019re in the right. How does any of this fit within the theory of evolution? Why should an organism want to cease all desires? Buddhists don\u2019t deny biology, so they should know that desires come from within us.

Corruption is the number one problem for most developing countries; Britain provided an administrative class that were both competent and honest. They were also fairly effective in dealing with security problems; unlike France or Portugal they were never forced out of any of their colonies by military action, suppressing revolts in Malaysia and Kenya fairly easily. Many of their former colonies had their development stymied after the British left by internal political struggles and civil wars. <br><br>There&#039;s also the point that India wouldn&#039;t have been partitioned, which would have been immensely beneficial for the subcontinent. <br><br>It still begs the question: in what form could the British Empire have survived? As I said above, continuing down the road it was on would have torn it apart eventually. However, I think that if London had ever seriously pursued the Imperial Federation idea, allowing the white colonies equal say in the government of the empire while granting local autonomy to the rest, they could have found a compromise that would produce a workable system. <br><br>The problem with the British Empire was not that the colonies were tired of it but that London was - and I say specifically London and the ruling class rather than Britain as a whole.
