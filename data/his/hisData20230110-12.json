Recently I came around on some of the Marian dogmas and I thought that it might be beneficial to attempt praying to her, as this is such an important element of piety among Catholics and Orthodox. As a Protestant, when asking Christ for something, I will pray to him and make my request, then if it is not granted, I accept it, knowing that Christ knows what is best and that God wills things for my good. I don&#039;t generally make trivial requests, or ask for things like money -- normally I pray for strength regarding sinful temptations. But I had a pressing need regarding a the physical health of a family member, so I prayed to Christ asking that he would help them, and I prayed to Mary, and asked that she would also pray for this family member and ask Christ to help them. I did this on a number of occasions.<br><br>Suffice it to say that the prayer has not been answered in any observable way. That is acceptable, of course. I&#039;m not evaluating this as some kind of experiment on whether my prayers will become more effective or something, but I wanted to see how this would affect my spirituality, or how I understand prayer. And I have to say that the change was strong, but in a wholly negative manner. Whereas in the past, I could make my petition, then accept Christ&#039;s will and move on, with the involvement of prayers to the saints this changes as there are now more possibilities. It could be that Christ will not grant the petition if I ask it, but he will grant it if Mary asks it (&quot;the prayer of a righteous man avails much&quot;). And perhaps Mary declined my request for prayer. In this case the way to get my prayer granted would be to supplicate Mary so that she might pray as I have requested.<br><br>(1/3)", "filename": "immaculate-conception", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1520, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 190, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673352342005061, "time": 1673352342, "md5": "/ruvRXojAFeo4+vgKoT3mg==", "fsize": 487763, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-attempted-praying-to-mary-and-i-would-like-to", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 14447919, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)07:06:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do you see the problem? Prayer becomes alienated from Christ and the acceptance of God&#039;s will, and becomes attuned to supplicating other humans, or creating the right conditions for your prayer to be accepted. This ties in with other concepts, like needing to pray in particular places, or pray in contact with or near the relics of saints, to increase the efficacy of prayer. It&#039;s almost like prayer ends up being more like constructing a spell, and it turns into a superstitious practice. Christ won&#039;t answer my prayer, but perhaps if I venerate Mary in my prayers enough, she will help me. Or perhaps if I pray near the bones of so-and-so he will pray for me and it will be sufficient. After all, we need the righteous to pray for us so that God will hear us. Simply asking him ourselves is not sufficient if we need something from Christ. That is the logic that comes to bear. It was at this point that I realized the importance of the Reformers fighting against this practice, and why they understood it as idolatry. Because it points us away from Christ and to other beings, to supplicate them instead of God.<br><br>(2/3)", "time": 1673352362, "resto": 14447918}, {"no": 14447921, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)07:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "But the objection will be: what of James 5:16? Does not the prayer of the righteous have greater efficacy? Should we not seek out the righteous or (in Mary&#039;s case) the most righteous to pray for us? This verse gave me some consternation after my experience, but I eventually came to understand what it actually means. The verse in full:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.</span><br>Now the context is that he is telling the readers of the letter to pray for one another. So the prayers he is referring to are the ones performed by the readers of the letter. So who is the &quot;righteous&quot; whose prayers are so effective? Frankly, it is you. Or it is supposed to be you. If you are not righteous you need to demonstrate your faith through your works, as James tells us earlier in the letter. Rather than telling us to seek out the righteous to pray for us, he is telling us to pray for others, because our prayers can help them. The emphasis placed on this verse by Catholics and Orthodox is inverted from its meaning. James wants us to direct our prayers to the benefit of others, the Catholic and Orthodox reading is for us to seek out the prayers of others who are more righteous in order for our own prayers to be answered. See the difference? This is the meaning of Christians praying for each other, not that we seek out particular righteous people to pray for us in a superstitious way, because otherwise Christ may not hear us; but that we love each other and pray for each other, because we wish God to be merciful on all of us. If we love our brother in Christ, we ask God to bless him. To dig beyond this, to try to extrapolate this into a system of efficacy, is to torture the text and miss its entire point.<br><br>I repented of my prayers to Mary and I hope others who do this will repent as well.<br><br>(3/3)", "time": 1673352422, "resto": 14447918}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14447917, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)07:05:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is suicide the way out?", "filename": "1642637016465", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1359, "h": 1828, "tn_w": 185, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1673352327897603, "time": 1673352327, "md5": "vnDV6PoCRlILq1HMx7Qhjg==", "fsize": 337854, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-suicide-the-way-out", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14447012, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:10:20", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "to hail satan I&#039;d need to believe in Christianity first which i don&#039;t.", "com": "don&#039;t drag me into this.", "filename": "1673270369083727", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 697, "h": 639, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 229, "tim": 1673331020043837, "time": 1673331020, "md5": "a/L4SNnbloG9iDDhKR2aEQ==", "fsize": 96632, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "to-hail-satan-id-need-to-believe-in-christianity", "replies": 11, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 14447414, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:40:19", "name": "daymonklotz@insta", "com": "<a href=\"#p14447012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14447012</a><br>demiurge also works", "time": 1673340019, "resto": 14447012, "trip": "!!HclrHMsvDz8"}, {"no": 14447418, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:41:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14447012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14447012</a><br>don&#039;t worry bro god has a sense of humor.

In addition, the high stability of the DYS392 locus (Brinkmann et al. 1998; Nebel et al. 2001) and of the shorter alleles of DYS19 (Carvalho-Silva et al. 1999) has been reported elsewhere. Moreover, the observation that the derivative E-M78 displays the DYS392-12/DYS19-11 haplotype suggests that it also arose in East Africa. This is illustrated by the microsatellite network (fig. 3, shaded area), which reveals that the Ethiopian branch harboring DYS392-12 is not shared with either Near Eastern or European populations</span><br><br>Cruciani et al. 2004<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Haplogroup E-M78 was observed over a wide area, including eastern (21.5%) and northern (18.5%) Africa, the Near East (5.8%), and Europe (7.2%), where it represents by far the most common E3b subhaplogroup. The high frequency of this clade (table 1) and its high microsatellite diversity suggest that it originated in eastern Africa, 23.2 ky ago (95% CI 21.1\u201325.4 ky).</span><br><br>Cruciani et al. 2007<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An eastern African origin for this haplogroup was hypothesized on the basis of the exclusive presence in that area of a putative ancestral 12-repeat allele at the DYS392 microsatellite, found in association with E-M78 chromosomes (Semino et al. 2004). Northeastern African populations were not represented in that study. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed for DYS392, a geographically widespread subset of the E-M78 chromosomes here identified. We observed that the DYS392 12-repeat allele is associated with the majority of the chromosomes belonging to the northeastern African E-V12... with a few of the European E-V13 (2 out of 23)...</span>", "filename": "e-m78-distribution", "ext": ".png", "w": 680, "h": 570, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1673195682065780, "time": 1673195682, "md5": "yPFexXt5mIhpd+95i5KZTQ==", "fsize": 157240, "resto": 14439600}, {"no": 14439624, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)11:37:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1443960</span><br>Triki-Fendri et al. 2014<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Cruciani et al., (2007), the peripheral geographic distribution of the most derived sub-haplogroups with respect to northeastern Africa, as well as the results of quantitative analysis of UEP and microsatellite diversity are strongly suggestive of a northeastern rather than an eastern African origin of E-M78.

While these results do not suggest that the AHG gene pool originated as a mixture of Levant_N and WHG, both of which lived millennia later than AHG, it still robustly supports that AHG is genetically intermediate between WHG and Levant_N. This cannot be explained without gene flow between the ancestral gene pools of those three groups. This supports a late Pleistocene presence of both Near-Eastern and European hunter-gatherer-related ancestries in central Anatolia.

Social, Religious, and Political/Economic. The religious aspect should be outside the realm of government - and if a church wants to preform a ceremony for gay couples then that&#039;s a matter for that church&#039;s leadership and congregation. The social aspect is to announce to your friends and family that you think that this relationship is the one you want to keep from now on (although given divorce stats there&#039;s some debate about how much this applies now), but again that&#039;s not something that you need a government&#039;s or church&#039;s permission for, just throw a party and announce it. The reason that marriage has legislation around it is for the last one there, the economic factor. A stable, loving, supportive heterosexual family has been proven time and time again to be the best scenario to breed and produce children (the next generation of citizens and workers, hence the government&#039;s interest in it). There isn&#039;t sufficient data to tell us how gay parents will compare to that just yet - and for such a polarising issue it is almost impossible for a fair and honest study to be conducted/published - but let&#039;s be real and acknowledge that at its best it can only be as good as a functional heterosexual marriage, just without the ability to actually breed their own children. <br><br>As such it is, in the absolute best possible case, a second rate set up for fulfilling the task of a marriage (from the perspective of the government, the people you are arguing should be involved).

According to Denis Baraby, director of youth protection services in the area, they discovered some houses that were dirty, had 4\u20135 children sleeping in one bedroom, some mattresses soaked in urine, and children with fungus on their feet.

One woman said she was struck with a belt and a coat hanger, and a pregnant 17-year-old girl said she was beaten by her brother, sexually abused by her father, and married by force to a 30-year-old man when she was 15.[36] On November 27, 2013, a Quebec court ruled that 14 children of the group must be placed in foster care, and arrangements were made for the children to be placed in Yiddish-speaking foster homes.[40] On February 21, a Quebec court ruled the group did not have the right to appeal the previous ruling of a Quebec court, because they failed to file the appeal within a 30-day period, and soon, Canadian authorities began to seek custody of children of Lev Tahor members.[41][42]</span><br>they&#039;re cunts", "time": 1673334804, "resto": 14445308}, {"no": 14447767, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:52:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14446100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14446100</a><br>I can&#039;t believe a bunch of old geezers and kids were able to overpower a prison and the guards, are lantinos this weak?", "time": 1673347979, "resto": 14445308}, {"no": 14447809, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:10:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14445308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14445308</a><br><br>Based.

Catholic apologists like to take a very conservative line on theological matters, but this is divorced from Catholic scholarship almost entirely. If you look at any Catholic academic works on controversial matters, they&#039;ll tell you point blank that the modern Catholic position is not authentic, that bishops were a development, that Rome did not have a bishop until the 2nd century, etc. Their scholars adapt a historical critical approach to the Bible as well. I live in the U.S. and the translation produced by the bishops here, the NABRE, contains footnotes that basically discredit the Bible entirely, telling you that the Gospels contain errors and all sorts of things, and this is true for the majority of Catholic biblical studies produced today. There are some exceptions I will grant, but they are a minority, and this is something I really can&#039;t get past, that these liberal viewpoints are completely endorsed and allowed in the Church. I know that as a conservative Protestant, I can look to our scholars and find robust defenses of the conservative, orthodox position on these matters, and that if one them stated otherwise, there would be a holy uproar about it. The Protestants who have rejected orthodoxy in this way -- we have nothing to do with them at all, they are cut off from us. In Catholicism I would be entering communion with such people, and their viewpoints would be endorsed by the hierarchy. Do you see what I mean, that it feels like I&#039;m being sold a load of crap? I don&#039;t want to leave something conservative and traditional and join with something that&#039;s basically like the liberal Episcopal Church down the road, just with Francis on top of it.

Before Mary\u2019s bodily Assumption into heaven was defined, all theological faculties in the world were consulted for their opinion. Our teachers\u2019 answer was emphatically negative\u2026\u201dTradition\u201d was identified with what could be proved on the basis of texts. Altaner, the patrologist from W\u00fcrzburg\u2026 had proven in a scientifically persuasive manner that the doctrine of Mary\u2019s bodily Assumption into haven was unknown before the 5C; this doctrine, therefore, he argued, could not belong to the \u201capostolic tradition. And this was his conclusion, which my teachers at Munich shared. This argument is compelling if you understand \u201ctradition\u201d strictly as the handing down of fixed formulas and texts\u2026But if you conceive of \u201ctradition\u201d as the living process whereby the Holy Spirit introduces us to the fullness of truth and teaches us how to understand what previously we could still not grasp (cf. Jn 16:12-13), then subsequent \u201cremembering\u201d (cf. Jn 16:4, for instance) can come to recognize what it has not caught sight of previously and was already handed down in the original Word, (Milestones, p. 58-59).</span>", "time": 1673290553, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444471, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:57:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444310</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No evidence, just vague &quot;it makes sense&quot; ramblings</span><br>We could use the same logic and say that you should honour your father therefore Joseph was sinless, but I doubt you want to go there", "time": 1673290641, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444472, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:58:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444468</a><br>so basically &quot;it was real in our minds&quot;", "time": 1673290684, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444473, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:58:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444468</a><br>Meant the bodily assumption, to be clear", "time": 1673290718, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444475, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:59:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444310</a><br>By the same logic mary should be able to boss Jesus around and start hitting him with sandals or something, get real, he&#039;s God, he wrote those commandments you are quoting", "time": 1673290762, "resto": 14444007}, {"no": 14444481, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14444468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14444468</a><br>I&#039;m aware that it has no early evidence among orthodox Christians.

R1b definitely establish a dominance like Normans did around Europe but their autosomal was most definitely Egyptian and not some Native Yamnaya... also got absorbed more in southern Europe then the north. Look at Iberians who paternally come from the steppe but cluster with early neolithic and then those same Iberians mixed with native women and west African women and now cluster witihin Europe and outside of Europe just like Yamnaya did before mixing with neolithic Europeans. Yamnaya spread their y chromosome but their autosomal got shifted towards the women they were fucking. If Latin Americans mixed with Europeans then of course their DNA would once again be shifted towards Europeans.

What we refer to as &#039;energy&#039; is but a abstraction representation of the innate capacity of action that a given object possesses, i.e. of something influencing or causing a change in something else in a noticeable, observable, or scientifically measurable way (usually in the form of motion, which is the most basic phenomena of observable). But this definition loses its very coherence when we start talking about quantum fields as vectors of influence overlapping one another in spacetime; the ontology ceases to be about &#039;things&#039; in the material sense and becomes &#039;digital&#039; in the sense that discrete units of information become the foundation of reality. The overlapping fields are analogous to layers or subsystems of a complex information processing system that, taken together, produces and interprets the content of reality (i.e. of the cosmos). This is pretty much what theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and software programmers spend all their day doing; establishing frameworks or structures for the interpretation of data, and working out the relationships that exist among quantities and qualities (i.e. variables) and how they interact to produce more complex variables and larger or smaller quantities, depending on the operation/interaction.", "time": 1673250019, "resto": 14440948}, {"no": 14442382, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)02:42:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14442376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14442376</a><br>schizo.", "time": 1673250133, "resto": 14440948}, {"no": 14442407, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)02:51:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "To me it\u2019s the only certainty.

Deny as much, and you&#039;re saying that it&#039;s contingent on something which is informational in nature (that&#039;s what you&#039;d have to be saying because no alternative exists). So the identifiable existence of any coherent X automatically implies the negation of X, making the distinction both evidential and conceptual.

God can do all sorts of things, if He so chooses. The issue lies in what He has purposed to do and how He has disclosed Himself in His Word and in Nature. You reject the logic behind Biblical truth because it competes with your own epistemological method, one which takes for granted fallen man&#039;s powers of perception and reasoning, while neglecting to take into account the results of sin on the human heart (i.e. the seedbed or originator of human desire, motivation, axiological judgment, affections, and beliefs).

Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?

Third, the two genealogical lines parallel each other from Abraham to David. Fourth, beginning with David, Matthew traced the paternal line of descent through Solomon; Luke traced the maternal line through Solomon\u2019s brother, Nathan.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A fifth factor that must be recognized is that the two lines (paternal and maternal) link together in the intermarriage of Shealtiel and Zerubbabel.

Matthew 22:24-26), a deceased man would have a son through a surrogate father who legally married the deceased man\u2019s widow (e.g., Ruth 2:20; 3:9,12; 4:3-5); and (5) in the sense of a step-son who took on the legal status of his step-father\u2014the relationship sustained by Jesus to Joseph (Matthew 13:55; Mark 6:3; Luke 3:23; 4:22; John 6:42).</span><br>part1/2", "filename": "bb-03-31-lg", "ext": ".png", "w": 742, "h": 960, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673327745298748, "time": 1673327745, "md5": "8uEIXy0rkCcSf1b2sVusZw==", "fsize": 56798, "resto": 14446259}, {"no": 14446850, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)00:16:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14446847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14446847</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Notice carefully that Joseph was a direct-line, blood descendant of David and, therefore, of David\u2019s throne.

However, an equally critical credential was His blood/physical descent from David\u2014a point that could not be established through Joseph since \u201cafter His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Matthew 1:18, emp. added).
