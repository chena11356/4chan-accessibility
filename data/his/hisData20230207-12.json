Think of it like this, in the 1500s, the majority of the world could not read and write, it wasnt until recently, that reading and writing became standard. What was once a well admired thing in the past, became something trivial in the modern era. Before the internet, the only way people could achieve knowledge was by going to the library and reading books, then as the internet came out, acquiring knowledge became easier to do. Instead of wasting time with the books and a library, you could read an online article with the click of a button. Then knowledge became even more streamlined with youtube videos. Instead of having to read a boring article on quantum physics, you could watch a youtube video &quot;Quantum Physics 101 in 10 minutes&quot;. So, knowledge is trivial.

Then, by extension, because rice farming is farm more physically taxing than other forms of agriculture, and because it&#039;s highly prone to climactic shocks = more rice = weaker and more malnourished people leading to their current physiology.

Third, Rice populations grow like crazy. The majority of the world live in Rice cultures. The rice corner of Asia has about half the global population even though geographically it&#039;s not a big area. They grow in population and subsume tge populations around them. The original Manchus don&#039;t remain. The Mongols in inner mongolia don&#039;t remain. They&#039;ve all been assimilated by the rice eating han. And the Uyghur and tibetans are next to be wiped out by the rice easting plague.

Hence the natives of the land surmised that unless they removed the foreigners, their troubles would never be resolved. At once, therefore, the aliens were driven from the country, and the most outstanding and active among them banded together and, as some say, were cast ashore in Greece and certain other regions; their leaders were notable men, chief among them being Danaus and Cadmus. But the greater number were driven into what is now called Judaea, which is not far distant from Egypt and was at that time utterly uninhabited. The colony was headed by a man called Moses, outstanding both for his wisdom and for his courage. On taking possession of the land he founded, beside other cities, one that is now the most renowned of all, called Jerusalem. In addition he established the temple that they hold in chief veneration, instituted their forms of worship and ritual, drew up their laws and ordered their political institutions. He also divided them into twelve tribes, since this is regarded as the most perfect number and corresponds to the number of months that make up a year. But he had no images whatsoever of the gods made for them, being of the opinion that God is not in human form; rather the Heaven that surrounds the earth is alone divine, and rules the universe. The sacrifices that he established differ from those of other nations, as does their way of living, for as a result of their own expulsion from Egypt he introduced a kind of misanthropic and inhospitable way of life</span>", "time": 1675731406, "resto": 14588673}, {"no": 14590230, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)19:59:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14590217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14590217</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even the earliest most fragmentary mention of jews describes them as hateful and uncharitable</span>", "filename": "unknown (5)", "ext": ".png", "w": 959, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675731557320725, "time": 1675731557, "md5": "ei1qgxNI68zEaSthWDHnyg==", "fsize": 532680, "resto": 14588673}, {"no": 14590247, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)20:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14590217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14590217</a><br>Yes, Diodorus Siculus, in the 1st century BC, mentions judaism, Herotodus 400 years earlier didn&#039;t...", "time": 1675731881, "resto": 14588673}, {"no": 14590285, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)20:12:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14588673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14588673</a><br>There is evidence of an exodus of Shepard out of Egypt sometime between 1500 and 1000 BC.

The Ordo Salutis in Aquinas and Calvin are similar. The main problems arise in: What is the role of free will in this (i.e. is it monergistic or synergistic), consequently leading to a slight difference in the Ordo Salutis (i.e. does regeneration precede faith or follow it as in baptism), whether or not those who have been grafted in are all necessarily among the elect unto final perseverance and final justification, and whether or not God elected the reprobate to damnation or merley passed over them unto reprobation. The metaphysics of both differ fundamentally in the nature of causation. Both would agree there is a class of elect though, and both would admit that knowledge of the elect is a mystery, but while the Calvinist would say that all who have been justified are assured of final perseverance as the elect, the Catholics would not admit of an assurance to what it calls final justification but only a strong hope in this reality while still warning against the possibility of apostasy as Arminians would, which is why Catholics use the word &quot;elect&quot; sometimes in a technical sense for the Church Triumphant.

His work in cooperation with the workers he employs is based not on mutual services rendered, but on the common work done for the nation. The employer&#039;s position as leader does not therefore mean that he is master in his own house and can do what he likes. It means rather that he is responsible for what his firm does for the community. The employer is bound to his workers by the fact that they are all participating in the labour of the nation. The essence of this cooperation lies in social honour, which means performances of duty, and respect for every kind of work. To offend against this principle of honour is to infringe the order of things embodied in the Labour Organization Act. The form given to the Works Community necessitates that it should be self-governing. The organ of this self-government is the Mutual Trust Council, which consists of the leader of the firm and members elected by the workers.

There is also the case of an employer who did not allow the workers to do their jobs in peace and quiet, but was continually bothering them and urging them on with abusive language. An employer was condemned for an offence against honour because he refused to have the sick children of a worker taken to hospital in a neighbouring town in accordance with the doctor&#039;s instructions; he said he wished to spare his horses. His action in this case was not an insult to honour within the meaning of the Criminal Code, but an offence against the honour due to every member of the working community.

Evolutionists cannot point to any transitional fossils\u2014creatures that are half reptile and half bird, for instance.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Actually, paleontologists know of many detailed examples of fossils intermediate in form between various taxonomic groups. One of the most famous fossils of all time is Archaeopteryx, which combines feathers and skeletal structures peculiar to birds with features of dinosaurs. A flock&#039;s worth of other feathered fossil species, some more avian and some less, has also been found. A sequence of fossils spans the evolution of modern horses from the tiny Eohippus. An amazing fossil creature from 375 million years ago named Tiktaalik embodies the predicted and long-sought transition of certain fishes to life on land. Whales had four-legged ancestors that walked on land, and creatures known as Ambulocetus and Rodhocetus helped to make that transition. Fossil seashells trace the evolution of various mollusks through millions of years. Perhaps 20 or more hominins (not all of them our ancestors) fill the gap between Lucy the australopithecine and modern humans.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Creationists, though, dismiss these fossil studies. They argue that Archaeopteryx is not a missing link between reptiles and birds\u2014it is just an extinct bird with reptilian features. They want evolutionists to produce a weird, chimeric monster that cannot be classified as belonging to any known group. Even if a creationist does accept a fossil as transitional between two species, he or she may then insist on seeing other fossils intermediate between it and the first two. These frustrating requests can proceed ad infinitum and place an unreasonable burden on the always incomplete fossil record.</span><br><br>1/2", "time": 1675701828, "resto": 14587513}, {"no": 14587791, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)11:45:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14587724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14587724</a><br><a href=\"#p14587786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14587786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nevertheless, evolutionists can cite further supportive evidence from molecular biology.

Weapons of a broadly similar type are found in a wide belt of Eastern Africa from Lake Victoria in the west to the Swahili coast in the east<br><br>The seme can vary in length, from the size of a knife, to the size of medium length sword, with an elegant leaf shaped blade flaring towards the tip and featuring a median ridge running the length of the blade. Typically, this one handed slashing weapon has a short wooden hilt covered in leather, often tapering towards the tip, and is kept in a leather sheath, often dyed red.<br>The seme was used for mundane everyday purposes like clearing brush and butchering meat, and was also used for war, and during lion hunts, which were once important rites of passage. It is important however to note, that the seme is a secondary weapon, second only to the spear.<br><br>Among the Maasai, men belong to age groups that determine their status, with each age group being assigned a distinctive set of weapons. At about 15 to 21 years of age, Maasai youths, called \u201clayok\u201d, are initiated into the status of young manhood, called \u201cmoran\u201d, at which point they are given their first seme, which they will carry for the rest of their lives.<br>The Maasai and Samburu have their own subgroup of specialized blacksmiths, known as \u201cIlkunono\u201d, who produce seme\u2019s, and who were traditionally surrounded by taboos and even scorned for being ritually unclean.
