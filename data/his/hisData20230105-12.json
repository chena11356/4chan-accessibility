You regurguate some talking points that you never even botgered to double check. Here is what Xenophon says<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In order that the boys might never lack a ruler even when the Warden was away, he gave authority to any citizen who chanced to be present to require them to do anything that he thought right, and to punish them for any misconduct. This had the effect of making the boys more respectful; in fact boys and men alike respect their rulers above everything. [11] And that a ruler might not be lacking to the boys even when no grown man happened to be present, he selected the keenest of the prefects, and gave to each the command of a division. And so at Sparta the boys are never without a ruler. [12]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think I ought to say something also about intimacy with boys, since this matter also has a bearing on education. In other Greek states, for instance among the Boeotians, man and boy live together, like married people;5 elsewhere, among the Eleians, for example, consent is won by means of favours.

Then it&#039;s the typical case of &quot;forgotten&quot; presidents or &quot;racist&quot; ones ranked inexplicably low, like the aforementioned Jackson, but also Ford, (on what planet was Carter better?) Hayes, Arthur, Tyler and Andrew Johnson. Furthermore, if you delve into the individual metrics, they make no sense. For example, FDR, JQA and Theodore Roosevelt somehow allegedly rate higher in &quot;background&quot; than all of the Founding Fathers. Now, I believe both Roosevelt&#039;s belong in the top 5 overall, but this is an example of a category where they clearly shouldn&#039;t be rated so high, especially FDR, who was only a state senator for two years, a naval assistant and a governor prior to his presidency. Compare this to any Founding Father&#039;s background, and it obviously pales in comparison. In the same metric, Woodrow Wilson, who again, I believe to be a top 10 president, is rated 9th, despite only being a governor for two years prior to his administration. That&#039;s ahead of the likes of Monroe, Biden, LBJ, Nixon, Van Buren, McKinley, Ford, Garfield, Polk, Truman, Coolidge, Tyler, Buchanan, Jackson and Andrew Johnson, all of whom had far more government experience. Liberal favorites like Obama, Clinton, Kennedy and Carter rate inexplicably hate despite being some of the least experienced people ever to hold the presidency.

The same situation occurs in John 10:31-39 and there Jesus describes the perichoresis of the Trinity he later discusses in the Farewell Discourse. Jesus forgives sins when only God had the authority to do such in Mark 2:5, the Pharisees object because only God could forgive sins, God gave none the right to do this until Jesus gave the apostolic authority to the apostles in John 20:23. Jesus echos the words of the God of Israel in Isaiah 41:10 when he walks on water (symbolic of the God of Israel conquering chaos) and says &quot;Fear not, for I AM&quot; (read the Greek). Most translations have this as &quot;It is I&quot; which is fine, its a play on Isaiah 41:10 &quot;Fear not, for I am... I am your God... etc.&quot; Matthew has the imagery of Psalm 144:7 in mind when Jesus rescues Peter from drowning in this event, Jesus acts as the God of Israel here. &quot;Who is good but God alone.&quot; You may object. First, Jesus was asking a rhetorical question. He wanted the man to think why exactly he was calling Jesus good. Now who does is Jesus? He is, as the parable in John 10 shows us, the Good Shepherd. Jesus says, &quot;I AM the Good Shepherd.&quot; Further, the Jesus says in the Revelation 1:8, 22:13 he is the Alpah and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning of the End. He is called omnipotent in the Greek in those verses, he is he pantokrator. Jesus does indeed have a subordinate role to the Father insofar as he is begotten, this does not imply creation though, quite the contrary as John 1:1 itself asserts. Jesus was with God, he is God, because he eternally partake in the nature of the Father given to him by such.

Half a million soldiers joined the party during the war, and the army was fighting a battle to make revolutionaries out of as many as possible. To this end, despite strained resources, the political departments poured out pamphlets, newspapers, posters and leaflets, and set up reading courses and mobile libraries to combat illiteracy so the soldiers could read reports from the other fronts and take active part in the debates arising in the new state. By the spring of 1919 reading and writing were taught daily. By the end of 1920 there were 3,000 Red Army schools, 60 amateur theatres, and libraries with reading rooms in every soldiers\u2019 club. The commitment to political education in the army is summed up in the first emblem of the army: the hammer and sickle with a rifle and a book.

I don&#039;t think any side of the political spectrum likes this much, but the traditional inception of &quot;democracy&quot; was with Cleisthenes reforms in Athens. Cleisthenes was responding to the fallout of the overthrow of the Peisistratids. The Peisistratids were the family of the tyrant of Athens Pisistratis, who installed himself not long after Solon&#039;s reforms. &quot;Tyranny&quot; back then wasn&#039;t as loaded as it is now, to be a tyrant was merely to be a ruler outside the bounds of normal law or constitutional order. But tyrants weren&#039;t always perceived as de facto &quot;bad&quot;. While they were understood to be ultimately illegitimate under normal law, tyrants were often understood to be agents of divine intervention to set right a rotting political culture. So sometimes tyrants were considered necessary or even agents of justice, but they were still doomed to die or be expelled in order to return the city to lawfullness.<br><br>So the repressed thing here is that Pisistratis was actually considered a good governor, and he was largely a popular one because he favored common farmers and such. He maintained his rule until he died, and his sons were overthrown by some angry aristocrats. Cleisthenes was basically tasked with doing what Solon did but more effectively, so another tyrant wouldn&#039;t arise. He set about changing the political divisions of the state from old tribal divisions to more arbitrary geographic ones resembling census districts (the &quot;demes&quot;), basically jumbling the tribes together. The move was to weaken kinship ties and create more loyal ties to the state as &quot;citizens&quot;. A part of this process was deciding who was and was not a &quot;real&quot; Athenian, and the question was won by the Athenian movement for autochthonism. The majority was allowed to vote on whether you were a real Athenian, and if they voted no you were enslaved. <br><br>Cont.", "time": 1672782637, "resto": 14413994}, {"no": 14417165, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)16:56:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14417085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14417085</a><br>Monarchs during the Middle Ages didn\u2019t have that kind of power.

There was a lot of immigration into Athens due to the propserity and Pisistratis welcomed it and used it to help bolster his power. So the Athenian democracy partially responded to this immigration and the existence of a larger populace by allowing for votes on enslaving people to properly define Athenian citizenship. This is an unhappy history for liberal democrats who profess a love for democracy, because ironically the democracy and its emphasis on &quot;real Athenians&quot; was also used as an argument for essentially the racial superiority of Athenians. In order to bind Athenians together in a civic identity, the concept was promulgated that Athenians had lived in Athens for a very long time, were &quot;of the land&quot;, and were more pure than other Greeks. So Athenians were justified in dominating the impure Greeks. This has parallels with the creation of white identity in the colonial Era, the thing that made a bunch of disparate European colonists start to identify with the colonial project instead of their other identities. <br><br>So you can see why this seems contrary to liberal democratic values, why do they love democracy so much? Well for one they repress all of this about democracy, they just take for granted that there are states and citizens and &quot;the people should rule its only fair&quot;, but the REASON they repress this is because they are afraid of the alternative. They&#039;re still implicitly afraid of the tyrant, they&#039;re afraid of the popular tyrant that turns the power of the state and &quot;people&quot; against them. The concept of democracy is how the more aristocratic and powerful families win the loyalty of the groups of people they want to protect them from a tyranny. <br>Cont.", "time": 1672783341, "resto": 14413994}, {"no": 14417212, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:06:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14413994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14413994</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Democracy fucking sucks.</span><br>It does.

Here, the descendants of societies associated with steppe pastoralists form Early Bronze Age (EBA 2400-1800 BC) were followed by Middle Bronze Age (MBA 1800-1200 BC) populations displaying unique characteristics. Particularly, the predominance of collective burials, the scale of which, was previously seen only in the Neolithic. To study kinship of those MBA societies and to test whether the re-emergence of those old traditions was a result of genetic shift or social changes, we generated and analyzed 91 genomes from individuals associated with EBA and MBA from modern day Poland and Ukraine. Our results indicate that while EBA people in East-Central Europe were most likely direct descendants of the preceding populations, the MBA populations were formed by an additional admixture event involving a population with relatively high proportions of genetic component associated with European hunter-gatherers. Additionally, our data shows that MBA collective burials contained numerous individuals related to each other, and the prevalence of close kinship among adult male descendants over adult female suggests that patrilocality was dominating form of marriage arrangements in these societies.</span><br>Found it.", "time": 1672904531, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423666, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:48:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423660</a><br>Was this HG-admixture from females if haplogroups weren&#039;t changed?", "time": 1672904907, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423670, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:50:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423659</a><br>Maybe there&#039;s more HG in Baltic CWC, also GAC isn&#039;t the same as LBK.", "time": 1672905030, "resto": 14423275}, {"no": 14423678, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:53:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14423670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14423670</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GAC isn&#039;t the same as LBK</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more HG in Baltic CWC</span><br>The Baltic ones have more WHG, but not EHG, and less ANF than the others, and GAC there have more WHG too while LBK/Barcin have not.

The main powers of Greece (Aetolians, Achaean League) had been looking to get their independence from the Big Kids on the block (Antigonid Macedon, Seleucid Syria), so they sought to bring in Rome as a third party/even Bigger Kid who ended up mopping the floor with both powers. Rome paid pretty good lip service to the Greeks for much of the second century, until they went scorched earth around 150s-140s after being dragged into so many disputes. The destruction of Corinth in 146, the dissolution of the Macedonian monarchy, and enslavement of 150,000 Epirotes really fucked their shit up and discouraged further rebellion for the next 50 years.<br>2. By the late 2nd/early 1st century BC, Rome was still pretty new to the &quot;empire administration&quot; thing, and their system of extracting taxes via intermediary contracts led to some extremely predatory Romans squeezing every last drop out of the wealthier provinces of Asia Minor. This led to some really strong resentment amongst the peoples of the area.<br>3. Mithridates was an extremely competent and ambitious ruler, and realized early on that it was probably a matter of time before he was going to have to deal with Rome somehow. Coincidentally, the Republic was suffering serious internal problems during his reign (post-Gracchi political violence, the Civil Wars of Marius/Sulla, the Social War, the Second Servile War), which allowed him to build up enough power without Roman interference. The fractious nature of Late Republican Rome enabled someone like Mithridates to take advantage of their distractions and infighting, while the Republic between 200 BC and 150 BC was unified enough to curbstomp anyone that so much as farted in the wrong direction. The fact that he still failed in spite of Rome&#039;s issues is a testament to just how strong the Republic still was.", "time": 1672889269, "resto": 14422887}, {"no": 14423045, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)22:29:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Different means of Roman rule, the overseas expansion of the Roman Republic was a bit of a ramshackle affair.

The most famous member of the family, Mithridates VI Eupator (ca. 120-63 BCE), although undoubtedly presenting himself to the Greek world as a civilized philhellene and new Alexander, also paraded his Iranian background: he maintained a harem and eunuchs in true Oriental fashion; he gave all his sons Persian names; he sacrificed spectacularly in the manner of the Persian kings at Pasargadae (Appian, Mith. 66, 70); and he appointed \u201csatraps\u201d (a Persian title) as his provincial governors.

Their only goal in life is the accumulation of more wealth and as such they form a class of parasites whose interests are often contrary to the interests of the crown. They are not tied to the land because, for the most part, their job requires them to be nomadic and rootless. They have no culture, for the most part, because their job requires them to live among others and adopt their customs to do business. They are greedy so they try to get out of contributing to the country when called upon. They are overeducated and wealthy yet lack the accumulated wisdom and power of the true upper class so they constantly seek to overthrow traditional power structures, often leading to absolute disaster for everyone involved.

Local pizza place gave giant party sized pizzas and had The Simpsons game. I also liked playing Skeeball and the ticket games.

In 1781, Madame de Lamballe became Grand Mistress of all of the Lodges of Adoption in France. That same year, Marie-Antoinette wrote to a friend, praising the good works of the masonic sisterhood, and how they provided dowries for poor girls and were very pious. She also praised them in a letter to her sister Marie-Christine, saying: &quot;It is only a society of benevolence and pleasure.&quot; (see Nesta Webster&#039;s Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette Before the Revolution, p. 237-238) She and Louis XVI both saw the masons as a means of charitable works to benefit society, and they both may have at one point visited certain lodges, so that to this day, some masonic groups claim them as their own</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is also evidence that Marie-Antoinette&#039;s best friend Madame de Polignac was a member of a ladies&#039; lodge, although not to the extent that Madame de Lamballe was involved; it was considered the fashionable thing to do.

Some of this explains his initial acquiescence to certain measures in the beginning of the Revolution which were damaging to the Church, especially the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.

However, in the years preceding the Revolution of 1789, masonic lodges formed a network that fomented discord, spread propaganda against the King and especially against the Queen.
