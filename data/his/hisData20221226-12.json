I am a Christian but I have no idea what to think on this manner after years of looking into it here and there. I will say this: when I was leaning towards Catholicism/Orthodoxy for an anchor of meaning in this world, I felt the need to defend the Holy Trinity (because that means that the story definitively begins and ends at the Bible). But when I began to entertain Mormonism, Christian perennialism, etc., suddenly the Holy Trinity seemed less necessary, up to a point (I will never entertain that Christ wasn&#039;t both divine and human in one person, for example). There&#039;s also the Girardian in me that wants to keep the Holy Trinity solely so Jesus Christ can be the highest possible divine figure. If God sacrifices Himself for our sins, then no story could ever supplant the Bible.

Since the land in question had no legitimate sovereign at the time (the Ottoman Empire had just lost the war and a shitton of territories) this was completely legal, fair and logical.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even though they got that from the international community at the time, they didn&#039;t simply just go there and take stuff. They bought all the land that they worked, either via the main Zionist orgs or through private donors. All the factories, power plants, etc... were built on legally purchased land. Not only that, but they also bought worthless swamp lands well above the market price, and they got those from absentee landlords who weren&#039;t even there. It&#039;s like you selling a plantation full of Blacks in the 1700s in America while you&#039;re living in an Oxford mansion in England.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lastly, you&#039;re pretty ridiculous to use the motivation of the decision (history, religion, origins, etc) to try and invalidate the legality of the decision itself. Now of course, you&#039;re free to disagree with it, but that&#039;s just as ridiculous as disagreeing with any legal document (contract, deed) in just the same way. Yeah, you don&#039;t like it, but it&#039;s perfectly legal, it&#039;s perfectly fair and it was perfectly a-okay.</span><br>So one thing is sure: the crazy ones aren&#039;t the Zionists.", "time": 1672007626, "resto": 14372642}, {"no": 14376134, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)17:39:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14376106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14376106</a><br>You&#039;re avoiding the anon&#039;s point that the reason why they specifically settled in Palestine was because they believed they were descended from the original owners of a land that their ancestors hadn&#039;t held for millennia; everything you mention in that post could&#039;ve been done literally anywhere else in the Third World, but they almost exclusively picked Palestine as the place to settle due to that imagined descent and not because it was simply the most logical region to settle due to geopolitical/economic considerations", "time": 1672007963, "resto": 14372642}, {"no": 14376182, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)17:49:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14376134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14376134</a><br>So you still don&#039;t get it, do you?

Of this I used to see many instances with my own eyes, and I have learned of more, by finding the records which are preserved against you. Moreover, when a tax was about to be levied on you again I prevented it, and compelled the impiety of such obloquy to cease here; and I threw into the fire the records against you that were stored in my desks; so that it is no longer possible for anyone to aim at you such a reproach of impiety. My brother Constantius of honored memory was not so much responsible for these wrongs of yours as were the men who used to frequent his table, barbarians in mind, godless in soul. These I seized with my own hands and put them to death by thrusting them into the pit, that not even any memory of their destruction might still linger amongst us. And since I wish that you should prosper yet more, I have admonished my brother Iules, your most venerable patriarch, that the levy [\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7] which is said to exist among you should be prohibited, and that no one is any longer to have the power to oppress the masses of your people by such exactions; so that everywhere, during my reign, you may have security of mind, and in the enjoyment of peace may offer more fervid prayers for my reign to the Most High God, the Creator, who has deigned to crown me with his own immaculate right hand.</span>", "time": 1672044809, "resto": 14377427}, {"no": 14377520, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:01:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14377427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14377427</a><br>Nothing involving worship is worth it because humans are gods, we aren&#039;t supposed to be worshipping anything.

Thats not realy impressive Honestly the spanish army of 8,000 could have also conquered the capital in three weeks. The reason Korea army was so bad was because.<br>1. 200 years of peace. In 1400s Korea had 30,000 professional soldiers, 100,000 conscription during war time and 300,000 conscription if the situation got worse. However by 1592 korea had 8, 000 professional soldiers and 140,000 conscription soldiers when things got worse. Even this is not correct. The 8000 professional soldiers were used total for four seasons. Meaning there were only 2000 active professionals soldiers during each season. Meanwhile most of the conscription were also fake. Before the war a minister looked up the names of each conscription soldiers and found out 50% of those names were names of mountain, dogs, dead people and non existent names. And most of the conscripted soldiers never learned to battle.<br>2. No experience. Heres the list of what korean generals ordered. A. Use pillows and blankets to block guns. B. Build fortress out of snow C. Plants seeds to stop the Japanese advancements... Basically most of the generals had no experience so your average total war player would have been better generals.<br>3. Japanese speed. According tp korean record pusan to capital takes about three weeks if your walking. Japan basically walked faster than your average Korean going to the capital.

Christianity demonizes everything that it can&#039;t explain but the religion itself can&#039;t even prove the reality of demons, which is like a slap in the face when that&#039;s you&#039;re only defense for everything. Christianity tells you that real things like talking to ghosts or reincarnation is fake, and tries to say fake things like demons and hell are real. It says real things are fake and tries to say all their fake stuff is real but people aren&#039;t stupid anymore or gullible. Our mentality doesn&#039;t match with our technology, we&#039;re mentally still in the 1800&#039;s but we&#039;re slowly catching up and that&#039;s why religion is falling off, not just christianity its all religions and belief systems period from islam to christianity to catholicism. The only ones that will stay are hinduism an buddhism and the more evolved teachings that aren&#039;t really religions anyway.

Anyway, debate nerds tend to obsess way too much over informal fallacies. With formal fallacies, there&#039;s a very clear argument form that you can identify and express in logical notation and prove is invalid. With informal fallacies there are no such criteria, and generally, it&#039;s trivial to make such arguments non-fallacious by just adding an extra premise. For example, you can easily do this with arguments that appeal to authority. People call these fallacious, but generally they involve the implicit premise that some authority should be trusted.

While President, Eisenhower knew the issue would come up before the courts and nominated Earl Warren to be the new Chief Justice - Warren led Ex. Order 9066 and the Japanese Internment as California&#039;s Attorney General. Warren had since become embarrassed by that, largely due to news of the holocaust, and decided to end the government&#039;s ability to do that forever. This was done with Brown vs. Board of Education. When the South refused to implement it, Eisenhower sent the military to enforce it.

An odd 70 years after the destruction of Judah, Babylon itself gets conquered by Persia. The Persians followed the religion of Zoroastrianism, which was persecuted by the Babylonians, so part of the Persians goal was to reverse all the religious discrimination committed by the Babylonians and rebuild the temples that were destroyed as well as restore religious rule in those regions.<br><br>The descendants of the rulers of Jerusalem who were living in Babylon at the time went before the King of Persia and argued that they were united under a religion called &quot;Judaism&quot; and that they deserved to be restored to their rule over the southern Levant. So the concept of Judaism as a religion was born.<br><br>Things like the Kingdom of Judah, and the experience of the rulers living in Babylon (known as the Babylonian Exile) have been very &quot;spiritualized&quot; in the Abrahamic scope.

Clinton&#039;s defense was that the question he was asked, in the way that it was phrased, basically did not include having received a blowjob and thus technically he never actually lied.<br><br>Added onto all of this is House Speaker Newt Gingrich who had come to power in the 1994 midterms and was clearly eyeing a presidential run himself. He thought if he could take Clinton down then he&#039;d basically be a hero to conservatives everywhere so he tailored the Republican strategy towards pushing this into full on impeachement for perjury and obstruction of justice and is the reason it became such a massive media thing; that was by design for Gingrich. The problem is that most people didn&#039;t think it was a big deal that Clinton got a blowjob and the end result is that the GOP, while still in the majority, lost seats in the 1998 midterm doing much worse than expected. This caused a coup in the Republicans and Gingrich was out of Congress by 1999, his dreams of running in 2000 up in smoke. Also, while he was going on about Clinton&#039;s lack of morals for his adultery, he was cheating on his own wife with a younger, prettier Washington employee.", "time": 1671945947, "resto": 14373161}, {"no": 14373332, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)00:27:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14373310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14373310</a><br>he was just in a poly relationship what&#039;s wrong with that", "filename": "1511718047955", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 1242, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671946021020769, "time": 1671946021, "md5": "CRAtO7e8Ahm1fzUKOOzPLQ==", "fsize": 143803, "resto": 14373161}, {"no": 14373343, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)00:33:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14373327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14373327</a><br>The greater effect was on the 2000 election. Because of the scandald, Gore thought that Clinton would be a burden to his campaign so basically told Bill to stay on the sidelines. But Gore was low energy and came off like a pompous doofus so there was no real enthusiasm for him. Clinton maintained that if he was allowed to campaign, he could&#039;ve helped deliver a state like Arkansas or New Hampshire to Gore. This is a big deal because Gore lost NH by something like 7000 votes. Gore&#039;s electoral total was 266 so if he wins NH, then he has 270 and wins outright, Florida doesn&#039;t even factor into it.
