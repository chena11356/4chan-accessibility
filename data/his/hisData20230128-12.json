Instead, desire is a positive process of production that produces reality, a machine that engineers and manufactures its own objects, its own self-replication, and its own autopoiesis. This was influenced by Nietzsche&#039;s will to power and Spinoza&#039;s conatus.<br>This is then applied to the concept of social reproduction, as in the reproduction and repetition of certain social modes in a given society. Since desire produces reality, social production, with its forces and relations, is purely and simply desiring-production itself under determinate conditions. They argue, thus, that the social universe is composed of &#039;desiring-machines&#039;, all connected to one another and involved in the production and reproduction of desires, which form the individual pieces of much of social reality, like the cells of a body.", "time": 1674790082, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535473, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:29:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14529672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14529672</a><br><a href=\"#p14535467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535467</a><br><br>This concept is fundamental to the book, and from it the notion of the Anti-Oedipus. Freud argues that the Oedipus complex represents an area in which the unconscious and desire is central to the social world - in the tripartite structure of the family (mother, father, offspring). However, the Anti-Oedipus shows that it&#039;s foolish to argue that the social world is solely made up of tripartite families, and instead it is an interconnected flow of different desires and the production of said desires by the desiring machines (ie humans). <br><br>From that standpoint, the concept of the desiring machine, they begin to interrogate how capitalism relates to this production of desire, and how it predicates itself upon the repression of some desiring machines, which leads to neurosis. The argument, then, is that schizophrenia is an extreme mental state co-existent with the capitalist system itself.<br><br>&#039;Desire&#039; here is obviously a broad term, but they were influenced by the discoveries of geneticists and the self-replication of genes - the &#039;desire&#039; for self-replication, survival, procreation showing that desire was not merely an aberrant impulse to acquire, but rather a fundamental productive force. From there, they develop the concept of a &#039;body without organs&#039; - ie the unregulated potential of a body without organisational structures imposed on its constituent parts by the necessities of biological homeostasis, the need to eat, sleep, breath, and instead one that is formed of combinations of desiring machines. This is when desire moves from the base to the superstructure, and can enter the world of more abstract concepts - no longer the desire of an individual, but the desire of a company, of a class, of a nation, of a civilisation. Desire is not limited to the affections of a subject, nor the material state of the subject.", "time": 1674790144, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535525, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:41:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535467</a><br>Do they provide any evidence for these statements, eg. desires producing reality?

Territorialization is maintenance, deterritorialization is dissipation, and reterritorialization is re-maintenance. <br>So, if a social system or system of relations could be argued to be made up of desiring machines, producing and interacting in a constant flow, then gradually they will acclimate and balance into some form of structure (territory). Then, when there is a foundational shift, that current organization and context will be altered, mutated or destroyed, and the components will then constitute a new territory, which is the process of reterritorialization.

Thus, it involves the hegemony of some desiring machines within the system of social relations, and these can be described as hegemonic complexes of desire - the desire for military growth, for economic prosperity, or the desire for a civil society, or the desire for medical governance, etc etc. These hegemonic complexes were often associated, by Deleuze and Guattari, with the sort of hegemonic forces left wingers or Marxists might complain about, but the actual point of schizoanalysis means that it isn&#039;t a critique of left or right wing - since desiring machines exist in both sides. As much as a military desire complex may suppress pacifist desires, a civil, egalitarian desire complex may suppress the will to dominance and power. <br>Essentially, to function, hegemonic capitalism must repress and quash these nonconforming desiring machines, to preserve &#039;normality&#039;.", "time": 1674791204, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535616, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:57:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14532551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14532551</a><br><a href=\"#p14535561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535561</a><br><br>However, as argued in psychoanalysis, these desires, or libidinal investments, do not simply disappear when they have been repressed, instead they emerge in other ways into the social world.

This is modelled on Kant and his transcendental apperception, which isn&#039;t about reality as the Ding an sich (thing-in-itself), ie objective reality independent of representation and observation, but rather reality as it is experienced. Kant argued that much of our experience of what we imagine to be objective reality, i.e. the space and time around us, are actually the forms of intuition via which we structure our experience. Your perception of light isn&#039;t the objective nature of light as a thing-in-itself, but rather light as it is observed by the self. Your perception of time isn&#039;t the objective nature of time as a thing-in-itself, but rather time as it is observed by the self. While the things-in-themselves do exist, they are distinct from our experience of them. From this it follows that the objects of our experience are mere &#039;appearances&#039; and that the nature of things as they are in themselves is unknowable to us. You can compare this to the allegory of the cave, or even to the observer effect in quantum mechanics (which relies on advanced forms of mechanical intuition). This is the basic argument behind Kant&#039;s epistemological programme, which he called transcendental idealism. It has been an epistemological argument that philosophers have grappled with since the 18th century. Russell and the analytics opposed it with na\u00efve realism, which argues that no, we can trust our perception, the world is knowable as it really is, without any consideration of the knower&#039;s manner of knowing. This has always struck me as putting your fingers in your ears and going &#039;La La La&#039;. Applied metaphysical realism to me is like the healthy vegetable of philosophy - it has done us a lot of good so far, it keeps our bowels in check, but it is far from the whole story.", "time": 1674794563, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535765, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:43:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535678</a><br><a href=\"#p14535762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535762</a><br><br>Attached is a map of Kant&#039;s model of coherent consciousness (an issue which is still challenging us today under the new guise of the &#039;consciousness and binding problem&#039;). Deleuze and Guattari basically repurpose this and apply it specifically to desire, desire as an investment or cathexis, meaning a concept or object that is allocated mental, emotional or even physical energy. If desire is allocated less energy, it becomes a libidinal investment rather than a direct investment. If your desire is to drink water, and you then immediately follow every course of action to drink water, then that&#039;s a direct investment. If your desire is to drink water, but your job, your family, or other social relations require you to de-prioritise that desire and follow other, unrelated courses of desire, then your desire to drink water becomes libidinal - at least until you have the opportunity to drink water.<br><br>This leads us to<br><br>2) The meaning that is more important to Deleuze and Guattari is that desire is thus, then, a socially productive and reproductive force. The thing driving the development of a social sector, or a social world, or an entire society, economy, civilisation, whatever, is not just the material conditions, but also the ecosystem and flow of desires between the occupants. There is a complex, mutable web of trillions and trillions of desires being produced by desiring machines, and much of this then governs not just the overall shape of social development, but also the junction at which the self and the world come together (as in Kant).", "filename": "transcendental apperception", "ext": ".png", "w": 1926, "h": 420, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 27, "tim": 1674794624441901, "time": 1674794624, "md5": "ETEbWj1bxdVmpl1c90c0eg==", "fsize": 138140, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14535796, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:56:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14535684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14535684</a><br><br>Science did not exist in Plato&#039;s time.

However, no amount of that can truly contend with the armour piercing question: What proof is there that you are observing and testing the universe as it objectively exists, and not instead simply observing and testing your own objects of experience? How do you know you&#039;re measuring the universe to gain and objective piece of information - a fact - instead of gaining an objective piece of information about your experience alone? How do you know you&#039;re not just measuring the shadows on the cave wall? It&#039;s a really annoying, pointless question, but it can&#039;t really be satisfactorily answered. The metaphysical realists have created a million rebuttals (see: post-Hume analytic philosophy), but still cannot escape the shadow of this postulate.

Aristotle referred to \u03b8\u03b1\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 (tha\u00fbma) in his phenomenology - the notion that conscious experience is a sublime, exhilarating, terrifying experience, yet also somehow quotidian. That, purely by being, every day we run the fearful gauntlet of being in the world, and facing the reality of experience - an almost supernatural event in the eyes of the Greeks. &#039;Wonder is the only beginning of philosophy&#039;, Plato has Socrates say at 155d of the Theaetetus. And at 982b of the Metaphysics Aristotle says, &#039;it is owing to their wonder that men both now begin and at first began to philosophise&#039;. So this is the fundamental aspect of phenomenology - understanding experience and consciousness, exploring the shape of the inside of our own existence, understanding what it is to experience phenomena and the mental objects, what Husserl calls noemata.<br>In order to organise your experience of these phenomena, you need to develop an epistemology, or rather an epistemological process, a theory of knowledge. How do I quantify my perceptions of phenomena? How is knowledge formed? How do I justify my theory of knowledge? Is knowledge formed via rationalisation and a priori logic and thought (rationalism)? Or purely by a posteriori experience and investigation (empiricism and positivism)? Or somewhere in between (Kant)? What is the nature of knowledge and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge? How do I define truth? How can I catalogue the nature of the universe as I experience it?

You use your epistemological process to organise and study the phenomena you experience and attempt to discover more about the fundamental nature of reality, and see if you can develop some first principles of being, identity and change, space and time, cause and effect, necessity and possibility. This part of metaphysics is called ontology, the study of being and the organisation of being into categories. Much of science comes into this bracket of philosophy - substances, properties, relations, states of affairs and events. Prior to the modern history of science, scientific questions were addressed as a part of natural philosophy. Then, over the Enlightenment, post-Hume, the scientific method came along and transformed natural philosophy into an empirical activity deriving from experiment, unlike the rest of philosophy - driven by empiricism. <br><br>The 19th century built on this with positivism (Comte, Darwin, Marx, Durkheim), and then that was brought back down to a much less positivist approach in the 20th century, whether that&#039;s more conservative critical rationalism or some of the more radical approaches or what have you (Popper, Kuhn, Feyeraband). However, since the split in the 18th century, metaphysics has denoted philosophical enquiry of a non-empirical character into the nature of existence.", "time": 1674829301, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14537310, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)09:22:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14537300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14537300</a><br><a href=\"#p14536628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14536628</a><br><br>However, where science stops asking &quot;why,&quot; metaphysics continues the question. Any theory of basic physics, for instance, is predicated on a set of axioms that may presuppose the existence of things like atoms, particles, forces, charges, mass, or fields. A science theory is said to have reached its &quot;end&quot; when such postulates are made. Metaphysics takes these postulates and examines what they mean in terms of human concepts. Do all theories of physics, for instance, require the presence of space, time, things, and properties? Can they also be expressed solely in terms of objects or properties? Do the objects have to stay the same over time or are they allowed to change? And on and on, ad nauseam.<br><br>From there, metaphysics starts getting into THE big question, referred to by philosophers as the &quot;Why is there something rather than nothing?&quot; question. Russell took a &#039;brute fact&#039; position when he said, &quot;I should say that the universe is just there, and that&#039;s all&quot;, which is what I call the &#039;La La La&#039; approach.

There is something rather than nothing, because the existence of something requires there to be something, rather than nothing. Aristotle&#039;s unmoved mover and all that.<br><br>Still, this is an issue that metaphysics still contends with and hasn&#039;t solved. No matter how much Russell says &#039;That&#039;s all&#039;, we&#039;re still led into this realm. The scientific method still struggles here, and the more it discovers (quantum mechanics??) the more questions it raises.<br><br>It was very important for British philosophers at the start of the 20th century, descended from Hume (a skeptic of rationalism), to distinguish themselves from the Kantian and Hegelian world, German idealism and all of its mess. So Russell and Whitehead were really intent on drawing a clear line between analytical philosophy (good, logic-driven, based on piecemeal induction, relatively empirical, agnostic about metaphysics, ethically naturalist), and continental philosophy (rationalism, idealism, deductive reasoning, bad, bad, not good). The distinction is not as simply as British vs continental, Frege, Carnap and Wittgenstein were very important for analytical philosophy. And these philosophers were tightly intertwined with philosophers of the &#039;continental&#039; canon, like Husserl and Bergson (Bergson is universally appreciated). The biggest aspect seemed to be about distancing themselves from Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Heidegger, etc. I would argue that quite a lot of this distinction is pretty broad and political, and in many ways kind of bullshit.

A wave-function may collapse due to observation, which does not mean there isn&#039;t an objective reality, but instead that our attempts to measure an objective reality will always be limited by the fact that we, ourselves, are forced to occupy and participate in that objective reality. At the turn of the 20th century, Planck was making discoveries in the study of black-body radiation (On Irreversible Radiation Processes and On the Law of the Energy Distribution in the Normal Spectrum) that required new methodologies that required an overthrow of classical mechanics, his postulate being that that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in quantised form. From there, quantisation became a necessity of measurement, and with it the complications of &quot;observables&quot; as self-adjoint operators, rather than the &#039;canonical&#039; observation of classical mechanics. The realisation, after double-slit and the rest, was that objective observation would always be limited by the fact that the process of observation would have to exist in the same quantum realm as that which is observed, and since every action has some kind of quantum effect, the conditions of that being observed and measured would always change as a consequence of measurement.", "time": 1674829670, "resto": 14529672}, {"no": 14537343, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)09:28:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14537336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14537336</a><br><a href=\"#p14536628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14536628</a><br><br>Over the next 60 or so years after Planck, there were many theoretical physicists who then questioned the extent of this participation - Wheeler, who helped build the atom bomb, even argued for a participatory anthropic universe, i.e. a universe that we can only confirm to exist based on our conscious participation within it. Of course, again, this does not confirm subjectivity, because that&#039;s not the point. The real discovery of quantum mechanics wasn&#039;t just a mechanical model that can deal with the physical nature of reality at an atomic subatomic level wherein forces and momentum can only be understood as discrete values (quantisation), but also there are clear limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement. A central part of that is that reality cannot be left unchanged by observation, and that, just as the observer emerges from a measurement of reality altered, that reality must be altered as well, on the quantum level. When measuring heat, a standard mercury-in-glass thermometer must absorb or release thermal energy to record a temperature, which will affect the temperature of the subject they are monitoring.

Moreover, in these three things no true-seeming illusion disturbs us; for we do not come into contact with these by some bodily sense, as we perceive the things outside of us of all which sensible objects it is the images resembling them, but not themselves which we perceive in the mind and hold in the memory, and which excite us to desire the objects. But, without any delusive representation of images or phantasms, I am most certain that I am, and that I know and delight in this.

For he who is not, cannot be deceived; and if I am deceived, by this same token I am. And since I am if I am deceived, how am I deceived in believing that I am? for it is certain that I am if I am deceived. Since, therefore, I, the person deceived, should be, even if I were deceived, certainly I am not deceived in this knowledge that I am. And, consequently, neither am I deceived in knowing that I know. For, as I know that I am, so I know this also, that I know. And when I love these two things, I add to them a certain third thing, namely, my love, which is of equal moment. For neither am I deceived in this, that I love, since in those things which I love I am not deceived; though even if these were false, it would still be true that I loved false things. For how could I justly be blamed and prohibited from loving false things, if it were false that I loved them? But, since they are true and real, who doubts that when they are loved, the love of them is itself true and real?

I see from it that Lapinski\u2019s dogma that the Great Russians are not Slavs has been advocated on linguistic, historical and ethnographical grounds in all seriousness by Monsieur Duchinski (from Kiev, Professor in Paris); he maintains that the real Muscovites, i.e., inhabitants of the former Grand Duchy of Moscow, were for the most part Mongols or Finns, etc., as was the case in the parts of Russia situated further east and in its south-eastern parts. I see from it at all events that the affair has seriously worried the St Petersburg cabinet (since it would put an end to Panslavism in no uncertain manner). All Russian scholars were called on to give responses and refutations, and these in the event turned out to be terribly weak. The purity of the Great Russian dialect and its connection with Church Slavonic appear to lend more support to the Polish than to the Muscovite view in this debate. During the last Polish insurrection Duchinski was awarded a prize by the National Government for his \u2018discoveries\u2019. It has ditto been shown geologically and hydrographically that a great \u2018Asiatic\u2019 difference occurs east of the Dnieper, compared with what lies to the west of it, and that (as Murchison has already maintained) the Urals by no means constitute a dividing line. Result as obtained by Duchinski: Russia is a name usurped by the Muscovites. They are not Slavs; they do not belong to the Indo-Germanic race at all, they are des intrus [intruders], who must be chased back across the Dnieper, etc. Panslavism in the Russian sense is a cabinet invention, etc.</span>", "time": 1674902711, "resto": 14533641}, {"no": 14542038, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)05:46:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wish that Duchinski were right and at all events that this view would prevail among the Slavs. On the other hand, he states that some of the peoples in Turkey, such as Bulgars, e.g., who had previously been regarded as Slavs, are non-Slav.</span><br><br>So here Charlie is describing someone else&#039;s view.", "time": 1674902773, "resto": 14533641}, {"no": 14542073, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)05:59:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14533836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14533836</a><br>Trump isn&#039;t as articulated as Che Guevara and his idiotic US colloquialisms give hime away.", "time": 1674903591, "resto": 14533641}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14540591, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)22:14:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hero or villain?", "filename": "napoleon", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1540, "h": 2568, "tn_w": 149, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674875687048563, "time": 1674875687, "md5": "u2LCuMEa1xbtGi0N1R/iMw==", "fsize": 1113570, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hero-or-villain", "replies": 31, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 14540627, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)22:21:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "villain, he betrayed pretty much every ally", "time": 1674876065, "resto": 14540591}, {"no": 14540769, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)22:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14540591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14540591</a><br>Cuck.

What&#039;s happening is that the children of Israel have a choice: if they will be righteous, God will reward them with descendants, and if not they will perish. It is exactly the same message we see again and again throughout the Torah. To make one&#039;s soul into a sin offering means to devote one&#039;s life to serving God. Crucially, the &quot;sin offering&quot; or restitution is paid to God on his own behalf, not on behalf of others. In verse 11 he justified many by &quot;his knowledge,&quot; which is the knowledge of God this righteous servant will spread throughout the world. See Zechariah 8:23.

A person can intercede for others by praying for them or doing good things in their name, but that is it. Every person must still atone for their own sins (see Ezekiel 18:20-23).

The New Testament never lays out any concrete doctrine on how Jesus&#039;s death or blood actually makes atonement for us, the closest thing you&#039;re going to find in it is the Ransom Theory but there is nothing explicit about that. Everyone in the ancient world understood sacrifice as like divine currency. The importance of blood in atonement is certainly present in Judaism and the Tanakh, specifically in the priestly source: Leviticus 4:35 and 5:9 specifically connect it with forgiveness and expiation. More importantly though, it was used in establishing a covenant as in the case of Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Was blood always necessary for atonement? Not always, prayer and repentance played a role too and Leviticus 5:11 has grain offerings in place of sin offerings for atonement. But the importance of prayer and repentance are important for forgivness in the New Testament too: Acts 2:28, Luke 24:47, 1 John 1:7-9, the list goes on. The New Testament instead understands Jesus&#039;s sacrifice as a kind of chatat for all believers, past, present, and future, and like Judaism of the post Temple period, puts a heavy emphasis on repentance and faithfulness as necessary for forgiveness as well. <br><br>Finally, the Judaism of Jesus&#039;s time most certainly had a precursor concept of a righteous man and his blood being able to make atonement for sins. 4 Maccabees 6:28-29 reads: &quot;Be merciful to your people, and let our punishment suffice for them. Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs\u201d. The idea of righteous martyrs standing in place, doing a kind of &quot;penance&quot; on behalf of Israel&#039;s sins, did exist at this time and mostly arose out the context of the Maccabean revolt (as did the Jewish idea about a future resurrection of the righteous).

But the Tanakh prescribes multiple ways of forgiveness for sins, repentance is one view held by the Torah and the importance of repentance for forgiveness is in the NT too. Aren&#039;t you a Jew? You should be cognizant of the different opinions on this in the Torah. The priestly writers emphasized sacrifice for forgiveness, the prophets emphasized repentance. These aren&#039;t mutually exclusive. In a way you are right that repentance is the primary way of forgiveness since its implicit in performing sacrifice and this is part of Christianity too. You seem to be polemicizing against a specific brand of Protestant Christianity since this is what most antimissionary Jewish polemics are aimed at. Not all Christians understand atonement in this way.", "time": 1674844832, "resto": 14534890}, {"no": 14538536, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:41:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14538051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14538051</a><br><a href=\"#p14538083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14538083</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is hoped that the death of martyrs will inspire others to repent.

Firstly, it doesn&#039;t matter what ideas there were in Judaism because the Bible isn&#039;t a manmade book, it&#039;s inspired by God. It doesn&#039;t matter what common people thought back then, whether they worshipped false gods or otherwise. So everything in the Holy Bible was already determined by God, and it isn&#039;t a development of ideas nor an invention of groups of men in the first place. Second. The prophecies about the Messiah are present throughout the Old Testament, from the books of Moses (see for instance Genesis 3:15, Gen. 22:17, Gen. 49:10, Deut. 18:15-18) and many others. It was a concept even in the time of Job as mentioned of the Redeemer in Job 19:25-27. Jesus Christ is found all throughout the Bible, He is spoken of as the Messiah and the only begotten Son of God (see Psalm 2, Hosea 11:1, Isaiah 9:6, Psalm 91, 2 Sam. 7:12-16). Your sentence is so wrong on so many levels, that like I said, I don&#039;t even know where to begin. Also you haven&#039;t backed up a single word with anything concrete, just your bare assertions which are easily proved false by even the slightest effort. The arguments of some medieval heretics in middle ages Europe about the Talmud, is so irrelevant from this, that I can&#039;t see why it was even brought into this conversation.", "filename": "6208138", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674858712077173, "time": 1674858712, "md5": "o2ZXvj/bMlr8//35RSabeg==", "fsize": 783714, "resto": 14534890}, {"no": 14541138, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:31:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14538528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14538528</a><br>There is no reason to believe the first two examples are talking about metaphorical descendants rather than biological ones.

The result is a schizophrenic megalomanic that loves you unconditionally but we torture you forever if you don&#039;t worship him. All powerful but can be easily defeated by foreskin (Exodus 4:24-26). All knowing but cannot find two humans hiding behind a tree (Genesis 3:9-10).
