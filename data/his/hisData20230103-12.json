It is the only system, in theory, in which the government is constantly scrutinised by legislators and judges, and the government is powerless to send people to jail or act as judge, jury and executioner. In other systems e.g. military dictatorships or absolute monarchies, all powers are concentrated in one person - of course this always depends on the specific case, for example dictator Mussolini was deposed by the legislative Council of Fascism, dictator Pinochet stepped down after losing a referendum, etc but that&#039;s the general idea. An absolute monarch is above the law; a feudal lord, a warlord, a sultan not only rules the land but acts as judge and legislator as well. This cannot happen in a democracy, by definition.

By that I mean it had temples, monks, priests, they were writing their own literature (most of Europe&#039;s pagan religion and mythology was recorded by Catholics for instance), and when faced with a higher standard of living present in metropolitan life it could still give answers to metaphysical, emotional, existential questions that bother intellectuals. This last part is especially important for endowing a religion with a timeless quality that will persist in the face of modernity. A lot of pagan beliefs didn&#039;t survive because they depended on genuine ignorance and worship of the &quot;gods of gaps&quot;. <br>This is pure assumption, but I also think Hinduism had (and still has) the benefit of controlled, slow, exposure to competing foreign religions and getting the opportunity to workshop more. India has something called the Kumhb Mela/Magh Mela every 12 years where hundreds of millions of people show up at the Ganges river to get baptized, seek absolution of sin, and discuss theology.

Early Christians thought demons were everywhere and were unclean, in order for God&#039;s Spirit to rest in a person he/she needed to be exercised before baptism and then chrismation/laying on of hands. Triple immersion baptism in the name of the Trinity (generally, or a trinity at least) cleanses a person of sin and makes them consubstantial with Christ and in some sense mini-christs who are adopted as God&#039;s children. Chrismation and the laying on of the hands imparts the Holy Spirit and his gifts to the elect. Early Christianity was charismatic too not too but eventually the orthodox began to reject gifts because they were being abused. Still, it was not uncommon for some Christians, like the Monatist, to believe God spoke personally through them. Monatists heavily promoted the divinity of the Holy Spirit as God. Gnostics thought their divine angelic counterpart spoke in them. Baptism was a chief sacrament in early Christianity. Some Christians thought ultimate redemption happened at Christ&#039;s baptism rather than crucifixion or resurrection. Even still, the Eastern Church places more emphasis on the resurrection in redemption whereas western theologians focus more on the crucifixion itself for redemption. Baptism is a derivative of the Jewish act of immersing in a mikveh, but with a new meaning attached to cleansing sin as a replacement for sacrifice. It was basically invented by John the Baptist himself, not Jesus. Similar ideas appear in the Qumran literature. The role of prayer forms as a replacement for sacrifice in Rabbinical Judaism, notice how both groups lack a temple. Though the notion of prayer also being sacrificial was known at this time.

The landscape at the heart of the rural idyll is not the product of a peasant society or a countryside of independent family farms. It is largely the creation of agrarian capitalism in its \u2018golden age\u2019. Although it was centuries in the making, and though the marks of other times and other ways of life have never been completely erased, the landscape that figures most prominently in the mythology of \u2018England\u2019s green and pleasant land\u2019 probably owes more to the eighteenth century than any other, \u2018the age of the territorial aristocracy\u2019 and the era of \u2018improvement\u2019 at its height.1</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The seemingly idyllic landscape of rural England has inscribed within it the history of capitalist property and class relations. Both peasants and landlords underwent a transformation, which changed the landscape too. On one side is the process of dispossession and enclosure, which, among other things, made rural poverty less visible. Poor peasants of the type that have shaped the countryside in other agricultural societies, with their marginal plots and impoverished dwellings, were replaced by two distinct agrarian classes: more prosperous capitalist tenants, with their solid, even picturesque farmhouses, and landless labourers, whose only mark on the landscape was a system of rights-of-way across fields giving them access to their places of work \u2013 their gift to ramblers today. Even whole villages disappeared in this process of rural transformation. On the other side are country houses, parks, and landscape gardens. The remains of a classic military aristocrary had long been replaced by the comforts and ornaments of the country gentleman, the \u2018territorial aristocrat\u2019 living on the rents of capitalist tenants, who truly came into his own in the eighteenth century.</span>", "time": 1672728154, "resto": 14414188}, {"no": 14414204, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)01:49:09", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "023010321729", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 2195, "tn_w": 61, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672728549929610, "time": 1672728549, "md5": "Ec5T0d48v77OUpF+ZvHVZg==", "fsize": 842045, "resto": 14414188}, {"no": 14414215, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)01:53:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No ethnographic studies have shown that any present or past society has used barter without any other medium of exchange or measurement, and anthropologists have found no evidence that money emerged from barter.", "time": 1672728795, "resto": 14414188}, {"no": 14414260, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)02:13:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;sodoku ginmi standardized the kundoku reading, which converts the syntactical order of the kanbun to \u201cJapanese-local\u201d grammar by inserting diacritical marks, particles, and suffixes, and conjugating words as necessary.

The word is derived from the ancient Latin word religio, but religio was only one of a constellation of terms surrounding social obligations in ancient Rome, and when used it signified something quite different from religion in the modern sense. Religio referred to a powerful requirement to perform some action. Its most probable derivation is from re-ligare, to rebind or relink, that is, to reestablish a bond that has been severed. To say religio mihi est\u2014that something is \u201creligio for me\u201d\u2014meant that it was something that carried a serious obligation for a person.

The rationalists and the empiricists differed in their answers. These answers, in their various formulations, determined the course of Western philosophy. In the Sanksrit philosophical vocabulary, the words &#039;reason&#039; and &#039;experience&#039; have no exact synonyms, and the epistemological issue was never formulated in such general terms.

Among things that were taken to be sensuously perceived are: the self and its qualities, such as pleasure, pain, desire and cognition; universals, such as redness; natural-kind essences, such as cowness; and relations, such as contact and inherence (of a quality in a substance; of a universal in its instances). That *anum\u0101na* or inference is different from reason (of the rationalists) is clear from its very etymology; it follows upon perception.

There are no Indian rationalists.

The Milinda Pa\u00f1ha (\u201cQuestions of King Menander\u201d) portrays a dialogue between King Menander and the monk N\u0101gasena. Since attaining canonical form in Plutarch as Theseus\u2019 ship, a version of this thought experiment has had a long life in European philosophical thought, where it is often used to argue for some version of mereological nihilism. But the Milinda Pa\u00f1ha has a different conclusion. First, it suggests that the chariot is only provisionally or conventionally the same chariot. Any entity composed of parts or aggregates lacks a single or essential nature. So in this respect, a process is in some sense always changing, and therefore lacks autonomous or permanent identity (again, think of Heraclitus never stepping in the same river). This seems to be a largely skeptical response. But the Milinda Pa\u00f1ha goes one step further, and suggests that the conventional identity of the chariot is similar to a lit torch being used to light another torch. Is it the same flame?

We may distinguish between the cause of my believing it, and reasoning for believing it. The cause of my believing it is that God designed me to believe it. That is, in the objective reality, God designed the creature with mental tools to equip him to live in the world He designed, which by virtue of the masterful skill of the designer in their original and undamaged form are highly successful at delivering truth to the creature that he may act on truth and not falsehood. It for this reason if is simply obvious to me that 2+2=4, that if all men are mortal and Socrates is a man then Socrates is mortal, and that God exists, for such knowledge was implanted in my soul at my creation, such that no matter how hard I try or tell myself otherwise, I cannot help but know it. But because of the fall of man my mind is not in its original and undamaged form, and has far greater difficulty in discovering truth than it ought to. So the Lord intervened and invaded His own creation and spoke to man to cut through the darkness of fallen reason to lead His people to the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. So while the creature&#039;s reasoning was derailed by sin, it was put back on track by the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit that the inspiration of His word might be as clear and instant to his mind as light is to his eyes. But while this account may do well to extoll the rationality of Christian belief, it does so without actually touching its truth value. It is a cold, objective and mechanistic narrative of things done to a machine, rather than a first-person account of experience giving compelling cause for belief.", "time": 1672644476, "resto": 14409540}, {"no": 14409674, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)02:28:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14409614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14409614</a><br>The reasoning for believing it is that there is no other. That is, in the subjective experience, I see how God stands behind all truth. That is, if the Triune Christian God of scripture exists, then it is impossible for there to be external proofs of it, not because He is wanting for proof, but because all truths and all facts are explicitly Christian and internal to the Christian faith; God the all-father of truth. For I do see how God stands at the beginning and the end of all reasoning, and how irrational and untenable unbelief is, so that unbelievers are not as unbelieving as they think they are because they too depend on their innate knowledge of God and oppose themselves when they oppose Him. I see that they too see God standing behind every fact, they too see Him standing at the beginning and the end of all reasoning, but while unbelievers always see God in the corner of their vision they dare not look Him in the eye. And that is why I believe in God. I shall not convert you at the end of my argument. I think the argument is sound. I hold that belief in God is not merely as reasonable as other belief, or even a little or infinitely more probably true than other belief; I hold rather that unless you believe in God you can logically believe in nothing else.
