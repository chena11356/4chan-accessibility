Vodouists believe that over a thousand lwa exist, the names of at least 232 of which are recorded. Each lwa has its own personality and is associated with specific colors and objects. Many of them are equated with specific Roman Catholic saints on the basis of similar characteristics or shared symbols. The lwa are divided into different groups, known as nanchon (nations), the most notable of which are the Petwo and the Rada. According to Vodou belief, the lwa communicate with humans through dreams and divination, and in turn are given offerings, including sacrificed animals. Vodou teaches that during ceremonies, the lwa possess specific practitioners, who during the possession are considered the chwal (horse) of the lwa.

The Dutch outpost on Dejima provided a trickle of Western learning, and in the 1850s became a full-blown naval institute with Dutch training officers and a donated steamship. They were quicky replaced by the Royal Navy, who were happy to see another threat to Russian expansion in Asia. This begat a contest between Britain, Germany, and France to win over the Meiji government with gifts of arms and engineering expertise. By the 1870s British-built Japanese ships were menacing Taiwan and Korea. These conflicts, culminating in the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, awarded Japan cash indemnities that they used to buy more ships. By 1905 Japan had amassed the sixth-largest navy in the world.

I said this before, and I\u2019ll say it again:<br>Most Jews, do not even consider any of the old testament outside of the petition as authoritative. <br><br>Most of them never actually read it outside of some selected chapters from the Psalms. The reasoning behind that, is that both the writings and the prophets do not have anything unique that is not already found in the Pentateuch; so why bother reading them? Even then they get all of their commentary that they need for their religion in the commentary of Rashi for all of their Bibles, to prove as a hostile apologetic against Christian interpretation of scripture; this helps them ignore all the messianic imagery and prophecies that Christians point out to them. You know it\u2019s really rather funny, the book of Daniel automatically proves rabbinic Judaism false.

Of course, some antinomians denominations may argue against the binding validity of the law as a rule for life, but that goes against the very words of Christ and of His apostles.<br><br>It seems to me that it is in fact unbelievers who have less of an incentive to be law abiding citizens, seeing as they deny the universality of moral obligations and the inevitable visitation of justice even to those malefactors who operate covertly. It follows that apart from a mature notion of maintaining social harmony and cohesion, a belief scarcely present in the youth of today, or a arbitrary commitment to particular ethical precepts, the unbeliever would only obey rules and statutes only insofar as he perceives a greater likelihood of getting caught by human authorities in violating them.

The area in abstract makes sense because:<br>1. Assuming they didn&#039;t cross mountain ranges as they&#039;ve migrated, the distance they could cover between the collapse of the hunnic empire and their first mentions by byzantines is proportional with the distance between it and the earliest finds of slavic like pottery in the Czech Republic.<br>2.

In the grand scheme of things? Pretty alright? I actually have a PhD in Ottoman history. You are going to get a lot of mingy nationalist posts talking about how awful it was - while I am not going to pretend the Ottoman Empire was perfect you should ignore these. The Ottomans are just an easy scapegoat for problems because they don&#039;t exist. Most slavic nations, the greeks, etc. Their issues stem from post-Ottoman shenigans, corruption, and larger European politics. But, it is easy to blame the dead empire than shake fists at people who might actually get mad at you. You&#039;ll get some people going for the epic owning Islam take - these can also be ignored. This is not a good place to ask this if you want genuine responses. I will try my best though to give you a very direct and (overly) simple take: As a point of fact despite the work of Suraiya Faroqhi and others our knowledge of the common person in the Ottoman empire is pretty poor. The records don&#039;t show you much about their actual lived experience, you have a metric ton of data from a government/elite perspective, but common people are kind of just looked down on and ignored. They come up in court sicils and other things from time to time, but, we know more about Elite people, in major cities then we do about anything else. (Though again, time and place matter immensely) most accounts you&#039;d find from Europeans and others would say - it would have been pretty damn good to be an elite most of the time, and pretty okay to good to be a common person.", "time": 1674969189, "resto": 14543068}, {"no": 14546054, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:14:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14546050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14546050</a><br><br>But, like - when crisis of the 17th century hit - probably was a pretty ass time for a lot of people out in the boonies, during Tanzimat it was certainly not sunshine and lollipops for a lot of people.

The festival attendees were branded as hippies by the British press. This, along with the open drug use and sale, contributed to the increase in restrictions on access to Stonehenge, and fences were erected around the stones in 1977. The same year, police resurrected a moribund law against driving over grassland in order to levy fines against festival goers in motorised transport.

To be a Hitler, an Eichmann or a Mengele takes a kind of conviction and effort few people can hope to attain to, let alone call their own. Hence it is vital to investigate the worldview driving such men with due diligence and impartiality. Yet there is hardly a worldview demonised as widely and deeply as Nazism and hardly a crime as well-known or condemned as the holocaust. You can lionise Genghis Khan or Mao without being branded a heretic and shot by an imperial commissar. In fact, there are societies who approve of them. This is in spite of the equal or larger significance of these figures and the equal or larger violence and death tolls caused by their orders. Hitler&#039;s only fault was in being the first to lose without an avenger and riot the cathedral. Western society highlights Hitler, nazis and the holocaust on ideological grounds and for narrative control. Every single debate in the Western world resorts revolves around Godwin&#039;s law, set up in a way so the biggest anti-fascist wins. The media is Goebbels and &#039;L\u00fcgenpresse&#039; is nazi-jargon. Antifa is brownshirts and smash the fash. Ukraine is full of nazis and Putin is Hitler. Zionism is Lebensraum and Hamas is Islamofascism. The infected go to concentration camps and Bill Gates goes to Nuremberg. You can try to wiggle out of this dialectic through metapolitics, king, but holocaust remembrance remains. Holocaust remembrance is an abyss of nothingness. It means nothing and reinforces no values. It is an antimyth, something solely designed to destroy all other myths. It never nursed, never gave birth. Like a sort of tranny held captive in a black mirror screaming out a giga-fact-check into the void for all of eternity.

Therefore, landholders ought to pay compensation according to the rental value set by the free market, absent any improvements, to the community for the civil right of usufruct (that is, legally recognized exclusive possession with restrictions on property abuse) or otherwise fee simple title with no such restrictions. Ideally, the taxing of a site would be administered only after it has been determined that the privately captured economic rent from the land exceeds the title-holder&#039;s equal share of total land value in the jurisdiction.<br><br>On this proposal, rent is collected not for the mere occupancy or use of land, as neither the community nor the state rightfully owns the commons, but rather as an objectively assessed indemnity due for the legal right to exclude others from that land. Some geolibertarians also support Pigovian taxes on pollution and severance taxes to regulate natural resource depletion and compensatory fees with ancillary positive environmental effects on activities which negatively impact land values. They take the standard right-libertarian position that each individual is naturally entitled to the fruits of their labor as exclusive private property as opposed to produced goods being owned collectively by society or by the government acting to represent society, and that a person&#039;s &quot;labor, wages, and the products of labor&quot; should not be taxed. Along with non-Georgists in the libertarian movement, they also advocate the law of equal liberty, supporting &quot;full civil liberties, with no crimes unless there are victims who have been invaded.&quot;[1]", "time": 1674983326, "resto": 14546669}, {"no": 14546690, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)04:09:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Geolibertarians are generally influenced by the Georgist single tax movement of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, but the ideas behind it pre-date Henry George and can be found in different forms in the political writings of John Locke, the early agrarian socialism of English True Levellers or Diggers such as Gerrard Winstanley, the French Physiocrats (especially Quesnay and Turgot), British classical economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo, French liberal economists Jean-Baptiste Say and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, American Revolutionary writers Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine, English Radical land reformer Thomas Spence, American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker, as well as British classical liberal philosophers John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer.

Sasanov waited until March 9th, 1915 to tell Stavka to pass on to Odessa to Odessa a formal allied request that Russia contribute 80-85k troops for combined amphibious landings.

If Algirdas for example, managed to take out Muscovy then it might have worked out differently. I guess technological backwardness and golden liberty of boyars that were bribed by enemy powers also weakened PLC a lot.<br>From ethnic Lithuanian standpoint the problem was also our general backwardness that allowed for foreign cultural influence to spread, polonization took root among aristocracy (even if they called themselves Lithuanians and defended their sovereignty because it was the source of their power) and among city dwellers and lower nobility, boyars (especially mid tier boyars), because they wanted privileges that Polish boyars had, looked up to them culturally and adapted their language and other customs in greater or lesser form.<br>Also, serfdom, that meant that peasantry couldn&#039;t really form its own cultural trends, Paganism was slowly extinguished or adapted and Christianity needed to be adapted over few centuries. But maybe that also saved us from total assimilation, because serfs were insulated from larger global and local trends.

Then, when they go on to look into the nature of the life itself, if they find it mere nutritive life, without sensibility, such as that of plants, they consider it inferior to sentient life, such as that of cattle; and above this, again, they place intelligent life, such as that of men. And, perceiving that even this is subject to change, they are compelled to place above it, again, that unchangeable life which is not at one time foolish, at another time wise, but on the contrary is wisdom itself. For a wise intelligence, that is, one that has attained to wisdom, was, previous to its attaining wisdom, unwise. But wisdom itself never was unwise, and never can become so. And if men never caught sight of this wisdom, they could never with entire confidence prefer a life which is unchangeably wise to one that is subject to change.

While varying jurisdictional arrangements with varying degrees of primatial power have been present in different times and regions, the intrinsic character of primacy is defined in Apostolic Canon 34: \u201cThe bishops of every nation must acknowledge him who is first among them and account him as their head, and do nothing of consequence without his consent\u2026 But neither let him who is the first do anything without the consent of all; for so there will be unanimity, and God will be glorified through the Lord in the Holy Spirit.\u201d To speak of the Pope of Rome as the archbishop of all the churches cannot, then, be equated without consideration to his having ordinary and immediate jurisdiction over all the Churches. Indeed, the context of the Council, given the critical analysis of St. Leo\u2019s Tome by the Council Fathers, suggests something more like that described in the Apostolic Canons, where primatial and collegial authority are both necessary for the Council\u2019s being what it is.\u201d<br>https://kabane52.tumblr.com/post/18<wbr>4760073500/papal-primacy-ecumenism-<wbr>and-orthodox-tradition", "time": 1674929221, "resto": 14541966}, {"no": 14543304, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)13:08:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14543280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14543280</a><br>Eastern Orthodox can&#039;t even appeal to geographic isolation as a sign that the Oriental Orthodox are in the wrong, because the same thing happened to both of them.", "time": 1674929308, "resto": 14541966}, {"no": 14543309, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)13:10:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14543270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14543270</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there is no way to differentiate between which of you is right</span><br>Not the Holy Spirit, huh?

That&#039;s how I am to treat it, and 2 Thessalonians 3:6 makes this very clear, that we are not to accept interlopers or those coming claiming to have a different thing to say.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paul repeatedly exhorts Timothy and Titus to hold fast to that which they received</span><br><br>&quot;But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;<br>15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.&quot;<br>(2 Timothy 3:14-15)<br><br>Here we see what Paul told Timothy. And following this is the epistle to Titus: &quot;Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.&quot; (Titus 1:9) Amen.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Again, just assuming it\u2019s man-made baselessly.</span><br>It says it directly in Mark&#039;s Gospel. Look at the verse prior, which I am guessing you didn&#039;t go read. &quot;Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.&quot; (Mark 7:7). See that? Commandments of men. It says that very thing right there in the Gospel of Mark.<br><br>It says it also again in Mark 7:13, where it is &quot;your tradition which ye have delivered&quot; as opposed to &quot;the word of God.&quot; The two are in opposition here.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can tell the Jewish oral tradition is fake because there are ancient Jewish sects that lack the same oral tradition.</span><br>It&#039;s not in the written word, it isn&#039;t something that God inspired.

The point here is that believing, as it says in John 6:47 \u2013 &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.&quot; \u2013 believing in the Lord Jesus is the gift of God. As it says in Ephesians 2:8-9, by grace are we saved through faith, and that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. So, the act of acknowledgement does not mean we are trusting in any of our own works. Because again, salvation is not of ourselves, and not of works. This answers the alleged objection in the first question here: <a href=\"#p14546368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14546368</a><br><br>So then getting back to the question, the faith that the Bible speaks of is the reason for salvation - not anything that is of ourselves. So it cannot be characterized as trusting in one&#039;s own work then, as it is not a work. This faith is mentioned in Colossians 2:12 and throughout Scripture (cf Ps. 32:5, etc.) Baptism, again, according to 1 Peter 3:21, is a figure of that which saves us; that which saves us is the actual Resurrection of our Savior and Lord. So according to the Bible, baptism is not that which saves us, but it actually represents this same thing. Because of this, it is shown not to be that which saves us, as stated in 1 Peter 3:21.<br><br>It is rather &quot;the answer of a good conscience toward God.&quot; This characterizes baptism as something that is done willingly, because it is an &quot;answer&quot; of something that is on their &quot;conscience.&quot; So, while such a thing is a matter of obedience to the truth, it is not the actual salvific factor for whether a person is saved. That&#039;s to say, it doesn&#039;t &quot;violate&quot; Eph. 2:8-9. But to say that it, or any good work outside of Christ&#039;s sacrifice, is the &quot;cause of salvation,&quot; does in fact contradict it. Of course according to Ephesians 2:10, good works are to be done.

Second, The Bay of Pigs was a complete fiasco that indicated Kennedy&#039;s poor leadership. Kennedy&#039;s meeting with Khrushchev was a complete debacle that showed Kennedy&#039;s inexperience and gave Khrushchev confidence. The Berlin Wall was also constructed while Kennedy was president. The Cuban Missile Crisis was another blunder. Although WWIII did not start, the US had to remove their Jupiter missiles from Turkey. Therefore, the Cuban Missile Crisis was a net loss of the US and a win for USSR.

The six leagues of inner jasag (later known as Inner Mongolia) were divided into 49 banners, and the Khalkha (later known as Outer Mongolia) were divided into 81 banners. There were also numerous other banners outside the two large entities. Borders were demarcated and policed between tribes, leagues and even between banners. Karun (M. Haruul, C. Kalun) border control stations were set up along borders, and stone cairns called oboo were built between karuns. At strategic places, each karun was manned by 30\u201340 soldiers from Manchu garrison armies stationed in Suiyuan, Ningxia, Uliastai and other places; they would patrol along the border every day to the oboo between karuns, where they exchanged information with patrols from the other karun. This was called khaich yavakh, scissor-walking, a metaphor implying that the soldiers were cutting the borderline like scissors, making a radical partition. These karuns and oboos would be checked by Manchu garrison generals once a month and they would be inspected by officials from the Lifan Yuan in Beijing occasionally. No tribal, league, or banner nobles and subjects were permitted to cross banner borders, nor were they allowed to marry across banners without authorization. The karun guards would make their record every day and the inspection report would be sent to Beijing regularly (Baoyinchaoketu 2003).</span>", "time": 1674977907, "resto": 14542361}, {"no": 14546474, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)02:39:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14546464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14546464</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you would be banned from /his/ right now</span><br>You&#039;re very smart.

For instance, Daqing Huidian Shili, published in the twenty-third year of Jiaqing reign (1814), recorded the following: \u201cOriginally, should there be border violations from Mongolia, a prince would be fined 10 horses, zasag, beile, beizi, and gong 7 horses, taiji five horses, and commoner, a cattle\u201d. By the second decade of the nineteenth century, the fine had been increased tenfold for aristocrats, and a commoner would lose all his property, including himself, which would be awarded to the whistle-blower (Huidianguan 2006: vol. 979, pp. 237\u201339). The fine soared further towards the end of the Qing, betraying an increase in violations and their seriousness.11</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;21Such stringent prohibition of trespassing borders was to mould a divided unity of the Mongols under the Qing gurun or state. All Mongols were to identify with the Qing state, not as a politically unified nation (ulus), but through the banner system. It was intended to prevent the Mongols from realigning with each other and challenging the Qing, as it categorically prohibited princes from conquering each other, which was the classical mode for the rise of power among the nomads.
