I sometimes hear this opinion.</span><br>Before I get to it I want you to realise something that will help you later in the post. Genetic code is not computer code. A sequence of genes can be used to synthesise proteins in several different tissues leading to morphological differences in many organs. Computer code only does a particular thing when it&#039;s &quot;called in&quot; to so a particular thing.<br><br>Ok so imagine a group of people. If you measure their skulls, they will have certain range of cephalic index, probably spread along the bell curve. Living in certain stable environment, they maintain this spread because natural selection doesn&#039;t benefit either side of the curve. Now if you change the environment to benefit traits that coincide with let&#039;s say brachycephaly, brachycephalic people will have more children and the average will start shifting towards their side of the graph. The genes will also start accumulating, as in if 1/3rd of the population had some sequence A contributing to this shape of school and 2/3rd had B with only 1/6th having an overlap, this disproportionately high population growth will make this overlap more common, so it&#039;s absolutely possible for such shift to be relatively rapid and ironically enough - reversible.<br><br>The reason why brachycephalic skull shape is seen as &quot;unnatural&quot; is based on good observation but bad priors - domesticated animals tend to have more brachycephalic skulls than their wild ancestors, so clearly a brachy man is a domesticated man*. The bad prior here is that people assume that because this shift occured in some societies, this is not natural, but that&#039;s because they fundamentally don&#039;t believe humans naturally form societies and adapt them to different conditions and that&#039;s very silly.<br><br>*Mind you domesticated is not timid.

The Germans, sometimes with Italian fascists, also committed several atrocities against civilians and non-fascist troops.</span>", "time": 1670973082, "resto": 14320331}, {"no": 14322374, "now":

That means creatures which can go wrong or right. Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can&#039;t. If a thing is free to be good it&#039;s also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata -of creatures that worked like machines- would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they&#039;ve got to be free.<br>Of course God knew what would happen if they used their freedom the wrong way: apparently, He thought it worth the risk. (...) If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will -that is, for making a real world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings- then we may take it it is worth paying.", "time": 1670928020, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319761, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:42:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319759</a><br>well, i didn&#039;t expect that to explode formatting.<br>readable still. that&#039;s the simple answer.<br>if you want more, look into Augustine&#039;s &#039;de libero arbitrio&#039;", "time": 1670928123, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319762, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:42:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319759</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can&#039;t.</span><br>What was jesus?", "time": 1670928142, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319768, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319751</a><br>to explain it even further, God gave us the responsibility of making the right choice.<br>we can obey, and everything happens as it should, or we can not do so, and bring our own demise and harm others.<br>&quot;everything happening as it should&quot; includes freely choosing to do so.", "time": 1670928286, "resto": 14319488}, {"no": 14319774, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)05:49:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319762</a><br>He was tempted.<br>with riches, with the whole world.

In the West Germanic ancestor of Old English, * walhaz meant \u2018foreigner\u2019, more specifically \u2018Roman\u2019, and even more specifically \u2018person of Celtic or Romance speech\u2019. The perspective here is that of a Germanic-speaking neighbour of the Western Roman Empire, living in what<br>are now the Low Countries and Germany. To him, his Roman neighbours would be culturally and linguistically clearly distinguishable from himself, being citizens of the Roman Empire and speaking either Latin or Celtic or<br>both. On the Continent, *walhaz survived into the later West Germanic languages as a term of reference to persons and areas of Romance speech. Old High German walh \u2018person of Romance speech/origin\u2019 and Dutch Waal \u2018Walloon\u2019 testify to that meaning. Place names containing the element *walhaz denote pockets in the Germanic-speaking world where Romance was spoken (e.g. Walchensee in Bavaria, Germany, and Waalwijk in North Brabant, Netherlands). A walnut (German Walnuss , Dutch walnoot ) is etymologically a nut from France. In Old English, *walhaz developed into<br>wealh. This retained the inherited meaning \u2018a foreigner, more particularly a pre-Anglo-Saxon inhabitant of Britain who spoke Celtic or Latin or both\u2019, but it is indicative of the social position of the British natives that in the<br>West Saxon dialect of Old English it acquired the new meaning \u2018(British) slave\u2019. The old feminine derivative of *walhaz , Old English w\u012bln &lt; *w\u012belen &lt; *wealh-\u012bn-, even exclusively means \u2018a female slave\u2019 and is likewise concentrated in the Saxon south of England. 6", "time": 1670935465, "resto": 14318903}, {"no": 14320199, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)08:19:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14319710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14319710</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Welsh were also EXTREAMLY retarded when it came to succession.

Russia was a poor serf state, destroyed by ww1, and then faced a massive bloody civil war. And Stalin and the communist party was able to take this hopeless situation and turn it into a semi functional state. Hell a more than functional state. Keep in mind they did this all entirely separate from the much larger and populous western world. That had just plundered Africa and Asia for a century under imperialism and colonialism. They had their own computers, rockets, military weapons. Let&#039;s be honest most of the west couldn&#039;t survive doing this if it wasn&#039;t for NATO. Then to top it all off, as soon as free market reforms happen, Russian life expectancy drops, income inequality skyrockets, poverty raises, diseases spread, GDP plummets, no more supwer power. Let&#039;s be real, communist Russia, was a goddamn miracle story. The poor serfdom state went through being destroyed TWICE, (Faced the brunt of the axis), and still turned out as one of the most powerful nations in the world, and at the time it was prosperous, much more relatively prosperous than the new democratic, capitalist Russia. They didn&#039;t have slaves to build their nation, they had no free land to get by genociding native americans, they didn&#039;t have two oceans protecting them during the 2 bloodiest conflicts in history.

It was a solo attempt to avert the civil war evidently threatening between Britain and its colonies. Despite the opposition of many of his colleagues and supporters he offered conciliation, albeit with the simultaneous dispatch of more army and navy units to America and after legislation to prevent colonial trade and fishing until British control had been restored. His conciliatory propositions of February 1775 offered to renounce taxation of any individual colony which agreed to pay its costs of civil government and defence. This proposal, conceding no rights to the colonists and regarded in America as deliberately divisive, would probably have been unsuccessful even if fighting had not commenced in April 1775 before news of it arrived. Formal rejection by Congress in July 1775 did not deter North from offering it again in the Peace Commission sent to America in 1776, and North\u2019s intention was to enforce that arrangement on the colonies if Britain had won the war. North had shrewdly perceived that a return to the status quo was unrealistic, and his proposal was as far as British opinion would allow him to go. All suggestions, both contemporary and retrospective, that a more conciliatory American policy should have been essayed in 1775 ignore political reality.</span><br><br>I was mistaken about it being offered a third time in 1777.", "time": 1670896761, "resto": 14314535}, {"no": 14318479, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)21:03:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14316937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14316937</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nice fanfiction.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If a governor or royal official commits crimes in the colonies he\u2019s to be tried in Britain</span>", "time": 1670897007, "resto": 14314535}, {"no": 14318485, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)21:05:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14318479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14318479</a><br>Which colonists during the reign of George III were transported overseas to be tried in Britain?

Deep down, even if they have not had any spiritual experience of that nature, they still see Brahma and Vishnu and Shiva as they are. But they have been lied to by the priests. Trimurti were well known since vedic times, but it needed a Christian explanation. So that is how Trinity came to be. The cherry on top? Jesus Christ (a.k.a. Jesus Krishna) was not a Messiah, but a Bodhisattva. He came to teach the people some great lessons in spirituality and a path of enlightenment. But then the priests had to come and spoil it. And if you think the Catholic Church had a hard time with that, it is only because they did start the Catholic Church on the scam. It was always a scam. It was not just the Catholics. The Christians and the Jews have been at it. Just look at the current debates on how to put together some mythical character out of Jewish and Christian stories. Do not forget that Christianity started out as a religion of Hebrew descent. The Hebrews wanted to do some damage to the Greeks and the Roman Empire. So they created the stories of Jewish/Christian messiah. It was all a scam, of course, but the Christians had the advantage of being able to impose the scam upon whole nation, thanks to the invention of Christianity as a religion.

But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy.

When looking at it as a dispute over slavery then clearly you can see where all those original fears came from, it was directly about the fact that the federal government had the authority to make slavery illegal, so the opposition to that authority became about constitutional &quot;liberty&quot; to be self-governing. But this ballooned into wild claims that the federal government was seeking to eventually dissolve the power of the states altogether, so that after the war the issue of slavery could be diminished and it could become about some much dearer right to self-governance. It becomes a great irony, then, that after the North conquered the south in a war it quickly brought the southern states back into the union and allowed them to build their little internal police states and continue to defend them in Congress as equals with the other states. The south continues to fret about liberty in its political culture, and usually take a very adversarial position in respect to the federal government, even though it is plainly obvious that this is the inherited cultural resentment for losing the Civil War and being unable to reconcile with the fact that so many people died and suffered for slavery. And that everybody tends to agree that the south was wrong for fighting for slavery. So the south has to endure the shame of being both losers and considered evil for what they did, and in order to suppress that feeling of shame they told themselves lies and filled themselves with resentment, and here we are today.

I think that was a mistake, though I also think what was basically the desire for vengeance by many of the Republicans was a mistake too. Honestly this is a deep problem with America&#039;s federal structure, I&#039;m not sure if it was ever possible to do what I think should&#039;ve been done, but the North should&#039;ve dissolved the south and kept it as a federal territory, and it should&#039;ve basically carried out a cultural genocide. But the key would&#039;ve been to do it magnanimously, the North should&#039;ve spent a shitload of money redeveloping the south with an eye to making it prosperous again, but maintaining a state of emergency in which the south was politically neutered and not a major participant in the federal government. Only after re-engineering the south in the North&#039;s image could the south return to representation in the federal government. That would probably take several generations at least, and it would involve a lot more migration into the south too. The federal government found itself thrust into the role of empire, and it was in denial about it. The south&#039;s fears of a growing federal state were essentially made real by the fact they revolted and were outright conquered, but ironically the federal state didn&#039;t have the political will to meet the moment. The nation was no longer whole by the fact of the revolt, which was undertaken by a geographically bounded and rival national entity rather than a claimant to the federal state, so that fusing the constitution of the union states with the states of the former confederacy within such a short time span was like bringing a mortal enemy in and saying &quot;we are friends now, we live together. Let&#039;s share a bank account, here are the keys to the house&quot;. It was just irrational.
