All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should, according to the Stoics, live in brotherly love and readily help one another. They held that external differences such as rank and wealth are of no importance in social relationships. Thus, before the rise of Christianity, Stoics recognized and advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Graeco\u2013Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as Cato the Younger and Epictetus.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cAll men descend from the same original stock; no one is better born than another, except in so far as his disposition is nobler and better suited for the performance of good actions.\u201d - Seneca</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cAnd neither does the sea nor a great expanse of intervening land keep one from being a citizen [of Rome], nor here are Asia and Europe distinguished.

The Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs probably depicts the four rulers of the Empire instituted by Emperor Diocletian - the first Tetrarchy. The question of how to account for what may seem a decline in both style and execution in Late Antique art has generated a vast amount of discussion. The figures are stout and blocky, far from the verisimilitude or the idealism of earlier Greco-Roman art. The figures are stiff and rigid, the attire being patterned and stylized. One factor that cannot be responsible, as the date and origin of the Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs show, is the rise of Christianity to official support, as the changes predated that. This shift in artistic style points towards the style of the Middle Ages.</span>", "filename": "5D72175E-5AEE-4052-8DF2-B34F70803724", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 2880, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671694039121823, "time": 1671694039, "md5": "YhYA0SD4Knp3w6oZOSG+dw==", "fsize": 1462010, "resto": 14360627}, {"no": 14361118, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:27:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14361100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14361100</a><br>Unironically yes.", "time": 1671694045, "resto": 14360627}, {"no": 14361120, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:27:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14360658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14360658</a><br>The bible describes Christians as God\u2019s children, slaves, and wives at various points.

Some mothers jumped in holding their children, some were throwing their children in, others were flinging their children aside. Still others threw the children in first and then jumped in. Some were crawling at the feet of the Gestapo men kissing their boots, their rifle butts and the like. We were told to go among the standing Jews and collect clothing and shoes.

Only closely packed heads were to be seen when one looked into the pit. The Jews already stripped naked were thrown by the Gestapo men onto the heads of those already crammed in the pit. [...] <br><br>I noticed four vat-like containers. Then the Germans set up a small motor - it was probably a pump - connected it with hoses to one of the vats and two of them brought the hoses from the motor up to the pit. They started the motor and the two Gestapo men began to pour some liquid on the Jews. I think it was water, at any rate it looked like water. The hose was connected in turn to the other containers. Apparently, because of the slaking of the lime, people in the pit were boiling alive.

Women seem more emotionally invested in their work and upholding the hierarchy socially. Men are, in a weird way, more selfish, such that they tend to help put rational constraints on labour. A woman can be underpaid. She can be coerced into doing unsafe work. They act like cattle under authority. And if you put a woke spin on something objectionable, they eat it up.

Unlike other people, I don&#039;t resent immigrants that much because they&#039;re pawns in the system. A mix of endogenous and exogenous (our foreign policy) causes destabilize and immiserate where they&#039;re from, making them amenable to leaving. They stream to our countries based on very intentionally false de-facto ad campaigns about prosperity, comfort, and the lives possible here. Then they get worked like dogs being paid less and encouraged to take a standard of living far below what was advertised. Many of them take this Hobson&#039;s choice because it&#039;s still marginally better than life back home. They may have taken huge loans or made other sacrifices to come. Hard to have mobility when you&#039;re locked in like that. Western economies then squeeze the 10-20 best years of their labour productivity (20&#039;s to 30&#039;s) out of them and then dump them. With defunded welfare and other social services many just die, some might leave. Luckily, few have kids. The intergenerational fertility rates are abysmally low, &quot;necessitating&quot; further immigration. Each new wave helps move society below the top percentile in lock step downwards in material comfort and financial security. Women also contribute because of their aforementioned social manipulability. It&#039;s very easy to make them debt slaves and tell them they have become masters of their own destiny.", "time": 1671392136, "resto": 14341694}, {"no": 14344678, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)16:07:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14344251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14344251</a><br>Why the fuck do you even live with someone like that?

The army was so great that the defending claimants to the throne simply fled, leaving all their possessions and their claims to the kingdom behind. Thus, having driven his enemies before him, Conaire has successfully upped his honor by wielding a large army to take something by force of arms. However, in \u201cDestruction\u201d, Conaire does not come to power by force of arms. Instead, he relies on prophecy that says he will be king and stands up for his right at the feast by invoking his noble lineage.

There was a constant string of mass murders and war crimes committed by American troops throughout the entire decade of American involvement in the war.<br>Every major American unit in Vietnam, down to the brigade, had &quot;incidents&quot; wherein Vietnamese civilians were abused, murdered, and raped. The only thing exceptional about My Lai was its scope, killing hundreds at once was a step too far that couldn&#039;t be hidden. But the brutalization and killings of civilians was routine.<br>Even the most cursory examination of the evidence shows this, and it isn&#039;t even hidden or disputed. The US military&#039;s own analysis showed that during Operation Speedy Express, for example, 5000-7000 of the 10000 Vietnamese killed were civilians. The most outrageous stories there coming from the helicopter and light plane crews that admitted to military investigators that they constantly just murdered anyone they saw for any reason they could think of.<br>The ubiquitous search and destroy missions were much more up close and personal. Many times these were just covers for the wholesale destruction of a village that happened to be close to a place where a Viet Cong ambush had taken place, or where a GI had gotten injured or killed by a trap or mine. Troops bombed the village, rolled in, burned the houses, killed the livestock, raped the women, and then killed them along with anyone else they could get their hands on. I suggest you read Jamie Henry&#039;s account of one such attack. The highlight is really something, and it was attested to by multiple witnesses to military investigators. Or you could read about Roy Bumgarner, who was known as a murderer among troops and was convicted of manslaughter after gunning down four civilians and blowing their heads up with a grenade to teach some new recruits how to conduct themselves. <br>I can&#039;t do the extent of the violence justice, there is too much and I get too angry.

As G.K. Chesterton explained <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Nietzsche, as every one knows, preached a doctrine which he and his followers regard apparently as very revolutionary; he held that ordinary altruistic morality had been the invention of a slave class to prevent the emergence of superior types to fight and rule them. Now, modern people, whether they agree with this or not, always talk of it as a new and unheard-of idea. It is calmly and persistently supposed that the great writers of the past, say Shakespeare for instance, did not hold this view, because they had never imagined it; because it had never come into their heads. Turn up the last act of Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III and you will find not only all that Nietzsche had to say put into two lines, but you will find it put in the very words of Nietzsche. Richard Crookback says to his nobles:&quot;Conscience is but a word that cowards use, Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.&quot; As I have said, the fact is plain. Shakespeare had thought of Nietzsche and the Master Morality; but he weighed it at its proper value and put it in its proper place.

Written in the 19th century, Duncan&#039;s Ritual, as it is known, has been republished numerous times. It includes the three basic degrees of the Ancient York Rite, and four additional advanced degrees. There are over a hundred illustrations, all reproduced here, which show important details of the rituals, including gestures and symbolic pictures. Duncan&#039;s Ritual is careful to note known variations where they exist. This book will be of interest to beginning Masons who want a roadmap of the craft, as well as experienced Masons who need a review.--J.B.

Postmodernism is associated with relativism and a focus on ideology in the maintenance of economic and political power. Postmodernists are &quot;skeptical of explanations which claim to be valid for all groups, cultures, traditions, or races, and instead focuses on the relative truths of each person&quot;. It considers &quot;reality&quot; to be a mental construct. Postmodernism rejects the possibility of unmediated reality or objectively-rational knowledge, asserting that all interpretations are contingent on the perspective from which they are made; claims to objective fact are dismissed as naive realism.</span><br><br>Postmodern thinkers frequently describe knowledge claims and value systems as contingent or socially-conditioned, describing them as products of political, historical, or cultural discourses and hierarchies. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to self-referentiality, epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, and irreverence. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as deconstruction and post-structuralism. Postmodernism relies on critical theory, which considers the effects of ideology, society, and history on culture. Postmodernism and critical theory commonly criticize universalist ideas of objective reality, morality, truth, human nature, reason, language, and social progress.<br><br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pos<wbr>tmodernism#:~:text=11%20External%20<wbr>links-,Definition,of%20economic%20a<wbr>nd%20political%20power.", "time": 1671649894, "resto": 14357757}, {"no": 14357953, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)14:13:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14357816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14357816</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;seething brownpipo version of /pol/</span><br>That&#039;s just regular /pol/.", "time": 1671650039, "resto": 14357757}, {"no": 14358158, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)14:41:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14357757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14357757</a><br>That which is after &quot;modernism&quot;.", "filename": "1670182246942765", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1011, "h": 711, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1671651715478099, "time": 1671651715, "md5": "TEgK5OpGaYqd2EoG8pdmdw==", "fsize": 65806, "resto": 14357757}, {"no": 14359110, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14358158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14358158</a><br>What is modernism", "time": 1671660520, "resto": 14357757}, {"no": 14359114, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:09:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "postmodernism is critical theory applied to historical literary practices", "time": 1671660587, "resto": 14357757}, {"no": 14359149, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:16:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14359110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14359110</a><br>Modernism is normal literary practices within western society.

For Damian, only those who shared in the sufferings of Christ could be saved. Throughout Christian history, the mortification of the flesh, wherein one denies themselves physical pleasures, has been commonly followed by members of the clergy, especially in Christian monasteries and convents; the 11th-century Dominicus Loricatus repeated the entire Psalter twenty times in one week, accompanying each psalm with a hundred lash-strokes to his back.

Cabanagem, the biggest popular revolt in Brazilian history and the only one that managed to seize and remain in power for a period of time, faced Portuguese domination and was against the majority of whites who, in general, were the rich and rulers and formed a dominant minority. The population of Par\u00e1 was 119,877 inhabitants at the time, of which 32,751 were indigenous, 29,977 were black slaves, 42,000 were mestizos.

Directed by former slaves, such as Negro Patriota, Diamante, Felix, Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o and Beliz\u00e1rio, they defend the rupture with the Brazilian Empire and a Free Black Republic, like Haiti. In this sense, Cabanagem was, in our history, something similar to the revolution led by slaves in Haiti (1791-1804), in addition to black slaves, there were poor indigenous and mestizos peasants who fought against Slavery, large estates and Genocide. In the top leadership of Cabanagem was a minority of white bourgeois and slave owners who were dissatisfied with the neglect abandonment of the Province of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 by the Empire and the local elite, who promised the mestizo, indian and black cabanos Equality and Freedom</span>", "filename": "1663655756251287", "ext": ".png", "w": 1672, "h": 1508, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1671646019319219, "time": 1671646019, "md5": "tHV/9NIxZK3N+HbNIHE97g==", "fsize": 546228, "resto": 14357349}, {"no": 14357501, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)13:08:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14357495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14357495</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cabanagem was the bloodiest civil war in Brazil and, most likely, in all of Latin America. It is estimated that more than 40,000 cabanos were killed. Armed popular groups occupied the cities and killed whites rich, landowners and slaveholders. Cabanos entrusted their desires for freedom and better days to other whites landowner leaders, slave owners and bourgeois, as were the three Cabano governments. They were betrayed by all of them. For this reason, the counterrevolution led by the regency government based in Rio de Janeiro was particularly cruel and decimated almost 50% of the population that lived in the great Amazonian floodplains at the time. The Mura ethnic group was practically decimated: there is talk of 21,000 dead in Cabanagem.
