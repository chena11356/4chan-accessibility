Hitler didn&#039;t care about the &#039;&#039;development of the soul&#039;&#039; which is a retarded idea. It was all stated in biological terms. Germans had to fight and so came together and became more warlike. &#039;&#039;Prussian virtues&#039;&#039; were only those of war (so once again the racial virtues). Most of the old nobility and systems were seen as horrible. As for everything about the community, Socialism vs Individualism, and the English spirit. None of this was original. Most of this had already been said by Werner Sombart (especially in his book traders and heroes) and he was actually a huge influence on National Socialism.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He is a philosopher not a pseud</span><br>lmao<br><br>And just FWI<br><a href=\"#p14630214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14630214</a><br>This nigger is wrong.

After Commodore Perry&#039;s visit, Japan began to deliberately accept Western culture to the point of hiring Westerners to teach Western customs and traditions to the Japanese starting in the Meiji era.

And when Hermesilaus, who was connected with him by ancient ties of hospitality, and who was also the proxenus of the Athenians, entertained him, the boy who was mixing the wine was standing by the fire, being a boy of a very beautiful complexion, but made red by the fire: so Sophocles called him and said, &#039;Do you wish me to drink with pleasure? and when he said that he did, he said, &#039;Well, then, bring me the cup, and take it away again in a leisurely manner.&#039; And as the boy blushed all the more at this, Sophocles said to the guest who was sitting next to him, &#039;How well did Phrynichus speak when he said\u2014<br> The light of love doth shine in purple cheeks.<br>And a man from Eretria, or from Erythr\u00e6, who was a school\u2014 master, answered him,\u2014&#039; You are a great man in poetry, O Sophocles; but still Phrynichus did not say well when he called purple cheeks a mark of beauty. For if a painter were to cover the cheeks of this boy with purple paint he would not be beautiful at all. And so it is not well to compare what is beautiful with what is not so.&#039; And on this Sophocles, laughing at the Eretrian, said,\u2014&#039; Then, my friend, I suppose you are not pleased with the line in Simonides which is generally considered among the Greeks to be a beautiful one\u2014<br> The maid pour&#039;d forth a gentle voice<br> From out her purple mouth.<br>And you do not either like the poet who spoke of the golden-haired&#039; Apollo; for if a painter were to represent the hair of the god as actually golden, and not black, the picture would be all the worse. Nor do you approve of the poet who spoke of rosy-fingered. For if any one were to dip his fingers in rosy-coloured paint he would make his hands like those of a purple-dyer, and not of a pretty woman.&#039; And when they all laughed at this, the Eretrian was

So the left-wing militant groups emerged out of that. It was kinda mutual, like some of the more radical students would think &quot;well, the Vietnamese are fighting capitalism and imperialism over there, so we should &#039;bring the war home&#039; and fight a revolution just like the Vietnamese.&quot; And then the cops have the same attitude, their brothers are fighting a war there and &quot;we&#039;re killing &#039;em over there, why not kill &#039;em here?&quot; <br><br>So it was rare in the U.S. for an anti-war protest at that time to not get into a physical confrontation with the cops. The students and young anti-system people were certainly willing to get into it with the cops, but the cops were willing to get into it too. People get radicalized and hardened by this experience. There were times when people would get killed by the cops in these confrontations, it started to resemble a war-like situation.<br><br>Part of it too is that they started to LARP as Che who was a big hero. It wasn&#039;t just wearing a Che t-shirt, they literally wanted to be like Che and start doing that in the U.S. or West Germany or Japan. The more radical students saw their success at shutting down campuses and their images being broadcast on TV, and they had been relatively successful at that, but confused that as a sign that revolution was imminent, and they narcissistically fell in love with themselves, that they were gonna be the leaders, and believe they could switch to militant tactics and people would automatically follow them. In fact, they destroyed what were fairly large coalitions for smaller, militant and cult-like groups which completely failed at making a revolution happen so RIP<br><br>https://youtu.be/vFzCQcHglFA?t=1362<wbr>8", "filename": "days-of-rage", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 647, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1676278743933998, "time": 1676278743, "md5": "HVXH5S/jWyt+QdO+ErDTfQ==", "fsize": 87299, "resto": 14621041}, {"no": 14621167, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)04:18:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Also if you wanna immerse yourself, watch La Chinoise, which was a Godard movie that came out in 1967, which is interesting because the big revolt in France happened a year after this movie was made. It&#039;s a fictional story of a French Maoist student group and roughly based on a Dostoyevsky novel set in Russia in the 1860s during a period of radical political nihilism (think Nechayev).<br><br>The movie is insane. The director was sympathetic to left-wing politics, but the students are just kids who are off in an ideological la-la land and have no real connection to the workers they want to represent.

This scene is interesting because they&#039;re talking about Maoist China being more True Communism because that&#039;s what the Americans fear, but they are missing a kind of obvious point which that Americans don&#039;t really care about the ideological purity of the nations they interact with, what they care about is their own profit, or the profit of their ruling class.

World War Two and the subsequent explosion of the middle class and new money in new industries made college available to the general public for the first time ever. The new generation of students didn&#039;t come from old money aristocracy and thus they were much more open to radical movements. Along with the fact that a university student has very little oversight and they were ripe to be swept up in the new left movements of the 60&#039;s. Another major reason was that most western students were pumped full of Cold War propaganda about the superiority of capitalist and western civilization but being exposed to the issues in the west, such as the civil rights or various conflicts shook their beliefs. <br>Skipping over the 60&#039;s and going to why they turned militant in the 70&#039;s is because they failed.

Therefore, garments had to adhere as strictly as possible to the standard parameters that gave these pieces an eminently imperial character; however, it has also been pointed out that one of the political strategies of the Inka state was to coordinate the diversity of the peoples, with their different cultures, languages, and traditions, without trying to homogenize them completely. The Inka promoted diversity and allowed local groups to produce material culture and conduct local ritual behavior in ways that represented their ethnic identity [14, 42]. In short, the relationship between the state and local communities was a dialectical process that varied from region to region and village to village, depending on the pressure exerted by the state and the receptivity of local groups [40, 43]. In our opinion, these historical contexts would have generated the conditions for local weavers to introduce morphological, technological, and stylistic features with low visibility, attributes which did not radically transform the imperial character of these iconic objects that represented the state.&quot;<br><br>there&#039;s still a level of assimilation involved - the state did have a lot of control over its subjects, especially compared to another empire like the aztecs for example. but they certainly organized the imperial structure around ethnicity.

In 1997, Jansen has argued that endorphins are not potent hallucinogens and have a long-lasting effect that is quite unlike an NDE. Hypercarbia is also thought to play a role in NDEs and has long been known to induce visions, lights, mystical experiences and out-of-body experiences.</span><br><br>https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapt<wbr>ers/edit/10.4324/9780203334492-16/n<wbr>ear-death-experiences-susan-blackmo<wbr>re", "time": 1676431413, "resto": 14628958}, {"no": 14630550, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:28:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14628958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14628958</a><br>nope, nearly all wrong", "time": 1676431699, "resto": 14628958}, {"no": 14630566, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:33:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14630459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14630459</a><br>https://books.google.com/books?hl=e<wbr>n&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1<wbr>1&amp;dq=near+death+experience+pseudosc<wbr>ience&amp;ots=bGzB6JLvSn&amp;sig=OJ1-vJeDT_<wbr>jNRvsXwURjQG7XiY4#v=onepage&amp;q=near%<wbr>20death%20experience%20pseudoscienc<wbr>e&amp;f=false<br><br><br>Page 155.

Here we determine the chromosome-quality genome of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), which is known to have the largest genome of any animal. The vast size of this genome, which is about 14\u00d7 larger than that of humans, is attributable mostly to huge intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (around 90%), the components of which resemble those of tetrapods (comprising mainly long interspersed nuclear elements) more than they do those of ray-finned fish. The lungfish genome continues to expand independently (its transposable elements are still active), through mechanisms different to those of the enormous genomes of salamanders. The 17 fully assembled lungfish macrochromosomes maintain synteny to other vertebrate chromosomes, and all microchromosomes maintain conserved ancient homology with the ancestral vertebrate karyotype. Our phylogenomic analyses confirm previous reports that lungfish occupy a key evolutionary position as the closest living relatives to tetrapods4,5, underscoring the importance of lungfish for understanding innovations associated with terrestrialization. Lungfish preadaptations to living on land include the gain of limb-like expression in developmental genes such as hoxc13 and sall1 in their lobed fins. Increased rates of evolution and the duplication of genes associated with obligate air-breathing, such as lung surfactants and the expansion of odorant receptor gene families (which encode proteins involved in detecting airborne odours), contribute to the tetrapod-like biology of lungfishes.

Transcript localization in Neoceratodus embryos showed expression of hoxc13 in the distal fin (Fig. 4c). This indicates an early gain of hoxc13 expression in sarcopterygians, suggesting co-option of this domain in tetrapods to pattern dermal limb elements (such as nails, hooves and claws).

The answer is most probably\u201cyes\u201d. When the Yang group was defeated in Feb 1682 and fled to Cochinchina, the English East India Company (in Pho Hien) recorded their numbers as 206 junks on April 1682. 54 However, on their arrival in Quang Nam, the number of junks was reduced to over 50 (Vietnamese source), or over 70 (Japanese source Kai hentai ). 55 Vachet\u2019s court informants at the time said there were about 70-80 galleys and boats. 56</span>", "filename": "Chinese pirates and Vietnamese prostitutes", "ext": ".png", "w": 825, "h": 6664, "tn_w": 15, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676419965797420, "time": 1676419965, "md5": "Hbr2ne2bZB4Naqd5u+ZpQw==", "fsize": 1360923, "resto": 14629472}, {"no": 14629512, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:13:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "eat shit and die worm", "time": 1676420028, "resto": 14629472}, {"no": 14629524, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:16:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14629472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629472</a><br><a href=\"#p14629482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629482</a><br><a href=\"#p14629495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629495</a><br><a href=\"#p14629504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629504</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How can the rapid reduction in Yang\u2019s junks be explained when the journey began with 206 junks in March 1682 and ended a few months later when the fleet reached Quang Nam and the Mekong Delta? Chen Chingho asked this question and quoted Leclere\u2019s Histoire du Cambodge that they met a typhoon at sea so some of the junks had lost and some other scattered. 57 It is also possible that the original fleet divided into smaller groups and went separate ways. All this could well partly explain the missing junks, but some other factors might also at work. Since the epidemic was recorded as a severe and violent one, some of Yang\u2019s pirate troops would have been very difficult not to beinfected. Or more accurately they themselves were the carriers of the virus.A Vietnamese source provides a completely different albeit more colourful story about the set back of the Yang group in northern Vietnam. It was defeated not by epidemic or hunger but by 300 Vietnamese women, all of which was planned by the pre-minister of the Le/Trinh court, Vo Duy Chi:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the time there were over hundreds sea junks from China came to Hong Dan of our country. [The court] ordered him [Vo] to attack. He came up with a plot of employing beautiful women. He fetched over 300 prostitutes and singing girls ( hoa nuong and a dao ) and sent them in small boats to the enemy junks. He had told everyone to take a handkerchief in red colour in their hands. When entertaining the enemies they should make the handkerchief wet and drip water into [enemies\u2019] gun barrel. After this they should leave in the boats they came. On the following day Vo arranged his navy in a row and started shooting the enemy fleet. The enemies rushed to their guns to shoot back but none of them could do so. They sailed away, and our army won the battle in a big way. 58</span>", "filename": "Chinese pirates Vietnamese prostitutes", "ext": ".png", "w": 616, "h": 7261, "tn_w": 10, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676420161911303, "time": 1676420161, "md5": "tIpmifQihV1dY0WmxjXz2g==", "fsize": 1575829, "resto": 14629472}, {"no": 14629532, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:18:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14629472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629472</a><br><a href=\"#p14629482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629482</a><br><a href=\"#p14629495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629495</a><br><a href=\"#p14629504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629504</a><br><a href=\"#p14629524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629524</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the story of the southern prostitutes infected with Siamese Sore (syphilis) is any guide,the liaisons between more than 300 northern Vietnamese girls and Chinese pirates would also have provided a crucial medium for the transmission of the epidemic to Tongking. </span><br><br>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id<wbr>=BB1qDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160&amp;lpg=PT160&amp;dq<wbr>=%22caused+not+by+epidemic+but+by+s<wbr>ome+beautiful+Vietnamese+women%22&amp;s<wbr>ource=bl&amp;ots=KNnA9bN2Pg&amp;sig=ACfU3U1<wbr>ruJXf7UFu4rKz9AhSt_SXLNOgbA&amp;hl=en&amp;s<wbr>a=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_iqLVn5b9AhXBF1kFHT<wbr>CADPkQ6AF6BAgJEAM<br><br>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id<wbr>=LgGhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199", "filename": "Vietnamese prostitutes and Chinese pirates", "ext": ".png", "w": 616, "h": 925, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676420314238120, "time": 1676420314, "md5": "le3I4T+qC/c8C0HARQF3fQ==", "fsize": 221966, "resto": 14629472}, {"no": 14629549, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14629472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629472</a><br><a href=\"#p14629482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629482</a><br><a href=\"#p14629495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629495</a><br><a href=\"#p14629504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629504</a><br><a href=\"#p14629524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629524</a><br><a href=\"#p14629532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629532</a><br>he Vietnamese record of the incident.

In fact, historians usually credit these merchants for the name \u201cKorea\u201d, a derivation of Goryeo. Koreans called the merchants saekmok\u2019in, \u201cpeople with colored eyes.\u201d<br><br>Historical records show at least one Arabian merchant staying Korea, presumably marrying a local Korean woman. The Goryeo king awarded him a Korean name of Jang Sunryong, who became the starting point of Deoksu Jang clan. (More discussion about Korean surnames here.) The Korean would not be surprised if there were many more such cases not recorded into history. The picture is Goryeo people&#039;s rendition of the Arabian merchants. (Source)<br><br><br>Another instance of non-East Asian immigration is with a person named Seol Son. Seol was an ethnic Uyghur, who live in what is now western China, bordering the \u201cstan\u201d countries. He had an official position in China, and immigrated to Korea in order to run away from a rebellion in 1358. He received an official position and a surname from the Korean king.<br>Goryeo was clearly more open to overseas trade than the dynasty followed, i.e. Joseon dynasty. Joseon was dubbed the \u201chermit kingdom\u201d, as it sought self-sufficiency with minimal foreign contact. But there was at least two prominent occasions in which non-East Asians came, stayed and got married in Korea. Interestingly, they were both Dutch.<br><br>The first was a man named Jan Janse Weltevree. He was a Dutch sailor working on a ship that sailed between Jakarta, Indonesia (which at that time was a Dutch colony) and Nagasaki, Japan. In 1627, he and two of his shipmates were shipwrecked on the coast Jeju Island, the southernmost island of Korea. They were caught and sent to Hanyang, i.e. modern-day Seoul.", "time": 1676422333, "resto": 14629472}, {"no": 14629753, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:53:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14629472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629472</a><br><a href=\"#p14629482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629482</a><br><a href=\"#p14629495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629495</a><br>Dutch men and English men and Han Chinese men having sex with Japanese women during the 17th century.

The gold filigree ornaments with turquoise-colored insets found in the tomb of an official called Shi Gang are derived from Iranian models.

Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga&#039;s camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners,[33] mostly by crucifixion and decapitation[34] with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek&#039;s teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as &quot;a very sweet and pleasing maiden&quot;, while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses.[35][36][37] The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that &quot;the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.&quot;[38] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga&#039;s but it came to nothing.[39][40][41]</span>", "filename": "Taiwan", "ext": ".png", "w": 1717, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676447268636579, "time": 1676447268, "md5": "iRRS8qd+zKjZKzcK7ObMYQ==", "fsize": 785060, "resto": 14629472}, {"no": 14631418, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)02:48:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14631413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14631413</a><br>The Chinese who escaped the Batavia massacre began a series of revenge slaughters against Dutch posts throughout the northern coast of Java, butchering all Dutch VOC personnel one by one as they moved though each post.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Although conflict had been endemic in the intervening years, 1740 marked the beginning of an era of cataclysmic violence.

As a result, a number of single women were sent and an orphanage was established in Batavia to raise Dutch orphan girls to become East India brides.[8] Around 1650, the number of mixed marriages, frequent in the early years of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), declined sharply. There was a large number of women from the Netherlands recorded as marrying in the years around 1650. At least half the brides of European men in Batavia came from Europe. Many of these women were widows, already previously married in the Indies, but almost half of them were single women from the Netherlands marrying for the first time. There were still considerable numbers of women sailing eastwards to the Indies at this time. The ships&#039; passenger lists from the 17th century also evidence this.

Acknowledging the difference between Han and Manchu, he admitted on the one hand that \u201cManchu blood differs from Han blood, in the same way as Mongol and Tibetan blood too differs from Han blood\u201d (Abe 1971: 41). On the other hand, he commented that \u201cwe too, as equally as the Han, have been the culturally \u2018civilized center\u2019 (zhonghua) in sophisticated morality and religion\u201d (ibid.).7 In other words, the Yongzheng Emperor thought that if yi meant barbarian, then the Manchu were hua (civilized); but if yi meant different ethnic group, the Manchu were happy to remain yi (ibid.). This distinction in the interpretation of yi is very important in examining the ideational change in interpretation made by the Qing civilization. While the civilization of zhonghua was still important, the differences in the meanings of yi, from barbarian to ethnicity, meant that the Manchu could retain their ethnic identity as long as the center of their state was defined as zhonghua (civilized). </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Manchu were content to be different from the Han. The Manchu identity as a different group was not new, but the Qing, it is worth noting, realized that to become zhonghua, the Manchu and the Han did not necessarily need to be the same; rather, the level of civilization was the essential determinant of the center of the world. Based on this, the Manchu and the Han, both of whom acquired the same level of civilization, namely zhonghua, were legitimately the center of the world.</span>", "time": 1676414603, "resto": 14628196}, {"no": 14629262, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:31:19", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Spirals", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1544, "h": 1670, "tn_w": 115, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676417479108881, "time": 1676417479, "md5": "dPtnJVcVLnzL8VE0wwDKSQ==", "fsize": 972639, "resto": 14628196}, {"no": 14629289, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:36:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Qing.", "filename": "Qing", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1676417796366438, "time": 1676417796, "md5": "qGeqHZEnp7+yjZyWsygMgg==", "fsize": 457915, "resto": 14628196}, {"no": 14629313, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:39:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump.", "time": 1676417963, "resto": 14628196}, {"no": 14629335, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:43:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14629262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629262</a><br><a href=\"#p14629289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14629289</a><br>Every single one of these was posted by the Iraqi child rapist in Sweden.<br><br>Proof?

The Jews are supposedly so influencial they are omniprescent and capable of influencing not only geopolitics, but local politics as well. The Jews do not have a coherent agenda, except for the maintainance of their homeland at the expense of every other societies stability. They believe whites are the largest victims of this compaign, and that whites are inherently righteous, any wrongdoing carried out by whites, Jews can be used as a convenient scapegoat for. In political science, we can therefore conclude that NeoNazism is also a form of Populism, the assertion of a class of people against another class of people. In populism, it is necesarry to overgeneralize in order to manufacture an &quot;Us vs Them&quot; mentality, since it implies there are only two competing factions and each individual within said faction must all share a common goal, which is fallacious.

This isn&#039;t necessarily to negate the notion of a god or god like entity or essence that permeates through the universe.

Here&#039;s a verse from the gospels to support this theory:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mark 11:22-23 - &quot;Have faith in God,&quot; Jesus answered. 23 &quot;Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, &#039;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&#039; and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.&quot;</span><br>There needs to be no doubt in your heart in order for your prayers to be answered, and the only way to have no doubt is to KNOW with absolute certainty, and the only way to do that is by proof. As impossible as this may sound, the book of Job claims that it is possible to have proof that God exists, by &quot;seeing God face to face&quot;. It is a seemingly contradictory thing, because it is said that seeing God face to face results in death, however everyone that has seen God face to face have somehow lived. That is because by seeing God face to face, the old faithless self dies, and the new faithful self is born, as Jesus said: &quot;I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again&quot;", "filename": "i find your lack of faith disturbing", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 639, "h": 354, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1676346861311802, "time": 1676346861, "md5": "Rsj0+Df6xKqF1Ku/DRu5DQ==", "fsize": 20933, "resto": 14624658}, {"no": 14624937, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:57:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624658</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is it that the book of Job is the most ignored book of the Bible</span><br>It was one of the first Bible stories Ive ever heard from watching South Park.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z7<wbr>afkc5CpU", "time": 1676347048, "resto": 14624658}, {"no": 14624944, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:58:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14624658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14624658</a><br>I&#039;m reading it right now.

We see that there is a reason, just Job doesn&#039;t know it. Also, even though Satan wants evil for Job, God means it for good, as with all things. For it says, &quot;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&quot; (Rom. 8:28).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is only when Job had experienced God firsthand that he truly believed</span><br>I don&#039;t think so.

This is what Elihu points out when he finally enters the picture in chapter 32-37. He points out how that, while Job&#039;s friends indeed were making wrong assumptions, Job himself was also going too far in certain things he said in response to their arguments. See chapter 32-37. After that, God Himself speaks to Job out of the whirlwind from chapter 38 to the end, which is in effect an answer to Job&#039;s request.

I will begin with a fact that comes from direct experience, early in my training, of a patient in whom the dissociation between pain as such and emotion caused by pain was vividly patent. The patient was suffering from a severe case of refractory trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux. This is a condition involving the nerve that supplies signals for face sensation in which even innocent stimuli, such as a light touch of the skin of the face or a sudden breeze, trigger an excruciating pain. No medication would help this young man who could do little but crouch, immobilized, whenever the excruciating pain stabbed his flesh. As a last resort, the neurosurgeon Almeida Lima, who was also one of my first mentors, offered to operate on him, because producing small lesions in a specific sector of the frontal lobe had been shown to alleviate pain and was being used in last-resort situations such as this.</span><br><br>1/2", "time": 1676444705, "resto": 14629588}, {"no": 14631288, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)02:06:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14631284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14631284</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I will not forget seeing the patient on the day before the operation, afraid to make any movement that might trigger a new round of pain, and then seeing him two days after the operation, when we visited him on rounds; he had become an entirely different person, relaxed, happily absorbed in a game of cards with a companion in his hospital room. When Lima asked him about the pain, he looked up and said quite cheerfully that &quot;the pains were the same,&quot; but that he felt fine now. I remember my surprise as Lima probed the man&#039;s state of mind a bit further. The operation had done little or nothing to the sensory patterns corresponding to local tissue dysfunction that were being supplied by the trigeminal system. The mental images of that tissue dysfunction were not altered and that is why the patient could report that the pains were the same. And yet the operation had been a success. It had certainly abolished the emotional reactions that the sensory patterns of tissue dysfunction had been engendering. Suffering was gone. The facial expression, the voice, and the general deportment of this man were not those one associates with pain.</span><br><br>From &quot;The feeling of what happens&quot;.
