When Hawking did the calculation, he found to his surprise that it was true. In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein conjectured that the black holes should have an entropy, where by the same year, he proposed no-hair theorems. Bekenstein&#039;s discovery and results are commended by Stephen Hawking, which also led him to think about radiation due to this formalism. According to the physicist Dmitri Diakonov, there was an argument between Zeldovich and Vladimir Gribov at the Zeldovich Moscow 1972\u20131973 seminar. Zeldovich believed that only a rotating black hole could emit radiation, while Gribov believed that even a non-rotating black hole emits radiation due to the laws of quantum mechanics.

We may distinguish between the cause of my believing it, and reasoning for believing it. The cause of my believing it is that God designed me to believe it. That is, in the objective reality, God designed the creature with mental tools to equip him to live in the world He designed, which by virtue of the masterful skill of the designer in their original and undamaged form are highly successful at delivering truth to the creature that he may act on truth and not falsehood. It for this reason if is simply obvious to me that 2+2=4, that if all men are mortal and Socrates is a man then Socrates is mortal, and that God exists, for such knowledge was implanted in my soul at my creation, such that no matter how hard I try or tell myself otherwise, I cannot help but know it. But because of the fall of man my mind is not in its original and undamaged form, and has far greater difficulty in discovering truth than it ought to. So the Lord intervened and invaded His own creation and spoke to man to cut through the darkness of fallen reason to lead His people to the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. So while the creature&#039;s reasoning was derailed by sin, it was put back on track by the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit that the inspiration of His word might be as clear and instant to his mind as light is to his eyes. But while this account may do well to extoll the rationality of Christian belief, it does so without actually touching its truth value. It is a cold, objective and mechanistic narrative of things done to a machine, rather than a first-person account of experience giving compelling cause for belief.", "time": 1672644476, "resto": 14409540}, {"no": 14409674, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)02:28:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14409614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14409614</a><br>The reasoning for believing it is that there is no other. That is, in the subjective experience, I see how God stands behind all truth. That is, if the Triune Christian God of scripture exists, then it is impossible for there to be external proofs of it, not because He is wanting for proof, but because all truths and all facts are explicitly Christian and internal to the Christian faith; God the all-father of truth. For I do see how God stands at the beginning and the end of all reasoning, and how irrational and untenable unbelief is, so that unbelievers are not as unbelieving as they think they are because they too depend on their innate knowledge of God and oppose themselves when they oppose Him. I see that they too see God standing behind every fact, they too see Him standing at the beginning and the end of all reasoning, but while unbelievers always see God in the corner of their vision they dare not look Him in the eye. And that is why I believe in God. I shall not convert you at the end of my argument. I think the argument is sound. I hold that belief in God is not merely as reasonable as other belief, or even a little or infinitely more probably true than other belief; I hold rather that unless you believe in God you can logically believe in nothing else.

Apparently theists consider this a form of pantheism. Another form of Monism states that the World IS the One and that you or are I or a building in a city each are different &quot;forms&quot; of the One. In other words, this version of Monism states that the universe IS an individual thing consisting of NO individual parts. Theists also deny this, but it&#039;s not exactly clear to me why this is the case since I often hear Christians saying that God is within all of us.

Morality does not change if you believe in God, the ruling across the Bible and the Quran is very simple, you can have sex with someone of the opposite sex if you are married and if puberty has been hit. Having sex with someone who has hit puberty is not pedophilia, you can move your little numbers up but it&#039;s meaningless, you&#039;re just a retard who can&#039;t see the bigger picture. No, a good majority of humans throughout history across the different continents were not pedophiles for having sex with someone who has hit puberty. You are confused and spineless.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The average age for girls to start puberty is 11, while for boys the average age is 12. But it&#039;s perfectly normal for puberty to begin at any point between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.&quot;</span><br>That being said, Muhammad did nothing wrong for having sex with his wife, in fact it was a good thing. His action was no different than any other that God has permitted, doing any action that falls under this is &quot;good&quot;. Anything else is pure cope, why is this so difficult to understand? Also, this argument of Muhammad being &quot;perfect&quot; and a timeless example is not refuted by this action which you deem &quot;immoral&quot;, if you have any understanding of religion and prophethood, you&#039;d know that the Quran describes Muhammad as the &quot;criterion&quot;, very few other prophets were described as this. Now, what this entails is that Muhammad&#039;s action in this context means that this is &quot;the age of consent&quot; for Muslims, these are the limits established by his messengerhood. The Christian Ethos has the same ruling and this is evident in the &quot;history of the age of consent&quot;, using today&#039;s numbers as the paragon of virtue is utterly meaningless, you have taken feminism and secular jewry to be superior to your Lord Creator God and His Messengers.", "time": 1672511024, "resto": 14401224}, {"no": 14403570, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)13:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14403563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14403563</a><br>Oh God, here we go.

First,women voted far more strongly than men for clerical/conservative parties, &#039;with the accent on clerical&#039;.

His Old World accent and reactionary politics might not have been sufficient to earn Niall Ferguson his cisatlantic celebrity, were it not for the demise of American intellectual conservatism, chronicled by Sam Tanenhaus and others. The mass extinction of America\u2019s intellectual right at the hands of anti-intellectual Jacksonian populists like the Tea Partyers has created a lack of native conservative thinkers with impressive academic credentials who are willing to dash to a TV studio at a moment\u2019s notice. And in an era when the conservative movement is symbolized by lightweights like Glenn Beck, Ann Coulter and Jonah Goldberg, rather than William F. Buckley Jr., George Will and Irving Kristol, even Niall Ferguson can be mistaken for an intellectual.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Having begun his career as a historian of 19th-century banking, Ferguson became what in Britain is called a &quot;television don&quot; in 1998 with the publication of his book &quot;The Pity of War,&quot; about World War I. Like the historian John Charmley, who expressed the same wish in the case of World War II, Ferguson belongs to the fringe element of British conservatism that regrets the absence of a German-British deal in the first half of the 20th century that would have marginalized the United States and might have allowed the British Empire to survive to this day.</span><br>https://www.salon.com/2011/05/24/li<wbr>nd_niall_fergsuon/", "time": 1672533645, "resto": 14404869}, {"no": 14404896, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)19:42:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14404869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14404869</a><br>Allies were at fault for essentially dooming Germany to economic failure creating even more resentment and the explosive rise of the Nazis.", "time": 1672533771, "resto": 14404869}, {"no": 14404900, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)19:43:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Key paragraph:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Ferguson, Britain should have stayed out of World War I and allowed Imperial Germany to smash France and Russia and create a continental empire from the Atlantic to the Middle East.

Ten individuals of the Andronovo horizon in southern Siberia from 1400 BC to 1000 BC were surveyed. Extractions of mtDNA from nine individuals were determined to represent two samples of haplogroup U4 and single samples of Z1, T1, U2e, T4, H, K2b and U5a1. Extractions of Y-DNA from one individual was determined to belong to Y-DNA haplogroup C (but not C3), while the other two extractions were determined to belong to haplogroup R1a1a, which is thought to mark the eastward migration of the early Indo-Europeans. Of the individuals surveyed, only two (or 22%) were determined to be of Asian ancestry, while seven (or 78%) were determined to be of European ancestry, with the majority being light-skinned with predominantly light eyes and light hair.[34]</span><br><br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/And<wbr>ronovo_culture", "filename": "4450015726_3ea6d5801f_b", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 677, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672610646916771, "time": 1672610646, "md5": "HtEqL2+ftTgQGtkPi62swg==", "fsize": 184475, "resto": 14407697}, {"no": 14408206, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)17:43:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14408005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14408005</a><br>If you mean Mongols have any relation to Andronovo, you aren&#039;t right at all, not even close.", "time": 1672613029, "resto": 14407697}, {"no": 14408401, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)18:25:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "so is no one going to mention how mongols and koreans look nothing alike?", "time": 1672615544, "resto": 14407697}, {"no": 14408424, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)18:30:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14408401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14408401</a><br>Tbh i think they look very very similar despite being myself vietnamese, however my opinion may be biased since i am SEA", "time": 1672615822, "resto": 14407697}, {"no": 14408464, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)18:36:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14408401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14408401</a><br>Bugs are all identical, literally no differences.

Perpetual Virginity -- the statements regarding Jesus having brothers can be read either way linguistically, there is typology which could apply to Mary, Eze. 44:2, and there is intertexual comparison of Mary with the ark of the covenant in Luke. What we need is a reason to read these things in this way. First we should note what perpetual virginity actually is, which is that Mary was a virgin before, during, and after birth. The &quot;during&quot; means that her virginity remained physically intact as Christ&#039;s birth was of a miraculous nature. If this did not occur, then it means that Christ damaged his own mother&#039;s physical virginity, which is too impious to consider. This must be avoided, and thus we must at least affirm Mary&#039;s virginity during birth. This would fit the typology of Eze. 44:2, and thus also affirm her virginity after birth.<br><br>2. Immaculate Conception -- this teaches that Mary was saved by a retroactive application of Christ&#039;s saving work: at the moment of her conception she was saved by Christ and preserved from original sin, and cooperated with God&#039;s will in committing no personal sins, so that original sin would not pass to Christ. God prepared her as a holy vessel, for if Mary is stained with sin, then that means that God dwelt bodily in a body that was sinful, as his body was within Mary&#039;s body, and he took his flesh from Mary&#039;s flesh. How can God dwell within a sinful body? Further we know that God is a consuming fire, Heb. 12:29, but this fire burned in Mary&#039;s womb and she was not burned -- she is a typological fulfillment of the burning bush -- and she was not consumed because she bore no sin. One should also consider the special love that God has for Mary, for example the icon I have posted which shows God&#039;s special relationship to her. Imagine a being which God loves with the special love that a child gives to his mother, and this being raising up God himself as a child.

The former receives securities \u2014 principally government obligations \u2014 amounting to 14 million, and the entire metal hoard, of which not more than one-quarter is to consist of silver, and issues notes to the full amount of the total. In so far as these notes are not in the hands of the public, they are held in the banking department and, together with the small amount of coin required for daily use (about one million), constitute its ever ready reserve. The issue department gives the public gold for notes and notes for gold; the remaining transactions with the public are carried on by the banking department. Private banks in England and Wales authorised in 1844 to issue their own notes retained this privilege, but their note issue was fixed; if one of these banks ceases to issue its own notes, the Bank of England can increase its unbacked notes by two-thirds of the quota thus made available; in this way its issue was increased by 1892 from \u00a314 to \u00a316\u00bd million (to be exact, \u00a316,450,000).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus, for every five pounds in gold which leave the bank treasury, a five-pound note returns to the issue department and is destroyed; for every five sovereigns going into the treasury a new five-pound note comes into circulation.

And this could take place so much more easily since there is a period in almost every crisis when heavy exports of gold take place which must be covered in the main by the metal reserve of the bank. But for every five pounds in gold which then go abroad, the domestic circulation is deprived of a five-pound note, so that the quantity of circulating medium is reduced precisely at a time when the largest quantity is most needed. The Bank Act of 1844 thus directly induces the entire commercial world forthwith to hoard a reserve fund of bank-notes at the outbreak of a crisis; in other words, to accelerate and intensify the crisis. By such artificial intensification of demand for money accommodation, that is, for means of payment at the decisive moment, and the simultaneous restriction of the supply the Bank Act drives the rate of interest to a hitherto unknown height during a crisis. Hence, instead of eliminating crises, the Act, on the contrary, intensifies them to a point where either the entire industrial world must go to pieces, or else the Bank Act.</span>", "time": 1672619100, "resto": 14406426}, {"no": 14408729, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)19:32:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14406426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14406426</a><br>he noticed the jews while being a jew himself, effectively outjewing the jew, so probably a base 120 and around 140 for this 20 minutes he got that caffeine high.", "time": 1672619544, "resto": 14406426}, {"no": 14408740, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)19:34:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14406426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14406426</a><br>What is the greatest extent of Marx&#039;s mathematical abilities displayed?

Neither is &quot;153 years&quot; instead of addressing disenfranchisement and modern slavery which takes form in the prison-industrial complex. It doesn&#039;t address the ways systemic oppression is present at the level of institutions through harmful policies and practices, and across structures such as education, health, and economy, that are interconnected and reinforcing over time. You should also have an understanding of the origins of &quot;whiteness&quot;, and its purpose as an economic tool for the planter class, instead of being something that arrived through explicit biases. There is no point you could bring up that hasn&#039;t been addressed and defeated repeatedly, so please educate yourself before parroting the most basic counterpoints that would get you laughed out of any intellectual discussion about race and systems of oppression.

For example, Christians have traditionally insisted that they worship a single God, while simultaneously identifying that God with a trinity comprised of three numerically distinct, fully divine persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is not easy to see how three divine persons add up to one God. Similarly, Christians have also asserted that a human man, Jesus of Nazareth, is also God-the-Son, the second person of the divine trinity. It is not easy to see how a human man, who is born, lives, and dies, could also be a fully divine being...</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christian thinkers have always drawn on philosophy to help answer these kinds of questions... Over the course of the Patristic period, as the early Church successfully established its own intellectual framework, it formally defined the boundaries of Christian orthodoxy through a series of ecumenical councils...</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...For Christian thinkers, the already settled doctrines of Christian orthodoxy provide a normative framework within which this philosophical reflection occurs. For example, it is not open to an orthodox Christian thinker to dispel the logical problem of the Trinity (the problem of how God can be both three and one) by arguing that there is in fact no God, or that God is not triune, or that the Father and the Son are two stages in the temporal life of the one God. These theoretical options are ruled out by virtue of the philosopher\u2019s own orthodox Christian commitments.</span>", "time": 1672628046, "resto": 14407446}, {"no": 14409101, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;14409084</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christian thinkers have always drawn on philosophy to help answer these kinds of questions</span><br>Drawn on scripture*<br>Fixed that for you, what hath Athens to do with Jerusalem?", "time": 1672628081, "resto": 14407446}, {"no": 14409169, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14409101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14409101</a><br>&quot;what hath Athens to do with Jerusalem?&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Patristic theologian Tertullian famously asks \u201cWhat has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\u201d but he never actually asserted the irrationalist credo \u201cI believe because it is absurd\u201d (De praescriptione haereticorum 7; De carne Christi 5.4; see also Harrison 2017).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead, like all the Patristic fathers, Tertullian regarded human reason as one of God\u2019s greatest gifts; ratio (reason) is one of his most frequently used nouns, and his own writing draws heavily on the stoic philosophy of his day.</span><br>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/<wbr>christiantheology-philosophy/", "time": 1672629506, "resto": 14407446}, {"no": 14409173, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:20:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14409056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14409056</a><br><a href=\"#p14409063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14409063</a><br>Desperate", "time": 1672629620, "resto": 14407446}, {"no": 14409254, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:55:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14409169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14409169</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his own writing draws heavily on the stoic philosophy of his day.</span><br>Sources cited bong.jpg<br>Tertullian may have never said he believed because it was absurd but his apologetic was still fideistic.
