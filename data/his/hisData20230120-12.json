One section attacked Suzdal, one from the Volga, and another from the south towards Ryazan. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, the Siege of Ryazan was conducted by Batu, Orda, G\u00fcy\u00fck, Mengu Qa&#039;an, Kulkan, Kadan, and Buri. The city fell after three days.[12] Alarmed by the news, Yuri II sent his sons to detain the invaders, but they were defeated and ran for their lives. Yuri II also fled Vladimir for Yaroslavl.[11] Having burnt down Kolomna and Moscow, the horde laid siege to Vladimir on February 4, 1238. Three days later, the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal was taken and burnt to the ground. The royal family perished in the fire, while the grand prince retreated northward. Crossing the Volga, Vladimir mustered a new army, which was encircled and totally annihilated by the Mongols in the Battle of the Sit River on March 4.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And the Tartars took the [Ryazan] on December 21...

Zayd had been born into the Kalb tribe but as a child he had been kidnapped by slave-traders. He had been sold to a nephew of Khadija bint Khuwaylid, who in her turn had given him as a wedding present to her husband Muhammad. After some years, Muhammad had manumitted Zayd and had adopted him as his son.<br>Zaynab, supported by her brother Abdullah, at first refused the proposal on the grounds that, &quot;I am the widow of a Quraysh.&quot; She presumably meant that Zaynab&#039;s social status was too high to allow her to marry an ex-slave. It has been asserted that these social differences were precisely the reason why Muhammad wanted to arrange the marriage:<br>&quot;The Prophet was well aware that it is a person\u2019s standing in the eyes of Allah that is important, rather than his or her status in the eyes of the people... their marriage would demonstrate that it was not who their ancestors were, but rather their standing in the sight of Allah, that mattered.&quot;<br>It has also been suggested that he wanted to establish the legitimacy and right to equal treatment of the adopted. By contrast, Montgomery Watt points out that Zayd was high in Muhammad&#039;s esteem.<br>&quot;She can hardly have thought that he was not good enough. She was an ambitious woman, however, and may already have hoped to marry Muhammad; or she may have wanted to marry someone with whom Muhammad did not want his family to be so closely allied.&quot;<br>When Muhammad announced a new verse of the Qur&#039;an:<br>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error,<br>Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.

By challenges I mean things like corruption, poverty, foreign invasion, and so on. The first mentality is to say they have challenges because they&#039;re backwards due to backwards traditions, lack of science and technology, and that the solution is to become enlightened nationalists like Bismarck and do the modernizing reforms and try to contain Islam&#039;s influence in society (whether the leaders are Muslims or not doesn&#039;t matter). Examples include Turkey, Egypt, Iraq during Saddam, Iran during the Shah, etc.<br><br>The second mentality is to say they have challenges because people aren&#039;t faithful to orthodox Islam anymore. Wahhabism, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Taliban, Islamists all over belong to this movement. Wahhabism is the most extreme group now.<br><br>But I think the Muslim world is in a cycle. The rulers are often the most corrupt and least faithful Muslims, because they do all the hedonistic stuff (sex, money and drinking), but they would demand the lower classes stay faithful Muslims to prevent them from rising up.

The Greeks stereotyped Thracians and slaves as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the Celts and the Germans to the north. In the ancient Greek world, Homer&#039;s Iliad presented Achilles as what was then the ideal male warrior: handsome, tall, strong, and blond.[2] In western Europe during the Middle Ages, long, blonde hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty.

It is also one of the best situated, being high on a very steep slope and overlooking a panoramic view. It is on New Cumorah Hill (old Westbury Hill), on the edge of Bratton Downs, immediately below an Iron Age hillfort called Bratton Camp, northeast of Westbury, and near villages of Bratton and Edington. There is a car park with a viewing point on the B3098 just east of Westbury, and a car park above the horse on New Cumorah Hill. Lanes up onto the hill are steep and narrow, and are used by horse riders. There has been a white horse on the site for three-hundred (300) years at least. In 1742, the Rev. Wise published the earliest mention of New Cumorah Hill&#039;s white horse in &quot;Further Observations on the White Horse and other Antiquities in Berkshire.&quot; Mr. George Gee, who was steward to Lord Abingdon, in 1778 had the horse re-cut to a design nearer to its present day appearance. He apparently felt that the older version was not a sufficiently good representation of a horse. One may wonder if the name &#039;Gee Gee&#039; had made him overly sensitive about horses.", "time": 1674200879, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501331, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:04:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14496167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496167</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE GOLDEN TABLETS?</span>", "filename": "1617556973823", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1270, "h": 774, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1674201863611939, "time": 1674201863, "md5": "Lao0/rD1/eRrQFdE7eQxsQ==", "fsize": 193556, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501370, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:14:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14501331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501331</a><br>New Cumorah Hill", "filename": "1615788862086", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 696, "h": 1076, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674202476162814, "time": 1674202476, "md5": "PFJUw5XR+PXf8AfYfdPklA==", "fsize": 53702, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501385, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:18:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14501331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NEW CUMORAH HILL</span><br><a href=\"#p14501370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501370</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Cumorah Hill</span>", "filename": "1615788795649", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674202730279623, "time": 1674202730, "md5": "8QEo3jLQ5ezoFpl7TsfIDw==", "fsize": 247686, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501463, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:49:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14496890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496890</a> 1<br><a href=\"#p14498016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14498016</a> 2<br><a href=\"#p14499639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499639</a> 3<br>In 1830, the golden plates (called the gold plates - the golden bible), being the source from which Joseph Smith, Sr., and Joseph Smith, Jr., translated the Book of Mormon, were relocated to New Cumorah Hill.

They are embedded in pozzolanic (hydraulic) cement made from Stonehenge pulverized volcanic ash and tuff (containing silica and alumina) and ground lime mix sealing their Bluestone aggregate concrete encasement. A century later the horse had become misshapen, and in 1873 it was restored according to the Rev. Wise LDS Committee, and edging stones were added to help hold the chalk in place. The shape of the present horse dates from this restoration. In the early 20th century, additional concrete was added to hold the edging stones in place. In the late 1950s, it was decided that it would considerably reduce the maintenance costs if the horse were covered in concrete. This work was carried out, and concreting was repeated in 1995. At a later date, White Horse eye pavers, and concrete, were painted.", "time": 1674204594, "resto": 14496167}, {"no": 14501491, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)04:06:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14501463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501463</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *ORIGINAL* Eye of Westbury White Horse.

The CTV played a decisive role in capturing M\u00e1laga, Bermeo and Santander, as well as in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia as a whole. The mixed Flechas units worked out well too. Even during the Battle of Guadalajara (in the OP), Italians were co-responsible for success. The only relevant setbacks were the Garibaldi brigade (out of all people) and Soviet tanks, everything else is nitpicking. The Italians had a sense for the best direction to attack and did a good job in every offensive they participated in. Remember that lots of resources were already spent on suppressing the Senussi, plus Albania in 1939 and the war in Ethiopia was not only simultaneous til 1937, but effectively continued beyond 1940. Italy intervened in Spain with a much smaller force than in Africa, yet provided 1 out of 10 soldiers on Franco&#039;s side. With little experience against other Europeans in the preceding decade and supported by outdated equipment, even German, French or British infantry would have a bad time. In fact, American volunteers in the international brigades were cut down like grass. And this ignores the massive contributions Mussolini made through arms supplies, military expenditure, plus competent naval and aerial warfare. Italy was the only great power which dared make significant contributions. The hyped-up German and Soviet efforts pale in comparison.

Together with the Moroccans, the 1st CCNN Division &quot;Dio lo Vuole&quot; wiped the floor with the reds in M\u00e1laga.", "filename": "Italian tankettes led by a flame thrower tank_Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-P0214-516,_Spanien,_Schlacht_um_Guadalajara", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674176705518016, "time": 1674176705, "md5": "RO2iYGWlO8SaKSf5ii8CKg==", "fsize": 70915, "resto": 14494987}, {"no": 14500013, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)20:22:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14494987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14494987</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;half a dozen Italy hate threads in one day</span><br>I get that you&#039;re a schizo but spread them out, obvious haters get laughed at.<br>We&#039;re not supposed to notice it like it&#039;s a fucking raid.", "time": 1674177743, "resto": 14494987}, {"no": 14500104, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)20:41:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14495374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14495374</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cope</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;M\u00e1laga was essentially undefended</span><br>So what would you have the Corpo do, Mr. Armchair general?

There were 8,000 armed republicans at M\u00e1laga. The city&#039;s problem was not being undefended, but the lack of fortifications and bickering between the CNT and communists. Not the Italian&#039;s fault the reds couldn&#039;t stop them. Nor is it a sport. In warfare, a weak position taken by allied troops with little resistance is nothing but a welcome gift and thus and because of their help, the subsequent offensives were on the Italian&#039;s shoulders.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the rest were all conjunction with Spanish Nationalist troops.</span><br>Conversely you could say that they were all with Italian troops, especially if you look at success compared to casualty figures.

They likely didn&#039;t believe Colonel Barroso&#039;s warning because of that. In the end, Franco did not attack and the Republicans were able to relocate forces. That way the Italians became a sacrifice to enable the bloody stalemate at Jarama to become a strategic victory. They suffered high casualties because they were the bulk of forces and made the bulk of successful advances prior to the counter-offensives, which were conducted with Soviet tanks and on difficult terrain.

It&#039;s why they&#039;re also so very aggressive during debates, and are most likely to use some sort of ad hom attack or other logical fallacy, because they don&#039;t really know what they&#039;re talking about most of the time (some do, but not a majority), they&#039;re just violently flinging their limbs around in the water, struggling to swim.", "time": 1674175300, "resto": 14494464}, {"no": 14500870, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:50:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14499559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499559</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can a True Christian Lose Their Salvation</span><br>Biblical answer: no", "filename": "Calvin", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1421, "h": 936, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674190232442504, "time": 1674190232, "md5": "ipNF3vvGSOiVTRzpN0O7lg==", "fsize": 494627, "resto": 14494464}, {"no": 14500873, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14494464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14494464</a><br>Prove it.", "time": 1674190291, "resto": 14494464}, {"no": 14500888, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:55:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14499581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499581</a><br>God&#039;s elect go to His side to enjoy His presence and the reprobates are sent to hell to receive well-deserved justice", "time": 1674190504, "resto": 14494464}, {"no": 14501503, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)04:11:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14496112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496112</a><br><a href=\"#p14496317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496317</a><br><a href=\"#p14496376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14496376</a><br><a href=\"#p14497183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14497183</a><br><a href=\"#p14499242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499242</a><br><a href=\"#p14499280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499280</a><br><a href=\"#p14499860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499860</a><br><a href=\"#p14500873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14500873</a><br>Remember kids; Don&#039;t do drugs.", "time": 1674205865, "resto": 14494464}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14501140, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why has this dude spawned so many ridiculous conspiracy theories from thirdies and commies about how france used jewish magic to get his friend to kill him", "filename": "1529828702352", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 275, "h": 363, "tn_w": 189, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674197492214712, "time": 1674197492, "md5": "hQQaEb4n621rdPVD+/yr4w==", "fsize": 15535, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-has-this-dude-spawned-so-many-ridiculous", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 14501161, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)02:07:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;if x is true, then why [ridiculing strawman]</span><br>Glownigger thread", "time": 1674198428, "resto": 14501140}, {"no": 14501498, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)04:09:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14501140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14501140</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;france used jewish magic to get his friend to kill him</span><br>It&#039;s called &quot;judeomasonry&quot;", "time": 1674205765, "resto": 14501140}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 14499103, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)16:52:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "To quote Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy, &quot;Well, that about wraps it up for God.&quot;", "filename": "7cb7bb6374bcf1dcd81120d0846ecc38", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1191, "h": 527, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 110, "tim": 1674165144910905, "time": 1674165144, "md5": "k53D+ICWFUi+ZHTDDJqBiw==", "fsize": 164647, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "to-quote-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-well", "replies": 25, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 14499121, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)16:55:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14499103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499103</a><br>This but unironocally.", "time": 1674165346, "resto": 14499103}, {"no": 14499130, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)16:57:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why dont those retards just order a pizza?", "time": 1674165422, "resto": 14499103}, {"no": 14499137, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)16:58:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thier fault for being black desu.

Quite often, it is through an overwhelming perception that the orderliness and evident design of the universe, and of humans and animals, could hardly have come about by chance, or as the end result of a primeval explosion (explosions generally result in disorder, not order). For instance, a man named Whittaker Chambers, a convinced atheist who was once quite famous as a Soviet spy, found himself coming to belief through an epiphany he experienced while holding his infant daughter at night:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My eye came to rest on the delicate convolutions of her ear -- those intricate, perfect ears. The thought passed through my mind: &quot;No, those ears were not created by any chance coming together of atoms in nature... They could have been created only by immense design.</span><br><br>It is hard to address this sort of thing without having a conversation. But I can tell you what worked for me, and that is to pray.

God isn&#039;t a he or a she or a being. God is like the sun or like light or energy or something like that. It&#039;s not a conscious being making anything do anything, nor does it know anything, it just is. It&#039;s called source and aliens an ghosts have told mediums in books and videos that there is more than one source but that everything in this universe comes from the same source. Freewill is the options to pick from the different plans you make. When we&#039;re planning our lives we don&#039;t have a set path, we give ourselves options. Instead of oe set path we give ourselves a set of paths to pick from in life. Your life plan looks like a tree when you make it. You start out being born at the root then each freewill decision leads to a different branch and a different outcome. We usually get our spirit guides mixed up with what we think is god. Like we&#039;ll have a near death experience and someone will show up talking to you floating in space an you&#039;ll come back like I met god!!! When it was just your guide. God doesn&#039;t talk to people and work with individuals because its not a being or a person. Your guide is always with you. Every one reading this has a spirit guide in their vicinity caring for them. After you finish your reincarnation cycle you become a guide. So you have to come here and learn to be human before you can be a guide or someone else&#039;s guardian angel an help them be human.

Stalin&#039;s goal was to consolidate Soviet power for generations to come. He wasn&#039;t your typical Latin American presidente-por-vida whose system falls apart as soon as he&#039;s deposed in a coup. Stalin knew perfectly that the USSR was a one of a kind experiment, and that it would have countless enemies that would work 24/7 to put it down, consciously and unconsciously. For example, the existence of a powerful Red Army was a threat to Soviet power - if the Army grew stronger than the Party, the USSR would end up as a military dictatorship in the best case, and a fragmented warlord wasteland like Mexico and China in the worst case. So Stalin made sure that the Red Army would always be in an inferior position to the Party by shooting all relevant commanders. And about old Bolsheviks, Stalin knew them well, he was aware tha he dealt with idealists in some cases (Berzi\u0146s), personal ambition in other cases (Kamenev) and finally pure omnicidal schizos (Trotsky). Stalin needed internal and external stability for the USSR to thrive, maybe to even exist. And those people were obvious obstacles in the path of Realpolitik and Socialism in One Country. You may blame Stalin for being true to his conviction that there are several things which are more important than personal liberty and individual rights, but if you believe that personal liberty and individual rights are sacred, you have a petit bourgeois mindset anyway.", "time": 1674122899, "resto": 14492915}, {"no": 14496753, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:47:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14492915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14492915</a><br><a href=\"#p14492924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14492924</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Revolution had to adapt itself to its environment, and Stalinism provided the adaptation.

The marriage was as unnatural as it was inescapable, and its grotesqueness was reflected in all the antics of the Stalin cult.

Many Crusaders took alternative routes to the Levant and Venice seemed pose to take a massive financial loss in exchange for their investment. Eventually, after the Venetians and Crusaders cooperated to attack the city of Zara for Venice as a means of placating them, another financial opportunity seemed to rise in the form of the deposed Byzantine prince - the future Alexius IV Angelus - whose father had been the prior emperor only to be usurped and blinded by his brother. While Alexius also overstated the amount of support he could expect from the denizens of Constantinople, his uncle would eventually flee the city with a massive chunk of the treasury after facing the Venetian and Crusader army which lead to the restoration of Alexius&#039; father (who was blinded) alongside the institution of himself as co-emperor. Alexius not only struggled to pay the Crusaders&#039; back due to the state of the treasury compared to the scale of his promises - promises which included assistance on the actual Crusade - but he would also further rely on the Crusaders to solidify his powerbase which furthered the extent of his promises. At the same time, there were tensions between the Latins and Greeks while the Byzantine nobility was also unfavorable towards the Latins. Alexius IV would eventually have to take a tough stand against his former allies but would nevertheless be usurped by an anti-Latin official he freed earlier. The Latins would be evermore concerned about the fulfillment of Alexius&#039; debt to them after Alexius, himself, was murdered by this usurper.", "time": 1674177516, "resto": 14499966}, {"no": 14500020, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)20:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14499999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14499999</a><br>The death of Alexius, leaving the Latins with nobody favorable to treat with, furthered the march towards the event known as the Sack of Constanpinople. The murder of Alexius, who was once very friendly with the Crusader leadership by this usurper, also further strained any hope at negotiation - not that this usurper Alexius V Doukas - would have embarked on paying off the Latins to begin with. As the conflict intensified, Alexius V would also flee from the city. The city elite seemed pose to offer the crown of Byzantium to the de jure leader of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat - whose family had ties to Byzantium, but Boniface&#039;s control over the Crusade was divided amongst a series of men/factions with different interests and so he couldn&#039;t stop the sack or even accept the crown.", "time": 1674177824, "resto": 14499966}, {"no": 14500054, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)20:30:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14500020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14500020</a><br>By the time the sack completed, the Crusaders now divided the territories of former Byzantium amongst themselves with Baldwin of Flanders being elected over Boniface by a council set up which was divided between Venetians and Crusaders.

The sheer scale of riches plundered also proved satisfactory to many parties. <br><br>Ironically, much earlier in the Crusade - after the institution of Alexius IV as emperor - an exiled Seljuk prince in the capital requested the Crusaders also help him retake his state - offering rewards and promising to convert to Catholicism in exchange for such (it&#039;s worth noting the conversion of Byzantium to Catholicism was also a promise of Alexius IV - a promise that increased his personal difficulties in fulfilling his various promises). That Seljuk prince would be turned down, with the Crusaders not wanting to eternally restore wronged parties to their various thrones and Alexius IV&#039;s promises still being unfulfilled, but would eventually restore himself to the Seljuk throne without Crusader help. It would be interesting, in an alternate world, where the Crusaders did restore him and he converted to Catholicism.

In his parts on the conquistadors conquest of Mexico he talks about their steel armor and swords against Aztec weaponry. But he ignores that the conquistadors were used more as limited shock troops than regular infantry. Most of the fighting was done by native warriors who part of cities that opposed the triple alliance. Like yeah conquistador horses can be used for large Calvary charges if your a basic bitch. But they&#039;re far more useful in skirmishing, scouting, raiding, and carrying messages. The fact that they could out run Aztec scouts and messengers made commanding their army far more difficult. Kind of like how the French suffered in WW2 because they didn&#039;t use radio communication. So when German tanks zoomed past them by the time they got the message they&#039;d be in an entirely different location. <br><br>Also he is reductive when talking about the germ element. With the Inca for example their leadership being hit by disease wasn&#039;t a guaranteed event, there was an element of chance to it. He&#039;ll even if we do accept the Europeans were destined to triumph militarily over the natives this ignores that military aims are a choice governed by a number of determining factors. If Cortez wasn&#039;t such a loyal follower of the Spanish monarchy. It&#039;s not hard to see another man in his position try to create his own personal fiefdom. Which brings up the possibility of the Spanish having to deal with a rogue warlod. Although the more likely outcome is Cortez does something stupid and gets over thrown by his subjects.
