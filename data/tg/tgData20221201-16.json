The rules don&#039;t have to be complicated, but keep them in the front of your mind. The line between a hammy and exaggerated NPC and a memorable and interesting one is not impossibly thin, it does not exist. <br><br>For example, lets take your rich noble bastard. Put that on a notecard, in big all caps &quot;RICH NOBLE BASTARD&quot;. Then write the following:<br>1. What he wants: keep this in the front of your mind, this gives them direction. He wants riches, or he wants to be king, or he wants the princess to himself, whatever it is it&#039;s why he matters. Caveats and exceptions can be very important here too: maybe he wants to take over a neighboring fiefdom, but it&#039;s going to be different if he wants to do so by force or lawfully.<br>2. What he is: What can he do? Does he have a lot of men? Is he the wealthiest of the nobility? Second richest? Is he charismatic? Both what he has and what he is good at (or bad at) will also inform his behavior. <br>3. What he does: Does he stutter? Does he ramble? Does he delegate responsibility? Does he tell riddles? You already know what he wants and what he can or can&#039;t do, decide now a single (or a few) ancillary characteristic, something that makes him stand out. <br><br>At its simplest, you have an NPC:<br>&quot;RICH NOBLE BASTARD<br>-Wants to be made ruler of neighboring counties, but lawfully recognized by the king.<br>-Dye Trade makes him richest noble. Backroom network of spies and deals with trade guilds. Not very handsome, but exceptional negotiator and affable. Insecure.<br>-He thinks with his hands, always playing with a puzzle or fiddling with things even when talking to others.

You can add the world outside the town, kingdoms, orc tribes, wandering monsters, elves, magic places, shrines, treasures, monsters, thieves and all kinds of other adventures for the other players to find.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In your world don&#039;t make it impossible to survive. Since you must tell the other players what&#039;s happening and what effects their actions have you are their eyes and ears.

After all, it&#039;s their neck.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Try to be realistic. Read up on the middle ages so you&#039;ll get a good idea of how things went then.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don&#039;t make your world too civilized. If there&#039;s no monsters around to fight the players will take to robbery to make life interesting.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When you create your area, start by making a map of the area with graphpaper at a scale of 5\u201310 miles to a square. Then make maps of a larger scale of areas that should be more detailed, like castiles towns etc. Fill in all the smaller details with your imagination when a player comes to them.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any rules for anything that is not here feel free to make them up.

Mechs were initially sent out as universal utility vehicles with the first waves of extra-solar colonization. You could use them as forklifts, escavators, towtrucks, or asteroid wranglers. As Earth had neither the resources or even the desire to govern the diaspora the colonies tended to erupt into bushfire wars and banditry. Mechs got pushed into combat like a pickup truck in the middle-east. <br><br>The setting starts at about 80 years since the first colonies were established. Mechs still sit in the universal combat engineer nich but occasionally branch out into sapper or spec ops roles as some planets are just too hazardous to walk on even in a hardsuit.

Now there&#039;s a lot of focus put onto more mundane aspects of the world--pastoral fantasy games where labour of the land and the struggles of commoners are more in focus than hunting dragons and cleansing great world-devouring evils, for example. If it&#039;s a sci-fi game, you&#039;re a wagie under the foot of a large corporation trying to get by. If it&#039;s a post-apocalyptic game, it&#039;s strictly about the survival aspect. Any authority system is dissected and explained down to the last little detail about how it functions and how it affects the commoners.<br><br>On the other hand, more classic fantasy (JRPGs evolved directly from this and reflect it more prominently, but I digress) have fantasy injected on every level of the world, even in the same themes that these grounded games are trying to reflect. The miners are goofy dwarves and use heavy machinery to dig, they are constantly attacked by goblins that they themselves can drive away, but they need the heroes because their mining operations have awoken a machine of an earlier age that&#039;s wrecked their machines and threatens their village, and it turns out it&#039;s an old guardian protecting an ancient treasure. The farmers struggle not against their way of life, but because a dragon is stealing their cattle and burning their crops. The king is a tyrant that enforces a nation-wide blockade that would be completely impossible to pull off in real life--that&#039;s how great his royal might is.<br><br>Not everything needs to have a deep deconstruction born from realism.
