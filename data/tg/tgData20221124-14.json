Maize was still receiving its visitors, there lived a man named Kage. Kage was seemingly a pious man, looking after the shrine and it&#039;s spirit with great respect and devotion. However a darkness loomed underneath and when the tower fell and the world ended, he stole the final offerings left to the shrine for himself, not because he was fearful of starvation but because he could not stand to give up the luxury he had known as the head priest of the shrine. Once the food from the offerings dried up he began to steal the food that was meant for the priesthood. None knew of this treachery and many of the remaining members soon succumbed to starvation while Kage gorged himself on the berries and food supplies he had stolen from them. Eventually he would begin to fear for his own life, worried that he too would starve and hatched a final cunning plan. Kage knew that the revivor seeds that were used to bring back the dead, were not used immediately after Shiro blessed them. waiting patiently for the perfect time to strike and snuck away with the seeds in the middle of the &quot;night&quot;. his preparation was for naught however, as the last remaining shrine maiden, Yuki had spotted him leave. Upon learning of this Shiro flew into a rage, quickly piecing together that his was also likely the one who stole his offerings and the food meant for his followers. He and Yuki soon began to prepare a divine ritual, a curse to punish his sins; His hunger could no longer be satisfied and yet his body would no longer eat any food without falling ill. Unaware of this fact Kage started to consume his pilfered seeds, attempting to gain immortality, however after he had eaten but a single seed, his body was twisted into a foul mockery of itself, an undead wraith who has only one goal, to end it&#039;s ever growing hunger", "time": 1669314212, "resto": 86826393}, {"no": 86828782, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:25:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86828772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86828772</a><br><br>Partner Build <br><br>Yuki, Miko of Summit Shrine <br>Natural <br>Trouble <br>Take a Chance (Snowrunt) <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perks and Drawbacks </span><br>Evolution (Froslass) <br>Hidden Ability <br>Skill x2 (Religion x2) <br>Popular <br>Berry Allergy (Aspear Berry) <br>Weakness (Dragon, Psychological Weakness) <br>Incompetence (Physical Tasks and Athletics) <br>Bad Egg x4 (Health, Attack, Defence, Special Defence) <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Moves </span><br>Hex (Free) <br><br>Experience x3<br>Hail <br>Blizzard <br>Aurora Veil <br><br>TM <br>Safeguard <br><br>Linking <br>Hail + Aurora Veil <br>Divine Winds <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Assets </span><br>Home <br>Food Supply <br>Wand Supply (Stayaway Wand) <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Accessories </span><br>Reunion Cape", "filename": "b1af37a2200df6dde4677389154d0166", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2216, "h": 1268, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1669314315197339, "time": 1669314315, "md5": "o120ndoem0zW6GJoG37hKw==", "fsize": 358762, "resto": 86826393}, {"no": 86828790, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:26:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86828782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86828782</a><br>It has been decades since then and now only one person remains to look after Summit Shrine, the shrine maiden who cursed him alongside Shiro.

Every other week when she should be helping with maintenance, she instead sneaks away with some of her food and attempts to calm his restless soul, however futile that may be. if Shiro knows of her actions he makes no outward mention of it but a growing awkwardness between the two in recent years is suggestive of something, perhaps he regrets his harshness in punishing him&#039; or maybe he views the shell of a man beneath his notice as a deity and merely turns a blind eye to what happens to him. Of course there is another possibility, perhaps deep down Kage is still aware of his actions, even if he is no longer in control of them and that by letting Yuki bring him sustenance she extends his life and therefor his punishment.", "time": 1669314376, "resto": 86826393}, {"no": 86829139, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:06:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m looking to poach some Heroes/Vigilantes for Fission&#039;s team.

I think the designer for Shadow even worked on WHFRP 4e. You pick from four starting classes at level 1, then at level 3 you pick from dozens of advanced classes, then at level 7 you pick from over a hundred master classes. They get progressively more specific and specialized as you go. The key is that there&#039;s no restrictions in what you pick. So you can build a hybrid or specialist as you see fit and go along. You could go Warrior &gt; Fighter &gt; Highlander to make a two-handed sword drontline specialist, or instead go Warrior &gt; Wizard &gt; Chronurgist to instead make a spellblade that uses time magic.<br><br>Though I&#039;d caution that Shadow has some divisive fluff. The default setting kind of sucks and most people don&#039;t like it. The setting also gets memed on for having a lot of really gross, disgusting content. It&#039;s either because the designer has a really juvenile sense of humor, focuses too much on the gross-out aspect of horror, or has a scat fetish. Take your pick of the reason why because nobody agrees and 90% of Shadow threads devolve into arguments about that because of (literal) shitposting. It&#039;s fortunately easy to ignore if you don&#039;t want it, though.

We worked out the quest in broad strokes so it could make sense in the background but not get in the way. The real hurdle was figuring out healing. We decided that slow regeneration was probably best, but that being hit to below 0 HP would be complete destruction to compensate. I could also be turned as my level/HD, affected as other undead, and even disrupted. Beyond this, we used the human XP table since I was a human skeleton. Anyway, the long and short of it is that if you do it thoughtfully you can probably make it work in any set of rules so long as you&#039;re not trying to squeeze out unfair advantages.

This allowed me to heal up during rest periods without being nuts about it, which we figured was fair since I had no way of healing during combat and would be destroyed at 0. Which indeed is what happened, somewhere around level 7.

Breathless, unlike most undead, do not lose their alignment, class skills, or personality when becoming undead nor do they gain any special abilities outside of the standard slew undeath grants.

Most go through the motions of their lives though being undead, continuing in their jobs and even eating and sleeping though such acts are not required of them anymore.

Wizard cast Invisibility and Fly on himself, and began scouting terrain. We thought he was in the clear, until we realized &quot;Oh yea, this is a magic heavy game&quot;, and saw Griffon&#039;s begin heading directly towards him.
