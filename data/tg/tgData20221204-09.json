The PCs are capable of fighting adult dragons, greater demons and devils, rakshasa sorcerers, beholders, and even stronger threats.

(Pathfinder 2e&#039;s Agents of Edgewatch #5 has over twenty CR 12 street gang thugs across the adventure. 13th Age&#039;s Games of Power is a mini-adventure for max-level PCs, who can slay ancient dragons and balors; the first challenging encounter is against a rebellious noble house&#039;s guards, including some mooks who are explicitly supposed to be &quot;in training.&quot;)<br><br>Why? Who knows. For some reason, adventure authors sometimes forget that mid/high-level PCs are essentially superheroes, and that it becomes increasingly implausible for them to be seriously threatened by a group of &lt;20 mundane, mortal humanoid grunts with no buildup. For some reason, adventure authors want to tell a low-level story with low-level obstacles even though the PCs are much stronger.<br><br>But it is not just published adventures. Actual GMs do this, too. I have been playing tabletop games for a long time. I have frequently seen GMs field mid/high-level, mortal humanoid grunts as opponents with no buildup.

These gods would each represent one of the underlying forces of the setting. At the top of the divine hierarchy are a duo of deities. The first, Quintessence, is a chaotic force constantly creating shit, like a writer constantly putting to paper every thought that runs through their mind. To continue the metaphor their equal and opposite number Void is akin to an editor, an orderly force that refines the workable ideas that Quintessence produces and destroying those that would have an overall negative effect on the world as a whole, though some bad shit still slips through every so often, which is where a lot of monsters come from. They&#039;re usually depicted as a couple but they&#039;re rather ambiguous on the topic if asked.<br><br>Underneath these two are the other four major deities, each one the god of one of the classical four elements, as well as other concepts, like War for Fire or Truth and Illusions for Air for example. What are your thoughts on other domains each might also have, just to throw ideas out there? Not sure if they should be more like couples, siblings, or what. They&#039;re a bit more active among mortals than the Duo are.<br><br>As for races, each race was created by the gods from the same base template all of them contributed to, with each race having been primarily shaped by two of the six, so while they can worship any of the six, or all, they tend to focus on the two that made them more. If you have any ideas for race-god associations I&#039;d be glad for them, my main idea is that Humans in the setting are both Quintessence and Void, so we&#039;re a race of contradictions, and can breed with the others more easily.

Sure, the text mentions that clerics &quot;typically associate themselves with temples or shrines&quot; of whichever deity gave them powers, but this doesn&#039;t seem to be a requirement.

They had a graduation party, an official school event after hours where everyone dressed up in black tie, but it wasn&#039;t really a prom (we had two of those already). Anyway, one of the rooms was being run by parents/volunteer teachers as a classic style casino; While it was still on school tables, it was dimly lit, and they had actual nice green felt, new packs of cards, a roulette wheel, etc. Chips were free, but ostensibly tied to charitable donations (I think I put a 5 in, but they were giving everyone the same amount of chips, 30 or so).<br><br>Being an autist, I was making my way from table to table, trying not to talk to acquaintances I sort of knew. After losing a third of my chips on roulette and poker, I found myself at the blackjack table. Now, years before, my father had bonded with my siblings and I by regularly playing blackjack with us at the dinner table, so I knew the ins and outs of the game very well. Without &quot;counting cards&quot; you can still reliably win; if you play for long enough, and especially when they&#039;re using only two decks, the count just becomes evident. Splitting, doubling down, even taking hits on a 16; it was all working out. I was on the greatest run of my life. <br><br>As an aside, the PA system was playing a single CD; whichever Ariana grande&#039;s latest album was. I heard those 10 or so tracks so many times I began to leave my body entirely, hovering above my tuxedoed self, clusters of people joining and leaving the table for a few hands at a time. One of the other rooms had a fog machine, and our room became hazier with every card dealt. I was there for hours. Gradually the chips began to pile up. Two hours in, they shuffled the deck. The pile in front of me waned over the next 30 minutes, but soon stopped depleting. And the trickle started again. <br>[cont]", "time": 1670126642, "resto": 86916913}, {"no": 86922811, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)23:22:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86922694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86922694</a><br>The man in charge of the whole gaming room&#039;s chips, the banker if you will, ended up pushing the table of chips adjacent to mine. First the 50s were to few. Then the hundreds. Until finally every other game had shut down. There were chips enough for me, the guy beside me, and the two girls to my right. They were playing with 10s still; i began to go all in. Matte colored cylindrical spires pushed forwards, some losing their structural integrity, cascading like rivers of moss, blood, sunlight.
