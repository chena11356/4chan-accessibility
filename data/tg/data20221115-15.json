That said maybe I&#039;m just more cynical but there&#039;s a lotta stuff in WHF that I just don&#039;t like and find hard to headcanon out, mainly aesthetics or themes of some factions.

Different settings, different rules, aiming for different goals. From a purely mechanical perspective even a lot of people that prefer VtM will tell you VtR 2e beats it for mechanics. V20 is really a pretty clunky game with some strange choices, and ability design that&#039;s never been particularly exciting. VtR 2e is head and shoulders above it in that regard. <br><br>It&#039;s really the setting and fluff that most of the love for VtM stems from. It&#039;s a big setting with a lot of detail that&#039;s been around for a long time. VtR handles its setting very differently, deliberately not doing a lot of what VtM did, and so that&#039;s mostly what it comes down to there. VtR doesn&#039;t give a lot of hard answers for things that happened in ancient history, it leaves gaps in places for GMs to fill in, and generally just handles its setting differently. For my money I prefer both the fluff and the style of the fluff in VtR but YMMV. However fluff doesn&#039;t really seem to be what you&#039;re after so if you can only read one, I&#039;d read VtR.

CofD games all have a unified core system they all share. So stats, skills, combat, social stuff, etc, all work the same. There will be additional mechanics in each, and what PCs can do in each is very different. So everything is different except how you&#039;ll do mundane stuff and roll dice. oWoD (VtM, etc.) is the same for that last bit but only has fairly similar core systems. Which means you can&#039;t really just learn a core ruleset because that might change between games. <br><br>Any two games in CofD or oWoD will be very different.

If you take some of the world-creation-giant stories literally, you have giants big enough to make planets out of.<br>On the other hand, lots of entities which get called &#039;giants&#039; may not have been thought of as especially large. Norse giants are often not recognized as giants until they display magical powers, implying they were no bigger than other people (although those &#039;people&#039; may not all have been humans, to add a bit more confusion). A common theme in Germanic romance is a giant who wears the armour of a legendary human hero, which implies human-like size (I think there are even texts where this theme appears alongside the same giant being explicitly much larger than a normal man).<br>Medieval Christians had a blurry line between humans and the &#039;monstrous races&#039;. They knew that freakish children could come from normal parents, and generally saw that as the origin of most humanoid monsters, especially the giant / ogre / wildman archetype. If they were considered a separate &#039;race&#039; it would be in the sense of a subspecies of human rather than entirely different. So they would be entirely willing to categorize someone suffering from gigantism (or maybe even just someone like 6&#039; 6&quot;) as a &#039;giant&#039;, alongside fictional beings who were far larger.", "time": 1668522054, "resto": 86711720}, {"no": 86732952, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)09:57:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86732184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86732184</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ljotalfr</span><br>Are you talking about the ljosalfar?
