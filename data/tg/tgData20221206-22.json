There are very few cities within the Ra\u2019Ga, with most of the population nowadays either living in the great oyster farms or living as nomads as it\u2019s tradition. The size of the cities is also small, since the environment is not the most appropriate to build sprawling metropolis in. In general, the cities are made in areas easy to drain, and once they\u2019ve been cleaned enough, the Ra will design the cities from the bottom up. The thuleans brought with them a formula of special concrete, easy to create with the resources of the swamp and that could dry fast even in high humidity conditions. The Ra will set up great blocks of concrete at the bottom of the swamps, making sure the city\u2019s buildings do not sink under their own weight. Once they have created a secure enough foundation, the Ra will begin building their structures, forming spherical and oval structures, using concrete blocks mixed with cooked adobe or hardened wood. These buildings are pretty much a single room, in which the Ra\u2019s families live together, with only the public buildings having something similar to inner walls. Roads are irregular and frequently drain, with many Ra workers keeping them from clogging with the rains or the floods. Vines use the buildings to grow wildly, which is allowed by the Ra up to a certain point. This, combined with the frequent and unimpeded floods, means that their cities can look like they\u2019ve been abandoned for ages when in reality they are in current use.", "time": 1670366305, "resto": 86924239}, {"no": 86950852, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)17:39:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86950846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86950846</a><br>Trade between the different cities is slow, due to the Ra\u2019s lack of a proper beast of burden.

This race is the living embodiment of the divine light being granted to a being.

Instead, they are moulded from the very earth, their \u201cbirth\u201d process changing the very biological and mineral makeup of the body to include working organs despite their outer body remaining of the same material they were assembled with.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Their explicit connection to Duar lends them one or more of the many aspects of their god (from wanderlust to homeliness, or pacifism to warmongering, as examples), although they always exhibit an almost unbreakable code of honour.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;---Isn\u2019t this a golem?--- A dwarf is sort of a golem, but not really. They are both shaped by hands before having life breathed into them. The important difference is that a golem lacks a soul and is bound by a set of commands that it must follow. However, a dwarf has the benefit of free will as well as a spark of Duar\u2019s blessing, which manifests as a soul.</span>", "time": 1670369544, "resto": 86896333}, {"no": 86952313, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:36:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86951277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86951277</a><br>My prototype game&#039;s elves are moth-things from the spaces between realities.<br>Based around the idea that some cryptids are interdimensional and merely phase in and out of this world.<br>After a terrible event in their history, their vibrational frequency began to drop and attune to our dimension leaving them no longer able to walk among the dimensions at will, and are now limited to slipping behind the wallpaper of reality for brief periods of time.<br>While now adapted to their new prison, they are adversarial to the lower life forms they find themselves surrounded with.<br>They are a reclusive and inscrutable breed, preferring the deep wilds, in which they mercilessly dispatch of intruders.<br>They communicate with sympathetic EM signals between one another, and due to being able to &quot;read&quot; synapses, they are able to put thoughts/images/sounds in the heads of organisms when they suss out their signals.<br> <br>Some by pure chance are born with the &quot;Gloom-Blur&quot; and appear to be omni-positional across the dimensions, those cursed with this affliction seem to flicker like a glitch under a blacklight and are subject to, and channel a torrent of forces and stimuli from countless realities, manifesting as a chaotic power of will that is best defined as &quot;magic&quot;.<br>They are no longer capable of surviving the worlds between so even among their kin, those born with the Gloom-Blur are considered dangerous as they mature, and their sympathetic waves can even drive their own mad from the overload.<br>A rare few of their species manage to reach maturity with this affliction and those that do are the most dangerous of their ilk.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do they resemble our moths?</span><br>Why do lightning bolts resemble the circulatory system?", "filename": "Gypsy-Moth-finger", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670376990548256, "time": 1670376990, "md5": "yNf8N1a81pRmmJjgUPGBAw==", "fsize": 22682, "resto": 86896333}, {"no": 86952780, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:39:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86952313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86952313</a><br>I&#039;ve gone a different way - more &quot;traditional&quot;, but still with a twist.

She prefers the emotional extremes and as such is prone to kicking up drama in wherever she can whether that be through romances, rivalries, festivities, games, orgies, wars, tragedies, or combat. Her religious rituals are often adrenaline filled affairs where her worshipers will go into a state of revelry fueled by a special concoction of drugs which enhance emotional experiences. Acting like a mix of PCP, roofies, ecstasy, and steroids, the drug enhances physical prowess via tapping into the emotions of the users, those intoxicated on the concoction often fly into fits of madness where they will slaughter and fuck all in their sights. In the south, aphrodisiac fumes are used in tandem in order to channel the emotions into those of sexual euphoria that they then use to host orgies. Whereas in the north, the drug is consumed before battle, driving the warriors into an unquenchable berserker rage where they decimate all in their path. Predictably capricious, she is quick to change her attitude and fancies on a dime.

Basically, after the Big Bang equivalent in my setting, like in ours, the universe started out effectively perfectly homogeneous, but a slight imbalance caused matter and energy to coalesce, forming the seeds for the stars and planets, as well as the deities that would shape the cosmos. But in one corner of the cosmos, consciousness spawned from the remaining proto-matter and energy, and it was filled with hatred and twisted thoughts. It could remember what the homogeneous proto-cosmos was like, and it hated that it had changed. Wanting to return everything to this bland expanse and keep it like it was forever, it set out to try and destroy the gods and their creations. <br><br>Unfortunately for it, the gods outnumbered it and were too powerful to directly attack without risking being destroyed itself, forcing it to hide in a pocket realm, which it copied from the realms that the gods were making for their own use, as it actively hates creating new things, and is terrible at it besides, mainly just making flawed copies of what the gods make. And so it came up with a new plan, corruption. <br><br>So now it twists and corrupts the creations of the gods, through both physical corruption and madness, building up its forces with them and mages who foolishly used its powers and lost control of it, as well as cultists who want the oblivion it promises, only for it to twist their souls into new forms rather than destroy them after death like it promised.<br><br>So, any major issues?
