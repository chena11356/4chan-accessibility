It was quickly established that aether was not a substance natural to the world, but an alien element that was related to the space beyond the sky. Astromancers began investing great amounts of time and effort to track any other sources of aether to continue their studies, which they slowly found over time. Many astromancers dedicated great amounts of resources to improve their tools and methods to explore the sky and the spaces between the stars, with the purpose of finding the original source of aether, as well as to track any other asteroid that could contain the element. At this point, a brewing schism between astromancers began appearing. Some believed that the study of aether was the future, and that it would help find out many of the great questions the order had asked themselves for decades, and to also create wonders never before seen in the world. Others believed that astromancy needed to separate itself from aether, seeing it as a misleading element, a mere intermediate element between the stars and themselves, and thus not really able to reliably answer the many questions of the astromancers.", "time": 1669566827, "resto": 86786745}, {"no": 86855970, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)11:35:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86855960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86855960</a><br>This peaceful debate would be settled, not by the astromancers themselves, but by the Magoclergy. At this point in time, the Magoclergy ruled the Khenomeric Empire, and sought to use magic to gain as much power as possible. This meant that the more practical and direct branches of astromancy would be supported over the more esoteric and philosophical ones. This push against the less practical branches of astromancy would make them abandon the School of Light Astromancy, though they never really abandoned their studies. The remaining astromancers would dedicate their efforts at this time to the creations of things like automata, floating structures, or the control of divine energies.

The many astromancical researches that centered around the study of the stars and the many philosophical and metaphysical debates about it made them look less like dangerous wizards and more like a branch of alchemists and philosophers. This allowed them to settle near what would become the Kingdom of Tarot, having friendly ties with their alchemists.

But they certainly are strong in other aspects like close to mid-range combat, HD/camo game, spearheading with cheap HI, aragotos duos, etc etc. Domaru/Tanko teams may have lost 2pts of BS, but they&#039;re still very scary fireteam. They&#039;re not the absurd powerhouse they used to be at the beginning of N4, and the current ITS season certainly isn&#039;t doing them any favors (other than bikers) because it&#039;s so hacking focused. But I don&#039;t think an introduction to a new profile is necessary. If anything they just need a tweak to their fireteam composition labels (bringing back samurai fireteams), a tinbot option for one of the HIs, maybe make Oyama stand out more from generic Domaru, and if you really need more smoke give them to Aragotos then.

They succeeded and eventually even caused their own smaller Skaven version of the Great Maw to be born as a greater daemon of the Horned Rat, but it permanently altered them, giving them both the desire and the ability to grow and consume more, better food to the point that they have their own underground ecosystem that they farm and even their slaves are chubby, leaving them tougher but slower moving.

Those that actually survive to bring something back essentially always wind up in a good position. Their frustration over the lack of backstabbing manifests itself through a love of aggressive flanking attacks. They also sell substantial amounts of slaves (their slaves need more food but are a lot harder to work to death, making them a valuable commodity) and cheaper, easier-to-grow versions of their food, making them almost as rich as some of the poorer Council clans.

Syphon machinery may look to in many places be of incredibly high quality and highly reliable and this is exactly what their warlock-engineers want you to think. In reality, their most important and most sophisticated machines undergo grueling maintenance daily, the unsafe nature of this maintenance accounts for a full quarter of their slave fatalities and they pay huge sums of food and money to Eshin to help keep it a secret. In reality the likes of Ikit Claw still make finer machines but don\u2019t bother with the absurd degrees of maintenance that Syphon does.", "time": 1669521721, "resto": 86852244}, {"no": 86852343, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)23:07:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86852244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86852244</a><br>Why not just use the actual AOS and WHFB books to play in the game?", "time": 1669522049, "resto": 86852244}, {"no": 86852354, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)23:08:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86852343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86852343</a><br>Got a few buddies who insist on Pathfinder and they\u2019re fun enough to play with that I just said \u201cfuck it, fine.\u201d", "time": 1669522112, "resto": 86852244}], "last_modified": 1669522112}, {"no": 86845726, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)08:22:50", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "What If Creating A Character", "com": "Wasn&#039;t about what your character CAN do, but what they CANT", "filename": "1663498726676659", "ext": ".gif", "w": 260, "h": 195, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669468970559649, "time": 1669468970, "md5": "xYnE7VjBXLJvb204hDWQ/Q==", "fsize": 1620619, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-if-creating-a-character", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 10, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 5, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 86847418, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)12:36:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86845726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86845726</a><br>Maybe do both and you actually have a fun game", "time": 1669484182, "resto": 86845726}, {"no": 86848933, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)16:03:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86845726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86845726</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;five pages of blank slots to fill with all the skills and powers you DON&#039;T have</span>", "time": 1669496598, "resto": 86845726}, {"no": 86849359, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)17:01:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I leave my character sheet blank, making me omnipotent.", "time": 1669500073, "resto": 86845726}, {"no": 86852088, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)22:31:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86845726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86845726</a><br>It&#039;d be a very long and boring list. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Accounting</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Banking</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Basket Weaving</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Wood Identification</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Elf Lore</span>", "time": 1669519871, "resto": 86845726}, {"no": 86852236, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)22:48:05", "name": "Smaugchad", "com": "<a href=\"#p86845726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86845726</a><br>Yeah like what if there were like points that you used to build characters with and you could like take disadvantages to gain more points?
