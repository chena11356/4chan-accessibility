The tech-side of the setting is pretty hard-wired into the world at large. If you were to run a game set in the Protectorate (religious, low-tech, crusader types), or with one of the Hordes factions (Trollbloods and Cricle would be best candidates) then I think you could have a good game where the players raid Orgoth ruins, or disrupt Cryxian plots to attack the mainland, or something. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can I bar my players from picking warjack-related classes...</span><br>Yes, easily. Warjacks are very expensive and hard to maintain (worth it if you are really getting into big fights, though) and the only class that really NEEDS to interact with them are warcasters. You can pretty easily fudge the rules a bit to allow a character to become a &quot;jack marshal&quot; later on in a campaign without violating any in-universe rules. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it simple enough that I can explain it to ESL players who never played a TTRPG before?</span><br>English as a second language?

Things did not go great. I ran the game, plot was a Phoenix clan wedding where alcohol was banned in this town by the bride&#039;s father (a scholar-noble) and players are tasked to root out local bootleggers before the wedding because he is paranoid and thinks the bootleggers will use the wedding as an opportunity to try to kill him and his entire family (he&#039;s right, by the way). My players were Phoenix and Ronins. Things did not go well, they picked a fight with the bride&#039;s bitchy aunt because she insulted them (The quest-giver&#039;s younger sister who thinks the quest-giver is a bad father and is raising a complete idiot, and she&#039;s right, the bride is a total idiot, especially by Phoenix standards) and repeatedly challenged her to duels. She, as an NPC was not really designed for combat but she kept winning because of combination of luck and my PCs being more designed more magic than sword fighting. I even suggested to my PCs, &quot;Why don;t you challenge her to a contest you&#039;re good at?&quot; but they insisted on melee combat because it&#039;s most honorable, and I respected that.<br><br>In the end, they congratulated a middle-aged poet woman with a sword for being a more powerful warrior than they, and asked her to help them defeat the bootleggers, to which she insulted the PCs again and stated they&#039;re the ones who got hired to stop the bad guys, she just wants to relax and enjoy the wedding.<br><br>In the end they decided to wait until the day of the wedding for the villains to show themselves. The bootleggers set the tent the marriage was taking place at on fire and caused a panic. PCs got to take down the bad guys (one of which was a groomsman in the wedding), and summon a water spirit to fight the fire, but a couple guests died in the blaze and the bride got a hideous burn on her face.

I&#039;m trying to make a very unlikely situation reasonable.<br><br>Our protagonist is a trainee on an orbital ring station, part of an occupying force that controls the whole ORS, when bioweapons attack. During the raid, he rescues an escaped prisoner. I&#039;m trying to figure out a good way to get both people on the ground and separated from the protagonist&#039;s faction. So far my best idea is that he is patrolling a less-frequented part of the station and the incursion blocks his route to the others. The issue with this idea is that the ORS is supposed to have been occupied for decades and the occupying force is not hurting for numbers (it is a HL/Combine kind of situation), so the idea that he could be caught alone like that seems very strange. As a trainee, I don&#039;t want to rely on him somehow fighting his way out; this is supposed to be something of a major event in the war that at least momentarily boots the occupying faction from the ORS. Comms hardware being on the fritz in the middle of a well supplied station doesn&#039;t really track, and an SPOF to get hit during combat doesn&#039;t really fit the setting. There is also the matter of what escape route he uses. It doesn&#039;t make much sense for the bottom of the elevator to be unguarded, so he can&#039;t ride down. A tram to another station just puts us at square one again.

The demon then spends centuries, maybe even millennia, using all the torture implements along the walls on him - whips, scourges, hooks, knives, etc, etc. Then the real torture starts, and the demon spends another couple of eons flaying the man down mentally, confronting him with every shitty thing he ever did, stripping away his illusions about himself one by one. Over and over and over again the demon teases his ego apart just as he&#039;d ripped apart his flesh, until the man despises everything he ever was. Then eventually, there is no more. He looks up, and the demon is gone. The door to the room opens, and in steps a man - an arrogant, prideful, ignorant man.

The campaign revolves around our group trying to defeat a legendary vampire lord who is corrupting the population through an artifact.The group consists of a NE sorcerer tiefling, a NE rouge half elf, a LN fighter human, and me, a N fighter human. We are currently in the Underdark searching for an item that can help us destroy the artifact.We are being guided by a drow prince who is not trustworthy. He sat by and did nothing to help when the party was attacked by a group of driders. The item is in a duergar city and we are trying to figure a way in without being attacked on sight. We have a couple of options.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tell the duergar the truth and hope for the best </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try getting access to the city as merchants. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sneak in and hope for the best. </span><br>My personal preference is to try the merchant route. We have items that would be valuable to anyone. The problem is, the drow prince is the most valuable thing we could offer them for obvious reasons. Plus he did sit by and do nothing as we were ambushed by the driders. Plus we don&#039;t need him anymore as we located where we need to be.The tiefling is okay with this. The rogue is okay with this. The only one who has a problem is the LN fighter who pulled the following on us when I suggested we sell the drow prince. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he pulls out d20</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t tell us why he&#039;s rolling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rolls 18</span><br>He proceeds to tell us that he made the roll to determine whether or not his character would go along with the group in selling the drow to the duergar. He said if he rolled his lvl (17) or lower he would go along with it. Since he rolled an 18, his character would morally object. It is a legal activity on the surface as well as the underdark. So would a LN fighter really have this big of an objection to selling an evil drow to the duergar? My personal opinion is the player was going to object no matter what.
