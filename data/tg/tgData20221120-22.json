The way the characters do it is all fluff. The only distinction is any limitations or specializations implicitly imposed by the broader conventions of the archetype the character or class is meant to embody.

The Fighter in 5E also has a solid collection of tools to do things other than &quot;hit with sword.&quot; 5E&#039;s approach to Proficiency and Skills means that you can focus on developing all of their fighting-stuff and they&#039;ll just continue to get better at whatever 4-6 skills you chose for them to be proficient at; inherently addressing their lack of out-of-combat utility from ye ol&#039; 3.5. Then, unless you picked Champion, you either get access to arcane spells, magical weapon-related actions, your own Wizard-Flavored Smite, and the ability to teleport. Which all sounds like &#039;more stuff,&#039; than Battle Master, but under the paint it&#039;s till just applying effects within various parameters; as are all actions in a TTRPG.

They&#039;re good, but it doesn&#039;t feel like it changes a ton from the base game. I never separate it from the rest unless I want more focus on the new resource added in the second expansion.

Greeks believed you could make rituals to ask spirits questions, that included the dead. By Greek religion rules the necromancer doesn&#039;t actually orders the spirit, all rituals had burnt offerings, animal sacrifices and shit like that to pay the spirits for their services. Even prayers and divine rituals were to ask stuff and pay preemptively the Gods. And rituals could always fail. For instance, lots of sailors would make prayers and throw wine on the sea to ask Poseidon for safe passage, but if the ship sunk and they died they didn&#039;t thought it was because he wasn&#039;t real but because he decided not to listen to you. <br>The only way I can see a neutral necromancy sistem that works is if the dead work like Poseidon, you can call on them but they decide if they gonna listen. In that case it would be a little like planar binding, you gotta know what they want to be able to convince them. I&#039;d say zombies and skellies are way easier to get than elemental and demons cause they&#039;re human but they don&#039;t last, cause they&#039;re human and they don&#039;t want to stay herer as skeletons, they are easy cause you can summon the guys on your side that want revenge on the guys on the other side and vice versa.

Whether these eldritch forces are Mak Thuum Ngatha and Ragnorra, Caiphon and Allabar, Dyrrn and Belashyrra, Cthulhu and Shub-Niggurath, or some other mix of entities, they are willing to empower vast cults and lend a hand against the fiendish invaders.

The mounted abilities are all cool and the class itself seems more on theme than the fighter subclass. I like the flanking maneuver as an option for when you&#039;re unmounted but apart from that it doesn&#039;t have a lot outside riding and feels a lot more narrowly focused than the fighter, especially when 5e did a decent job fleshing out the other not-quite-fighter classes.<br>As for the subclasses<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Great Knight</span><br>This looks like the other half of the fighters cavalier subclass, the &quot;mmo tank&quot; half.

It doesn&#039;t meaningfully incorporate the mount in it&#039;s theme or mechanics. (how does sitting on a horse get rid of enemies resistances?) It just gets a lot of edgy features that I feel would be more at home as part of a warlock kit or something.<br>Overall I feel like there&#039;s a lack of a cohesive theme between the subclasses, maybe your intention was to make up for the base class&#039; lack of unmounted abilities but the subclasses just end up feeling unconnected to being a Cavalier.

So we decided to try out Dawn of Worlds, and made a collab world with the possible idea of running future D and D games in it. Now that we have a basic map to work with, we&#039;ve started doing Microscope sessions every month or so to add more details. Now expanded to an Utgar&#039;s Chronicles page and a Trello for the AI art people have been making . It was definitely interesting doing it as a collab because you get four creative inputs instead of one. It also sort of invests players more in the world, which will be nice for when we lay, and might encourage more people to take turns DMing (hopefully).<br>Anyone else using DoW or Microscope for building RPG worlds?
