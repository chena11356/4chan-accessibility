For most part overall tech level is on par with late Clan Invasion era, but you start seeing more mechs that actually use new tech reasonably well instead of shit like the Panther with ERPPC and single heat sinks. The big thing is obviously WoB with their c3i, but IS in general gets a few nice pieces of tech like improved jump jets (which make heavies and assaults with a +3 modifier from jumping actually feasible), light autocannons (fixes AC/2s and 5s), and snub-nosed PPCs (which are one of my favourite weapons, especially on jumping mechs since the long short range band helps offset the TN penalty for jumping). Most new tech is sidegrades, though, and not all of it is particularly good. In fact, most of the experimental TacOps equipment is questionable at best, and also still extremely rare in the era (they only start becoming commonplace during the Dark Age).", "time": 1668699375, "resto": 86751731}, {"no": 86753502, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)10:41:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86753222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86753222</a><br>In FM 3067 Drac RAT had one Clan mech in each weight class, except light which had 2: Locust IIC, Koshi, Ryoken, Cauldon Born, and Daishi.

Like all eras, the additional new tech was pretty reserved. They added light, snub, and heavy ppcs, MMLs, Plasma weapons, Light autocannons, AP Gauss Rifles and HAGs. Some additional stuff like XL gyros and compact heat sinks, as well as rules for industrialmechs that I don&#039;t think anyone ever used for pickup games. Basically Total Warfare covered everything Jihad when it started so any additions after BMR marked a Jihad inclusion. This also marked a period where vehicles and conventional infantry were given a fighting chance instead of being laughable stopgaps.<br><br>We also saw a bunch of Primitive mechs get introduced for the first time since the Mackie, meaning a new set of construction rules, but I think most people used them on the table in introtech/upgraded versions. Every now and again you saw Tacops gear show up, but it was usually on niche stuff like Solaris 7 mechs that you assumed nobody would field anyway, and a trickle of it showed up on 3085 units or on alternate configs.<br><br>But the transition from Jihad to Dark age era tech levels was rules whiplash like nothing before.

I&#039;m trying to make a very unlikely situation reasonable.<br><br>Our protagonist is a trainee on an orbital ring station, part of an occupying force that controls the whole ORS, when bioweapons attack. During the raid, he rescues an escaped prisoner. I&#039;m trying to figure out a good way to get both people on the ground and separated from the protagonist&#039;s faction. So far my best idea is that he is patrolling a less-frequented part of the station and the incursion blocks his route to the others. The issue with this idea is that the ORS is supposed to have been occupied for decades and the occupying force is not hurting for numbers (it is a HL/Combine kind of situation), so the idea that he could be caught alone like that seems very strange. As a trainee, I don&#039;t want to rely on him somehow fighting his way out; this is supposed to be something of a major event in the war that at least momentarily boots the occupying faction from the ORS. Comms hardware being on the fritz in the middle of a well supplied station doesn&#039;t really track, and an SPOF to get hit during combat doesn&#039;t really fit the setting. There is also the matter of what escape route he uses. It doesn&#039;t make much sense for the bottom of the elevator to be unguarded, so he can&#039;t ride down. A tram to another station just puts us at square one again.

We have a couple of options.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tell the duergar the truth and hope for the best </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try getting access to the city as merchants. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sneak in and hope for the best. </span><br>My personal preference is to try the merchant route. We have items that would be valuable to anyone. The problem is, the drow prince is the most valuable thing we could offer them for obvious reasons. Plus he did sit by and do nothing as we were ambushed by the driders. Plus we don&#039;t need him anymore as we located where we need to be.The tiefling is okay with this. The rogue is okay with this. The only one who has a problem is the LN fighter who pulled the following on us when I suggested we sell the drow prince. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he pulls out d20</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t tell us why he&#039;s rolling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rolls 18</span><br>He proceeds to tell us that he made the roll to determine whether or not his character would go along with the group in selling the drow to the duergar. He said if he rolled his lvl (17) or lower he would go along with it. Since he rolled an 18, his character would morally object. It is a legal activity on the surface as well as the underdark. So would a LN fighter really have this big of an objection to selling an evil drow to the duergar? My personal opinion is the player was going to object no matter what. Have you run across players who pull shit like this?

With some manual tweaking they can be quite effective and fast. Hollowing in Chitubox is great because when you punch a hole it lets you print the hole as a plug to put back into the model after printing, especially great for large holes. However the holing often is buggy it doesn&#039;t want to put in the hole sometimes even when the punch is big enough and the walls thin enough.<br><br>Photon. It&#039;s the simplest of the three, and loads the fastest. For just quickly checking a model out it&#039;s the go to before closing it and loading a more powerful slicer. However it can be used to hollow and poke holes decently enough that it can fill in for that when Chitubox fails. And it&#039;s autosupports aren&#039;t bad, but not as good as the other slicers, but sometimes more usable then Lychees autosupports.
