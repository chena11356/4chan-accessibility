The campaign revolves around our group trying to defeat a legendary vampire lord who is corrupting the population through an artifact.The group consists of a NE sorcerer tiefling, a NE rouge half elf, a LN fighter human, and me, a N fighter human. We are currently in the Underdark searching for an item that can help us destroy the artifact.We are being guided by a drow prince who is not trustworthy. He sat by and did nothing to help when the party was attacked by a group of driders. The item is in a duergar city and we are trying to figure a way in without being attacked on sight. We have a couple of options.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tell the duergar the truth and hope for the best </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try getting access to the city as merchants. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sneak in and hope for the best. </span><br>My personal preference is to try the merchant route. We have items that would be valuable to anyone. The problem is, the drow prince is the most valuable thing we could offer them for obvious reasons. Plus he did sit by and do nothing as we were ambushed by the driders. Plus we don&#039;t need him anymore as we located where we need to be.The tiefling is okay with this. The rogue is okay with this. The only one who has a problem is the LN fighter who pulled the following on us when I suggested we sell the drow prince. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he pulls out d20</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t tell us why he&#039;s rolling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rolls 18</span><br>He proceeds to tell us that he made the roll to determine whether or not his character would go along with the group in selling the drow to the duergar. He said if he rolled his lvl (17) or lower he would go along with it. Since he rolled an 18, his character would morally object. It is a legal activity on the surface as well as the underdark. So would a LN fighter really have this big of an objection to selling an evil drow to the duergar? My personal opinion is the player was going to object no matter what.

Many a tale has been spoken of a foolhardy priest or knight who goes to convert or slay the arimaspi, only to come back a zealous Devil Worshiper or, most horrifically, as a demon himself.* As such, interactions with arimaspi are forbidden by the Pope unless instigated by the arimaspi as to prevent a crisis of faith throughout Christendom. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For their part, the arimaspi tend to stay to the Rhipaion Mountain range, finding humans willfully ignorant and beneath them. That said, if a human were to show themselves as benevolent, they will gladly take them into their ranks if only to lead them away from the path of God. Arimaspi who do leave tend to go alone for their own personal reasons whether it be vice, to collect knowledge for their libraries, or most nefariously to sow the seeds of Satan&#039;s grace to the unsuspecting masses. </span><br>2/3", "filename": "battle-with-one-eyed-giants-cyclops-from-bl-royal-20-b-xx-f-79v-03370c-1024", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 583, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1668816986909900, "time": 1668816986, "md5": "y9X51K7p3q9BAyIVqz7sBQ==", "fsize": 189203, "resto": 86760004}, {"no": 86769254, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)19:17:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86769248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86769248</a><br>Not sure if they should have access to a portal to Hell or not or if only the hyperboreans should have that.

However, you must blaspheme against the Holy Ghost (the unforgivable sin) and be &quot;baptized&quot; in the flames of Hell or something of that extreme nature. There are also reports of mortals in some apocrypha becoming angels such as Enoch into Metatron. And before discounting apocrypha, it can technically count for the purpose of this project given it&#039;s part of medieval folklore. It is also worth noting men CAN become sidhes given the nature of sidhes so it shouldn&#039;t be completely out of the question for them to become other forms of spirits too. Or they could be akin to antisaints given saints in Catholicism often function as per an archangel.

Yes, skins would probably be the saving grace of the company. Because, let us be honest, infinity would not be as popular if there were very intricate miniatures. I dropped warhammer 40k and malifaux in favour of it because of those having far worse miniatures in a miniature game. And if i add a small detail to the miniature, it will not look out of place despite not having &quot;volumetric&quot; representation, as in &quot;metallic shape&quot;. Have nothing against vaguely sexual things for both male and female models. Cheesecake as a term is too overused, i abhorr it. Yeah, battle damage - sure thing. But give me the option of non-damaged miniature as well, in your example - not torn-out hand, but the undamaged one. If you own Aida, you know she comes with the &quot;open maw&quot; face variant.

Also with your mention of mini and frogs, you could even use Frog Mages and say they&#039;re Illusionists if there&#039;s a knowledge check or maybe you make an event where one casts some illusions here and there like vines stopping a path or maybe an overly dangerous monster like a Behemoth which would feel abit too bullshit that a little frog could summon.<br><br>Another idea I had too was maybe the dungeon boss could be art themed as a reference to the FF6 mansion dungeon where you fight Chadarnook that possessed a painting or something like that but for your campaign maybe have a large frog be painting something and it reveals to be preventing the party to make it to Matoya so it paints a monster to life.<br><br>I also think you could maybe make riddles that are already strange in nature before anything happens e.g. the next room the party enters has a classic example of dream-like surrealism where everything in the room is giant but the PCs are super small and they have to solve some puzzle/find an item that makes the room go back to normal or they&#039;ll get sent to one of those magical trap rooms.

Then later they stopped pumping stats and instead gave cards more effects or stronger effects. Then they gave as many cards as possible a second effect which can activate from the graveyard, basically making your graveyard a secondary &quot;hand&quot;.
