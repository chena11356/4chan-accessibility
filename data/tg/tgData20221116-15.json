The same as saying moar law = moar good because the modern interpretation is that laws are generally moar good than anarchy. This is true, it is also true that more law creates less suffering than more anarchy, but it does not make law itself a natural good.

Even later stuff seems pretty ambiguous.<br>Greek sources talk about several different forms of dwarf, some of them supernatural, others just exotic races of human. I believe that there is at least a consensus from them that dwarfs are smaller than normal people. Pliny said that the Pygmaioi were also known as Trispithami because they were just three spans (a span is about 9&quot;) tall.<br>English, French, and German medieval romances were usually pretty vague about how big dwarfs were (and often unclear if they were meant to be normal people who had dwarfism, members of a race of small people who were nevertheless still human, or actually supernatural beings) but again there seems to be a general consensus that they were relatively small. I&#039;ve seen references to them being three spans (almost certainly copied from Pliny), one cubit (18&quot; or so), &#039;knee high&#039; (to a human), or (probably the most common measure) one ell (&#039;arm&#039;; a wildly variable unit ranging from the same as a cubit to over four feet, but usually about two feet).<br>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen any description of a legendary dwarf which is in the height range of fantasy dwarfs (which I generally think of as 4 to 5 feet). They are either not any smaller than normal people, completely ambiguous, less than 4 feet tall, or don&#039;t really fit the general dwarf archetype (e.g. a lot of pacific-region legends have stories of &#039;short men&#039; who are near human height, but they are ape-men, AKA wildmen, which share little in common with European dwarf myths).", "time": 1668629308, "resto": 86711720}, {"no": 86745338, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:33:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86742181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86742181</a><br>I&#039;m going to concentrate on concepts with actual mythical basis, since otherwise you can pretty much include anything.<br>One major theme is that giants are related to gods. The titans, gigantes, and cyclops of Greek myth were ancestors, cousins, or offspring of the gods. Germanic pagans seem to have classed their &#039;giants&#039; as comparable to the gods and often related to them. Asuras are god-like. In many cases, they are said to be older than the gods and may even represent &#039;folk memories&#039; of previous pantheons. Sometimes they are &#039;anti-gods&#039; or enemies of the gods. Even in medieval Christian traditions, where they are obviously nowhere near the power-level of God, they are portrayed as so arrogant that they think of themselves as equal to Him.<br>So there&#039;s a lot of ways that can be played with. Maybe giants are outcast gods who have been cast down to earth? Or the offspring of gods and mortals (and possibly able to call on their divine parents).<br>Another theme is that giants are primordial beings of stone. This is a very widespread idea; I know of it being mentioned in European, Asian, and American myth. Often they turn to stone on death, or have bodies as hard as stone (often immune to stone or iron weapons, for example). Make them kind of &#039;elemental&#039; rather than fleshy.<br>Another popular theme is that giants are a mix of man and beast, mixing with the &#039;wildman&#039; archetype. This is especially common in north America, but also found elsewhere. Modern fantasy writers often like to play with this, making giants resemble archaic hominids, with lots of hair, stone-age technology, brow ridges, etc. This ties in with the idea of them being &#039;primal&#039; beings from the dawn of time.

All I know is that during Ex3 development a lot of the issues people point out where brought up, but when it was brought up Holdorke said \u201cIt would be discussed\u201d but nothing ever changing. I think one beta-tester I talked to even mentioned the initiative toilet issue Mass Combat groups have but nothing was ever done about it (by memory, could be wrong).<br><br>DB\u2019s was shit for a different reason. Minton and Vance just saw Holdorke get run over after their game of chicken, and Rich threatened to run them over if the DB book wasn\u2019t made yesterday. They had a writing staff that was beyond a skeleton crew, Vance was finalizing their bar exams, and Minton was going through some difficult life challenges. As a result the DB\u2019s book was quickly churned out with past notes and didn\u2019t have the time to go back and revise shit (if they did, then it still wasn\u2019t enough). The issue with the DB core wasn\u2019t the echo-chamber of core, but more like untying oneself from a train track before it runs you over. This is why I said the DB book is garbage, but I forgive Vance/Minton because of the circumstances surrounding it.<br><br>Long story short: Don&#039;t comprehend &quot;why is this made the way it is?&quot; in the corebook.

That doesn&#039;t seem right, because many small boats need a lot of rowers, while some big ships can be managed by a small crew. For example, the Armed Launch in GURPS Vehicles: Steampunk Conveyances is operated with Boating, despite having 16 crew (I think that is 12 oarsmen, one stoker, one helmsman, one gunner, and one loader with some of them doing double duty handling the sails when those are in use). Meanwhile the Steam Yacht in the same book has only 6 crew and one of those is a steward (I guess the two sailors handle both shoveling coal and the sails, which seems like a lot of work) but is managed with Shiphandling.<br>Is it weight or size? Presumably not, since the massive Walap from Vehicles: Transports of Fantasy uses Boating (Sailboat) while being larger and heavier than many ships which use Shiphanding (including ones from the same book, so it isn&#039;t inconsistency between authors, nor does it seem to be tech-level dependent).<br>I guess it basically comes down to what &#039;feels right&#039;.

I actually had some more back end stuff, as well. Like how some God minds are lucid dreamers and can appear as an avatar within their own dream even travelling outside of it for short times. Other God minds had ego death and now their psyche is fractured into a pantheon of gods unaware of their true nature.

Sometimes these are similar races but other times this can be landscapes, buildings or other things less grandiose like a identical tea set. <br><br>The Oneiroi themselves have a separate, very ritualistic religion apart from that of the other races. They sometimes allow other faiths to exist within their &quot;foreign quarter&quot; but withing their citadels and inner cities exist towering cathedrals and floating temples that are off limits to non Oneiroi. Oneiroi are also extremely cryptic and aloof with inscrutable goals. While different Oneiroi cities will ally with opposing factions the cities themselves never ever come to blows, even fighting between Oneiroi individually never happens. No one is quite sure where they came from either, already having been old by the time the first explorers came and documented their existence.

It&#039;s something I&#039;ve been kicking around for almost a year, actually. Fiddling, tinkering, revising. My goal with it is literary. I have something close to 20k words written that is simply a natural history of the setting, beginning with Genesis and progressing into the celestial war which provides the basis for the setting, before leading into the specific cultural histories of the three branches of humankind. <br><br>It&#039;s with that last part that I&#039;ve begun to get bogged down. I know what I have in mind for each, but every time I&#039;m able to churn through their early history, the events that separate them from their respective deities (it is a shared theme that each branch of humanity eventually distances themselves from their creator deities, or outright kills them), and sociopolitical progress that eventually brings them back to the stars, I wind up getting sidetracked and wanting to go back and revise it all again.<br><br>For the sake of brevity, the three subsets are:<br><br>1) A matrilineal, caste-based society who views purpose as a quasi-religious ideal, and raises children communally as a result of having primarily women in leadership roles. Their closest available phenotype is African, but the reason for the color of their skin is that their progenitor deities were descended partially from a sort of esoteric spirit of empty space who died in the celestial conflict.<br><br>2) A hyper-capitalist culture which revolves around the concept of family and filial piety - with rather loose ideals regarding who can be considered family and why. They essentially function like competing mafias, and are run by capos who have had their lives preserved through magical means at great expense. A loose coalition of these &#039;Families&#039; helps keep an uneasy peace and sense of unity, but there is much more internal conflict than the others. Phenotype similar to Asiatics. The idea was how would a culture look if its celestial &quot;parents&quot; were a mother/protector and a trickster deity.<br>cont", "time": 1668625288, "resto": 86742179}, {"no": 86744492, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:09:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86744432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86744432</a><br><br>3) Your more traditional imperialistic warmongers, whose patron deities were a pair of twin brothers - one embodying glory and a taste for righteous conflict, golden-haired and glorious. The other a mute, squat blacksmith type. There&#039;s a pervasive belief that the brothers fashioned them all from ores native to their homeworld - some gold, and some iron - and that this contributes to their diversity of appearance. Also leads to some intra-racial favoritism with the golds being more often elevated to leadership positions than the irons. This is all, quite simply, bullshit and revisionist history because the man who eventually drove off the twin deities and united the race under his banner was golden-haired and wanted to preserve a legacy for people like him. European phenotype. And, in the setting, the only type of human which is still aggressively exploring the dead god&#039;s wounds and colonizing new systems, even if they&#039;re already inhabited. Obviously, a lot of Roman parallels, since their economic engine is similar.<br><br>I want the main driver of conflict in the setting to be, oddly, socioeconomic. The crystallized remnants of the dead god&#039;s blood can be used as fuel for magical devices which have kickstarted a sort of industrial revolution, and is loosely used as currency even though it can twist those who are in contact with it for too long both mentally and physically. Sorcerers in the setting are, by and large, enslaved by groups and guilds within each human subset that are focused on creating and maintaining power through use of these technologies, a feat which is made easier with cooperative mages. I&#039;m thinking of exploring a human trafficking angle with it - kids from bad areas who display any speck of talent are there one minute, gone the next and the story will revolve around finding out why. Probably on a world that&#039;s more or less neutral ground, or only loosely policed and influenced by one of the major human groups.", "time": 1668625740, "resto": 86742179}, {"no": 86744700, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:29:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I unironically have settings that are based around the concept of Space Fantasy.

After the battle, your survivors wander home with loot in hand to begin the Settlement Phase. Arm yourself by developing new weapons and bizarre structures to prepare for next year&#039;s hunt.<br><br>A successful game campaign takes place over the course of 25 to 30 &#039;lantern years&#039; maximum, marked by completing one full phase cycle. Watch as your settlement grows and witness the survivors write their own narrative as they age. Hone your strategy and learn from your mistakes to overcome the immense odds in this cruel and twisted nightmare scape.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr</span><br>It&#039;s basically Darkest Dungeon meets Monster Hunter meets Berserk.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Official Sites</span><br>http://kingdomdeath.com/<br>https://twitter.com/kingdomdeath<br>http://www.kingdomdeath.com/faq/<br>http://www.kingdomdeath.com/wp/livi<wbr>ng-glossary/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.3 Rulebook</span><br>https://mega.nz/#F!WpB0VJhB!KS3q6IN<wbr>Y0vT8IPdtKc9aPQ<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other</span><br>Official build guides: http://build.kingdomdeath.com/<br>Unofficial lore and miniature build guides: http://vibrantlantern.com/<br>ART OF DEATH artbook: https://kingdomdeath.com/downloads/<wbr>kdm-artbook-web-high.zip<br>1.5 Core Game and 1.3 expansion miniature info image: https://i.imgur.com/t0clW3a.jpg (embed)<br>Gambler&#039;s Expansion (coming in late 2020 (we hope) miniature info image: https://i.imgur.com/A64r2Ar.jpg (embed)", "filename": "1496109325701", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1706, "h": 960, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668128513290486, "time": 1668128513, "md5": "3W8wYCwpclq6Z2nwF9p3tw==", "fsize": 235256, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "kingdom-death-monster-general-kdg", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 209, "images": 35, "omitted_posts": 204, "omitted_images": 34, "last_replies": [{"no": 86743691, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)12:36:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do any of the other expansions even compare to this chad?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;simple yet interesting lore</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;coolest battle mechanic</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;best tactics</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;baddass armor</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;replaces kingsman</span>", "filename": "23567433451", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4288, "h": 2848, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1668620180227434, "time": 1668620180, "md5": "W8s90zTqsxIlUMX1a/nBiQ==", "fsize": 810901, "resto": 86684920}, {"no": 86743823, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)12:49:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86743691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86743691</a><br>It does not replace kingsman", "time": 1668620981, "resto": 86684920}, {"no": 86743856, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)12:52:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86743823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86743823</a><br>Damn, you&#039;re right.

The only one who has a problem is the LN fighter who pulled the following on us when I suggested we sell the drow prince. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he pulls out d20</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t tell us why he&#039;s rolling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rolls 18</span><br>He proceeds to tell us that he made the roll to determine whether or not his character would go along with the group in selling the drow to the duergar. He said if he rolled his lvl (17) or lower he would go along with it. Since he rolled an 18, his character would morally object. It is a legal activity on the surface as well as the underdark. So would a LN fighter really have this big of an objection to selling an evil drow to the duergar? My personal opinion is the player was going to object no matter what.
