So, too, they tell of a race who have two feet but only one leg, and are of marvellous swiftness, though they do not bend the knee: they are called Skiopodes, because in the hot weather they lie down on their backs and shade themselves with their feet. Others are said to have no head, and their eyes in their shoulders; and other human or quasi-human races are depicted in mosaic in the harbor esplanade of Carthage, on the faith of histories of rarities. What shall I say of the Cynocephali, whose dog-like head and barking proclaim them beasts rather than men? But we are not bound to believe all we hear of these monstrosities. But whoever is anywhere born a man, that is, a rational, mortal animal, no matter what unusual appearance he presents in color, movement, sound, nor how peculiar he is in some power, part, or quality of his nature, no Christian can doubt that he springs from that one protoplast.

I came up with the idea that, since the rolls are weighted to fall into a specific range, I wanted to factor that in and keep bonuses to a minimum. As such, using a rolling higher is better system, I came up with a number to succeed system for saves and skill checks and such. For instance, a simple task requires a 7, a trying requires a 10, a difficult requires a 13, a hard requires a 16, an inhuman a 19, and an impossible requires 21. So the difficulty of something is divided into tiers, 1-6. However, without +1s and such you may be wondering how you can roll higher than 18. Which is where this maybe gets confusing. <br><br>The idea I had is that your stat and skills are what determine how difficult something actually is in practice. I figure stats go from 1-5, with buffs/magic/skills being able to boost this to up to 6. Average for a stat would be 3, 4 is above average, 5 is top 5% tier, 6 represents superhuman. 7 and above would be reserved specifically for enemies (giants would have a strength score of 7 for instance but I\u2019m getting off topic). For each point above 3, the difficulty of a check would be reduced by 1 tier, and conversely for each point below 3 it is increased. Anything that gets reduced to tier 0 is now an automatic success, so someone with 6 body would be able to do feats of strength considered impossible with a roll of 13 or higher, slightly better than 1 in 4 odds, but would be able to Hard tasks with a roll of only 7 or better, succeeding almost 3/4ths of the time and not having to roll to succeed at anything easier than hard. Is this system intuitive do you think? I\u2019ve gotten mixed reception with the idea, it is a bit muddy, perhaps. Should I just abandon this idea and go for a simple 3d6+modifiers with fixed to hit numbers instead?", "filename": "8252A15C-C6E3-4341-BD96-6528CEEA9A9F", "ext": ".png", "w": 573, "h": 311, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1669009287603749, "time": 1669009287, "md5": "01KYvjXj5AiyQ8XVSwSDwA==", "fsize": 391505, "resto": 86773770}, {"no": 86792478, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)01:10:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Auto Attack Guy here.

Have it be an open field towards a tree line and then in the trees have there be a river or a cliff&#039;s edge that needs to be dealt with as a traversal problem in some way. You can also put in some open world style adventure points. From Here to There will deal with some things like that, but a cave opening or ruined temple can give a distraction to explore if they&#039;re not on a time crunch. Look at discovering something in Skyrim.

Choose one FU class as your class and one Ryuutama class as your background. Choose the type to add some bonuses. I prefer keeping the Ryuutama HP/MP, and just divide the MP cost of FU spells cost by 5, rounded up. Combat is from FU (way deadlier using Ryuutama stats), travel from Ryuutama. When you level you get a skill point to spend in your or another class as per FU, and all the Ryuutama level based stuff. Max level is 10.

The mounted abilities are all cool and the class itself seems more on theme than the fighter subclass. I like the flanking maneuver as an option for when you&#039;re unmounted but apart from that it doesn&#039;t have a lot outside riding and feels a lot more narrowly focused than the fighter, especially when 5e did a decent job fleshing out the other not-quite-fighter classes.<br>As for the subclasses<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Great Knight</span><br>This looks like the other half of the fighters cavalier subclass, the &quot;mmo tank&quot; half.

Same with hearing actually. A sound with breaks until it&#039;s just the same sound. So how fast would Elves go? In most they have Human perception of time. Fair enough. Similar metabolism. But what if they lived longer because their metabolic rate was ten times slower? That would have so many implications on Elven physiology and perception of time. They could recognize weather patterns because to them an hour is like our minute. They could remember faces a century after because to them only a year has passed.<br>At the same time decline in society would happen. If they existed millenia before any other race they would be able to advance, but would be outstripped in a few centuries by other races simply because they perceive time so vastly differently.<br>And what of other races?
