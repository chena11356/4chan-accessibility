He really needed someone else to guide him and keep him from succumbing to his bad habits, like not planning ahead or his love of cheap shock value.<br>It&#039;s also remarkable how sometimes he made actual sensible comments about how to write but other times he talked absolute rubbish. He said characters should never be forced to do things, but rather their personalities should dictate the plot, which is why he hated Vakama turning bad in &#039;05. He also disliked time travel because it robbed stories of their stakes. But then he loved alternate dimensions and retcons, which are arguably just as bad as time travel.<br>Greg&#039;s biggest writing sin (apart from his samey sarcastic asshole characters and general visual aphantasia) was his refusal to plan out stories because he claimed writing should be fun and surprising, and knowing where the story goes is boring. With no direction, he turned Bionicle into a sandbox of his spur-of-the-moment ideas, a jumble of loose plotlines that went nowhere. As a fan who followed the story since the start, it was painful to see it deteriorate into an incoherent mess where nothing mattered anymore.<br>There&#039;s a telling quote that shows how Greg misunderstood plotting. He compared his style of writing to Orson Welles&#039; performance on The Shadow radio drama. Welles supposedly didn&#039;t read the scripts before recording in order to make his acting feel genuine. Greg said he liked to surprise himself in a similar fashion. The obvious false equivalence is that Welles wasn&#039;t the writer, he was acting out a story that&#039;s been plotted out by someone else. Greg wasn&#039;t an actor, he was a writer, but he was more concerned with surprising himself with shocking twists and contrived cliffhangers than with telling a story.<br>I also don&#039;t believe Bionicle should be styled after 1930s radio serials but that&#039;s just me.", "time": 1670619533, "resto": 86918206}, {"no": 86980750, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)17:11:47", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1669832055078614", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670623907041932, "time": 1670623907, "md5": "X/LLmkB9nJBhxY0BVkA0cQ==", "fsize": 332894, "resto": 86918206}, {"no": 86981155, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)18:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86918206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86918206</a><br>I know that there was a lot of contention about G2, but did they actually do anything well, or have any cool ideas that we can use in our campaigns?", "filename": "FCUGVb9VgAAdw_y", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1802, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670626884962438, "time": 1670626884, "md5": "wUnfvuMW+gHRfonf0NrWrQ==", "fsize": 478033, "resto": 86918206}, {"no": 86981367, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)18:30:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86981155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86981155</a><br>A prosperous society that uses magic masks to do tasks but has to be weary about not combining too many powers into one mask was an interesting foundation.

I&#039;ve been working on a game called COGS over the past couple of years (a small number of people may even already know of it from a few threads I&#039;ve posted it in). Yesterday, I launched a Kickstarter for it at https://www.kickstarter.com/project<wbr>s/scribblegs/cogs-expanded-edition to fund a physical release filled with artwork and more supplemental material. It&#039;s got a small goal compared to some projects I&#039;ve seen for FUCKING 5E SUPPLEMENTS, and a good chunk of the funding will probably go toward shipping and printing costs before anything else.

Unfortunately, the text is still choppy at times since I&#039;m a single amateur writer with no editor. However, the plan for the free versions, whether the Kickstarter succeeds or fails, is to update them to match the expanded edition and make them entirely free (not PWYW). They would become the &quot;basic&quot; game version, with no artwork and little supplemental content (like character creation tips, example content, or establishing expected power levels). However, it would still feature what rules and extra content they already have (which is already enough to play a game).<br><br>1/2", "filename": "COGS Logo Expanded Placeholder", "ext": ".png", "w": 1400, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 142, "tim": 1670411352435259, "time": 1670411352, "md5": "CchfCNP0zd5dTEvixMu2KA==", "fsize": 272802, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cogs", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 42, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 37, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 86973700, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)22:46:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86968214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86968214</a><br>I gave good advice?

But PBTA is absolutely a recipe for massively uninspired games created by people who view crunch as vestigial for their improv. There are some really fucking lazy PBTA games and some of them are very well received. Imagine if churning out some uninspired shit for 5e didn&#039;t even really require an understanding of the system and it&#039;s mostly just a question of renaming shit that was already done.<br>Personally, I think there&#039;s too much crunch in PBTA systems, or rather misplaced crunch. The crunch that&#039;s there isn&#039;t to generate interesting narrative situations or stir the pot. It&#039;s primarily there to simplify the process of who does what and what that does. There are exceptions to this, but I&#039;d define these as the good PBTA. <br>They tend to be good for about one go around, a playbook will always be that playbook and you end up fighting the system to play what you want to play unless you limit your character-building to the confines of that playbook. Like making a DnD character: you&#039;re on rails with what you can do. A good PBTA game recognises this and makes its playbooks around narrative archetypes and tropes of the genre that&#039;s being emulated, rather than classes or unique character powers. Like how you&#039;d classify characters in an 80s slasher flick:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most slasher stories use the same old character archetypes from past stories: the Alpha Bitch, the Jerk Jock, the Token Minority (who is often one of the first to bite it), The Stoner, and of course, the Final Girl. This makes it very obvious as to who is going to die and who is going to live.</span><br>Look out for PBTA games that use the system as a base to build off. The Avatar one is a good example for this and I rather like it.

Inside, you can access a menu which will allow you to view any transformation sequence you have, and customize it. Customization can include lighting, particle, and sound effects, as well as the bodily motions you go through. While this can be used to adjust the speed of your transformations, you can only make a transformation as fast as the fastest one you can currently use. But on a more pleasant note, you can also copy any other special effects from one transformation to another. Does one of your transformations prevent you from being harmed during it? Now they all do!

Just spit balling, feel free to call me gey and tell me it wouldn&#039;t work. Firstly he could do something like the time travel from the new Lightyear movie, where the PCs effect a time jump in a spaceship during a mission or something and come back to a post-apocalyptic setting. Secondly, and I say this second because I&#039;m not as certain of how to make it work, but it could be something like the Megaman Zero GBA games. PCs are entered into suspended animation, but are abruptly reawakened post-apocalypse by a member of some surviving faction needing their help. Maybe they&#039;re being loaded on a spaceship in suspended animation for some kind of mission, but the apocalypse happens shortly thereafter and they remain in cryosleep for a hundred years. Or maybe they voluntarily go to sleep like in the game, but in that idea that should be part of character creation and OP should scrap the earlier sessions of ordinary superhero genre stuff.<br><br>In either case, it would be good if the conditions of entering suspended animation (or whatever they were doing before going to sleep) was related somehow to what they&#039;ll be doing when they wake up.
