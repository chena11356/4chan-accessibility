Sure, the text mentions that clerics &quot;typically associate themselves with temples or shrines&quot; of whichever deity gave them powers, but this doesn&#039;t seem to be a requirement. Indeed, a later passage outright confirms that there are clerics who &quot;decline to worship their divine benefactor&quot;, without loss of power.<br><br>I&#039;d be interested to hear what /tg/ thinks of this change. Personally, I assume it was done to make projection and self-inserting easier. It&#039;s no secret that many modern D&amp;D players see the game as a vehicle for working out personal psychological issues, and WotC seems to be catering heavily to such an audience. After all, if you treat roleplaying as a form of self-exploration, demanding that certain classes stick to certain kinds of behavior would likely be seen as an undesirable limitation.

The PCs are capable of fighting adult dragons, greater demons and devils, rakshasa sorcerers, beholders, and even stronger threats. And yet, the adventure author decides to write in one or more challenging encounters against a small group of nameless, mortal humanoid grunts with no buildup. A small group, not some massive army. (Pathfinder 2e&#039;s Agents of Edgewatch #5 has over twenty CR 12 street gang thugs across the adventure. 13th Age&#039;s Games of Power is a mini-adventure for max-level PCs, who can slay ancient dragons and balors; the first challenging encounter is against a rebellious noble house&#039;s guards, including some mooks who are explicitly supposed to be &quot;in training.&quot;)<br><br>Why? Who knows. For some reason, adventure authors sometimes forget that mid/high-level PCs are essentially superheroes, and that it becomes increasingly implausible for them to be seriously threatened by a group of &lt;20 mundane, mortal humanoid grunts with no buildup. For some reason, adventure authors want to tell a low-level story with low-level obstacles even though the PCs are much stronger.<br><br>But it is not just published adventures. Actual GMs do this, too. I have been playing tabletop games for a long time. I have frequently seen GMs field mid/high-level, mortal humanoid grunts as opponents with no buildup.

This approach both helps the balance out by not letting every mage cast literally any spell off of a single skill *and* it fits the Morrowind skills system where you level magic schools completely independently of each other much more closely IMO.<br><br>That being said, removing the default may be overly punishing, since there are over 20 different colleges and all are IQ/VH. You might want to consider retooling the colleges, combining them into a smaller list of broader colleges. This has the added benefit of also aping Morrowind&#039;s schools of magic. I don&#039;t think you could do an easy grouping of colleges as-is due to many colleges providing a wide variety of spell effects (like GURPS&#039;s Illusion &amp; Creation school needing to be broken up between Morrowind&#039;s School of Illusion and School of Conjuration, or GURPS&#039;s Necromantic college having spells that could go to Conjuration, Mysticism, Alteration, and Destruction), so sadly this requires a good deal of elbow grease on your part. Or you just provide guidelines and accept that you&#039;ll need to do some mid-game adjudication when a player asks if a given spell falls into a school or not; instead of having to do a ton of work before the game starts, you do a tiny bit of work only right when you need it.", "time": 1670220321, "resto": 86804700}, {"no": 86934672, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)04:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86933160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86933160</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This has always been the problem with AI art, and it doesn&#039;t seem to be improving anytime soon.</span><br>It is improving, but a lot slower than general quality.
