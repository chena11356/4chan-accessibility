During your Hunt Phase your band of survivors traverse the world of KD in pursuit of their quarry.<br>2. After successfully tracking your quarry you will begin the Showdown Phase, where you must fell these horrific creatures in order to acquire precious resources.<br>3. After the battle, your survivors wander home with loot in hand to begin the Settlement Phase. Arm yourself by developing new weapons and bizarre structures to prepare for next year&#039;s hunt.<br><br>A successful game campaign takes place over the course of 25 to 30 &#039;lantern years&#039; maximum, marked by completing one full phase cycle. Watch as your settlement grows and witness the survivors write their own narrative as they age.

They do at least replace the unique damage dice with &quot;damage base&quot;. which you get from the move&#039;s normal damage and convert it a chart. And you can even just replace the damage roll with a fixed number the &quot;DB&quot; has to save time. <br>Building humans somehow got more complex, having 2 different types of feat to spend.
