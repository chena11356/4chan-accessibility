GM Sadler was in the chat and was wondering the same thing because Komodo started very strong, he said he will have to look into this. It&#039;s also interesting to note that in the boomakers battle Jeroen has 2 Komodo opening wins and 11 Lc0 ones while Sadler has 5 Komodo wins and 7 Lc0 ones. Sadler said that he worked quite a bit on Komodo versus Stockfish matchups so maybe that&#039;s why there seems to be a bias in favour of Komodo in his openings.

The doubling cube is not a die to be rolled, but rather a marker, with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 inscribed on its sides to denote the current stake. At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the midpoint of the bar with the number 64 showing; the cube is then said to be &quot;centered, on 1&quot;.

Their opponent must either accept (&quot;take&quot;) the doubled stakes or resign (&quot;drop&quot;) the game immediately.<br><br>Whenever a player accepts doubled stakes, the cube is placed on their side of the board with the corresponding power of two facing upward, to indicate that the right to redouble, which is to offer to continue doubling the stakes, belongs exclusively to that player. If the opponent drops the doubled stakes, they lose the game at the current value of the doubling cube. For instance, if the cube showed the number 2 and a player wanted to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would lose two, or twice the original stake.&quot;<br><br>I think this is awesome, but what does the brain trust at /tg/ think?

Because of digimons weird timing when Argo taps every tamer at once it only creates 1 trigger. So if you have a card with neodevimon under one of your digimon it sees 1 trigger tap all the tamers and only gains the 1 memory for that trigger activating. <br><br>Digimon has weird rules, like when it says up to x, it means 1-X not 0-X. <br><br>Digimon ethics question time thread.<br><br>Your opponents playing 4 of the same eggs.

It wants to appeal to the tactical combat crowd but only does this through class-locked abilities while leaving default combat with the depth of a puddle.<br>The only real appeal is that it meets all those crowds halfway, so a disparate group of OSR, Pathfinder, and 4e fans can accept playing it as a group together, as long as the DM doesn&#039;t end up burning out because the game provides no tools to handle all three of those players&#039; preferences without delving into guides written online.<br>WotC also has quite a lot of disdain for their fans. I&#039;m still salty about how they promised race creation rules in the DMG then went &quot;just reflavor it.&quot; in the actual guide.

Various competing smaller governments reside in small planets and moons orbiting the further-out binary stars. Many of the factions came about from the various families and departments that were on the generation ship. One of the larger powers is the former science division of the generation ship.
