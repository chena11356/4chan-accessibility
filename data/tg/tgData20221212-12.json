The analysis of design patterns individually I found more lacking, because it&#039;s hard to list the benefits and problems with any particular mechanic in relative isolation while accounting for differing player preferences. Rolled stats, for example, are discussed as being speedy and less likely to lead to convergent character builds, but also potentially unbalanced. Which doesn&#039;t really account for differing player philosophies like &quot;I come to the table with a character concept in my head&quot; vs &quot;I like adapting to whatever surprise I get&quot;. Or that the degree to which stats affect balance is contingent upon how much a game champions character skill vs player skill.

I&#039;ve been working on a game called COGS over the past couple of years (a small number of people may even already know of it from a few threads I&#039;ve posted it in). Yesterday, I launched a Kickstarter for it at https://www.kickstarter.com/project<wbr>s/scribblegs/cogs-expanded-edition to fund a physical release filled with artwork and more supplemental material. It&#039;s got a small goal compared to some projects I&#039;ve seen for FUCKING 5E SUPPLEMENTS, and a good chunk of the funding will probably go toward shipping and printing costs before anything else.

Unfortunately, the text is still choppy at times since I&#039;m a single amateur writer with no editor. However, the plan for the free versions, whether the Kickstarter succeeds or fails, is to update them to match the expanded edition and make them entirely free (not PWYW). They would become the &quot;basic&quot; game version, with no artwork and little supplemental content (like character creation tips, example content, or establishing expected power levels). However, it would still feature what rules and extra content they already have (which is already enough to play a game).<br><br>1/2", "filename": "COGS Logo Expanded Placeholder", "ext": ".png", "w": 1400, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 142, "tim": 1670411352435259, "time": 1670411352, "md5": "CchfCNP0zd5dTEvixMu2KA==", "fsize": 272802, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cogs", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 64, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 59, "omitted_images": 7, "last_replies": [{"no": 87003871, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)23:23:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p86955816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86955816</a><br>Congrats anon", "time": 1670819038, "resto": 86955816}, {"no": 87003876, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)23:24:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p87003810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;87003810</a><br><br>But not every larper, casual roleplayer, nor their dog can make a good rpg.", "time": 1670819072, "resto": 86955816}, {"no": 87004494, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)00:44:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p87003810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;87003810</a><br>Thanks anon.

As winds blew across the &quot;Mediterranean Sink&quot;, they would heat or cool adiabatically with altitude. In the empty Mediterranean Basin, the summertime temperatures would probably have been extremely high. As a first approximation, using the dry adiabatic lapse rate of around 10\u00b0C (18\u00b0F) per kilometer, the maximum possible temperature of an area 4km (2.5mi) below sea level would be about 40\u00b0C (72\u00b0F) warmer than it would be at sea level. Under this extreme assumption, maxima would be near 80\u00b0C (176\u00b0F) at the lowest points of the dry abyssal plain, permitting no permanent life but extremophiles. Further, the altitude 3\u20135km (2\u20133mi) below sea level would result in 1.45 to 1.71 atm (1102 to 1300 mmHg) air pressure, further increasing heat stress.</span>", "time": 1670843510, "resto": 86979344}], "last_modified": 1670843510}, {"no": 87003602, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)22:50:52", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/chess/ - chess general", "com": "fighting edition<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free online play:</span><br>https://lichess.org<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free online chess variants:</span><br>https://www.pychess.org<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Guess the opening sequence:</span><br>https://jackli.gg/chessle<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Guess the puzzle sequence:</span><br>https://playboardle.com<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chess links, tools and books:</span><br>https://pastebin.com/sSWtAXgw<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Join our teams:</span><br>https://lichess.org/team/vietnamese<wbr>-basket-weaving-forum<br>https://www.chess.com/club/4chan-ch<wbr>ess-club<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Previous threads:</span><br>https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/searc<wbr>h/text/chess/type/op<br><a href=\"/tg/thread/86980856#p86980856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86980856</a>", "filename": "women chess boxing", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 991, "h": 664, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 167, "tim": 1670817052726318, "time": 1670817052, "md5": "aWQLm17ttAyI/uzkE3lK7A==", "fsize": 152683, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chess-chess-general", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 71, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 66, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 87005488, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)04:17:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lol", "filename": "terrible", "ext": ".png", "w": 1025, "h": 129, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 15, "tim": 1670836679014047, "time": 1670836679, "md5": "0t5Eaibn46XcyURGmPqdXA==", "fsize": 39082, "resto": 87003602}, {"no": 87005502, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)04:20:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p87005488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;87005488</a><br>When he&#039;s not streaming and whining about politics, Ben is hilarious.", "time": 1670836837, "resto": 87003602}, {"no": 87005609, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)04:47:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p87005488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;87005488</a><br>kek", "time": 1670838450, "resto": 87003602}, {"no": 87005898, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:04:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there a person with a bigger case of Stockfish worship than GothamChess?", "time": 1670843097, "resto": 87003602}, {"no": 87005932, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p87005898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;87005898</a><br>Matthew Sadler", "time": 1670843503, "resto": 87003602}], "last_modified": 1670843503}, {"no": 87005657, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)04:58:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "First game of Vampire the Masquerade this week, what am I in for?", "filename": "Vampmasq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 220, "h": 293, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670839114774106, "time": 1670839114, "md5": "axhWawLjEBAnBwlBhlz5DA==", "fsize": 33362, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "first-game-of-vampire-the-masquerade-this-week", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 7, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 2, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 87005679, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)05:04:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p87005673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;87005673</a><br>I picked Nosferatu because they&#039;re cool and I like the movie", "time": 1670839467, "resto": 87005657}, {"no": 87005737, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)05:22:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hopefully cringe kino.<br>Shadow the hedgehog tier dialogue is a must.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the weather outside is cold, just like me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I only worship one god, myself</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no I don\u2019t want reconstructive surgery, I am my scars</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beware of dog huh?

Thanks for reiterating my point.<br><br>The only &quot;Android&quot; part of Netrunner is the actual Lore. Netrunner as a term is R. Tal. The *GAME DESIGN* is fully Wizards. The only thing FFG did with the design is introduce Identities to the game design, remove BP as a losing condition and change the trading-card design of the game to their &quot;Living Card Game&quot; design. Everything else is Richard Garfield&#039;s initial game design of Netrunner.<br><br>Wizards can take NISEI to Court over using their game design. The thing is: Will they? Wizards didn&#039;t care about people doing DnD stuff, for instance, until nu-TSR was taken to court by them, for instance, due to objectionable content (to Wizards eyes).<br><br>NISEI could be taken to court due to using Wizards game design. However, the legal case would fall under OGL licensing (even though Netrunner hasn&#039;t been OGL&#039;d like 3.5 DnD/d20 has been to where Pathfinder is pseudo-3.75 for d20).<br><br>NISEI would have to literally change up a lot of the game to not have a case of 1:1 given FFG had to even LICENSE the game design in the first place for legal reasons.<br><br><a href=\"#p87002097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;87002097</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non-profit doesn&#039;t mean selling things at cost.</span><br>Yes.

You don&#039;t want to bore and/or provoke your other players with the NPC romance either and the solution to both is to make it good and brief. Create a romantic situation with the NPC that makes this girl melt - one that is also something she can see you in with her - then end that scene and move straight on to fighting goblins or whatever.<br><br>This is the grandmaster 3D chess move because you win in almost every way that it can go. If she doesn&#039;t feel it, no problem you&#039;re moving right on with the campaign as usual. Maybe it&#039;ll land some other session. If she DOES feel it, shell have her character seek out more of it and then SHE&#039;S the one risking being &quot;cringe&quot;.

It also manages to do stuff like make niche skills useful pretty consistently, Sorcery is great even if you don&#039;t ever want to learn a spell. With every Skill also having a talent tree you can not only specialise in a Skill and become incredibly potent with it, you can also use it for wildly different things from someone else. Sorcery, again, can be used to grant some powerful magic but also make you a witch hunter. Highly recommend it<br><br>The sticking point for some people is that it&#039;s heavy on meta-currencies. Two major types, Momentum and Doom. The former is accrued on excess successes, and spent on a bunch of beneficial effects. You can choose to spend them when you get them, or bank them in a group pool to help the rest of the group. Doom is essentially Momentum for the GM and they use it to do similar thing for enemies as well as create all sorts of hazards and obstacles for the group. Players can also give the GM doom instead of spending Momentum in some scenarios, which is a nice kind of Faustian deal. It&#039;s a great system over all but can take a bit of time to get used to, and remember some of the stuff you can use it for.

Now I&#039;m not so sure.<br>The biggest advantage of pf1 is that everything is *legally* available for free on the player side.<br>The bestiaries are also pretty great,and it has many, but monster stats area bit better than for 3.5, except for dragons where they lied about their CR in 3.5 to artificially make fights with dragons tougher than their CR would suggest.<br>The rest is kindof a mixed bag sidegrade from 3.5. Some good ideas, some bad implementations, planning characters is more of a slog than 3.5 because more feats with prereqs to plan around (and they didnt simplify the prereqs), they had a company policy about there being no balance floor only a balance ceiling, and only playtesting a small subset of published material (yes really), so in with what&#039;s good is a ton of abysmally designed, useless options with pretty art that you need to be good enough at the game to know to avoid (or rely on online builds like MMO players do). They also nerfed several3.5 feats that didn&#039;t need nerfing.<br>And one of the biggest rule overhauls: The unified combat maneuver check - the math doesnt scale properly if youre using monsters, only if you stick to npcs, because as you level up more and more of the monsters you fight will be: giant, many legged, legless, flying, or several of the above, which just puts them way ahead of the curve for their CR.<br>And bonuses to stuff from classes scales slightly faster in pf1 in general, so it&#039;s not trivial to just allow players to grab PF1 stuff in a 3.5 game if they want it without allowing some characters to just be better if theyre willing to jump through the extra pf1 hoops.<br>Now I think I&#039;m better off starting with the 3.5 phb and selectively importing good pieces of pf1 design. I&#039;m not sure whether I would include all of 3.5 either anymore.<br><br>Ill address your other posts separately.

I don&#039;t need to powertrip and it&#039;s a system I can easily get the group to handle the majority of rulings by the book without my fiat, making consistent rulings, which is my preferred playstyle, I like more detailed rules that are not full of contradictions that I can use for running sandbox campaigns, and I like making the players handle most rulings so I can focus on running the game.

The gist of it is that the setting has the classical four elements, along with Quintessence and Void, each of which is embodied by one of the main six deities. <br><br>The Quintessence and Void deities are at the top of the pantheon. The former embodies the creative forces of the universe and chaotically crafts random items and concepts like an author that scribbles down any idea that pops into their head in a burst of light. The latter is like their editor, bringing organization to what they make and winnowing down the mistakes that would hurt the story (the world at large), consigning them to darkness and oblivion, though some mistakes occasionally slip through regardless.<br><br>Do you have any suggestions for how I could handle the magic for each god, especially for Quintessence and Void? I want to avoid just having it boil down to creating things out of nothing and reducing them &#039;to&#039; nothing, respectively.<br><br>As for the races of the setting, each one would have been made by two of the gods working in concert from a base template they all helped make, so they&#039;re primarily aligned with 2 elements but can tap into the magic for the others with practice. The idea is that humans would be the race made by Quintessence and Aether in tandem, explaining the contradictions in our nature. Dwarves would be the Earth+Fire race, though I was worried it might be a bit too obvious, and an anon suggested Earth+Air for Elves, but I still need several more races at least, what other combinations can you think of? I was considering Dragons for one of the Fire races, but I&#039;m leaning more towards them being some of the more common &quot;mistakes&quot; I mentioned. Oh, almost forgot, I want to include angels for each god, but I want them to be distinct from just being elementals, and I&#039;m a bit stuck on how to do that ATM.

But they are autism. If you can learn one AND convince (~4) people to play it, you literally need nothing else. No one wants to play these unless they GM\u2014 and only certain types of GMs at that. My old HERO table was straight up GMs, which was a ridiculous stroke of luck.

These look like autism, but it is condensed into a single chart. You will use it for every-fucking-thing. Transplanting these is heavy lifting, I wouldn\u2019t bother. Play RAW, or not at all.<br><br>M&amp;M is the go-to for high-powered d20. The internal system isn\u2019t near as complex as the 3d6 games mentioned, but it is finicky. For some reason that makes it worse, idk why. Status conditions might throw you off. Bizarrely, basic stats are redundant compared to powers. Powers are almost always the better deal. If you don\u2019t want to run it, you can steal the Measurements Scale and slam it into the d20 system of your choice.<br><br>Cortex/MHR covers ~ the same absolute range as M&amp;M, but there\u2019s even less finicky rules. Die stepping for everything.<br><br>There are tons of die-pool games that meet the criteria. D6-types mostly, but there\u2019s a CoD d10 I\u2019ve never run/played.

The two driving factors for Skaven is hunger and warpstone. <br><br>Warpstone is dangerous destructive stuff and mutative and deadly to those not touched by the ruinous powers. While all the lore keeps saying things like &quot;perhaps&quot; and &quot;could be&quot; when talking about the link, it&#039;s pretty obvious that GW is just being coy. Skaven are born of the ruinous powers and crave it like drug addicts. In theory I think you could ween them off of it in an environment of absolute detox away from chaos with a long road of a behavioural breeding program since we can say freaks among them are able to show faint glimmers of moral virtue like Queek or the adviser rat from TW2. <br> <br>From there even if you manage to pull it off you&#039;d have an entire race of essentially AA members about Chaos with the emotional outlook of a dog since anything other then being a sniveling lovey dovey sap gets their ass killed for generations.<br><br>But more importantly than that is their hunger. Skaven cities have two sizes: Empty and Overpopulated. The little buggers breed so quickly that they invariably overload the local area&#039;s food production. Even when you &#039;clean up&#039; the species and make females be something other than coked up baby factories, you&#039;re still having litters of a dozen or so per female per year. That&#039;s explosive growth.<br><br>So if you were to have &quot;Good&quot; Skaven, they would need really, really strict discipline among their ranks to keep these two downsides in check.

the demon lord of the undead. They alone have the secret of the ritual of lich creation. You&#039;re going to bargain for this knowledge, and what they will want is going to require evil of a heinous nature.<br>Once you learn the ritual, the ritual itself will require acts of barbarism and evil to procure ingredients and to fuel the magics.<br>Once you&#039;ve bargained your soul to a hideous monstrosity of undeath (sold your soul to the devil), killed at least one innocent for their heart (murder, [Van Richtens Guide to the Undead]), brewed a poisonous potion and then consumed it (cannibalism, heart of innocent is ingredient), and succeeded on making it to undeath, you are a horrifying evil monster but you&#039;re immortal so long as you regularly consume souls (an utterly evil act no matter whose soul is consumed and thus destroyed). There&#039;s also the construction of the phylactery, an expensive magical item encrusted in jewels and fine metals holding the special magical scripts that will bind your soul.<br><br><a href=\"#p86995792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;86995792</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First we have to define lichdom.</span><br>There are two definitions, the modern pop culture one being an undead spellcaster who has undergone a vile ritual of undeath, who has placed their soul inside a magical container to power their eternal unlife. Its the basic definition, from their creation in D&amp;D as a monster. The second is the Old English definition which is still present in many places in England, being a word for a corpse.
