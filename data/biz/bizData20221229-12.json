Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since. They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH.

He made six figures or so from kickboxing. Basically relatively unknown promotors. He was never in K1 or Glory. He used that capital to move to eastern europe shitholes, seduce hot girls and run cam businesses for them. Later he switched to exclusive onlyfans management. Basically e-pimping and being the English proxy for eastern europeans who can&#039;t speak English. Back in the day, Kickboxing in Europe was basically an outlet for mobs and maffia and shady money. That&#039;s how he got his connections to wealthy people and capital. He did some security for those people because he actually can kick your average joe&#039;s asa. He&#039;s amazing at selling and capturing attention. Got several investments in Dubai basically before Dubai became what it is now. Look up real estate prices to see what they did the last decade or so.<br><br>He got into his first casino and snowballed it from there. Lots of money laundering via those casinos.<br><br>He was always into courses and selling them. The prices you see listed for the courses are just the beginning. The people gullible enough to get in get re-targeted for extra courses, private groups and titles and what not. He also has some &quot;&quot;&quot;exclusive&quot;&quot;&quot; groups with low 4 figure entries. With his reach and amount of people &quot;believing&quot; what he has to say, he&#039;s easily netting a few million in recurring course revenue.<br><br>That plus all his investments, puts him somewhere in the 8 to maybe 9 figures. Most of his cars are leased or rentals. He has maybe a few cars he outright owns (like the bugatti), rest is just show.

Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since. They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH. They fud because muddying the waters about Chainlink lets them shill themselves, it doesn&#039;t go much deeper than that.<br><br>4) The seriously mentally ill, like Michael, who also fits in category 2) but has now made a large part of his online identity &quot;being a link fudder&quot; and can&#039;t really distance themselves from that because it&#039;s the only way they can consistently get attention online, which they crave", "time": 1672316128, "resto": 53057414, "id": "9VNlaDej"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53057441, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)06:31:37", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Is daytrading crypto worth it?", "com": "Is anyone actually making money daytrading crypto?

I know that many of you are weary, or depressed, or upset about how LINK has behaved. But I tell you dear anons - I have bought into LINK not because I want to make money, but so I could baghold a selected favored coin of this board so I can be here with you. But if I am to buy in only to participate, this is not enough! In 2023 and 2024 you must create new palatable ideas for the next wave and discard the anger, discard the uncertainty, discard the fud. At this point anons will only hold themselves back. Zoomers are an optimistic generation, like nothing that has come before us now. They are willing to tackle the world even though the previous have made a serious mess of things. They are more patient, less lead poisoned, and kinder than any of us before them. Let them lead by example, and let us make marketing geared towards their collective philosophy.<br><br>Below this post I want you to write what you will do for LINK and how you will help fulfill the anonymous prophecies anons before you created! I will start:<br><br>I pledge to create an animated series to support anons on /biz/. The show will be quality, funny, but most importantly, informative, so that viewers can enjoy an actually good cartoon that /co/ would respect, and also because they learn about systems in crypto, and how LINK is good.

Society is being pushed to adopt hyper self aware positions as a way to cope with impending doom. It&#039;s both artificial strategy promoted by our authorities, but also organic because it actually feels good to feel smug and superior to others as an individual. Further with what you say, <a href=\"#p53045925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53045925</a>, the only reason they adopt those policies is because they are empathetic and compassionate, yet have no examples to be that way towards Whites and European identities due to an artificial response from the media. Might you give them examples then, to be kind towards, instead of lashing out? How do you expect to correct this or at least even it out if you do not firstly try to begin with? The problem is White people are not utilizing their endowed empathy, something they are very good at. You&#039;ve allowed your controllers and masters to twist you into an angry pretzel, so now that you see zoomers acting certain ways, you think it&#039;s pointless.<br><br>Everything starts atomized with the individual. You buy crypto, some of the most decentralized finance out there. Why not adopt the same mindset that you really can make a difference? Because they have made you insincere and not honest. Come back, White man. And as for <a href=\"#p53045870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53045870</a>, yes it&#039;s true, globally we are regressing regardless of race and identity due to some kind of reverse Flynn effect. Monogamy has become archaic to many individuals out there, leading to degeneracy, leading to a breaking down of tradition and honor and love. But I ask you: Why accept the predetermined outcomes of what the masters want for you? Why not attempt to forge a way forward for the lost to follow? Zoomers are not stupid, but their children and childrens children will be if we, the protectors, the providers, the matured, do not try and stop it. Regardless of what you look like or who you are, it is a good thing to try and build people up, not tear them down.", "time": 1672246052, "resto": 53045309, "id": "Go500RXk"}, {"no": 53046100, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)11:50:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53045309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53045309</a><br>Am I still a &quot;LINKIE&quot; if I only bought 50 coins back in 2020?", "time": 1672246228, "resto": 53045309, "id": "jmQPQ4xp"}, {"no": 53046109, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)11:51:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53046069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53046069</a><br>The point is that collectively we can build to something better than this incessant fud on this board.

Notice how I use no trip, I use no indicator to who I am, and until now, there have been no threads seeking attention.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1640435575462", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4572, "h": 4040, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1671853920036373, "time": 1671853920, "md5": "JMG275ZjGKZZeCWMkkVD4Q==", "fsize": 3937075, "resto": 0, "id": "1U+pzxG9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 265, "images": 95, "unique_ips": 98}, {"no": 52999287, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:53:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52942053#p52942053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52942053</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671854022165243, "time": 1671854022, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671854353882828, "time": 1671854353, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999336, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brainlet here, is there a way to swap monero for bitcoin or vice versa, <br>pls dont laugh ):", "time": 1671854363, "resto": 52999274, "id": "Sjyu/3Jr"}, {"no": 52999339, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Case and point, the top are literally running on GPUs.<br>For data centers, a similar thing occurs. Take a look at AWS&#039;s instances and plans, and you can see that they are custom tailed towards a specific need, like loading handling, rendering, simulations, fast/slow data storage, databases, etc. So a generic algorithm like randomX, that uses various aspects of a customer grade CPU, will run sub-optimal on all of them.<br>Additionally, data centers are used for everything, so asking them to turn it off, while possible is extremely costly. You would be asking them to turn of essential infrastructure for the backbones of the internet, that comes with a huge price tag. And you can count in the fact that data centers don&#039;t utilize 100% CPU, cooling and electricity issues.

Add 4GB DDR4 RAM to each, plus a PSU, plus a motherboard, plus all that is required to cool such a behemoth. And you can easily go over 1 billion USD to attack a small drug dealer&#039;s currency still in its early days.<br>And yes you can try to make a custom CPU just for randomX, but it&#039;ll essentially be the same as modern AMD CPU, with some overhead.

Where did you pull $79m - $100m per DAY? Does that mean Monero&#039;s doing $36.5 TRILLION annual volume? That kind of volume translates to $4m daily volume, but that very well be bellow $1m due to paper monero. Now as you said DNMs&#039; retail volume is on the lower end on the spectrum between 1-2b USD. But especially with Monero getting adoption, there is no way to tell.<br><br>Now assuming Binance and their partners(tm) operate on full reserves and do not sell paper monero that pump up the trading volumes. That still means that DNMs are a large portion of complete volume Monero is making. Adding in however much millions from CoinCards and other retail, Monero might as well be the only not mini-cap cryptocurrency where trading is not the dominant force of its volume. Adding in the fact that most centralized exchanges do sell paper monero and are running on fractional reserves. Monero IS the only not mini-cap cryptocurrecny where trading is not not the dominant force of its volume.<br><br>You made a case for Monero, not against I&#039;m afraid. But even comparing off-chain exchange volumes and assumed on-chain transactional volumes is kind of a stretch. If all CEXes just delist Monero both the supply and the demand they provided to the equation go away. That is why exchanges delisting Monero doesn&#039;t send the price straight down, rather the news makes the investors scared -&gt; the CEX&#039;s supply is met with a falling demand. The on and off ramps are here (https://trocador.app and LM are two examples) so the only meaningful difference for the price would be in volumes. volatility, and buy/sell walls.<br><br>Also picrel is in response to Monero being correlated with other cryptos.

The rest of the world will be stuck with a custodial solution like paypal. They\u2019ll get money taken out of their account for \u201cspreading misinformation.\u201d<br>The btc maximalist response to this is muh lightning network. But it cannot scale, for two reasons. First, because it depends on btc blockchain transactions, and those are extremely scarce. The waiting list to get your channel-opening transaction included in a block will be decades long. But even assuming that were surmountable, the lightning network also can\u2019t scale because of routing. The only way to send a transaction to someone you don\u2019t have a channel with is to have a map of the entire network so you can find a path through other channels to them. This means your little smartphone would need to keep a map of billions of nodes with tens of billions of channels open between them and keep an updated account of the balance in every single channel, which gets updated a million times a second. In the same way an ordinary user can\u2019t run a btc node if the block size is too large, an ordinary user can\u2019t run a lightning node if the lightning network is too large.<br>This won\u2019t kill btc.

The features don\u2019t matter. Gold became the global reserve currency even though it didn\u2019t have the best chemical or metallic properties. When people created steel it didn\u2019t become the global reserve currency, despite how useful it was and all the features it has that gold didn\u2019t have. Gold was better money than steel, even though steel was a better metal than gold. This is because gold was more scarce. When people say \u201chard money\u201d they mean difficult to make. The opposite of hard money is easy money. Every cryptocurrency is easy money. Anyone can make their own coin with features btc doesn\u2019t have, like anonymity or smart contracts or faster transactions. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Those other coins might be better code but they aren\u2019t harder money, because someone could come along tomorrow and make an even more anonymous, or even faster coin.

There will be an infinite number of cryptocurrencies, but only 21 million btc. Unless that changes, it will remain the hardest money for no other reason than because it is the first, and everything else is easy, inflationary money. They could even change the code to make it slower than it is now and it would still be the hardest money.

I just recently got an old PC, so I&#039;ve decided to start making YouTube videos. I&#039;m going to make multiple channels. Some channels I&#039;m going to make videos I enjoy. Others, I&#039;m going to try and ride the algorithmic wave. Something I&#039;ve noticed since I started looking at shorts is that they are really amplifying people making shorts for the first time. I&#039;m constantly getting videos made by children filming literally nothing in their bedroom that are 12 seconds long and have 1-2 likes and no comments. So I think they automatically boost your first few shorts in order to get you a bunch of views and hopefully get you a viral video in order to encourage you to keep making them. I have a few questions.<br><br>All I have is Windows Movie Maker. Can I really make decent videos with that, or is there a free editing program I can use?<br><br>Does YouTube or TikTok have a built in editor? Because I notice with TikTok especially all of the videos have the same kind of editing and effects, and most of these people look too dumb to take a vid on their phone, put it on their PC, edit it there, and then upload it. I presume most don&#039;t even have PCs.<br><br>This one is important. How do yu get clips from other videos without having to download the entire thing? Is there some free screen capture/recording software that also records audio that you could use?

As a result, we had to ask our Crew Schedulers to do this manually, and it&#039;s extraordinarily difficult. They must verify that you are legal. They can&#039;t just have the next person up, so to speak. They have to look through everyone&#039;s board and reassign. So that is a tedious, long process.

By Xmas evening the CS department had essentially reached the inability to do anything but simple, one off assignments. And to make matters worse, the phone system was updated not too long ago and it was not working well.

Be wary of routes that &quot;require a PhD&quot; reason being is if you&#039;re not even in collegr yet you dont fathom what a PhD entails. It it not simply taking more classes. It is a sacrifice of life to create something new and becomes your worth. Its not something you do with the forethought being &quot;oh imma just do it to get a job doing X.&quot; As well, for the case of engineering/hard sciences, Phds are typically paid for fully by the university/department with the MS included and you get a small salary of 1500-2k per month to be a TA/grader. If its not fully funded you are being scammed. So maybe if that is something that interests you, something like neuroscience/pharmacology would be better and then specializing in graduate studies. Never pay for a phd, it is unironically the most cuck move anyone can make in academia, it means the admissions staff are kikes and took you for a fool with no capacities in life.", "time": 1672295974, "resto": 53055128, "id": "7gBu7K8j"}, {"no": 53056205, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:46:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53055596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53055596</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how are your excel skills?</span><br>I&#039;ve never used excel<br><br><a href=\"#p53055720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53055720</a><br>Thank you for this advice, I&#039;ll look into neuroscience/pharmacology, have a great rest", "time": 1672299971, "resto": 53055128, "id": "KQj1lnaK"}, {"no": 53056828, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:36:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do HR, it\u2019s fucking easy<br>If you have a law degree and can write contracts, policies etc you will be instantly top 10% of earners in the field too", "time": 1672306572, "resto": 53055128, "id": "kRRny7XE"}, {"no": 53057054, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:18:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53055128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53055128</a><br>Do Gender Studies degree.

Trade dates also govern in determining whether your holding period is short-term or long-term, in determining whether the wash sale rule applies, and in determining whether you have a qualified dividend.<br><br>Exceptions<br>You should be aware of a couple of exceptions:<br><br>When you close a short sale at a loss, the tax law treats the transaction as occurring on the settlement date. See Last Day to Sell.<br>If you hold more than one lot of shares and sell part of your holdings, you may want to identify the shares you\u2019re selling. You can identify shares (or change your identification) until the settlement date.

I try to take friends there sometimes because it feels like it would be a fun mix between in person hanging out and digital hanging out. I think I would interact with the LAN cafe in my area more if it had more events that let me meet people, like if it had teams you could join through the cafe and tournaments. Really ideally a LAN cafe I would go to is one that communicates well to me what social events are going on and can assure me I will show up and have a good time and meet new people. I went to a third party tournament one time they hosted for Dota and it was fun as fuck. I also like that they stock drinks and snacks and let me eat at the PC. <br>Anyway yes, I can confirm if you can make it work there\u2019s definitely business to be had catering more towards zoomer socialization. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s enough business since most zoomers I know are poor as fuck, but there is business.
