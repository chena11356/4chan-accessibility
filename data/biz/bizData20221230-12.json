Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since.

I know that many of you are weary, or depressed, or upset about how LINK has behaved. But I tell you dear anons - I have bought into LINK not because I want to make money, but so I could baghold a selected favored coin of this board so I can be here with you. But if I am to buy in only to participate, this is not enough! In 2023 and 2024 you must create new palatable ideas for the next wave and discard the anger, discard the uncertainty, discard the fud. At this point anons will only hold themselves back. Zoomers are an optimistic generation, like nothing that has come before us now. They are willing to tackle the world even though the previous have made a serious mess of things. They are more patient, less lead poisoned, and kinder than any of us before them. Let them lead by example, and let us make marketing geared towards their collective philosophy.<br><br>Below this post I want you to write what you will do for LINK and how you will help fulfill the anonymous prophecies anons before you created! I will start:<br><br>I pledge to create an animated series to support anons on /biz/. The show will be quality, funny, but most importantly, informative, so that viewers can enjoy an actually good cartoon that /co/ would respect, and also because they learn about systems in crypto, and how LINK is good.

Society is being pushed to adopt hyper self aware positions as a way to cope with impending doom. It&#039;s both artificial strategy promoted by our authorities, but also organic because it actually feels good to feel smug and superior to others as an individual. Further with what you say, <a href=\"#p53045925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53045925</a>, the only reason they adopt those policies is because they are empathetic and compassionate, yet have no examples to be that way towards Whites and European identities due to an artificial response from the media. Might you give them examples then, to be kind towards, instead of lashing out? How do you expect to correct this or at least even it out if you do not firstly try to begin with? The problem is White people are not utilizing their endowed empathy, something they are very good at. You&#039;ve allowed your controllers and masters to twist you into an angry pretzel, so now that you see zoomers acting certain ways, you think it&#039;s pointless.<br><br>Everything starts atomized with the individual.

Monogamy has become archaic to many individuals out there, leading to degeneracy, leading to a breaking down of tradition and honor and love. But I ask you: Why accept the predetermined outcomes of what the masters want for you? Why not attempt to forge a way forward for the lost to follow?

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "PimpHand", "ext": ".png", "w": 961, "h": 999, "tn_w": 240, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672398550412929, "time": 1672398550, "md5": "wjrnsq7UPwnatHvBo8meng==", "fsize": 798594, "resto": 0, "id": "3CYHBxFm", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 9, "images": 8, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 53070970, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:10:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52999274#p52999274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999274</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672398647970535, "time": 1672398647, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53070979, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672398907889153, "time": 1672398907, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53071009, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:16:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since. They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH.

Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since. They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH. They fud because muddying the waters about Chainlink lets them shill themselves, it doesn&#039;t go much deeper than that.<br><br>4) The seriously mentally ill, like Michael, who also fits in category 2) but has now made a large part of his online identity &quot;being a link fudder&quot; and can&#039;t really distance themselves from that because it&#039;s the only way they can consistently get attention online, which they crave.", "time": 1672401193, "resto": 53071167, "id": "8tJd3v2R"}, {"no": 53071307, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)07:07:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53071179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53071179</a><br>This is what I\u2019m talking about <br><br>Literal pea brained niggers who think they\u2019re smart, no wonder devs end up being greedy fucks that dump on bagholders.

There were enough Millennials to completely topple the system, and 2008 was a MASSIVE gambit, because even though it robbed many of a decent start in their careers, it did so in a way that left a highly educated cohort with no attachment to or sympathy for the status quo. They had to fight to co-opt OWS, BLM, GG, etc., and they had to take so much damage to get it done.

Holding price at or above \u20ac0.92 for a while means nothing, whereas holding price at or above \u20ac1 makes it likely that that price will act as a de facto floor and that prices will accelerate upwards under any future bullish sentiment. Kevin has talked about this a few times on tg and AMAs.<br><br>You can see this theory behind the \u20ac0.60 floor. It&#039;s 5X the previous floor, is a nice round number, price has bounced around there a few times, narratively aligns XCM market cap with Coinmetro&#039;s nominal valuation, etc. I know there are other explanations for the price floor floating around- but either Kevin has explicitly denied them (he could be lying ofc, but entertaining that idea basically calls the entire point of CM into doubt, in which case marketing should be the last of anyone&#039;s concerns...), or they flat out don&#039;t make any sense (e.g. the XCM to equity swap at 60c was done *before* the price floor).<br><br>1/2", "filename": "1672260055030340", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 775, "h": 581, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672320820943460, "time": 1672320820, "md5": "PN+FJ6tEwz5CiRd/qXdnCQ==", "fsize": 56807, "resto": 53057439, "id": "hKYDC69o"}, {"no": 53058305, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)08:36:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53058276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53058276</a><br>How does this all tie together?

The first two times he does this (conservatively) it seems to work. <br><br>During a period of general good news and progress for Coinmetro, XCM price powers past \u20ac0.60 but begins falling back as the general outlook for crypto turns (it seemed at the time) short-term bearish. Rather than see XCM sink towards it&#039;s previous sticky price (whatever that is: 12c, perhaps 20c) and then have XCM spend months trying to get back to the 60c range- and struggle to be further bullish, since it will have already 3-5Xed at that point- Kevin decides to use a sell wall at 60c. This will then reinforce 60c XCM in everyone&#039;s mind, and help eventually make 60c XCM seem &#039;normal&#039;. As soon as the short bear is over, XCM will launch from 60c. This would have been massively beneficial for XCM holders, but not really beneficial to Coinmetro at all. If you accept that Kevin isn&#039;t currently selling his XCM, it&#039;s a benevolent move to help the XCM &#039;community&#039;. <br><br>Of course, crypto actually blows the fuck up, liquidity evaporates, and XCM holders (perhaps remembering that CM previously bought \u20ac1M of XCM and also apparently believing that Kevin could persuade a wealthy Arab to buy millions of dollars worth of an unknown crypto token) decide that their best hope is to relentlessly fud Coinmetro and act like cunts to every member of the staff until Kevin relents and magically conjures up the money to buy their bags from them at 60c. This massively damages any possibility of organic growth (which was already unlikely in a bear market), further reinforcing XCM illiquidity.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1640435575462", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4572, "h": 4040, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1671853920036373, "time": 1671853920, "md5": "JMG275ZjGKZZeCWMkkVD4Q==", "fsize": 3937075, "resto": 0, "id": "1U+pzxG9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 305, "images": 102, "unique_ips": 113}, {"no": 52999287, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:53:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52942053#p52942053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52942053</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671854022165243, "time": 1671854022, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671854353882828, "time": 1671854353, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999336, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brainlet here, is there a way to swap monero for bitcoin or vice versa, <br>pls dont laugh ):", "time": 1671854363, "resto": 52999274, "id": "Sjyu/3Jr"}, {"no": 52999339, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

So here is one a bit more condensed down.<br><br>Supercomputers cannot run randomX as they are extremely specialized towards one task, and might not even have the hardware to preform some of the operations needed. Case and point, the top are literally running on GPUs.<br>For data centers, a similar thing occurs. Take a look at AWS&#039;s instances and plans, and you can see that they are custom tailed towards a specific need, like loading handling, rendering, simulations, fast/slow data storage, databases, etc. So a generic algorithm like randomX, that uses various aspects of a customer grade CPU, will run sub-optimal on all of them.<br>Additionally, data centers are used for everything, so asking them to turn it off, while possible is extremely costly. You would be asking them to turn of essential infrastructure for the backbones of the internet, that comes with a huge price tag. And you can count in the fact that data centers don&#039;t utilize 100% CPU, cooling and electricity issues. And overall it does not make sense to use them on a large scale.<br><a href=\"#p53010310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53010310</a><br>I&#039;m too bored to do the napkin math again, but iirc it would cost $400 million just in the cost of CPUs to get the power required for te 51%. Add 4GB DDR4 RAM to each, plus a PSU, plus a motherboard, plus all that is required to cool such a behemoth. And you can easily go over 1 billion USD to attack a small drug dealer&#039;s currency still in its early days.<br>And yes you can try to make a custom CPU just for randomX, but it&#039;ll essentially be the same as modern AMD CPU, with some overhead.

Unfortunately, perhaps 98% of crypto&#039;s value rests in the fact that people want to trade U.S. dollars for it. When it becomes a crime to do so the value will plummet and perhaps return to 2012 levels. It&#039;s a speculative asset and not a medium of exchange. American speculators drive the market and hold the bags, and not one of them wants to be caught with a federal indictment. <br><br>What is Monero actually used for, beyond speculative dollar transactions by retail investors? Dark web marketplaces? And these transactions might only compose 0.1 \u2014 0.15% of the current demand. So the current &#039;stellar&#039; valuation is sitting upon a toothpick, the &#039;faith and credit&#039; of the U.S. government, even worse than fiat because this can be revoked arbitrarily at any time. This isn&#039;t an asset to hold. <br><br>However there is a value. But speculative investors won&#039;t be able to profit from it, only legitimate businesses who utilize XMR/TOR to attract privacy-minded clientele and immediately convert it into USDT to secure their gains, and the clientele themselves, who benefit from such privacy. There is potential to start every type of business that exists in the real world in the XMR/TOR ecosystem instead to cater to privacy-minded clientele, and enormous benefits for customers using these services.

In fact so many that Kraken&#039;s XMRUSD comes in only 31st, getting beaten by stuff like XT.COM &quot;centralized cryptocurrency exchange established in 2018 and is registered in Seychelles&quot; that supposedly did $2m volume on its XMRETH pair.<br><br>The perpetuals tab is even worse, Bitmart Futures supposedly did $11,223,268,872.47 of volume in the last 24 hours.

Additionally, decentralized exchanges often have lower fees and offer a greater level of security, as they are not vulnerable to hacking or other types of cyber attacks.<br><br>Overall, metavault.trade is a reliable and secure platform for trading a wide range of assets, and offers a superior alternative to traditional forms of gambling.", "filename": "spectruum", "ext": ".png", "w": 256, "h": 256, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672393766240585, "time": 1672393766, "md5": "A82neWka3M1EgCfapo6M/Q==", "fsize": 13607, "resto": 0, "id": "qaqmX1Mw", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "since-trading-on-metavaulttrade-i-have", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53069990, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:15:09", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "I started to code strategies into Tradingview pinescript", "com": "Any of you doing the same, or picrelated?", "filename": "1648146777807", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 460, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 230, "tim": 1672388109704381, "time": 1672388109, "md5": "zzU3KoRMY6zRMYY54djdBw==", "fsize": 51877, "resto": 0, "id": "F0WXGb87", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-started-to-code-strategies-into-tradingview", "replies": 7, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 53070040, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:22:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53069990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53069990</a><br>that article is like nazi propaganda tier holy shit is that real?", "time": 1672388574, "resto": 53069990, "id": "FNnNhHAp"}, {"no": 53070148, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:37:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I thought brown and yellow people of color are absolutely acing these things", "time": 1672389447, "resto": 53069990, "id": "QGN31Xgu"}, {"no": 53070173, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:41:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53069990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53069990</a><br>Link?", "time": 1672389684, "resto": 53069990, "id": "VdKeji9D"}, {"no": 53070333, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:11:00", "name": "MAGA24 - Christ is King", "com": "<a href=\"#p53070040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070040</a><br>Their symbolism will be their downfall<br>It&#039;s always darkest before dawn", "time": 1672391460, "resto": 53069990, "id": "NGlBO+5H"}, {"no": 53070355, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:14:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53070333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070333</a><br>checked<br>but also this is incredible, to see headlines and art like this and people are obviously incapable of inference or something to see nothing wrong lol. <br>zero self-awareness maybe, idk.", "time": 1672391646, "resto": 53069990, "id": "FNnNhHAp"}, {"no": 53070399, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:21:51", "name": "MAGA24 - Christ is King", "com": "<a href=\"#p53070355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070355</a><br>Buy $hex fren. <br>[They] don&#039;t want you to own it.", "time": 1672392111, "resto": 53069990, "id": "NGlBO+5H"}, {"no": 53070530, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:49:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53070040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070040</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nazi propaganda</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nazi bad !</span>", "filename": "1658165744458121", "ext": ".png", "w": 2576, "h": 1896, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1672393760834402, "time": 1672393760, "md5": "bNuBcJj5+iYpETTQ9UPZXA==", "fsize": 55474, "resto": 53069990, "id": "wNQrSjNl"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53064199, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)16:25:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it even possible to bring back the gold standard at this point?<br><br>What would it do to the economy?", "filename": "890DFF7C-AE7A-4E13-B705-629BD113387E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 427, "h": 280, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 163, "tim": 1672349124707592, "time": 1672349124, "md5": "qm3AWVXHk3ZwFmnwriTeLA==", "fsize": 64427, "resto": 0, "id": "K2kmTdfJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-it-even-possible-to-bring-back-the-gold", "replies": 49, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 30}, {"no": 53064241, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)16:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "To be clear, I know it will never be done.<br><br>I\u2019m asking if it CAN be done, and what the ramifications would be.", "time": 1672349280, "resto": 53064199, "id": "K2kmTdfJ"}, {"no": 53064263, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)16:29:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53064199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53064199</a><br>Both your useless green paper and your worthless shiny rocks will be abolished.

Normies who have overpriced houses will just refuse to sell at a loss and will live in their house instead of buying a new one. Most home buyers already own a home that was refinanced at a sub 3% rate, they are not gonna sell their current place to buy an even more expensive home at 6%. Inventory is also really fucking low. All the higher rates do is freeze the market, they will have very little impact on prices. The only reason housing crashed in \u201807 was that everyone had ARMs so their own payments skyrocketed as rates increased which led to foreclosures and forced selling. These days everyone has a locked in mortgage that will never become more expensive, and there is zero incentive to sell. My current house has a 1900 PITI payment at a 2.25% 30 year fixed mortgage but it would rent out for $2800. I will never sell it due to how cheap my borrowing costs are, I will keep it and rent it out if I ever move to a bigger place. NOBODY is going to voluntarily sell if they are underwater on their current house, this alone keeps prices high. We need forced selling to actually cause a housing crash, and this will only be possible if there is massive unemployment to the point where nobody is in a position to buy or can get loans. <br><br>This is the catch 22 of trying to time a housing crash, if you are feeling secure enough in your career to commit to a mortgage, chances are everyone else is feeling good too, thus leading to higher demand and prices. If you are feeling insecure in your job and afraid of getting fired or laid off, everyone else will be afraid too and housing might actually dump.
