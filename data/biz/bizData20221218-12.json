AECO is fundamentally much cheaper than other benchmarks due to the abundance of gas on Western Canadian soil as well as lack of sufficient infra for it to be able to reach other markets and catch arbitrage.

Essentially, they&#039;re set to become the uber of cloud based services. Their technology is open source and third parties can create dApps for sale on iExecs secure decentralized marketplace. Datasets and computing power can be rented out, all while using RLC as a means of exchange. Cloud computing is growing and will become a massive part of the IT industry over the next decade. iExec is a leader in this technology, and has been sought after and been used as a consultant for Microsoft and IBM. That recognition speaks volumes for their competency.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If it has a moonshot in its future, what is the likely time frame</span><br>end of 2023 realistically. Their main service- the marketplace for computing resources - goes live in January. Whenever this token has upward pressure, the price tends to skyrocket. It did a 10x from $2 to $20 in less than a week from its coinbase listing, where most coins see a 50-200% bump at most. With the token becoming increasingly scarce due to the low fixed supply, and iexec inversely offering more products on their marketplace requiring more RLC tokens over time, this upward pressure will meet little resistance. Realistic targets are hard to pinpoint, but if iExecs marketplace captures 0.1% of the cloud computing market by EOY 2023, that will make their services worth just shy of $600 million, which will set RLC at $7 a token. This is a lowball, however, as iexec will be the first to offer a service of its kind. at 1% market share, it will be worth $70. RLC has been stable around 0.90-1.20 the last few months, for reference.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s the suicide stack, what&#039;s the make it stack</span><br>870/8700<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

Let me describe people like OP. <br><br>First, for non burgers, $85k is not very much. He&#039;s lucky to take home $4500 a month after taxes and contributions, possibly less if he&#039;s maxing out his 401k which as a bean counting midwit, I&#039;m sure he is. A BMW costs a bare minimum of $35k, most being in the mid 40s. He&#039;s paying $800 a month for this minimum. The average price of rent or mortgage (which he doesn&#039;t mention and he seems status obsessed so I&#039;m sure he doesn&#039;t live with the P &amp; M) is $1500. That brings him to $2400 a month. Cell phone, car insurance (New car on lien or leased, at least 140 a month for BMW), utilities, $500 a month combined. Optional, Subtract another $400 if he needs to commute to work, minimum. $1500 to $1900 a month. That puts him in the same monetary class as the thug. Very doubtful someone like this dresses well, more like self conscious and wears a t shirt under a weird patterned dress shirt and probably buttons it all the ways up. He feels self conscious and then puts on big kid clothes like t shirt and shorts and sneakers after work. The thug could at least woo the woman with delusional plans for his big break. Big four firms max accountants out at 150k after two decades of work, which is actual work where you&#039;re putting in a grueling 40 hours a week working nonstop. He won&#039;t break 100k for a decade at least (not as much as everyone thinks it is post tax and contributions). And people at PwC and Deliotte in other areas make double the money and have the potential of making partner if they have MBA where they don&#039;t do real work, just troll around saying to that end, at the end of the day, we&#039;ll cross that bridge when we get there, etc, and shoot the shit with coworkers or customers all day. Women don&#039;t care about who you are, they care about what you can be and for people like OP is not much.", "time": 1671352794, "resto": 52920035, "id": "UlZ7y/Y2"}, {"no": 52920671, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:43:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52920649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52920649</a><br>All I read is that you&#039;re a roastie that wants someone that is 100x your value.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "m8id0472elu91", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671078605863817, "time": 1671078605, "md5": "K6e45VOUhLMgRsxfXNt7ow==", "fsize": 1601431, "resto": 0, "id": "T1QcB29f", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 181, "images": 57, "unique_ips": 91}, {"no": 52875609, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52817752#p52817752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52817752</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671078724777639, "time": 1671078724, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875619, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:33:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671078979741420, "time": 1671078979, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875676, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:37:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

While it is true that there are often debates and differing opinions within the fields of finance and economics, they are based on rigorous scientific analysis and research. There are well-established theories and principles that have been developed through careful study and testing, and the field continues to evolve as new data and insights are gained.<br><br>Second, the argument suggests that capitalism is inherently unstable, exploitative, and unsustainable, and that it leads to poverty, debt, wealth inequality, monopolies, disease, pollution, exploitation, slavery, conflict, and wars. While it is true that capitalism has its flaws and has contributed to various social and economic problems, it is also important to recognize that it has brought significant benefits to many people and has played a significant role in driving economic growth and development. Additionally, there are many different forms of capitalism and it is possible to design and regulate systems to address and mitigate some of the negative aspects.<br><br>Third, the argument suggests that greed, selfishness, lying, cheating, stealing, competition, conflict, slavery, and war are behaviors that are highly encouraged and incentivized under capitalism. While it is true that these behaviors may sometimes be present in a capitalist system, they are not inherent to capitalism and can occur in any type of economic system. In fact, capitalism can also incentivize and reward cooperative and ethical behavior.", "time": 1671320855, "resto": 52916191, "id": "DYYvKs4V"}, {"no": 52917015, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52917005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917005</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cont </span><br>Finally, the argument suggests that capitalism is literally cancer and shares the same functions and principles as a cancer cell. This is a metaphor that is not supported by scientific evidence. Cancer is a complex and multifaceted disease that has a variety of causes and is not a direct result of any specific economic or social system.<br><br>Overall, while it is important to recognize and address the challenges and problems associated with capitalism, it is not accurate to claim that it is inherently flawed or that it is the cause of all societal ills. There are trade-offs and benefits to any economic system, and it is important to carefully consider the costs and benefits of different approaches in order to create a system that serves the needs and interests of all members of society.", "filename": "1493508842619", "ext": ".gif", "w": 480, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671320918817798, "time": 1671320918, "md5": "To6x3uABtbQbQfvi55A/9Q==", "fsize": 1757858, "resto": 52916191, "id": "DYYvKs4V"}, {"no": 52917020, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:48:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52917005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917005</a><br>oh my god don&#039;t engage it it&#039;s starting to smell like leddit in here", "time": 1671320924, "resto": 52916191, "id": "4adQMIPe"}, {"no": 52917032, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:49:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52917020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917020</a><br>Shut up faggot I used ai to generate this shit, never read a single word of that post", "filename": "1670277221147895", "ext": ".png", "w": 685, "h": 925, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671320989524129, "time": 1671320989, "md5": "xUH1Ol9fcc3ZhaqXnlCfyQ==", "fsize": 485788, "resto": 52916191, "id": "DYYvKs4V"}, {"no": 52917042, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:50:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52917005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917005</a><br><a href=\"#p52917015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52917015</a><br>Damn AI can unironically make better arguments and sound more coherent than 4chan posters, all while being more civil.

To answer your question, <br>6m: house prices down another 5-10%. Rates at 8.25%. balance between sellers and buyers. A \u201cNORMAL\u201d market<br>12m: rates finally stop hiking. No ease for a while. Rates resting about 9%.

Early Christian converts were told to use Godan&#039;s name (God: \u16b7\u16df\u16de), in order to supplant their Native religion with the new Judaic sect that worships Yahweh.<br><br>God is not Yahweh and Yahweh is not God.

For D=T see also: archive.is/nck73 -- which is why it&#039;s Wotan in German, and hence why it&#039;s Gott instead of God (so Gott Mit Uns = Odin With Us).<br><br>Curiously when the name of the jew-god Yahweh is spoken in Japan, it sounds similar to &quot;Yab\u0113 yo&quot; (\u30e4\u30d9\u30fc\u3088) which means &quot;it&#039;s bad/dangerous&quot;.", "time": 1671346737, "resto": 52919799, "id": "ADNpoeLQ"}, {"no": 52920189, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)02:04:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Based.

This is because btc doesn\u2019t scale, and in a world where billions of people use it, only 1% of the global population will be able to afford the $1000+ transaction fee to gain access to the limited block space. The rest of the world will be stuck with a custodial solution like paypal. They\u2019ll get money taken out of their account for \u201cspreading misinformation.\u201d<br>The btc maximalist response to this is muh lightning network. But it cannot scale, for two reasons. First, because it depends on btc blockchain transactions, and those are extremely scarce. The waiting list to get your channel-opening transaction included in a block will be decades long. But even assuming that were surmountable, the lightning network also can\u2019t scale because of routing. The only way to send a transaction to someone you don\u2019t have a channel with is to have a map of the entire network so you can find a path through other channels to them. This means your little smartphone would need to keep a map of billions of nodes with tens of billions of channels open between them and keep an updated account of the balance in every single channel, which gets updated a million times a second. In the same way an ordinary user can\u2019t run a btc node if the block size is too large, an ordinary user can\u2019t run a lightning node if the lightning network is too large.<br>This won\u2019t kill btc. This is exactly the kind of thing the wealthy elite want. A cdbc for you. An open, decentralized, censorship-free, seizure-resistant, deflationary, cypherpunk money for them.<br>It will go to a quadrillion dollar market cap.
