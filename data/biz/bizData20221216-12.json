What he said was genius. <br><br>\u201cAnon, think about all the dumb things you do from 18-20.\u201d He said this in a thick Albanian accent. \u201cYou go out do drugs do drinking do party and go to jail. I tell my kids, \u2018stay with me and I pay your cell phone, your food, your car, your school, everything. And in exchange you work for me at the restaurant.\u2019 It keep them home and where I can be with them when they are the dumbest age they gonna be.\u201d <br><br>Boom. It hit me. I thought about all of the absolutely retarded shit I did at 19 off at college and realized that I would have been much more wholesome had I been forced to go home every night to my parents at that age.

They were throwing pieces of lettuce at him and squeezing ketchup on his head, while he begged for mercy. It was a shocking and disgusting sight, and I immediately left the room.<br><br>I am writing to denounce the CEO&#039;s behavior and to call for his removal from the company.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "m8id0472elu91", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671078605863817, "time": 1671078605, "md5": "K6e45VOUhLMgRsxfXNt7ow==", "fsize": 1601431, "resto": 0, "id": "T1QcB29f", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 74, "images": 27, "unique_ips": 45}, {"no": 52875609, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52817752#p52817752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52817752</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671078724777639, "time": 1671078724, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875619, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:33:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671078979741420, "time": 1671078979, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875676, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:37:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

This means I would either have to put on a big hedge or use such a small size that it wouldn&#039;t be as worth it compared to just long vol. And I never short vol. That is a negative skew strategy that makes a little money for a while with high probability then suffers catastrophic loss like with XIV in 2018. Yes these trades can all be &quot;managed&quot; and made profitable but then you start introducing complicated rules and if-then scenarios that inevitably get you rekt eventually.

Covered calls work until they don&#039;t. The problem is you are doing business with market makers and any call they sell you will have slightly negative expected value since that&#039;s the only thing they are in the business of selling and you aren&#039;t going to be doing business directly with other retailers. Some people get lucky selling covered calls for a long time and stop before something bad happens. Some people don&#039;t last more than a few months. I&#039;m not going to completely discourage you from selling them or credit spreads or any other &quot;insurance&quot; but just know that the odds on every single trade are against you and no amount of trade management will change that since by necessity when rolling you are just closing one bad trade and opening another one with negative expected value. I wish it weren&#039;t like this but 99% of option selling educators are outright frauds and the rest are probably misinformed and naive.

An interesting idea is also AECO (Alberta/B.C. natgas). AECO is fundamentally much cheaper than other benchmarks due to the abundance of gas on Western Canadian soil as well as lack of sufficient infra for it to be able to reach other markets and catch arbitrage. But next year the Coastal GasLink pipeline will be finished and 2.1Bcf/d (21.7Bcm/year) will be supplying a new LNG facility in B.C., this should increase demand for AECO and the price arbitrage should put upwards pressure on the price.<br><a href=\"#p52884804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52884804</a><br>Copper and iron ore interest me.
