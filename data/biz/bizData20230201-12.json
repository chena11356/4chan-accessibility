Value investors, 401(k)/IRA contributions, futures contracts for physical assets with real delivery, etc. all add up to less than 1% of daily volume whether you measure transactions, number of securities moved, or dollar value. If the people who trade securities for a living didn&#039;t have infinite liquidity or OTC settlement they&#039;d be suffering exactly like crypto traders do. Volatility measured in orders of magnitude, every trade hitting the ticker, no execution without an actual counterparty, etc. It&#039;s like how in 2008 the value of MBSes wasn&#039;t the piss boring returns on mortgage interest, it was the injection of hundreds of billions of dollars of actual face value liquidity backed by physical houses that could be leveraged or fractionalized or rehypothecated or made into a source of derivatives like CDOs. MBSes were pumping probably multiple quadrillions of dollars to balance sheets without creating any real value for the economy. If we are ever going to be free of rule by the banks then anyone who ever created, bought, or sold an MBS needs to be executed, along with all of their descendants. Then make failure to deliver a security or failure to force a buy in on delivery a capital crime.

Really great deal if your dealer goes off of grey sheet prices for proof sets, it was only $20 for the silver one. Yes, seriously just $20. The actual lens with silver coins is identical to what would be in any other 1998 silver proof set, the difference is it has a metal frame around the lens and is stored in a really nice clasped case instead of the shitty little cardboard box. It&#039;s also a BITCH to remove the lens from the metal holder, there&#039;s a holder that keeps the frame in place but metal-on-metal means it&#039;s very strong. It&#039;d make a great gift for someone&#039;s birthyear. Guess they aren&#039;t very well known which is what keeps the price low. Me personally, today was the first time I knew about them. I just pointed behind the coin counter at a black box and asked &quot;What&#039;s that?&quot;<br><br>2007 presidential dollars was a nice one to get since the stupid 2007 set didn&#039;t include them. Dealer only charged me $5 for them, so I only paid a $1 premium over the face value, been looking for those four little brass shits all over the place.<br>2012 hurt a little to buy. It&#039;s tied as the most expensive post-Kennedy proof set of any year, costing me a whopping $150. 2020 is also listed for the same price on the gray sheet, but it&#039;s climbing up in value fast so if you want to complete the ATB series I advice you get 2020 and 2021 first, they have the makings to really be key dates.<br>It&#039;s a nice set. Grover Cleveland is included twice, since he was the 22nd and 24th president.

Simply put, it&#039;s a masterpiece. No matter how you tilt it, you&#039;re getting a dazzling brilliance of luster. The mountain portion of the Volcano somehow seems to shine whiter than any of the other quarters. The lava being the negative space of cameo proof fields is just wonderful. What truly impresses is the erupting smoke. Reminiscent of a Holographic sticker, how the coin is tilted changes how much of the smoke cloud is visible. Laying flat, the smoke looks like some distortion. Facing the light, it&#039;s a gleaming radiance. It feels alive.

Only the smoke changes. It&#039;s gorgeous. It&#039;s changing, it&#039;s dynamic, and it&#039;s animated. Holographic stickers could never dream to be so classy, it resembles a gem more than a piece of metal. By far my favorite silver proof quarter, and maybe my favorite silver US coin of the 2010&#039;s period. 11/10. I get why people are paying $450+ for the 5ozt version, because now I really want one after seeing the brilliance of the 6.25 gram version. But I don&#039;t know if the effect can be conveyed as well without a proof finish, the cameo contrast is what really makes this coin.

That could have been one of the most beautiful silver coins, ever. <br><br>Ultimately, you&#039;re buying the 2012 set for the Hawaii quarter, and to fill out collection gaps.

If you don&#039;t want it for that reason, you don&#039;t want it period.

It all started with these threads which got me into economics, long term investing and of course flipping metals for profit.

I went from not even being able to do basic math to finishing calculus ad trigonometry and I mean I couldn&#039;t even understand what a variable was. It all started from collecting fractional poorfag silver. If I could turn my tubby ass into the man I am now then surely any other person can become more too.

Easiest way would be to buy a gold acid test kit off amazon. They&#039;re pretty cheap and idiot proof. I don&#039;t have one, this is what I usually do. <br>1. I try to verify the reputability of the seller. I now have a good few sellers that I have relationships with, so it&#039;s not as necessary for me. But look at the age of their account, if the have reviews, what types of items they have posted etc. You can usually sniff out tweakers relatively easy from that first step, but I&#039;ve gotten scammed twice before so it&#039;s better to be safe than sorry. <br>2. Familiarize yourself with hallmarks, and basic jewelry identification. Understand what the difference between 10k, 14k, and 18k is, how to identify gf (gold filled) gp (gold plated) and hallow jewelry. Then familiarize yourself with &quot;gas station gold&quot;. This is the cheap fake shit that you can find almost anywhere in the country. Usually marked 18k, it has a brass-y color, and is usually halmarked on the underside of the ring. They&#039;ll often be really chunky and gaudy. Look up some google images of &#039;gas station gold jewelry&#039; and you&#039;ll see a bunch of examples.<br>3. Call around to local pawn shops and jewelry stores/coin dealers. You&#039;ll eventually find someone with a sigma analytics metal tester that may be willing to let you test it there. In addition to verifying the gold, you can avoid wasting time with a tweaker if they know you&#039;re meeting at a place that will test it. <br>If you can&#039;t get an acid test kit, and don&#039;t have access to a pawn shop that will test, bring a jewelers loupe and a neodymium magnet. The magnet is a way to rule out cheap fakes, and the loupe can be used to view small hallmarks. Sometimes the hallmark is not easily visible to the naked eye, and even if you can make out &#039;14k&#039;, you have to ensure there&#039;s not a &#039;gf&#039; or &#039;gp&#039; after it. <br>Youtube will be your best friend for research.

I don&#039;t know why so many boomers are like that. Thankfully, my parents are pretty financially savvy, so they understand that renting is stupid.

Home ownership is the American dream, and it&#039;s also a fair system (when it&#039;s affordable). You get to keep the money you put into it, and eventually you&#039;ll have the whole thing paid off and you&#039;ll be able to enjoy a comfy retirement and have wealth to pass down to future generations. Nowadays, that dream is all but dead for most people because home prices have gone up 10x faster than wages. There&#039;s no light at the end of the tunnel for today&#039;s workers, no reward, even the very concept of retirement is a pipe dream for your average wageslave.

Yeah you do your job well, but unless you&#039;re absolute exceptional, you&#039;re just that new wiz kid or something. <br><br>By the time you&#039;re in your late 30s and 40s, if you&#039;ve played your cards right, you&#039;re really hitting strides in your career. People respect you and turn to you for advice. Your opinion on the direction of the company, or at least your department, matters a great deal. At a certain point, most successful people (people who actually earn enough to retire early, not wageslaves) actually enjoy their work. They feel fulfillment from it. This is what they dedicate most of their waking life to do. When you take that away, a lot of people don&#039;t know what to do with themselves. <br><br>Are you really going to learn how to play an instrument, or you&#039;re going to learn a foreign language so you can travel to another country and order beer? Are you going to buy that project car you always wanted and spend time and money fixing it up?

secure, low-fee, and fungible, meaning users can send XMR around the globe despite corrupt governments or broken financial systems. Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Dec2022", "ext": ".png", "w": 881, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 227, "tim": 1674967153121325, "time": 1674967153, "md5": "ag5BhOXv0T0piQrOMS12vQ==", "fsize": 261950, "resto": 0, "id": "GYt1JLiW", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 194, "images": 86, "unique_ips": 86}, {"no": 53479405, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53410417#p53410417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410417</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674967234895521, "time": 1674967234, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479406, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "comfiest hold", "filename": "anonymous psycho", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1107, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967238375027, "time": 1674967238, "md5": "FdGA/H8bh56WZ2bMRMIHkA==", "fsize": 286689, "resto": 53479388, "id": "/Ar04N/D"}, {"no": 53479417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967550498520, "time": 1674967550, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479528, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:52:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479388</a><br>Remember to teach your children about Monero.", "filename": "father teaches daughter about Monero", "ext": ".png", "w": 1488, "h": 1488, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674967975748895, "time": 1674967975, "md5": "IA9aY6yr2O8cKXnx0wYfAQ==", "fsize": 3128011, "resto": 53479388, "id": "hxWhAu08"}, {"no": 53479593, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:01:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "for russian monero-chads:<br>we have thread here <br>2ch.life/cc/res/839934.html", "time": 1674968497, "resto": 53479388, "id": "TSXvNt3D"}, {"no": 53479619, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:04:16", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674261391277545", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2176, "h": 3200, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674968656514531, "time": 1674968656, "md5": "YrMEeTOm/GlA4k4iCLs2nw==", "fsize": 1488978, "resto": 53479388, "id": "Zdcl3ipM"}, {"no": 53479756, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:20:59", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674969659484479, "time": 1674969659, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53479388, "id": "qtvM3HDJ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53479915, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trusted technology, growing adoption</span><br><br>Zcash was launched by one of the most respected technical teams in the world.<br><br>Zcash is the &#039;https of blockchains,&#039; protecting your freedom to save and spend as you like.<br><br>Zcash was the first project to implement zk-SNARKs, a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography that gives its users the strongest privacy available in any digital currency.<br><br>Multiple, independent organizations are funded to innovate on Zcash.<br><br>Zcash is already available on top exchanges, digital wallets and a growing number of applications.", "filename": "1621943471634", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1116, "h": 1166, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674971055828570, "time": 1674971055, "md5": "9CbmIjABh69hCgSvb/J4QQ==", "fsize": 218045, "resto": 53479388, "id": "pstI2t3M"}, {"no": 53479927, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:46:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is what Monero chuds don&#039;t want you to know.<br><br>Buy Zcash if you actually want to make it.", "filename": "G63gsFs7wbnasGVs3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1145, "h": 3404, "tn_w": 42, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674971161010922, "time": 1674971161, "md5": "XVHgUjHmgaGUqs4ONbqRLA==", "fsize": 1345614, "resto": 53479388, "id": "pstI2t3M"}, {"no": 53480031, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:04:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479915</a><br><a href=\"#p53479927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479927</a><br>Nice try z-niggers.

Roughly 38,000,000,000 tokens have already been burned totaling 0.5% of the total supply.<br><br>One of the biggest advantages of cryptocurrency is the ability to reduce the total supply by burning a set amount of tokens. The more coins a particular coin has the larger the supply and the more likely it is to see a price collapse in the future. Cryptocurrencies are a fundamentally deflationary currency. Luna Classic will have approximately 1,000,000,000,000 tokens by the end of the year. It will burn tokens to offset the crash and other transaction costs. This leaves the remaining token supply at 1,000,000,000,000 tokens.

That&#039;s why it&#039;s an existential crisis, if you&#039;re doubting the cryptographic strengths and checks behind HW wallets you also have to think critically about the software developer for non-HW wallet devices.<br><br>Everything hypothetically has a backdoor, but how likely they are to have one should be looked into. At the very least if you aren&#039;t comfortable with generating your seed on the device, you&#039;re not removing any security by generating a key off-device and importing it to your HW-wallet (aside from the probability of your other device being infected, which actually is a more likely scenario than the HW wallet being compromised). If you&#039;re worried about USB communications get an airgapped HW-wallet that only communicates via QR code and never use the manufacturer&#039;s applications (Metamask can read QR signatures just fine). It gives you the same security as the airgapped laptop, only you can actually use your crypto.<br><br><a href=\"#p53504540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53504540</a><br>The discussion of shamir and multisig wallets didn&#039;t pertain to HW wallets specifically.

I just strongly believe. <br><br>Image Generation AI (Ticker: IMGNAI) is an Ethereum-based token &amp; ecosystem whose goal is to provide consumer-level (you guessed it) AI image generation. The thing about this tech, which itself is very new, is that it it\u2019s not very accessible to normies for reasons of GPU processing power, funds, and a basic learning curve. They\u2019re not going to put in all the effort \u2014 you have to make it retard-proof for them. <br><br>What this project does fundamentally is provide an extremely convenient way to generate AI images on some the highest traffic platforms \u2014 Telegram &amp; Discord now, others to come later. There\u2019s already working product (the team has delivered) and the telegram hub is one of the most active I\u2019ve seen in a year.
