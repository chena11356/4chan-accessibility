The S&amp;P 500 went down 30% this year without causing any major blowups, but when the UK Central Bank tried to raise interest rates on bonds by 0.25% (might have been 0.5% too), pension funds almost went bankrupt because they were/are x100 leveraged against bonds via interest rate swaps. Similarly, the March 2020 crash was largely caused by dealers (large buyers and sellers of bonds who provide global liquidity for e.g. governments) not being allowed to buy bonds when governments wanted to sell them, thus causing the bond market to stall. Funding flows for stocks then stopped, and the S&amp;P took a 30% dive immediately.<br>The stock market is honestly just token-trading, it can go down 90% and people would be unhappy, but banks could still function.

As a result of the easy money, a speculative mania developed in the NASDAQ where people exchanged their money for toilet paper shares in dotcom companies, with that money ultimately going to investment bankers and early investors. When the NASDAQ had gone &quot;high enough&quot;, Greenspan kept raising rates until additional inflows into the NASDAQ become too expensive to maintain, and thus, the bubble collapsed.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1669396131668871", "ext": ".png", "w": 3500, "h": 2624, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669542531011387, "time": 1669542531, "md5": "rvLZ2wPHVctAvXZdM2FW4Q==", "fsize": 4126136, "resto": 0, "id": "4Rrn27q6", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 81, "images": 33, "omitted_posts": 76, "omitted_images": 32, "last_replies": [{"no": 52646760, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)08:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52641518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52641518</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I feel that this is precisely why Monero was brought to existence.
