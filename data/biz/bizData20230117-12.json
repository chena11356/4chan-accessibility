They&#039;d rather play it safe and collect a paycheck. Those that do succeed in outperforming tend to see AUM grow and quickly reach a scale where it becomes impossible to continue.<br>Many investors don&#039;t care anyway - they feel more comfortable earning less as long as they feel its safely taken care of. <br>Many funds have arbitrary restrictions on what they invest in. For foreign investors, bond funds, or small cap investors, &quot;the market&quot; is not a sensible metric for them to compete against.<br><br>I&#039;ve already said all this. I&#039;m just repeating myself because you seem incapable of fully comprehending.<br><br>Poker players lose money on average too, do you think professionals there are just getting lucky their whole lives? <br>What about insurance - on the whole more money is put into insurance than the average person will ever get out. Insurance firms extract fees while adding, on average, no value for their customers. Do you think that industry shouldn&#039;t exist?<br><br>You&#039;re latching on to irrelevant shit like Nikkei total return vs index price return (both are dogshit btw. Topix is a better index), while completely missing the point that your arbitrary criteria of &quot;the market&quot; is itself just another man made construction. When Buffett and Bogle push passive investing, they&#039;re just acknowledging two basic facts: the performance drag of fees, and the law of averages.<br>The median investor will have median performance, and in a fat tailed distribution this will be below the mean.

You usually see the aftermath of their failures though show up in pressers (after they get collectively shit on by all the other departments).", "time": 1673763319, "resto": 53273726, "id": "EwfKX7AU"}, {"no": 53283728, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:30:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53281297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53281297</a><br>You&#039;re asking advice from someone who thinks TA is useless.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "X4XMR", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673735030577156, "time": 1673735030, "md5": "uLmCVaurQRCCw/dXXCelDA==", "fsize": 993271, "resto": 0, "id": "wgWony5C", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 172, "images": 61, "unique_ips": 74}, {"no": 53277898, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:25:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53231130#p53231130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53231130</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673735115698271, "time": 1673735115, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53277917, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:26:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673735370054747, "time": 1673735370, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53277991, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:31:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673735479708887, "time": 1673735479, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53278370, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:02:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Geopolitics specialists got rekt. <br>Lucky for me that I sold everything days before bitcoin started its moon mission. <br>Feels so good to be a normie.", "filename": "geopoliticsrekt01", "ext": ".png", "w": 1403, "h": 464, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 41, "tim": 1673737368346005, "time": 1673737368, "md5": "mpoV/2zTpVBJgC/uNk18Kg==", "fsize": 31441, "resto": 53277880, "id": "tkzU9GAy"}, {"no": 53278567, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:16:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "alphabay down?<br>i cant connect", "time": 1673738193, "resto": 53277880, "id": "WE7MISfq"}, {"no": 53278771, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:30:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278370</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gay id</span><br>also lol Monero has climbed on the ratio since the beginning of the bear market.", "time": 1673739017, "resto": 53277880, "id": "/5JeRkzm"}, {"no": 53279043, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:48:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "tfw you cut out the part of the chart where we 2x against bitshit", "time": 1673740124, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279195, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:58:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;STATUS CHECK</span><br>Still an infinite supply shitcoin kek", "time": 1673740714, "resto": 53277880, "id": "v7AXt3Oc"}, {"no": 53279309, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:06:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m not exactly a regular here but I&#039;m surprised there&#039;s not more Nagatoro posting considering that the S2 is airing this season.", "time": 1673741168, "resto": 53277880, "id": "2nXv+nBC"}, {"no": 53279424, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:13:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279195</a><br>so is gold", "time": 1673741628, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279454, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:15:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53277880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53277880</a><br>BUT DOES IT HAVE SMART CONTRACTS?", "time": 1673741752, "resto": 53277880, "id": "qHfxHMxJ"}, {"no": 53279478, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279454</a><br>yes smart people are using it to exchange goods and services", "time": 1673741850, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279488, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:17:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lads when are we going to defeat evil", "time": 1673741873, "resto": 53277880, "id": "zdM1fM/K"}, {"no": 53279510, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:19:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279488</a><br>the outcome was predetermined", "time": 1673741958, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279519, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:19:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278370</a><br>so what gave you the premonition that this would happen?", "time": 1673741984, "resto": 53277880, "id": "Z3BLwzWs"}, {"no": 53280085, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)20:10:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278567</a><br>is i2p the future of the dnm?", "time": 1673745011, "resto": 53277880, "id": "zdM1fM/K"}, {"no": 53281025, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53280085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53280085</a><br>The guys at Dread certainly think so <br>https://old.reddit.com/r/DreadAlert<wbr>/comments/101tqq3/january_3rd_happy<wbr>_new_year_were_still_here/", "time": 1673749857, "resto": 53277880, "id": "tyk38Gk2"}, {"no": 53281112, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:40:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Reminder: Tails emissions means we are all going to make it, together.<br>The maxitards, the Zcringe troons, the taxman, russians, ukranians, jews, and niggers.

The first feelings of tension from stress begin to form in your consciousness before you can even remember what day it is. Unhappiness is a given. You do everything in your power to cope with the stress and keep it at a distance; meditate, breath, take a warm shower, think happy thoughts, pray. You can only do any of these things half-heartedly though because you know you have to be at work on time.

This is the failure we have seen time and time again with things like 10% APY for USDC, ect. The thing about HEX, is that the APY is retuned to the staker in a volatile asset, that already dropped 97% and has now found its bottom, and will spend the next 6-12 months preparing for its next godlike rise. APY in a volatile asset is not anywhere near the same thing as APY in USD.

But those of us who have been in this a long time know that the OA coins won&#039;t be sold. They will be diluted through inflation into the future, since they are not staked. HEX holders will keep winning, and these threads will always be the same. This is the plan and it will forever keep the big players from ever risking a purchase of HEX. <br><br>I have been told that I have too much faith in Richard. Meanwhile founders, teams, and VC investors dump on your heads every day in every other shit coin out there, yet the OA has never sold a coin. You will never get it, unless you get it.

I&#039;m your host, Jim Cramer, and today we&#039;re going to be discussing one of the most talked-about companies in the market right now, GME Gamestop. Now, I know that many of you out there are holding onto this stock, hoping for a turnaround, but let me tell you, the numbers don&#039;t lie. GME&#039;s financial position is dire, and it&#039;s only a matter of time before the company goes under. First of all, let&#039;s talk about revenue. GME has been struggling to keep up with the shift to digital gaming and online sales. This company&#039;s brick and mortar approach is no longer relevant and is not adapting fast enough. In addition, they have a heavy debt load, and they&#039;re not generating enough cash flow to cover it.<br><br>And let&#039;s not forget about the intense competition they&#039;re facing. The video game industry is constantly evolving and changing, and GME simply can&#039;t keep up. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Sony are eating their lunch, and it&#039;s only a matter of time before GME is left behind. Now, I know that some of you may be thinking, &quot;But Jim, what about the recent stock price spike? Surely that&#039;s a sign of a turnaround?&quot; Well, let me tell you, that spike was fueled by speculation, not by fundamentals. It&#039;s nothing more than a bubble waiting to burst.<br><br>In short, GME is a company that is past its prime and is not adapting to change. The numbers don&#039;t lie, and it&#039;s clear that this company is headed for a fall. My advice to you: If you&#039;re holding onto GME stock, it&#039;s time to sell, and sell now. Because if you don&#039;t, you&#039;re going to be the one left holding the bag when the bottom falls out.", "filename": "Jimmy-Chill", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673914882921838, "time": 1673914882, "md5": "namy4hwWkHYgAoM3jNXiqQ==", "fsize": 41211, "resto": 53305565, "id": "OADyRfCK"}, {"no": 53305720, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:22:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/biz/thread/53299552#p53305086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53305086</a><br>&quot;unavoidable scheduling problem&quot;", "filename": "soros has unavoidable scheduling problem", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 864, "h": 922, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673914950222846, "time": 1673914950, "md5": "Lm1o66MNKKOubhYrHp42AA==", "fsize": 251146, "resto": 53305565, "id": "H/Xn5Ho0"}, {"no": 53305725, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:22:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Once upon a time, Peter Parker, a brilliant and ambitious young man, decided to invest in GameStop (GME) stock. He had heard about the stock from a friend, who had told him about the potential for a &quot;short squeeze&quot; and the chance to make a quick profit. Excited by the prospect of easy money, Peter invested a large portion of his savings into GME stock. He watched as the stock price soared and he felt a sense of triumph and validation for his decision. He boasted to his friends and family about his savvy investment and how much money he was going to make. However, as time passed, the stock&#039;s price started to drop, and drop, and drop. Peter watched in disbelief as his investment lost value day after day. He tried to hold on, convinced that the stock would eventually bounce back and he would make a profit. But the price kept going down, and down, and down.<br><br>Feeling worried, Peter decided to talk to his aunt May, who had always been a wise and thoughtful financial advisor to him. She listened carefully to Peter&#039;s story, and then she gave him a stern lecture. &quot;Peter, I&#039;m disappointed in you. You know better than to invest in something just because a friend told you to, or because it seems like a quick way to make money. You should always do your own research and analysis before making any investment decisions. And you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.&quot; Peter felt ashamed, he knew his aunt May was right. He realized that he had been caught up in the hype and had not done his due diligence before investing.

He listened as they explained how they had heard about the stock from a friend, who had told them about the potential for a &quot;short squeeze&quot; and the chance to make a quick profit. Excited by the prospect of easy money, they had invested a large portion of their savings into GME stock. They had watched as the stock price soared and they felt a sense of triumph and validation for their decision. They had boasted to their friends and family about their savvy investment and how much money they were going to make. However, as time passed, the stock&#039;s price started to drop, and drop, and drop. The investors watched in disbelief as their investment lost value day after day. They tried to hold on, convinced that the stock would eventually bounce back and they would make a profit. But the price kept going down, and down, and down.<br><br>Tony Stark, who had always been a savvy and successful businessman, couldn&#039;t believe what he was hearing. He felt disappointed and frustrated by their lack of research, analysis and responsibility. He berated the investors for not doing their due diligence before investing, for buying into the hype and not understanding the risks involved. He reminded them that investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme, and that they should always think twice before making any investment decisions. He also emphasized that they should never invest more than they can afford to lose, and that they should always be prepared for the worst-case scenario. He advised them to cut their losses, sell their GME stock and move on.

She&#039;d always put a blanket on me if it was cold. When I first got excited about crypto, she gave me 10k AUD and was observably happy that I was showing interest in something, I couldn&#039;t tell her that I was down to 2k after 2017 crash. Then late 2017 I go almost all in on LINK, picking up a 8k stack and by 2020 I had scrounged 14k stinkies. Every day I&#039;d dream of making it, checking the price 100 times a day, dream of taking her overseas as neither of us have ever left the country, let alone our state. I had a reoccurring fantasy where I would take her to Rome where I&#039;d be dotting on her at a cafe when a cute waitress would engage with me, I&#039;d ask for her number and we&#039;d eventually get married and have kids.
