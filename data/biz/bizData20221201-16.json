Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1669396131668871", "ext": ".png", "w": 3500, "h": 2624, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669542531011387, "time": 1669542531, "md5": "rvLZ2wPHVctAvXZdM2FW4Q==", "fsize": 4126136, "resto": 0, "id": "4Rrn27q6", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 279, "images": 84, "omitted_posts": 274, "omitted_images": 84, "last_replies": [{"no": 52698650, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:16:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52698583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52698583</a><br><br>Its what Bitcoin aint.", "time": 1669929375, "resto": 52632163, "id": "7Tup2aCo"}, {"no": 52698674, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:17:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52695446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52695446</a><br>Anyone?
