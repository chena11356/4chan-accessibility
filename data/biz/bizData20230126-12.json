This proposal motions to design an optional randomised encryption system for developers that wish to create proposals without revealing the full code to be stolen, and revealing half of the code to show proof that the work is complete. The encryption is randomised, making it impossible for developers to intentionally release and get paid for half-finished work. The encrypted half of the proposal is revealed when payment is released to the developers, and a second voting period follows where the DAO can audit the full code and choose whether to implement it or not. This proposal has received a lot of criticism from community members who wish for developers to trust to be paid by the DAO, whilst another section of the community believes a trust-less framework such as this is fundamental to the DAO. <br>https://dscvr.one/post/9180263/moti<wbr>on-to-build-the-encrypted-bounty-sy<wbr>stem<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Latest Bread</span><br>Anons working on a frontend<br>A group is in talks with a team of devs to start work on the stablecoin protocol<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Telegram</span><br>/sns1community<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Discord</span><br>/2kgnM4cQQc<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter</span><br>twitter.com/SNS1dao<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DSCVR Portal</span><br>dscvr.one/p/sns1<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Taggr Realm</span><br>taggr.top/#/realms/sns-1<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SNS-1 OC group</span><br>oc.app/#/gttbe-dyaaa-aaaaf-a6gpa-ca<wbr>i<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Links</span><br>sneed.one", "filename": "SneedPunk2077", "ext": ".gif", "w": 424, "h": 239, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674637828572111, "time": 1674637828, "md5": "r7uJWcV2hD62K9APM8vRIw==", "fsize": 3084878, "resto": 0, "id": "FPVh8FeR", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sneed-sns1-general-6-sneedpunk-edition", "replies": 63, "images": 13, "unique_ips": 31}, {"no": 53428342, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:13:21", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674352081556727", "ext": ".gif", "w": 231, "h": 209, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1674638001683482, "time": 1674638001, "md5": "6QfodxTOvJ3OJfX3ykds0g==", "fsize": 4019723, "resto": 53428329, "id": "9RV2mxmH"}, {"no": 53428369, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53428329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53428329</a><br>It&#039;s quiet, sneed bros.

Middle class euros making 35-40k aren&#039;t living like an American on that salary. Euros living in cities often don&#039;t even have to own cars, so that already cuts off an average of $500 a month on transport costs. They don&#039;t have to pay insurance premiums, and they can often go to free or highly subsidized colleges for a full bachelor&#039;s degree. Their expenses are more predictable, so they don&#039;t have to incur sudden huge debts that can spiral. Americans have random issues with their health or their car, and suddenly they&#039;re down hundreds or potentially over a thousand dollars. For Euros a lot of that instability is just not there. Even on housing side, a lot of Euro cities have statutes managing how your rent can be increased so you don&#039;t spontaneously have your cost of living shoot up. Europe still has its issues, look at the protests over gas and heating costs, but they&#039;re often wondering why Americans tolerate how expensive it can be to live here. And ultimately it makes American competitiveness suffer. A country like Germany can still manage a lot of manufacturing industry even with its unions and state programs because the state programs actually make the cost of living cheaper. Middle class Americans demand relatively large salaries because they feel like they need them to handle all the random expenses. So America&#039;s economy has this big rent seeking aspect, a bunch of industries that make their scratch by preying on the precarity of the middle class. It&#039;s expensive and unnecessary, other countries just clamp down on it to stay competitive. America has managed to eek by because of its post-war dominance, but that has been increasingly challenged and now America is facing economic competition again, so it&#039;s large Middle class income is stagnating while all those parasitic industries are eating it alive.", "time": 1674676074, "resto": 53430056, "id": "Uka5GGVj"}, {"no": 53434967, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)15:13:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53433595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53433595</a><br>The worst of the worst lawyers in the US make 65k, immediately change your priorities, get into the USA at all cost make it in under 10yrs", "time": 1674677621, "resto": 53430056, "id": "yfnlaEhH"}, {"no": 53435157, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)15:23:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53430056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53430056</a><br>We all have tall poppy syndrome and low self esteem.

Innovation is already so stifled by the low-risk social democracy and regulations. Euro Manufacturing is losing it\u2019s competitive advantage rapidly as QA is no longer strongly driven by education and skilled labor, but rather automation, infrastructure, supply chains, and energy costs. Speaking of energy, you lost a large, cheap source of that recently and it is going to hurt your manufacturing and cost of living. Your demographics are terrible even with immigrants, and exploiting this to save you from more economic pain will just Americanize you. The EU is extremely weak as a political body so when people talk of the 500 million pop supereconomy I can\u2019t help but laugh.

This simple example illustrates how na\u00efve market cap discussions are when it comes to crypto.<br> <br>XRP\u2019s price will be determined by utility, not by market cap. For example, SWIFT moves around $5 trillion dollars per day. $5 trillion divided by 100 billion XRP = $50 dollars per coin, and this is assuming that SWIFT owned all the supply. XRP is going after more than just SWIFT, it is going after a $2.7+ quadrillion market. Market cap means nothing.<br><br>XRP will handle much more than SWIFT; it will eliminate the need for nostro accounts (worth $27 trillion), tap into the $2.7 quadrillion global transfer market, as well as interact with other blockchains and technologies. In other words, if XRP\u2019s price was low, it wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the trillions/quadrillions within its 100 billion coins.<br> <br>XRP will likely be pegged to precious metals and/or a basket of assets to make the price even more stable and liquid over time, likely by governments, central banks, and institutions like the IMF.", "time": 1674568199, "resto": 53413943, "id": "oQsfZlA1"}, {"no": 53415476, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)09:03:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Failed my 3 months NoFap streak.

Everyone here on /biz/ is trying to figure out which crypto will The One in the future. Just wanted to make a couple notes about XRP and its relation to the elites trying to realize the NWO which might prove useful in the future.<br>I first need to provide a little background. A key principle used by elites is the concept of what I&#039;m naming here &quot;manufactured polarity,&quot; though other names also exist. Elites believe that work only may be accomplished in the presence of polarity, be that positive/negative, hot/cold, good/evil, or something else. To do the most work, they need the most polarity. As such, they will intentionally create polarity in the world to shape outcomes in their favor. Any manufactured polarity ultimately derives from a unified expression of will to create such division. To that end, elites employ divisiveness as a tool for control. <br>In the same vein, elites believe that the concepts of male and female are manufactured polarity here on earth because our souls are fundamentally androgynous. To my understanding, the upward-pointing chevron represents male, and the downward-pointing chevron represents female. This relationship is reflected in symbolism of various esoteric organizations. For example, the Freemasonry logo includes the overlap of the two chevrons, one upward and one downward. <br>I believe XRP is related to the above points in at least two ways.

We didn\u2019t seek out 4chan like you guys did.

Then I went back to having fun for 4-5 more years then 4chan found me again\u2026 as things REALLY started deteriorating.

So I guess I\u2019m glad I fucked up cuz I probably would have been more drawn to being on here had I knew how to operate it\u2026 but since I didn\u2019t I still got an extra few years of fun before shit hit the fan", "time": 1674666063, "resto": 53429621, "id": "q8cAn6tw"}, {"no": 53432461, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)12:01:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53429621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53429621</a><br>I thought it was cool to have been a poster on 4chan since 2008?", "time": 1674666069, "resto": 53429621, "id": "EKMtSoNF"}, {"no": 53432510, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)12:05:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53430992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53430992</a><br>Yeah of course you are right we were in civilizational decline by the 90\u2019s\u2026 but to start going down you gotta be at the absolute top.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674525330036483", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1792, "h": 2688, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674528949550978, "time": 1674528949, "md5": "eQqdb8RP8r6wqVFYYE46dw==", "fsize": 1341589, "resto": 0, "id": "HlPPWoQL", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 143, "images": 58, "unique_ips": 72}, {"no": 53410434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53362323#p53362323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53362323</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674529029185211, "time": 1674529029, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410443, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:45", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674529065836512, "time": 1674529065, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53410417, "id": "QZ5UEoSQ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53410452, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:58:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674529281556892, "time": 1674529281, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410517, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:02:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.
