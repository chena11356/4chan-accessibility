Nexo is a meme started by Bulgarians (an infamous shithole conquered by the Turks) to lead people to financial ruin. This is NOT A JOKE. Don&#039;t let your saved wealth be thrown away over night. Vitalik Buterin the creator of ethereum said himself the days of making x100 or x1000 are over, that right the guy who created the second most popular crypto said himself those days are over. Now 4chan is trying to get people to lose even more money after the December/January bloodbath. Smart money already exited the crypto world. Crypto is basically a highly specialized database, companies don&#039;t need this. They will just create their own private blockchains. There is no need for nexo, they won\u2019t even be able to run a node. Think XRP when you think Nexo. The company ripple (nexo) isn\u2019t doing well but the coin they\u2019re manipulating (chainlink) is. Considering what Vitalik said &quot;The days of making x100 or x1000 returns are over.&quot; Nexo needs a 399900% decrease in price over the next couple of months to reach solvency this is ludicrous. Don&#039;t fall for it, Nexo its a meme to fuck you over. Consider this for Nexo at current price to reach solvency you need an increase of 700% or a 233% increase every month until EOY.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1640435575462", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4572, "h": 4040, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1671853920036373, "time": 1671853920, "md5": "JMG275ZjGKZZeCWMkkVD4Q==", "fsize": 3937075, "resto": 0, "id": "1U+pzxG9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 223, "images": 81, "unique_ips": 81}, {"no": 52999287, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:53:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52942053#p52942053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52942053</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671854022165243, "time": 1671854022, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671854353882828, "time": 1671854353, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999336, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brainlet here, is there a way to swap monero for bitcoin or vice versa, <br>pls dont laugh ):", "time": 1671854363, "resto": 52999274, "id": "Sjyu/3Jr"}, {"no": 52999339, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Case and point, the top are literally running on GPUs.<br>For data centers, a similar thing occurs. Take a look at AWS&#039;s instances and plans, and you can see that they are custom tailed towards a specific need, like loading handling, rendering, simulations, fast/slow data storage, databases, etc. So a generic algorithm like randomX, that uses various aspects of a customer grade CPU, will run sub-optimal on all of them.<br>Additionally, data centers are used for everything, so asking them to turn it off, while possible is extremely costly. You would be asking them to turn of essential infrastructure for the backbones of the internet, that comes with a huge price tag. And you can count in the fact that data centers don&#039;t utilize 100% CPU, cooling and electricity issues. And overall it does not make sense to use them on a large scale.<br><a href=\"#p53010310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53010310</a><br>I&#039;m too bored to do the napkin math again, but iirc it would cost $400 million just in the cost of CPUs to get the power required for te 51%. Add 4GB DDR4 RAM to each, plus a PSU, plus a motherboard, plus all that is required to cool such a behemoth. And you can easily go over 1 billion USD to attack a small drug dealer&#039;s currency still in its early days.<br>And yes you can try to make a custom CPU just for randomX, but it&#039;ll essentially be the same as modern AMD CPU, with some overhead.

Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This takes a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant! Rather, it is only to point out that, when looking at the case at hand (i.e., ease for both back-end and front-end development), they are not the top choice.<br><br>THERE IS NO NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED DATA EXTRACTION WHEN THE DATA IS ALREADY COMING FROM DECENTRALIZED BLOCKS!!! The decentralization is only necessary in proving the data hasn\u2019t been tampered with.

It&#039;s centralized. Centralization is faster and easier than decentralization.<br>2. It evolves more rapidly. PRQ&#039;s team has already moved on to a completely new project, while GRT&#039;s team is still working its first project.<br>3. Small and scrappy. GRT has a team of dozens if not hundreds of people, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. PRQ has a small team and very little money, so it knows how to fight for its survival and relevance with limited resources.<br>4. Legality. PRQ&#039;s business confidently operates in full compliance with the law of the United Kingdom. GRT indexes the data of sanctioned smart contracts, its DAOs are incorporated in tax havens, and some of its validators run in countries of questionable diplomatic standing. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t want anyone to control it, and this is wrong.<br>5. Affordability. GRT makes its users pay fees for its services. PRQ just asks that its users hold the token for services, and sell it when they&#039;re done.<br>6. Focus. PRQ&#039;s small team is focused on lots of different projects at once. GRT is focused on one project, and it doesn&#039;t even lend NFTs.<br>7. For the common man. PRQ has lots of small customers. GRT is used by amoral global entities like Goldman Sachs and the WEF.<br>8. Economics. GRT holders have to stake to earn a worthwhile cut of fees, and risk volatility with their investments. PRQ is a real business that gets paid directly for its services without a need for frivolous nonsense like profit sharing or value accrual.<br>9. Marketing. PRQ isn&#039;t afraid to talk about price action and predictions on official outlets. GRT aggressively discourages it in all their official communities and communications.<br>10. Specialization. PRQ was built by engineers. GRT has to hire engineers, cryptographers, data scientists, financial analysts, designers, and devrels to help build their product, and that&#039;s expensive.", "time": 1671871962, "resto": 52993237, "id": "FC9F7UB+"}, {"no": 53001084, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:41:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52999004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999004</a><br>How can you say that 99% of the tokens are released when the circulating supply is 170 million and the total is like 300 million?", "time": 1671874878, "resto": 52993237, "id": "IohuMduE"}, {"no": 53001170, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:12:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000769</a><br>Yeah don&#039;t trust that guy on that kind of info, he claimed GRT could not go below 10c, which is why he&#039;s now shilling PRQ lmao", "time": 1671876747, "resto": 52993237, "id": "jLJNQvLI"}, {"no": 53001198, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000940</a><br>Who&#039;s meant to fall for this bait?", "time": 1671877210, "resto": 52993237, "id": "YmuIbZEV"}, {"no": 53001212, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:24:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>Should we buy their new token when it&#039;s released?", "time": 1671877487, "resto": 52993237, "id": "ftj8mLGM"}, {"no": 53001228, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:28:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>999999 other shitcoin scams claimed this retarded shit (surely your pajeet coin partnered with aws) and of course not even the most established cryptos are used in any of that.", "time": 1671877736, "resto": 52993237, "id": "5jmbcW24"}, {"no": 53001269, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:38:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "because they don&#039;t plan to use their Reserve which is locked atm.

My guess is that he only wants you to pump his bags to get his 2x~10x, which is actually feasible by /biz/ on such a low mcap/liq coin in the short to medium term, at which point he&#039;ll just dump on you and move onto another coin.

Those settings create the automated flow as a crewmember is moving about their day, it doesn\u2019t know you flew the leg DAL-MCO it just assumes it and moves your piece forward. In the event of a disruption you call scheduling and they manually adjust you. It does work, it just works for an airline 1/3 the size of SWA. So the storm came and it impacted ground ops so bad that many many crews were now \u201cunaccounted\u201d for and the system in place couldn\u2019t keep up. Then it happened for several more days. By Xmas evening the CS department had essentially reached the inability to do anything but simple, one off assignments. And to make matters worse, the phone system was updated not too long ago and it was not working well. Last nite they did a web form and had planned to get the system up as much as possible with what communication they could muster, however it was too much to keep up on and ultimately the method for tracking crews failed again.

I was born into nothing, just poverty, but I&#039;ve been able to spend most of my life avoiding work and travelling.

When you don&#039;t buy retarded shit all the time, like the newest phone or stuff on loan, you realize that living is not that expensive. The most expensive thing is rent. This can be cut down by either volunteering while travelling in the 1st world -- hostels are the best because you&#039;re basically given accommodation in the city, typically in the city center or thereabouts, and your job is to check people in and do some basic shit; in reality that translates to sitting around at a desk and flirting with girls or chatting shit up with people 90% of time, very ideal for hookups and fast friends -- or by going to 2nd or 3rd world. Eastern Europe is quite cheap, especially off season. Southern Europe is cheapish too. Proper 3rd world like SEA or India don&#039;t cost much either, with flights usually being the most expensive item. Southern America is similar, but it is lot more dangerous than SEA or India, probably even more so than many parts of Africa.", "time": 1672142997, "resto": 53002585, "id": "qk6ddtlV"}, {"no": 53029186, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)07:25:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53002613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53002613</a><br><a href=\"#p53016447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53016447</a><br><a href=\"#p53019085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53019085</a><br>Wrong as always Ivan.", "time": 1672143949, "resto": 53002585, "id": "Z6W33Jpp"}, {"no": 53029202, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)07:30:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53029105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53029105</a><br>This is only useful if you hate living in one place and don&#039;t care about future too much like me. <br><br>But if you&#039;re still young (under 40&#039;s), and even if you&#039;re older than that, and have been dying to see the world, there&#039;s literally nothing stopping you.

I had infinitely more fun waking up in a tent in some random bushes while hitchhiking than any work experience. Settled life sucks if you&#039;re not making big money and if you got to spend much of your existence for that money. You can have the comforts of a medieval king, running water, internet, food from all over the world, a soft bed, all just for the minimum wage. But clearly that is not all there is to life, otherwise so many of you wouldn&#039;t be content. The function of man is to live, not just to exist comfortably. Years can just pass by like pressing fast forward button when you&#039;re stuck in a boring routine. This way people go from 20 to 35 in what seems to be just a few moments.

Stress is the biggest factor to aging probably and poor quality of life and work has that in spades.
