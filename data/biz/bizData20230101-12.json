VBA in particular as you&#039;ll be living your entire life in excel. if you get into a great program you&#039;ll need to keep your GPA in the top 90th percentile of your class, all while you&#039;re taking the (very difficult) aforementioned classes. if you can get an internship your freshman or sophomore year it&#039;ll set you up nicely to get an internship your senior year and eventually a return offer. the more time passes before you get an internship the more difficult it will be, know this.

You misunderstood my first post. This is one of the reason why I won&#039;t talk about philosophy. There are too many levels of detail required to effectively share the full extent of a perspective, and it&#039;s hard to navigate around all possible connective meanings mapped to all labels every reawders may rely on in order to design the most concise and clear explanations. Furthermore, external minds are scattered around various possibly inadequate stages of cognitive development, or may feel directly aimed by the discussion of generic types of bias, which is undesirable.

Objectively, XRP is the coin that WILL be adopted as the standard for settlement, and more. Whatever your tokenized asset, from equities to real estate to gold, it will be settled in XRP. I.e., not just &quot;foreign currencies.&quot; SPQR traced the creation of XRP to a Rothschild holding company working in concert with the NSA. It also appears that Bitcoin has the same source, and was floated to create widespread adoption, and to coopt anti-banker sentiment. SPQR got spooked and quit, but their videos are still up,.last I looked. If you own 5k XRP you will be the one percent - of those who survive the culling that&#039;s taking place in this era.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "PimpHand", "ext": ".png", "w": 961, "h": 999, "tn_w": 240, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672398550412929, "time": 1672398550, "md5": "wjrnsq7UPwnatHvBo8meng==", "fsize": 798594, "resto": 0, "id": "3CYHBxFm", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 136, "images": 39, "unique_ips": 64}, {"no": 53070970, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:10:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52999274#p52999274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999274</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672398647970535, "time": 1672398647, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53070979, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672398907889153, "time": 1672398907, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53071009, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:16:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

And the 2000 year old infatuation of the Europeans with it, to the point of killing all their paganisms to give space to the jewish god shows Europeans are just pathetic people in the first place.<br><br>So first you have to accept that meditation is not standalone. meditation is not done out of the blue to pass time and cast spells.<br>Meditation is a tool to achieve a goal. It turns out that there are various types of meditation. Once you fix a goal, some types of meditation will be bad and some types will be good. Meditation has nothing to do with a god. Again meditation is tool. Just like knowledge is a tool to achieve something. Knowledge has nothing to do with god. Knowledge is not done for the sake knowledge either.<br><br>Now Semitism is just not based on meditation in the first place. Semitism is based on devotion to a jewish guru and the novelty of semitism is that child sacrifice is no longer needed compared to the previous Canaanite religions (think of the jew Abraham who is asked to kill his son to please his jew god, and at the last minute the jew god says &#039;&#039;i changed my mind, it was just prank bro lmao&#039;&#039;). Any attempt at bastardizing Semitism into some weird meditative stuff will be ill-formed. And in comparison with the eastern teachings, it will be a brutal mogging in favor of the eastern teachings.<br>A direct equivalent of Semitism is any eastern cult based on devotion, which is just Bhakti And bakthi is not fucking meditation. Bakthi is complete different method. Typically this is hinduism, vajarayana and mahayana.

If a new BRICS economy/currency was a threat to the US etc, why would western nations sell their stockpiles of gold to them in the first place? Make it make sense.

It isn&#039;t the only thing, the trajectory of global finance is moving east because it has the biggest population, biggest potential for mass industrialization, little regulation, authoritarian states and more natural resources than the west.

If you can&#039;t afford to pay your employees a living wage, you shouldn&#039;t open a business [or you should pay yourself less], and if you don&#039;t want to complain about being paid poverty wages all the time, don&#039;t take the fucking job.", "time": 1672506646, "resto": 53085533, "id": "S1tjUEl0"}, {"no": 53085676, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)12:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53085650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53085650</a><br>and on the flip side, these places are never short on subservient retard goycattle to work the killfloor.", "time": 1672506803, "resto": 53085533, "id": "Be2NAGh3"}, {"no": 53085686, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)12:14:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53085533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53085533</a><br>Why would I tip the bitch carrying my meal a few meters instead of the cook slaving all day in the back to make the meal.", "time": 1672506887, "resto": 53085533, "id": "MFx5xke8"}, {"no": 53085765, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)12:21:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53085533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53085533</a><br>America is a cancer.", "time": 1672507302, "resto": 53085533, "id": "Ig12cXXx"}, {"no": 53085806, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)12:27:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53085650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53085650</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; $15 per hour</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; living wage</span><br>In the UK that&#039;s what a doctor makes and our housing is 4x the price per sq ft compared to the US.

I would be surprised if the bottle costs more than $0.15. The shampoo inside is about $.03 or so. Soap in general is one of the cheapest things to make, you just have to make it right, which is as simple as following directions and being able to pour something without it splashing. Also, word to the wise, I used to have really good hair and ended up growing it out. Grew down to my ass over a decade or so(cut it to shoulder length several months ago), however my hair seemed to get shittier and shittier. It was falling out a ton, seemed to be thinning. Then I ran out of shampoo and didnt want to buy a bottle online instead of paying half the price in store...but I didnt want to go to the store. Instead I found a bar of pure castile soap (pure olive oil, anything pure animal fat works too). I used that on my hair, within a week or so, my hair has gotten a ridiculous amount thicker, there is also no more hair falling out. My head in general is healthier. I can feel the natural oils in my hair when its wet now (when dry it feels normal). Invest in some good quality PURE soap, get a bar and either use it like that or mix it with water and essential oils to make a shampoo on your own since it wont have any detergents in it.

My bulging, huge, muscles ripped my Avalanche shirt off, and six women lined up. We had an orgy, which didn&#039;t last too long.
