They were being shorted to death back when oil was shit in 2020 and they merged with a tech company named MetaMaterials (MMAT) who wanted a NASDAQ ticker without an IPO. As part of the deal the oil company people kept all rights to the oil so they gave up some of their ownership in the new company and had the rights turned into a preferred share. They&#039;ve been going through filings to take it private (Nextbridge Hydrocarbons).

But then the regulating bodies, after approving the new ticker, showed their true hand a few days before the trading deadline, halting all trading of MMTLP until it is delisted the day after the 12th.<br>Now the future is uncertain but not set, people aren&#039;t sure yet where it being delisted means the shorts get off scot-free, or if they still have to close, that the halt might be lifted, etc.<br>The one thing MMTLP has got going for it right now is a C-Suite that was open about fighting shorts.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "time": 1670726547, "resto": 0, "filedeleted": 1, "id": "pC++OEQJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 240, "images": 61, "unique_ips": 98}, {"no": 52817763, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:43:38", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/tzm4s<br>Aliases- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/bjbx3<br>Extras- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/daxte<br>Nodes- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/ke2k8<br>Mining- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/c7na4", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1670726618118821, "time": 1670726618, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 52817752, "id": "N03p/zlR", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 52817767, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52766664#p52766664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52766664</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1670726634737312, "time": 1670726634, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52817752, "id": "pC++OEQJ"}, {"no": 52817772, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:44:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1670726894768796, "time": 1670726894, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52817752, "id": "pC++OEQJ"}, {"no": 52817812, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:49:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Binance is the top dog on Cexes with Coinbase being second in rank but way inferior both on volume and usefulness..But they both know that they are entrenched so hard that nobody can dispute them unless they fuck up on purpose. Now they have the defacto monopoly as the normalfag on ramp to crypto..Goybase in the US and somenYuropoors and Chinknance for the rest. They don&#039;t have to exit scam, just by existing right now it&#039;s literally free money for them. The problem lies to the other exchanges that are doomed to be losers forever if they are legit ( Bittrex,Kraken,etc) or to scam they way up ( FTX, Scamcor, Celsius). The even better part is that they can cater to normalfags with impunity while simultaneously recognizing ( and encouraging) DEXs so they can say they don&#039;t have a monopoly,but let&#039;s be honest most normalfag don&#039;t even know what a command line is, let alone knowing basic opsec and actually enforcing it. Like it happened with Vidya, the OGs will be pushed aside with the normalfags surge, unlike Vidya though they will buy our bags happily and make us rich, it doesn&#039;t mean that a part of that process doesn&#039;t sucks balls . It&#039;s the way of life, eventually somethint else will trigger our autism and we will move along to be left alone to our own devices until someone starts saying &quot; Lol, check out what those nerds are doing&#039; .

According to a recent study, one in every 200 Bahamians is in prison. The rate of imprisonment, at 478 per 100,000, is one of the highest in the world - almost four times that of the UK and Canada. The prison remains grossly overcrowded. Cells measuring 1 by 3 metres in the maximum security F Block for example contained 3 prisoners each. This block held prisoners in punitive isolation alongside those with mental health problems and others with communicable diseases such as TB. In near darkness, prisoners slept on cardboard in many cells. Space was further limited by two buckets \u2013 \u2018slop\u2019 bucket and a bucket for washing \u2013 with prisoners required to defecate and urinate in front of each other. The recent Prison Reform Commission highlighted four aggravating factors worsening overcrowding: lack of legal representation, high numbers on remand, lack of early-release schemes and incarceration for minor, non-violent offences, such as vagrancy. Addressing the issue of overcrowding would mean providing humane living conditions for prisoners and working conditions for staff and would also be cost effective. <br>He went from a multi billionaire to this in one (1) month", "filename": "943", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1111, "h": 597, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1670991771945035, "time": 1670991771, "md5": "AoYiLwYxSGOs0+gpjj8EDA==", "fsize": 388392, "resto": 52855960, "id": "g0Ta6ymh"}, {"no": 52859380, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:27:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52856143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52856143</a><br><br>He has classic ashkenazi features", "time": 1670992063, "resto": 52855960, "id": "ZfPHFIk/"}, {"no": 52859405, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:29:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "He\u2019s never gonna make it out that Bahamian prison alive.

Tne wealthy make money off of welfare is why. Who do you thinks owns all the housing projects? What do people on welfare spend their money on? (answer mega corp shit). Wealthy people paying for welfare is just a temporary medium of which the money eventually returns back to them, it\u2019s an illusion, it makes no difference how much they pay as they\u2019ll get it back and the super wealthy are only super wealthy in the first place because of the parasitism of the working class so in essence it\u2019s the working class that are paying for it anyways. Ultimately the more money being extracted from the middle class to welfare class enriches the elite corporate class, the portion the elite pays for welfare doesn\u2019t out weigh the benefits they get from the overall welfare state that the majority contribute to. This is why as we get more poor as the elite get more rich, they are squeezing the middle class of their value by using social programs/welfare as one of their mediums to do so, of course there is many other schemes. The understand politics one just needs to follow the flow of money to understand why elite support certain things like welfare states.

The police, too, are rather outrageous in the charges they feel are necessary. The government keeps passing laws which are antithetical to Western tradition. They already do steal from us in the form of the many, many taxes. They take money from people on the street if the person they are accosting cannot explain why he is carrying it.

This could lead to inconsistencies and conflicts within the network.<br><br>Another potential flaw is the scalability of the network.

That means that the expression of ohms law will not perfectly describe current, voltage and resistance at extreme values, it will not be reliable to use. What happens when you have a resistance going to practically zero wont be predicted/calculated by Ohms law because Ohms law only holds up for reasonable values that you see in circuits. <br>The anon was asking about resistance going to zero and implying that Ohms law means current would be infinite but because Ohms law is not a law of nature, it cant predict what will happen in that case.

The cost of labor rarely declines like the price of goods such as lumber or steel or staple crops such as corn and wheat. \u201cBecause wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services, the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech two weeks ago. The problem is, the cost of labor is still rising rapidly. Average hourly wages have risen 5.1% in the past year, roughly double the annual increase in the decade before the pandemic.</span><br>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/i<wbr>nflation-is-slowing-but-the-fight-i<wbr>s-far-from-over-11670952202", "time": 1670983774, "resto": 52854673, "id": "EEAs+Qur"}, {"no": 52857760, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)21:11:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52857740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52857740</a><br>Go clean your ass, you smell like faggot, and shit", "filename": "1670908142465670", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670983873688020, "time": 1670983873, "md5": "ujFTw4d/5DMlGQ3Oc44QdQ==", "fsize": 2974082, "resto": 52854673, "id": "lahMyn3D"}, {"no": 52857767, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)21:11:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52857740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52857740</a><br>also core inflation is rising despite the rest of inflation slowing, which is a very bad sign", "time": 1670983900, "resto": 52854673, "id": "sHQA0HnF"}, {"no": 52857783, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)21:12:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52857740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52857740</a><br>Damn it, wrong jif", "filename": "1670983264790961", "ext": ".gif", "w": 384, "h": 288, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670983978789070, "time": 1670983978, "md5": "7s04aW9IhF97VkhG2SR0Lg==", "fsize": 3669164, "resto": 52854673, "id": "lahMyn3D"}, {"no": 52857795, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)21:13:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52857722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52857722</a><br>Idk man that happened last CPI and it ended the day neon green.

I remember you posting about this some months back. I have about 50k laying around doing nothing and really like the idea of running my own business. Me and the wife pull in about 220k and only have 70k in expense. Use to me not working, long story but I make 6 figs now. Have about 5k a month to do whatever with. I have an IT and bar/restaurant background about a decade in each. <br><br>Please dont waste time replying to people with shitty comments and attitudes it derails the thread and doesnt do anything. I&#039;ve actually seen a guy exactly like you in my old neighborhood. Drove a giant truck around with a trailer that was always parked on street. Would have this black dude with him that was borderline homeless. His day laborer , seemed like a nice enough dude tho. <br><br>Anyways this sounds like a thing someone sort of mentors you into. Or maybe had a friend that kind of told you want to buy or start with. If I was going to try to do this I would look into IT equipment buying it up from random places. Or taking it for free. Saying I am going to recycle it. When I&#039;ll just repackage and buy whatever missing pieces it needs. Then resell it all another reseller. Trying to make connection and networking with other companies to find out who needs what seems like a huge pain in the ass. I feel like it would still be easier just to get a loan , buy a dive bar and let that collect income for me. Instead of essentially learning a new skill and becoming a salesman. But ya 250k for one year is okay, but not great compared to what my family is bringing in now and I work mostly from home tech job. I do want to have independent income that isnt reliant on an employer though. I find that very attractive in what you do. <br><br>I heard someone say, first you invest in stocks, make money.
