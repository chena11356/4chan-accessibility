Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "168972789564", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1431, "h": 1106, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 193, "tim": 1671495074320435, "time": 1671495074, "md5": "FO2prahRc0zhiZPmPBQVpQ==", "fsize": 1447627, "resto": 0, "id": "f4sg7tZ4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 217, "images": 67, "unique_ips": 90}, {"no": 52942076, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:12:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52875586#p52875586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52875586</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671495178054615, "time": 1671495178, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942093, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671495436933397, "time": 1671495436, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942167, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:18:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

The opposite of hard money is easy money. Every cryptocurrency is easy money. Anyone can make their own coin with features btc doesn\u2019t have, like anonymity or smart contracts or faster transactions. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Those other coins might be better code but they aren\u2019t harder money, because someone could come along tomorrow and make an even more anonymous, or even faster coin.

There will be an infinite number of cryptocurrencies, but only 21 million btc. Unless that changes, it will remain the hardest money for no other reason than because it is the first, and everything else is easy, inflationary money. They could even change the code to make it slower than it is now and it would still be the hardest money.

If you can afford to buy and run an array of asics, you can easily afford a few bucks for storage.<br>As the network grows this storage becomes another resource to earn money from, miners will be able to charge for access to archived data.<br>Halving leads to half the block reward for mined blocks to be shares by the miners. This drops profits by half too where the hashrate remains the same. other factors are running costs and efficiency of the asics. as profitability reduces the less efficient miners sell off their equipment and buy more efficient and competitive asics.<br>The problem I&#039;m pointing out is that as profits reduce due to halving block rewards, this profitability can drop below that of even the most efficient ASICs.

National average currently is about $400,000 fyi. It hasn&#039;t dipped to $200k (or rather, first hit $200k) since around 2005.

For an individual earner, $100k is in the vast majority of the US upper middle class. This is extremely variable, for instance I live in Chevy Chase, and my individual income is $154k, while my wife&#039;s is 84k. Together, our household income is something like top 8% in the US. However, in Chevy Chase, MD, we are barely above median ($200k), thus here, we are middle-middle class. It&#039;d be even worse if we moved to certain parts of California, assuming our pay wouldn&#039;t be scaled. FYI for all you who are definitely inexperienced in having a job or even money, salaries/wages tend to be scaled somewhat with the area, but this too has a lot of variability, especially with software development and remote work. E.g. One of my classmates went to Ohio after graduation and her salary was like 60% of mine, yet she was able to buy a pretty decent house like two years before me and had a way easier time doing it.<br><br><a href=\"#p52962554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52962554</a><br><a href=\"#p52968101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52968101</a><br><a href=\"#p52960646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52960646</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ryan Homes</span><br>This guy&#039;s mostly right.

Whether the Rewards BAT is genuinely all from their UGP reserves or from their dubious Transparency page purchases, or a mix of both, doesn&#039;t matter to me if I get paid.

Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This take a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data.

They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH.

Most stack a 100:1 ratio but that\u2019s only super general, ie one ounce of gold for every 100oz of silver and I think that\u2019s just because of the cost. In general silver has a LOT more room to go up, so you can increase a stack buying silver, and then when the price of silver goes up closer to gold (as a ratio) you can exchange your silver for gold, and when silver goes down (or gold goes back up.. it\u2019s about the ratio really..) you can exchange your gold back for silver, usually by just going in person to a coin shop, knowing the spot and ratios, and exchanging fair values.<br><br>If your a rich anon then gold can be a good store of value for cold hard cash.

They will pay high premiums to fill in the series. Consider the potential for series&#039; popularity: generic and/or cringeworthy-themed series are less likely to appreciate above spot.<br>- Low-mintage series are often priced very high, but may increase in price the most (consider design popularity!).<br>- Gov&#039;t-issued coins cost least while minted. Once the mintage stops and dealers run out of stock, the prices jump then rise more slowly but still faster than generic silver. Maples, Eagles, Wieners, Britannias, etc. are all nice but boring. The mint may add a privy to add novelty thereby ginning up the price. Stuff that changes overall designs from year to year become series (Somali elephants, Canadian Wildlife, Australian kookaburras or koalas, island nations&#039; series, etc.).<br>- If you buy pieces that appeal to your sense of art, taste, and interests, you will still appreciate them even if the price or value of the PM goes nowhere. Caveat: if you go to sell, it&#039;s harder to part with them.<br>- Some beautiful generics are priced comically high (Germanias, GSM special editions, e.g.) - they don&#039;t follow the market trends as readily, garnering peak price only while fashionable. Be aware: dealers may categorize and price these as &quot;generic&quot; (meaning below spot) when buying them from you. Or the gamble might pay off as they become very popular (Englehard, PAMP, antique miners/refiners, e.g.).<br>- For new generic bars, watch the markups over spot: premiums (added charges) go up for smaller pieces.<br>- Shipping is an added premium. Many vendors offer free shipping for purchasing a minimum amount (commonly $200).<br>- Keeping a spreadsheet of your purchases to track profit/loss is quite revealing and will help you make future decisions.", "filename": "A&amp;O_MajestixCrown", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2560, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671657377547156, "time": 1671657377, "md5": "4XNhjRA04EPyT1KK3mKrtw==", "fsize": 743925, "resto": 52965834, "id": "/58Hx29Q"}, {"no": 52967532, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:16:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52967334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52967334</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there a coin/shiny you all plan on getting next year?</span><br>Treefag needs tree coins.

They intend to weaken gold&#039;s function as an international reserve currency. They don&#039;t want to see other countries turning to gold reserves instead of the U.S dollar or euro.&quot; A Beijing embassy cable released by Wikileaks suggests that the Chinese have a policy of steadily undermining Western currencies by accumulating gold. A follow-up document accused the US of &quot;doing everything possible to prevent China&#039;s foreign reserve from buying gold.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; In October 2009, the Chinese government received a shipment of gold. In a normal assay, they drilled out bars and found they were filled with tungsten. The serial numbers traced back to Fort Knox. Over 5000 400oz bars were found to be counterfeit... Chinese officials caught and questioned some of the perpetrators. They traced the crime back to the Clinton administration under Robert Rubin&#039;s time at the treasury helm.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; In 2012, China increased its gold imports by 780%. Then it went big, importing 1200 tons by March 2013. The Chinese government only makes an announcement of official gold holdings every four or five years. The numbers of official gold holdings every four or five years. The numbers are not valid - China holds far more gold, likely multiples of the stated amounts.

China had no plans to increase its gold reserves from 1054 tons, he said, since it&#039;s worried about adverse effects to the gold price. He then seemingly contradicted himself by pointing out China&#039;s goldmines produce 400 tons per year and the country imports 500 tons per year.</span>", "filename": "australian gold kangaroo on top of gold wars smaller", "ext": ".png", "w": 1500, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671661316464393, "time": 1671661316, "md5": "nJrpVTGF5P+2VcdxhnFI6A==", "fsize": 2769546, "resto": 52965834, "id": "xyuZ+VGL"}, {"no": 52968259, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:23:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52967849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52967849</a><br>Fine insights and headings for research there, thanks.", "time": 1671661384, "resto": 52965834, "id": "2XTud8Jv"}, {"no": 52968309, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:27:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52968000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52968000</a><br><a href=\"#p52968017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52968017</a><br>of course", "filename": "20220529_155300", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 1782, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1671661653299643, "time": 1671661653, "md5": "CEh7KffFAAm6/u0MrPlkKw==", "fsize": 1141417, "resto": 52965834, "id": "oYG79Ybj"}, {"no": 52968313, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:28:26", "name": "Holocoinanon", "com": "<a href=\"/biz/thread/52951927#p52964299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52964299</a><br>we fully expect to lose money on the gold/plat coins, just as long as its not too insane we will be fine.<br><a href=\"/biz/thread/52951927#p52964441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52964441</a><br>This is just the drafted art stage, the font for the japanese text will be changed to something much nicer, thought the cherry blossom filigree is going to be staying.", "time": 1671661706, "resto": 52965834, "id": "IzVGn/xy", "trip": "!UXDtf0Fe9Y"}, {"no": 52968342, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:31:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52967999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52967999</a><br>Here is a panda fren.", "filename": "panda1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 810, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671661889188790, "time": 1671661889, "md5": "Eb4oJGcOrsYU5CsaywvCqQ==", "fsize": 183068, "resto": 52965834, "id": "YVHn2EUd"}, {"no": 52968354, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:33:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52968342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52968342</a>", "filename": "panda2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 810, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671661986698683, "time": 1671661986, "md5": "2Vvih8bBmJF/Sy4R1WQJfQ==", "fsize": 156095, "resto": 52965834, "id": "YVHn2EUd"}, {"no": 52968470, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:45:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Finally got some authentic RMs. 2 and a 5.", "filename": "rm", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 891, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1671662732749699, "time": 1671662732, "md5": "MxAJ3MqnqArXbD/FJacTtA==", "fsize": 467598, "resto": 52965834, "id": "2ro/guI8"}, {"no": 52968505, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:47:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52967385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52967385</a><br>What I&#039;ve heard is that if an ounce of gold &#039;should&#039; cost 15 times more than an ounce of silver; if it costs more than that then you should be buying mostly silver, and if it costs less than that then you should be buying mostly gold.

A scuffed panda is still worth its weight in gold, however, pandas always gain numismatic value over time, due to each year being unique, so why take away from that?", "filename": "20211105_164924", "ext": ".png", "w": 1500, "h": 1125, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671678795318826, "time": 1671678795, "md5": "6UYM7ksxOnQFnukKBppdSg==", "fsize": 2632350, "resto": 52965834, "id": "2BVBTDSz"}, {"no": 52971256, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:18:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52970770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52970770</a><br>uWu", "filename": "bear gotcha", "ext": ".gif", "w": 460, "h": 258, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671679123996757, "time": 1671679123, "md5": "tdf+YNv2hGgV5sjAtb5Jdg==", "fsize": 1967570, "resto": 52965834, "id": "8KngTvIg"}, {"no": 52971260, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:19:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52971206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52971206</a><br><a href=\"#p52971160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52971160</a><br>Got off with a warning", "filename": "1619845082612", "ext": ".png", "w": 713, "h": 611, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 107, "tim": 1671679145188007, "time": 1671679145, "md5": "qQALjNMrB5KSP8+c+7XUBg==", "fsize": 42747, "resto": 52965834, "id": "QnJYo0XN"}, {"no": 52971284, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:21:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52971260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52971260</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t answer questions</span>", "filename": "1671143988199122", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 584, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1671679273101452, "time": 1671679273, "md5": "2Vj/vCdtLhYD5YhWhvairw==", "fsize": 328835, "resto": 52965834, "id": "X38k/D/Q"}, {"no": 52971296, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:22:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52971284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52971284</a><br>I&#039;m a sovereign anon and my electrical signals are free to travel where they please", "time": 1671679350, "resto": 52965834, "id": "QnJYo0XN"}, {"no": 52971314, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:24:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Btw, I never followed up with /pmg/ regarding this 8g panda that I gifted to my friend&#039;s newborn baby back in October.

Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This take a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant! Rather, it is only to point out that, when looking at the case at hand (i.e., ease for both back-end and front-end development), they are not the top choice.<br><br>THERE IS NO NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED DATA EXTRACTION WHEN THE DATA IS ALREADY COMING FROM DECENTRALIZED BLOCKS!!! The decentralization is only necessary in proving the data hasn\u2019t been tampered with.

It&#039;s centralized. Centralization is faster and easier than decentralization.<br>2. It evolves more rapidly. PRQ&#039;s team has already moved on to a completely new project, while GRT&#039;s team is still working its first project.<br>3. Small and scrappy. GRT has a team of dozens if not hundreds of people, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. PRQ has a small team and very little money, so it knows how to fight for its survival and relevance with limited resources.<br>4. Legality. PRQ&#039;s business confidently operates in full compliance with the law of the United Kingdom. GRT indexes the data of sanctioned smart contracts, its DAOs are incorporated in tax havens, and some of its validators run in countries of questionable diplomatic standing. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t want anyone to control it, and this is wrong.<br>5. Affordability. GRT makes its users pay fees for its services. PRQ just asks that its users hold the token for services, and sell it when they&#039;re done.<br>6. Focus. PRQ&#039;s small team is focused on lots of different projects at once. GRT is focused on one project, and it doesn&#039;t even lend NFTs.<br>7. For the common man. PRQ has lots of small customers. GRT is used by amoral global entities like Goldman Sachs and the WEF.<br>8. Economics. GRT holders have to stake to earn a worthwhile cut of fees, and risk volatility with their investments. PRQ is a real business that gets paid directly for its services without a need for frivolous nonsense like profit sharing or value accrual.<br>9. Marketing. PRQ isn&#039;t afraid to talk about price action and predictions on official outlets. GRT aggressively discourages it in all their official communities and communications.<br>10. Specialization. PRQ was built by engineers. GRT has to hire engineers, cryptographers, data scientists, financial analysts, designers, and devrels to help build their product, and that&#039;s expensive.<br><br>It&#039;s over.", "filename": "1624378844535", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 391, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1671666511261086, "time": 1671666511, "md5": "su7GEIWjVgAUpaZmlyrkew==", "fsize": 145440, "resto": 52967973, "id": "C5NEA4C2"}, {"no": 52969505, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:14:57", "name": "OmegaMaker", "com": "<a href=\"#p52969176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52969176</a><br>Nice subtle GRT shill.<br>Facts are GRT has no hard token cap.

The reason link is still being suppressed is simple, if you believe an asset is going to be extremely valuable but that can&#039;t actually happen until actual adoption, you are incentivized to keep the price low by artificial means until this happens as you win on both directions, others will be more likely to capitulate allowing you to own a greater percentage of the supply, and you can accumulate for cheaper prices. Logically this makes perfect sense. The only people who need the asset to rise in price in the short term to get rich now are poor people or retail, i.e. us. <br><br>Now as for when it changes, there&#039;s two events and they are sort of correlated. The first is actual adoption, or the chasm as sergey likes to point out. This is something that simply can&#039;t be predicted, it&#039;ll just happen at some point, and unironically will be sort of a switch flip moment where speculators race to beat out the adoption before being left behind. The second is staking, as this removes the ability for long term investors to accumulate via suppression outside of actually staking themselves. Now we have staking but 1.0 is the only one that will actually change the tokenomics as this is where the majority of the supply will be locked up. Of course, 1.0 staking likely isn&#039;t economically feasible until you start to see mainstream adoption, i.e. Swift, DTCC, not shitcoin casinos and DeFi which is all we have in the space now. So its sort of a chicken/egg scenario, and it could legitimately happen next year or in a decade, nobody can actually tell you when its going to happen, although at this point I don&#039;t even think you have to say its an &quot;if&quot; scenario anymore.", "time": 1671652192, "resto": 52960436, "id": "aOGng2AP"}, {"no": 52966554, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)14:51:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52966480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52966480</a><br>You too, your posts in this thread are peak midwit while wasting time posting in a link thread.

You marry an ugly tall girl with broad shoulders, make it clear that you will be cheating on her with filipinas, and give her your seed via IVF to create your own tribe of ubermensch sons. Then you start buying huge tracts of land, holding majority stakes in large companies, donating to universities, etc. You turn those sons into kings and give them the tools they need to further expand on your family&#039;s wealth.
