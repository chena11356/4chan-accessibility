Which means you&#039;re retarded people. Your views are retarded. You&#039;re brainwashed. You&#039;re insane. You think through emotions. Primarily fear and hatred (both of which are inextricably linked). Everything in your life comes down to ultra-simplistic platitudes, black and white thinking, ultra simplicity. It&#039;s always ultra simplicity. Like you take all of the complicated issues in the world and you distill it all down to &quot;it&#039;s the whites&quot; or &quot;just blame the straight white males&quot;. That&#039;s because you&#039;re super stupid people.<br>And as super stupid people you can&#039;t make responsible decisions. You sure as fuck can&#039;t do trading.<br>Do you wanna know why I knew that the markets would crash all year and you all didn&#039;t? There are two main reasons.<br>1) Not brainwashed. I have no actual brainwashing. I have spent my entire life studying the economy and how it all works. You all, by contrast, believe retarded Dem platitudes like &quot;le inflation is caused by social injustice&quot; and just utterly moronic californian bullshit that is totally false.<br>You all shit on &#039;looking into it&#039;. &quot;Reuters fact checked that as false&quot; because you&#039;re a stupid urbanite in an apartment who doesn&#039;t know shit. Meanwhile, I spent my entire life with my face buried in books, studying shit, testing shit, apprenticing and working in a literal field and getting real hands on experience.<br>But your attitudes on the left is just &quot;hurrrr my pronouns are xim/xer and I know everything&quot; even though you don&#039;t. You don&#039;t know shit. Because you&#039;re ignorant and stupid.<br>2) I am sane. You are not.

Depends on demand destruction but seems like demand is still strong relative to supply, and rigs are plateauing. Cyclical bottom as well, demand should be stronger in Summer. An interesting idea is also AECO (Alberta/B.C. natgas). AECO is fundamentally much cheaper than other benchmarks due to the abundance of gas on Western Canadian soil as well as lack of sufficient infra for it to be able to reach other markets and catch arbitrage. But next year the Coastal GasLink pipeline will be finished and 2.1Bcf/d (21.7Bcm/year) will be supplying a new LNG facility in B.C., this should increase demand for AECO and the price arbitrage should put upwards pressure on the price.<br><a href=\"#p52884804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52884804</a><br>Copper and iron ore interest me.

To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "m8id0472elu91", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671078605863817, "time": 1671078605, "md5": "K6e45VOUhLMgRsxfXNt7ow==", "fsize": 1601431, "resto": 0, "id": "T1QcB29f", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 144, "images": 42, "unique_ips": 75}, {"no": 52875609, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52817752#p52817752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52817752</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671078724777639, "time": 1671078724, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875619, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:33:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671078979741420, "time": 1671078979, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875676, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:37:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

This is because btc doesn\u2019t scale, and in a world where billions of people use it, only 1% of the global population will be able to afford the $1000+ transaction fee to gain access to the limited block space. The rest of the world will be stuck with a custodial solution like paypal. They\u2019ll get money taken out of their account for \u201cspreading misinformation.\u201d<br>The btc maximalist response to this is muh lightning network. But it cannot scale, for two reasons. First, because it depends on btc blockchain transactions, and those are extremely scarce. The waiting list to get your channel-opening transaction included in a block will be decades long. But even assuming that were surmountable, the lightning network also can\u2019t scale because of routing. The only way to send a transaction to someone you don\u2019t have a channel with is to have a map of the entire network so you can find a path through other channels to them. This means your little smartphone would need to keep a map of billions of nodes with tens of billions of channels open between them and keep an updated account of the balance in every single channel, which gets updated a million times a second. In the same way an ordinary user can\u2019t run a btc node if the block size is too large, an ordinary user can\u2019t run a lightning node if the lightning network is too large.<br>This won\u2019t kill btc. This is exactly the kind of thing the wealthy elite want. A cdbc for you.
