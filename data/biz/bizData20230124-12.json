Silvergate is Michael Saylor&#039;s lender if any of you have followed that thread at all, he&#039;s been underwater since $30,000 and liquidation was rumored at $16,000 before he took out additional loans to meet margin. Signature bank similarly pulled transfers out from Binance because of liquidity problems, they took out a $10 billion dollar federal home bank loan. Read up on the federal home loan bank; these two crypto banks taking out these loans in tandem means $14 billion from the federal government just got sucked into crypto last week and yet the problem is seemingly so massive that it doesn&#039;t even matter.

High indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) of up to 943 kPa and 57.2% indicated efficiency was achieved at 90% hydrogen energy fraction, at the expense of NOx emissions. The hydrogen injection timing directly controls the mixture condition and combustion mode. Early hydrogen injection timings exhibited premixed combustion behaviour while late injection timings produced mixing-controlled combustion, with an intermediate point reached at 40 \u00b0CA bTDC hydrogen injection timing. At 90% hydrogen energy fraction, the earlier injection timing leads to higher IMEP/efficiency but the NOx increase is inevitable due to enhanced premixed combustion. To keep the NOx increase minimal and achieve the same combustion phasing of a diesel baseline, the 40 \u00b0CA bTDC hydrogen injection timing shows the best performance at which 85.9% CO2 reduction and 13.3% IMEP/efficiency increase are achieved.", "time": 1674369765, "resto": 53376781, "id": "+7WHmKVP"}, {"no": 53384029, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:42:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/01<wbr>/charles-hugh-smith/contrarian-thou<wbr>ghts-on-the-petro-yuan-and-gold-bac<wbr>ked-currencies/<br>He covers oil and gold obviously that&#039;s in the title.

What I do expect is substantial multipliers (although by no means early bird crypto style 10x&#039;s) in the coal sector followed by dividend increases, which can then be rotated into uranium when the time comes, instead of being married to our uranium bags now and being destroyed anally without lube by opportunity cost.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674525330036483", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1792, "h": 2688, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674528949550978, "time": 1674528949, "md5": "eQqdb8RP8r6wqVFYYE46dw==", "fsize": 1341589, "resto": 0, "id": "HlPPWoQL", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 43, "images": 25, "unique_ips": 27}, {"no": 53410434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53362323#p53362323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53362323</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674529029185211, "time": 1674529029, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410443, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:45", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674529065836512, "time": 1674529065, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53410417, "id": "QZ5UEoSQ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53410452, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:58:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674529281556892, "time": 1674529281, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410517, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:02:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

If we\u2019re 3 halvings into 32 total halvings, then the estimated break even point for miners at current hashrate going into the last halving would be:<br><br>$22,000 * (2^27) = $2,952,790,016,000 per BTC<br><br>$2,952,790,016,000 per BTC * 21 Million total Bitcoin = $62,008,590,336,000,000,000 BTC Market Cap<br><br>The block rewards shrink so fast that after enough halvings Bitcoin would eventually require a $2.95 trillion price per Bitcoin and a $62 quintillion market cap to sustain the current cost of $7.15 billion/year.<br><br>Even if these numbers were somehow realistic, can you imagine securing a $62 quintillion market cap on only $7.15 billion/year of hashrate? LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674529343481590, "time": 1674529343, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410559, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:05:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;53410476</span>", "filename": "no", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 999, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1674529533827566, "time": 1674529533, "md5": "QjpClOIkPLdZ6LtJ+ARZYQ==", "fsize": 165333, "resto": 53410417, "id": "k4cf0H+D"}, {"no": 53410567, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:06:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the only coins that make sense holding right now<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;XMR: anonymity </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ETH: dApps</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BIT: self governance</span>", "time": 1674529579, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HoiK+XKn"}, {"no": 53410621, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trusted technology, growing adoption</span><br><br>Zcash was launched by one of the most respected technical teams in the world.<br><br>Zcash is the &#039;https of blockchains,&#039; protecting your freedom to save and spend as you like.<br><br>Zcash was the first project to implement zk-SNARKs, a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography that gives its users the strongest privacy available in any digital currency.<br><br>Multiple, independent organizations are funded to innovate on Zcash.<br><br>Zcash is already available on top exchanges, digital wallets and a growing number of applications.", "filename": "1621943471634", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1116, "h": 1166, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674529903675033, "time": 1674529903, "md5": "9CbmIjABh69hCgSvb/J4QQ==", "fsize": 218045, "resto": 53410417, "id": "hv8KfB56"}, {"no": 53410643, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:13:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is what Monero chuds don&#039;t want you to know.<br><br>Buy Zcash if you actually want to make it.", "filename": "G63gsFs7wbnasGVs3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1145, "h": 3404, "tn_w": 42, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674530018276040, "time": 1674530018, "md5": "XVHgUjHmgaGUqs4ONbqRLA==", "fsize": 1345614, "resto": 53410417, "id": "hv8KfB56"}, {"no": 53410654, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:15:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How many anons are going to fall for the low quality bait this thread?", "time": 1674530110, "resto": 53410417, "id": "A4L6ws9v"}, {"no": 53410736, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I didn\u2019t get any replies on moneromarket :(", "time": 1674530514, "resto": 53410417, "id": "CWpg8fjs"}, {"no": 53410772, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:25:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;53410476</span><br><a href=\"#p53410567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410567</a><br><a href=\"#p53410621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410621</a><br><a href=\"#p53410643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410643</a><br><a href=\"#p53410654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410654</a><br><a href=\"#p53410736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410736</a><br>All we&#039;re missing now is the &quot;stop buying&quot; and the &quot;when are we making it&quot; anons and we&#039;ve got a full set.", "filename": "20230123_202455", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674530734478445, "time": 1674530734, "md5": "+Zgpw6F8i9verq7q9rMGtw==", "fsize": 155858, "resto": 53410417, "id": "8znrj02z"}, {"no": 53410796, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:27:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53410772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410772</a><br>Don\u2019t know why you @\u2018d me but I am just upset no one replied to me at moneromarket.

It just makes shit up. Current AIs can write reasonable sounding stories and make almost passable art, but they can&#039;t make any significant software without it being riddled with bugs and not really worth using at all.

Don&#039;t worry though, we&#039;re a few years to a few decades away from that. What AI does right now is generate noise within the bandwidth of human perception. They&#039;re really good at tricking you into thinking the output is meaningful.<br>Actually that&#039;s kind of more spooky.

It&#039;s not what he media is screaming about bankruptcy, that&#039;s just what lies they use to justify hammering the price. How much does say Ichan value he company? How much does Cohen value the BABY part? Does Ichan use IEP shares to take over BBBY and then carve out BABY for Cohen for GME equity? Seems like the best way to do it due to Ichan having a large short in GME and he can&#039;t close it so if Cohen buys BABY off him with GME shares in a reverse IPO through Teddy then he gets to close his position, he becomes a long in GME, Cohen uses about 20m shares out the pool, so it would dilute GME a bit but then the value of BABY is rolled into the price of a GME share so the value and profit it makes is now part of the valuation so it balances out and in fact means GME becomes profitable and can then begin issuing dividends, the complete end game for naked shorts.", "time": 1674560309, "resto": 53404732, "id": "I3VVV18J"}, {"no": 53414524, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:05:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53414346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53414346</a><br>If you actually have read this then you\u2019re mentally incapable of understanding the squeeze won\u2019t squeezazle until march or at least late feb.

Devs doxxed, already working product, LINK 2.0 but with many more features, only 1 million doll hairs mcap. It&#039;s the bluechip you&#039;re looking for.

Mark my fucking words. <br><br>Here&#039;s what one of the devs wrote in the tg the other day when a member asked about the difference between Kenshi and LINK:<br><br>&quot;The easiest answer would be that Kenshi offers a wider suite of products. LINK focusses on Oracles. Kenshi also offers Oracles. but the Kenshi Oracle Network allows developers to create their own oracles for their own business needs, built on top of Kenshi\u2019s fast and reliable tech stack. Which makes development easier and faster, because a lot of complex stuff is already taken care of. <br><br>Besides the Oracles, Kenshi offers Deep Index, which can be used both for easily querying blockchain data, but also allows to automate actions based on blockchain events.<br><br>There\u2019s more like IOT and lockers, but this message is already becoming too long. Just check the website which does an epic overview of the products, with a lot more improvements incoming<br><br>TL;DR: Kenshi has a more diverse portfolio of awesome products and also does things differently from existing competitors.&quot;", "time": 1674560228, "resto": 53414223, "id": "fr+RI0CX"}, {"no": 53414370, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:44:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53414341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53414341</a><br>Was just doing some research and you made me buy", "time": 1674560653, "resto": 53414223, "id": "8vpIYmmQ"}, {"no": 53414393, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:47:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53414370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53414370</a><br>Based.

You work until you can&#039;t work anymore, usually into your late 60s or early 70s. Why?

If people lived to be 150, the system would just rebalance with taxes, cost of living, fees, and so on, and you&#039;d have people retiring at 135-140 years old.
