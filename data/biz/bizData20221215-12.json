If you buy a stock you expect it to go up. However in the back of your mind you&#039;re like well if it doesn&#039;t go up at least I&#039;ll farm some premium. What happens now is instead of taking well researched trades you fall into the trap of taking shittier trades since you can always juice it with the calls. So now you&#039;re taking shitty trades. That&#039;s one problem. The next issue is if your trades do work out and the calls go in the money you&#039;re either going to get your shares called away and lose on the extra gains you could have made or you will roll the calls out and up. This second option is what internet gurus tell you to do and it&#039;s seductive but if it was such a great idea then you would have chosen that strike and expiration in the first place. And let&#039;s face it, a roll is just closing out a shitty trade and opening another one under duress. Eventually if your shares keep appreciating you end up selling leaps calls and the numbers work out to such that even with the rolling you are just delaying the inevitable where you&#039;re making a few dollars instead of the gains you lost by writing the calls in first place. So now you buy the calls back at a debit losing the gains and then some. But then the market dumps and not only did you lose money on the calls but your shares lose money too. But you&#039;re too emotionally invested to let them go.<br>So now you start some margin trading/leverage thing you read about on Reddit thinking that&#039;s the answer but it ain&#039;t.

What they don&#039;t tell you is that option selling is a negative skew strategy. Lots of small wins, high success rate but then big losses that wipe away all your gains. This flies against internet trading orthodoxy who all will tell you selling puts on high IV stocks is the winrar and it is.. until it isn&#039;t. Market makers aren&#039;t in the business of buying anybody&#039;s covered calls or puts for a price that has a positive expected value. This goes for credit spreads too. Again, high win rate but when the losses come they will be big. It doesn&#039;t matter if a credit spread wins 19 times out of 20 if the 1 loss is bigger than the 19 wins.<br>You can easily do an expected value calculation on any credit spread. Take pic related as an example. The delta on the short call is 0.5344 meaning you roughly have a 53.44% chance of it going in the money and a 46.56% chance of it expiring worthless. So if you run this trade 100 times you will make 46.56 times max profit of $267 which equals $12431 and you will lose 53.44 times $233 which equals $12451. A net loss of $20.<br>Market makers are not your friend so this assumes you get the best possible mid-price fill. Fat chance on that happening. This is a simplified calculation with some assumptions but do the work and calculate the expected value on any spread and the results will be the same albeit more refined.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "m8id0472elu91", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671078605863817, "time": 1671078605, "md5": "K6e45VOUhLMgRsxfXNt7ow==", "fsize": 1601431, "resto": 0, "id": "T1QcB29f", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 28, "images": 15, "unique_ips": 20}, {"no": 52875609, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52817752#p52817752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52817752</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671078724777639, "time": 1671078724, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875619, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:33:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671078979741420, "time": 1671078979, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875676, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:37:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

More supply more coin loss. Not immediately, maybe not even later, but eventually, yes. If supply goes down coin loss should go down. In reality you can&#039;t know or control any of this so thankfully the worst case is set to &lt;0.85% inflation and decreasing. If deflationary, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a real problem. Too much coin loss might also mean coin value is down (we have not taken over the world yet) deflation will pressure it up (a tiny bit).<br>In any case, we&#039;re talking about less than 1% a year fluctuations which will be completely overshadowed by price fluctuation. In any kind of practical scenario this has zero effect for the user.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has already started an investigation into the company&#039;s activities which could lead to hefty fines and other sanctions if any wrong-doing is found to have occurred. Additionally, there have been reports of fraudulent activities such as money laundering so it\u2019s possible that the company could be charged with criminal activity at some point in the future. <br><br>Another possible reason why Sergei Nazarov and Chainlink may fail is due to potential technical problems with their platform.

There\u2019s also a risk that hackers could compromise the security of the system by exploiting known vulnerabilities. This could lead to serious financial losses for users who rely on Chainlink for their transactions. <br><br>Finally, another possible reason why Sergei Nazarov might fail is due to competition from other companies in the industry who are offering similar services but without any of the associated risks or legal issues associated with Chainlink and Sergei Nazarov.

There are two ways to generate Plasma: 1) your device/hardware generates it with some PoW (which requires energy), or 2) you fuse QSR which locks it up in an embedded smart contract for 10h.

Well take a look at Bitcoin, one of the very few cryptocurrencies that is established as a fully decentralized p2p system. People run nodes willingly to ensure users of the network are able to connect through this p2p system and without their contribution, we would not experience the full power of decentralized crypto; Immutability. So already you need people running these nodes for free, without incentive. Luckily for Bitcoiners, we&#039;ve seen a massive increase in value, so naturally those who believed many years ago who run full nodes, likely also mined or purchased themselves some Bitcoin. I want to wrap this up quickly so lets do some brainlet buzzword training to help get into your thick monkey brain that you&#039;re sleeping on the next Bitcoin. Sentinel = BTC full node but with INCENTIVES. Pillar = ZNN Printer go BRRRRRRRRRR (Consensus Valdiator) Delegators = Voting. Staking = Network Security.

According to the XRP Ledger, there are currently 175k wallets with that many XRP in them. Lets just say for arguments sake, that XRP rises massively and eventually hits that $2000 figure. How many of those wallets do you think would sell once XRP hits $1, $5, $10, $20, all the way up to $2000? The actual number of wallets that hold till that $2000 figure would be extraordinarily lower than that 175,000 figure. <br><br>Lets also address the fact that \u201ctoo many millionaires would be made.\u201d Let\u2019s say that there are 100,000 wallets that hold XRP when it hits that $2000 figure.

What he said was genius. <br><br>\u201cAnon, think about all the dumb things you do from 18-20.\u201d He said this in a thick Albanian accent. \u201cYou go out do drugs do drinking do party and go to jail. I tell my kids, \u2018stay with me and I pay your cell phone, your food, your car, your school, everything. And in exchange you work for me at the restaurant.\u2019 It keep them home and where I can be with them when they are the dumbest age they gonna be.\u201d <br><br>Boom. It hit me. I thought about all of the absolutely retarded shit I did at 19 off at college and realized that I would have been much more wholesome had I been forced to go home every night to my parents at that age. It makes so much sense. So unless my kid gets a scholarship for football (which is possible currently) I\u2019m going to make that same offer to my kid.

They marketed the PNK token, the currency&#039;s digital asset, as a surefire way to make a fortune, and they were soon inundated with eager investors.<br><br>But Ast and Lesaege had no intention of actually delivering on their promises. As soon as they had raised enough money, they abandoned the project, leaving their investors holding a worthless digital asset.<br><br>At first, the investors didn&#039;t realize what had happened. They continued to hold onto their PNK tokens, believing that they would eventually be worth something. But as time went on and the value of the token never materialized, they began to realize that they had been duped.<br><br>Some of the investors were devastated. They had poured their life savings into the PNK token, and now they were left with nothing.

Rent a really nice flat / villa in this area. Make sure the area is really well known.<br>4. You must be dressed and groomed well and fit (min otter mode). If you don&#039;t know how to dress hire a professional stylist<br>5. Hire a pro photographer to help you take a bunch of lifestyle selfies in your home, with your car, just hanging out in the fashionable areas<br>6. Post to instagram stories. Ask teasers like &quot;can you guess where I am?&quot;<br>7. Pay instagram to promote your stories locally<br>8. Status climber thots will start DMing you <br>9. Invite them over and make sure to take lots of selfies and post to intagram<br>10. This snowballs because women always think &quot;I can do better than her&quot;<br>11. Invite multiple girls over at same time<br>12. Play party games, hang out, keep it light and fun. Order food so they never have to leave.<br>13. Flirt with the women in front of eachother. Since you&#039;ve already selected for status climber whores they&#039;ll start to escalate.<br>14. Fuck them. Never commit to anything. It&#039;s just light fun. Don&#039;t invite troublemakers back.<br>15. At this point you should be banging several of them. Start to notice which ones are bisexual and not intimidated by you fucking other girls.<br>16. Invite those to share some romps with you, start threeways and such.<br>17. Keep the instagram stories going and recruiting fresh faces, filtering out women who aren&#039;t into you or the scene.<br>18. At this point you should have several bisexual status climbers all practically living at your place for free.<br>19. Personality management becomes big issue now.

But it&#039;s something who does interviews on Bloomberg. Someone who has at least SOME idea of how the world works. I don&#039;t know enough to even know what to ask of a person, to learn from them in a way that matters. <br><br>Tell me more, tell me everything.", "time": 1671065862, "resto": 52873123, "id": "q767Bd9O"}, {"no": 52873582, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)20:10:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52873449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52873449</a><br>I&#039;m glad someone finds this interesting. I&#039;ve always claimed to be interested in the working of the world, but realized I rarely talked to people close enough to even begin to know anything about it. <br>I smoked a lot of weed recently, and it really helped me let go of some of my inhibitions. I began feeling a lot more confident in myself. I looked at the world around me and thought that I&#039;m content, but there are some things I&#039;d like to improve. I was intellectually bored. And I do want to make a little more money. So I naturally started talking to those people at my job because they are a possible path to what I want.<br>The first conversation was with a VP who is an older woman and she&#039;s the one who explained in no time at all why she didn&#039;t care about my account. I literally just asked &quot;why don&#039;t you care about (thing I&#039;m doing)? What else should I be doing?&quot; and she just explained it. I didn&#039;t put on any formalities, which is the correct thing bc people at that level can see through them, and what I wanted to get from her was honesty. I kept prodding and prodding to try to understand why she is doing what she does. What does she value? This was my bosses bosses boss.<br>I then talked to somebody above her but the conversation was more tactical.<br>Then I later talked to someone above even them but who exited the company and pretty much just told him what I was going through, that I had this epiphany smoking weed and wanted to talk to more interesting people and that he was one of them. And it ended up being a 2 hour frank conversation about power where he told me it&#039;s a game and that he likes it and it&#039;s up for me to decide if I want to play the game or not.<br>So basically just saying whatever was on my mind to these people because I wanted 100% honesty from them so I could understand their thinking. That was my goal. <br><br>I did learn that each level the thinking is far more abstract.

I repair tundishes and get them ready for casting steel (a tundish is vessel above the caster that steel pours into before casting) well anyway my boss was telling us to make sure that all of the built up debris in the overflow spout is clear. He quizzed us why, I said because the lids will be fused to the top potentially making a safety issue when we try to pull them off with the crane, fucking up the lids, crane, etc. He said no. The issue is if it overflows upstairs in the wrong spot it could burn down the whole caster potentially killing a few guys and putting hundreds of people out of a job &quot;I could give two fucks about the lids&quot;<br><br>Anyway I say this to show how our goals were different but had similar results. I need to clean the spout because I dont want to fuck up the tundish and lids and make more work or a safety issue for me, he wants me to clean the spout so that I don&#039;t cause the whole plant to burn down. I&#039;m thinking about 1 job and 45 minutes of extra work, he&#039;s thinking about potentially tens of millions of $ lost and maybe 200 people out of work.

While GMX has had a lot of success with its AMM/GLP model, this model is really just an adaptation to slower blockchains and ease of setting up/bootstrapping. There are many problems with the AMM/GLP system that GMX uses and ultimately I believe CLOB perp dexes will win. Happy to go into more details here.<br><br>-There aren&#039;t a dozen on starknet. There are a couple CLOB perp dexes on StarkEx to my knowledge (DYDX and ApeX, let me know if I&#039;m missing some), but they aren&#039;t on Starknet. RabbitX will be the first on Starknet. I&#039;ve been bullish on Starknet for quite a while now so I like getting exposure here.<br><br>-ApeX is cheap. $10m MC, $60m FDV, which is a fraction of ApeX and DYDX. Obviously those coins are much further developed than RabbitX, but there&#039;s clearly upside here if they manage to deliver. Also, finances of the team are solid, they&#039;ve got a lot of USDC in reserve and as mentioned they are trading at close to book value.", "time": 1671095763, "resto": 52876963, "id": "8xXx2Tre"}, {"no": 52877627, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:17:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52877581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52877581</a><br>If you think &quot;Perpetuals&quot; is jargon then I think you don&#039;t really know much about crypto.", "time": 1671095845, "resto": 52876963, "id": "8xXx2Tre"}, {"no": 52877677, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:26:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52877627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52877627</a><br>So you&#039;re making this token for the 17 people who actually know the technical details?

This additional security review is also based on the large user interest in CCIP as a critical infrastructure, the large amounts of value we expect to be sent over the protocol over time, the $100B+ in value transferred across bridges this year, and that over $2B of that value was exploited due to the complexity of bridge security. A phased rollout gives us more time to continue running a series of quality assurance procedures such as penetration testing, soak testing, and multiple internal and external audits.<br>Current plans for the phased rollout of CCIP involve initial availability on multiple different chains. Various alpha partners, including Synthetix and others, are contributing to this initial prototyping and testing of CCIP, as well as various leading enterprises working on their proofs of concept using CCIP, as announced at SmartCon 2022, one of which would enable SWIFT messages to instruct on-chain digital asset transfers across multiple chains via CCIP.<br>Ultimately, security is always our number one priority. This has been true for every Chainlink product launch, and CCIP will be no exception. The extra testing, research, and audit work will go a long way in helping ensure that the production version of CCIP meets the functional and security demands of the growing cross-chain economy. We do appreciate your understanding as we do our best to build a protocol that delivers the security our industry needs to be considered reliable and look forward to CCIP launching in 2023 to help enable secure cross- chain applications.", "filename": "1523305858115", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 769, "h": 697, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 226, "tim": 1671049348704249, "time": 1671049348, "md5": "DkZPR0yhDiBL44YCpLnDEQ==", "fsize": 111733, "resto": 0, "id": "StW53tFe", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chainlink-has-switched-to-a-more-aggressive", "replies": 123, "images": 25, "unique_ips": 72}, {"no": 52870089, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "it&#039;s from the official discord, this is the first time rory ever does that! they always kept dev progress silent.", "filename": "Fj9pkSZVIAEzzFD", "ext": ".png", "w": 774, "h": 612, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 98, "tim": 1671049448831355, "time": 1671049448, "md5": "uObvohCrV47+oIopYAlkNA==", "fsize": 468442, "resto": 52870055, "id": "StW53tFe"}, {"no": 52870093, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:24:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52870055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52870055</a><br>BIG WORD, BIG NUMBER<br>HERE IS A V.0001 CCIP STARTING 2023(second quarter half)", "time": 1671049466, "resto": 52870055, "id": "4P1bvfHX"}, {"no": 52870135, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:26:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52870055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52870055</a><br>Rory is a cuck and Chainlink is a failure", "time": 1671049572, "resto": 52870055, "id": "THg0s84A"}, {"no": 52870145, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:27:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52870093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52870093</a><br>swift is working on ccip, you retarded fudder bulgarian, Enterprise deals are generally super sensitive, NDAs and all that before official public comms.<br>this mzans that they got green light", "filename": "89697563", "ext": ".png", "w": 473, "h": 500, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671049624039920, "time": 1671049624, "md5": "IXp/MReOOjkBxLGWLY9IfQ==", "fsize": 8659, "resto": 52870055, "id": "StW53tFe"}, {"no": 52870156, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:27:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52870055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52870055</a><br>i&#039;ve got your penetration and soak testing right here", "filename": "1630228632753", "ext": ".png", "w": 996, "h": 911, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1671049646618278, "time": 1671049646, "md5": "J8+bNu0Z+m0jmdsUzo745g==", "fsize": 770266, "resto": 52870055, "id": "AUSc5N0F"}, {"no": 52870180, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:29:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52870145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52870145</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mzans</span><br>bonjour monsieur !", "time": 1671049749, "resto": 52870055, "id": "2Mf6sSVS"}, {"no": 52870192, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)15:30:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52870055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52870055</a><br>2 more weeks then it&#039;s 2023 and you wait 11 months and 2 weeks for another update that it&#039;s delayed for security.

My primary criteria was finding ones that seemed to have some headroom and didn&#039;t have any obvious headwinds in their news or such. So far every single one of the picks have remained in the overall post purchase green even after Jan 2022. The least is up nearly 19% (was over 20 until very recently), and one is ~53%. I think all of the ones I actually picked qualified pretty strongly as value stocks, and one maybe even a growth stock, but I also am aware that a great many from the lists did not fare to well. Of course, market conditions after Jan have played a huge part of that.
