Hope interchain security works out. Use Restake or Yieldmos to compound staking rewards. Pray for a giga airdrop like NETA which was a $30k airdrop at one point.

Go on nested finance and browse some existing portfolios and see which are performing well within that ecosystem.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "qR5CBBA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2448, "h": 3264, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675632296838480, "time": 1675632296, "md5": "VV7a4UQAUxYJzK0m3Pd9Bw==", "fsize": 615391, "resto": 0, "id": "NFozmSdJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 302, "images": 97, "unique_ips": 118}, {"no": 53589412, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:26:53", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53546578#p53546578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546578</a>", "filename": "1653056374364", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675632413998658, "time": 1675632413, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53589386, "id": "NFozmSdJ"}, {"no": 53589428, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:27:50", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool.<br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it? Do I have to store GBs worth of data like when running an XMR node?</span><br><br>It is literally as easy as installing an Android app and no, there are no storage requirements, the node only consumes some bandwidth.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cool, I&#039;m sold.

Duncan the fat spic debt-ridden retard whose repeg plan rests on price fixing? The active validator set, most of whom vote only for their personal interests while torpedoing any prop that tries to change things for the better? Vegas, the thieving gypsy whose latest plan is embezzling the multisig funds? Alex the USTC baggie working for a hedge that&#039;s looking to turn LUNC into USTC&#039;s liquidity pig? Who are these big brains, anon? Where are they? Face it man, this coin is a clusterfuck. Democracy doesn&#039;t work because it&#039;s a fucking meme.

It also has the issue that these deposits havent been explored since the parks were put on top of them, so you would have to do all the exploration drilling and planning first, than build the mine, which takes years. <br><br>I would not at all be surprised that there was a plan at some point to exploit these deposits but its not in motion currently.", "time": 1676145329, "resto": 53662425, "id": "ZgIXzLXE"}, {"no": 53673747, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)14:57:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53669696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53669696</a><br>GV and canadian rahaj forces combined", "filename": "1671472971287", "ext": ".png", "w": 740, "h": 630, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1676145470767910, "time": 1676145470, "md5": "di0d7x6fRPekt46HlKjAUQ==", "fsize": 332902, "resto": 53662425, "id": "A2CAeWXB"}, {"no": 53673819, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:04:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53669696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53669696</a><br><br>i don&#039;t understand the significance of this. is crescat good or bad for bllg?", "time": 1676145874, "resto": 53662425, "id": "b1qTJyiG"}, {"no": 53674469, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)16:17:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53673387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53673387</a><br>Similar problems abound in oil and gas as well.

Survived the bear market and is currently aligned closely with Equalizer LPs. You&#039;ll also get a share of revenue fees if you stake their token.<br>Soulswap - Degen pick. FantomFDN/AC tend to buy into projects that they retweeted, and SOUL, as well as their NFT tokens CULT/xCULT/CANDLE, are still incredibly cheap considering the amount of attention they&#039;re getting from them.<br>LSHARE/TSHARE - Degen pick.

Computers, GPUs, self-driving electric cars, AI enhanced smartphones, medical devices, microcontrollers, networkinging gear, machine learning, surveillance, infrastructure, military, and all that other bullshit that people and the government don&#039;t have enough money to buy are not needed. No matter how many cores, how fast or efficient, it won&#039;t be enough to convince consumers to upgrade from their 10-year-old i5 2500k.

The plea: not semiconductors.<br><br>SOXS couples a single ETF entry point with the the &quot;best&quot; companies the semiconductor space has to offer then pushes their already horrific returns to your advantage with 3x inverse leverage, all responsibly managed via daily rebalancing to boot.

In the last 2 days, SOXS has exploded over 1.1x yet still we are early.
