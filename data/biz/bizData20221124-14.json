It was so bad actually, that it passed the 3-sigma line from the regression line. Just so you understand, 2-sigma is already an outlier. So long bonds are critically oversold.<br><br>But why should they go up you ask (because things can remain oversold for long). There are two reasons. First, US inflation is coming down, and it&#039;s are coming down with a lag. The coming data from housing suggests that one of the major components of the CPI - owner&#039;s equivalent rent - is going to significantly fall in the coming reports. So inflation is a 2022 story and will likely die out going into 2023 H2. <br><br>Second, if you aren&#039;t blind, then you know that the US economy is headed for a recession next year. How bad that would be in GDP and earnings terms is hard to say, but the bond market is SCREAMING recession. A recession means that the FED will have more room to halt its rate hikes and even maybe pivot completely. Falling short-term rates are extremely bullish for long duration bonds.<br><br>The only way that this trade does not work is if inflation suprises to the upside and the terminal FED rate will be higher than what is currently priced in - about 5%. If you think that this will play out, then don&#039;t buy bonds. But if anything else happens, this trade will be THE trade of 2023.<br>How to play this trade:<br>First possibility is to buying the spot TLT, which is very easy and simple. Since I don&#039;t think this is a late trade by any measure, buying it outright is a sensible thing to do.<br>Second, if you don&#039;t want to tie up too much capital to this, VIXTLT is still high so doing some call bull spreads is a very good idea. You will gain from selling that further OTM call. I will take at least 90 DTE.<br>Third, if you think you&#039;re bit late, sell puts/bull spreads. Less upside but still positive delta. <br><br>Good luck and see ya in 2023 H2 when TLT is $140.", "filename": "TLT since inception 3SD reg line", "ext": ".png", "w": 1539, "h": 895, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 145, "tim": 1669312868895739, "time": 1669312868, "md5": "bT9krreOcOP94mkos5VKlw==", "fsize": 146711, "resto": 0, "id": "ard1ch3K", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-next-trade-long-duration-bonds", "replies": 14, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 9, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 52601373, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:00:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52601356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52601356</a><br>TMF*", "time": 1669316424, "resto": 52600626, "id": "DHEvckUV"}, {"no": 52601543, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:17:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52601373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52601373</a><br><a href=\"#p52601356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52601356</a><br>oh I own some TMF, its like 5% of my portfolio.

Simple. Wells Fargo decreases Bob\u2019s balance by $10 and increases Alice\u2019s by $10<br><br>Now what if Bob wants to send money to Charlie who banks with Citi.

What if Bob wanted to send $100 million? Now Wells Fargo opens themselves up to massive loss if Citi fails. In addition, transaction costs will add up. <br><br>Now think about how many banks there are. There are around 25,000 banks globally.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay.

Mountain biking here is kind of popular, biking is getting more popular tho because of high gas prices and mountain biking is done by richfags who already have their own bikes. There is already one such business where they rent out bikes in the city now that I think about it but those are street bikes. I like the idea of renting out sports equipment that you talked about because unlike bikes only it can be done all year round because of different sports. The thing is I have passion and drive to work because I&#039;m lower middle class but my main goal is to have a passive income. My family owns quiet a bit of land in the country side and I was thinking of doing something with that, like making trails there etc but that would take too much money which I don&#039;t have. As the anon below mentioned he does work on lawnmowers and that reminded me of an idea that I pitched to my friend. I was thinking of a business that would do housecleaning and yardwork on the houses of diaspora from my country. Most of them are loaded and since they spend most of their time out of the country they would need someone to take care of their property. Doing that doesn&#039;t seem hard the only issue is that they usually have low trust and are cheapstakes sometimes atleast from my experience.

These connections happen through liquidity pools. We create pairs, which then interact with other pairs that have one of the tokens in them, and thus creates a chain of price action when one in the pair moves. The actual movements here are extremely complicated and you would need vast amounts of data to even have an inkling of how much price movement of X effects Y. My 2nd point here is liquidity itself. If you have a high price of a token and you want to keep the price high, you either buy pressure to counteract sells, or you need a deep as fuck pool of liquidity in that sells dont move the price much at all. Having too much liquidity is an issue though, especially if you have a low price and want that price to go higher, in this example having a lot of liquidity protects the price from moving up(due to the nature of how our liquidity pools operate). This sort of thing can controlled via incentives, too much liquidity, kill incentives and people will leave, too little and add incentives, people will come. Now my theory: these liquidity incentives are being controlled by people trying to artificially move the market one way or the other. You want the price to crab, add a fuckton of liquidity, want a moon? Remove liquidity and shill the fuck out of things, while placing some small buys to move the price to generate FOMO. Want a crash, remove liquidity and add FUD.", "filename": "pondering", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 920, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 191, "tim": 1669311173109612, "time": 1669311173, "md5": "ZUkofFDSo/O+xx0rabRrjg==", "fsize": 40875, "resto": 0, "id": "Eu/+v1qx", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "greater-market-discussion", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 52600345, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)12:35:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52600322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52600322</a><br>Now my big question, are you anons seeing a drain of liquidity in the various markets?

The chain is EVM/cosmos hybrid which is really nice for various reasons. the entire basis for the chain is also to integrate various tools into the chain and treat them as public utilities. I will give you one example of this, there is a built in AMM into the chain, these contracts are not available via UI, instead they are contract only assets. This allows for protocols to build their own UI on top and add any additional features they would like to differentiate themselves from other offerings. The underlying contract has 0 fees involved as it is a public utility, however the DEX that builds can choose to add their own fee (they have other features to charge for). There is also the benefit that any contract that is created reserves a portion of the gas used on the contract and pays the contract creator for the contracts use. Its a really innovative way to attract protocols that have razor thin margins to migrate over to gain the gas fee sharing. There are lots of other ideas similar to these that are based on the concept of features being public utilities.", "time": 1669309212, "resto": 52598979, "id": "bLkeyb2l"}], "last_modified": 1669309212}, {"no": 52599619, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)11:26:39", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "DONT USE BISQ", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;bought $500 of BTC on BISQ </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;went to meet seller to complete purchase</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jumped by 3 guys</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they beat me up and stole my money and phone</span><br>I&#039;ll never use Bisq again.", "filename": "JS89308896", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 615, "h": 1138, "tn_w": 135, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669307199608878, "time": 1669307199, "md5": "vOoyBrz255Lo9MyNtaHBzg==", "fsize": 71920, "resto": 0, "id": "BQtXoBHU", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dont-use-bisq", "replies": 5, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 52599670, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)11:30:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52599619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52599619</a><br>larp or not, not my problem", "filename": "1668158979120970", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 725, "h": 442, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1669307402257506, "time": 1669307402, "md5": "C2wFPTb+Ue4xdjMJV79mTQ==", "fsize": 59637, "resto": 52599619, "id": "yAaAtxvb"}, {"no": 52599879, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)11:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52599619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52599619</a><br>country?", "time": 1669308526, "resto": 52599619, "id": "3i3de6HK"}, {"no": 52599892, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)11:49:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "should have settled using zelle", "time": 1669308588, "resto": 52599619, "id": "zLKY8R08"}, {"no": 52599907, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)11:50:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52599619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52599619</a><br>why do you want to buy $500 of bitcoin anyway?", "time": 1669308657, "resto": 52599619, "id": "aMaMOYwC"}, {"no": 52599979, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)11:58:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52599619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52599619</a><br>I looked like that once.
