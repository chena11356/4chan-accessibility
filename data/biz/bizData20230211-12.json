The fact that DvegaDtime is mathematically expressed as negative derivatives makes sense because time decay is clearly a price that every options holder has to pay. In order to make things easier have a look at the plots of vega and theta because you will immediately realize that both volatility and time decay have their highest and lowest values in the ATM area.

We won&#039;t help women, women are a trap you see. They can&#039;t fight, they can&#039;t hunt, they can&#039;t even have sex very good. But I guess we could keep the hot ones in a cellar somewhere. So what I&#039;d do eventually after taking over the ruins of a factory town and converting it into a foundry and powerbase to become a warlord is that I&#039;d give every man a government assigned gf. Because men have a good time going around hunting and stealing and fighting but they don&#039;t have a good time working in a factory or picking fruits on a large communal farm. But if you give them a hot chick they&#039;ll be like &quot;the boss is pretty cool and knows what he&#039;s doing&quot;. But you see, that&#039;s a trap, because they&#039;ll knock that thot up and then all their hair will fall out and they&#039;ll get a beer belly from drinking Post Apocalyptialcoholiccola (TM) while listening to their wife nag at them. Women are a depreciating asset, so why do men tie themselves to them? Turns out most men are fucking stupid. Women who don&#039;t have rich dads to bankroll a dowry are worthless, but people have poor business sense and don&#039;t realize this.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "qR5CBBA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2448, "h": 3264, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675632296838480, "time": 1675632296, "md5": "VV7a4UQAUxYJzK0m3Pd9Bw==", "fsize": 615391, "resto": 0, "id": "NFozmSdJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 269, "images": 90, "unique_ips": 109}, {"no": 53589412, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:26:53", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53546578#p53546578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546578</a>", "filename": "1653056374364", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675632413998658, "time": 1675632413, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53589386, "id": "NFozmSdJ"}, {"no": 53589428, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:27:50", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool.<br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it? Do I have to store GBs worth of data like when running an XMR node?</span><br><br>It is literally as easy as installing an Android app and no, there are no storage requirements, the node only consumes some bandwidth.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cool, I&#039;m sold.

First let them make a earthian GME-stockholder image board (tell gme to do so, since we, the stockholders, demand it) and then, if you want them, for example, sell metal vinyl disks, bring in the idea, and if enough of the cultmind is for it, we can bring it into existance.

There are 8Billion people, and I alone need at least 5 (better 6) gamecubes, for the perfect Zelda4swords and FF:CC setup). I dont even have to trust randoms, like on ebay, since the shipping goes through gme. I could even use the store as rate&amp;trade retro game pawn store.

In my example, you can see, where the weakpoints of gbas are, so you can then extrapolate by the rate of being played in houers and the total amount of GBAs ever minted how the price will move (up in this case). Now, if GME joins this market, before some other big players establish, it could generate lots of money by dominating this field.<br>I hope you could follow this thoughtprocess, if not, remember the first point: I dont care about you.", "filename": "1666906806778530", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1992, "h": 1673, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1676060069623733, "time": 1676060069, "md5": "JsR58n07edwDta0CcWX1XQ==", "fsize": 273652, "resto": 53661732, "id": "cB+1yTLY"}, {"no": 53662798, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)15:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "comfiness is rising.", "filename": "1663360073199354", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 514, "h": 606, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676060250532722, "time": 1676060250, "md5": "p77yO0ZLwbWgZ560WgXlvA==", "fsize": 72379, "resto": 53661732, "id": "4s65eNb9"}, {"no": 53662833, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)15:20:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fractal", "filename": "GME 1y vs 1d", "ext": ".png", "w": 1894, "h": 2242, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676060452858717, "time": 1676060452, "md5": "2qsNkDpExfYHygNrwBqmZw==", "fsize": 227230, "resto": 53661732, "id": "BqelSu4u"}, {"no": 53662836, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)15:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53662738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53662738</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it will be known IMMEDIATELY and GLOBALLY</span><br>kek", "filename": "welco", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 222, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1676060464346980, "time": 1676060464, "md5": "H4atgtbxJAQUNOUCl2TbxA==", "fsize": 253663, "resto": 53661732, "id": "DVSZ3j1o"}, {"no": 53662853, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)15:21:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53662265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53662265</a><br>The best part (and most terrifying for old money) is that we\u2019ll be able to use the gains from hedgecunts to buy majority stakes in every other company out there and bend them to our will.

Go ahead and sell one if you&#039;re scared. No, selling you one share will not cancel MOASS. Doesn&#039;t matter if you buy back either. So why would the retard make this up? Is he just stupid? Yes, but you would have to be a shill to say what this dumbass said. Shills are STILL being paid to post this crap. They are announcing that they are still scared you aren&#039;t selling.

They do. There can&#039;t be a buyer if there is no seller. You have to remember that there is supposed to be a finite amount of shares. You don&#039;t just say &quot;hey stock exchange ATM, I want to bug or sell one share for $5 please, because the number on my screen says $5 now&quot;. Nope, a person or an institution has to agree to sell you a share they previously bought with their real money. If you ask to sell for $5, and noone says they want to sell for $5, even though the number on the computer screen says $5, you will not be able to sell one for $5. You will receive no money unless you change your price to where someone says yes. I&#039;m not trying to be a dick, but this is for anyone who has never really thought about it. I just discovered a couple of friends never thought about it, and just kind of thought you traded in your shares to the stock market foe the price it is at the time. The stock market just gave you your money. Naked shorting does make it hard to explain there always has to be a buyer and a seller. Yes, their illegal tactics fuck up supply/demand though. But it&#039;s still good for them to know the concept. You&#039;d be surprised how many have no understanding whatsoever.<br><br>But if hedge funds wanted to close their shorts (100&#039;s of millions), they would need retail (us) to agree to sell them 100&#039;s of millions of shares for a huge loss by selling at $5. That ain&#039;t happening. And if it gets way too low, it&#039;s over b/c 100% will be direct registered. It&#039;s why they have kept it above $15. They are scared yo go too low.

This reason this token is genuis is because they make mobile games and the LIS token is used ingame to speed up progress so there is allways damand for the token. When the exchange price of the token increases they increase the ingame price to encourage price apreciation. This is what we saw back in the soul days. Soul did a 20x. I was shilling sould every fucking day on biz, none of you fuckers listed. I bellived in the project so much I paid an indian guy to shill it here. I invested what I had which unfortunalty wasent much. This time Im hoping to see the same thing happen again. The supply of LIS is 35 million and the in game price is $0.135 usd.
