This is like laughing at the man with an umbrella while it&#039;s raining outside. When the economy inevitably deleverages, real value will fundamentally change.

It is too large, and the resource transfer too large, to actually exist. The ponzi is exposed if you can understand and care to look at it. $46TN massive black hole of financial assets all set and ready to go &quot;poof&quot; with everyone from individuals, corporations, financial institutions, banks, insurance companies, governments, foreign governments all running for the door. <br>Inflation is already catastophically high and interest rates need to rise. but they CANT without forcing a default via default risk. And why would you want to hold an asset hemorrhaging 15%+ of its value. You know, 10% of the $46TN bond market is a pretty large percentage of our GDP that is only $22TN. Worried yet?

You have the benefit of religiously watching the price of a single stock. You might not believe it, but we all know we are pretty damn close to the bottom in terms of price.

The easiest way to escape is to price gouge on resell... but nobody is buying anymore. A similar story is happening in the real estate market. I do agree with your sentiment that this bubble needs to pop but it seems already a little to late, greedy financiers are the reason this country is going to tank thanks to their neverending tirade of devaluing the dollar.

I didn&#039;t believe them at first and when I was little I&#039;d say &quot;I want to climb on the roof like you one day!&quot; and they would laugh and pat me on the back and say &quot;No you&#039;re not. You&#039;re going to college.&quot; And to enforce this my dad put me to work in roofing in the summers in high school. After 4 summers of that I can safely say I am glad that&#039;s not me and I&#039;m not tarnishing my family wish to see me be successful in an easier way. I would say the worst part in working construction, even worse than the pay and conditions is the absolute bottom of the barrel kinds of people you work with. Granted my dad owned the company so I worked with him mostly and I was shielded from these types, but I still saw a lot of their antics. <br><br>So you want some more tradespeople? You&#039;re hurting for it? Not my problem. I firmly believe that any slack left by zoomers in the construction industry will (if it hasn&#039;t already) be picked up by hispanics. The pol schizos can say what they want about them but they work harder than anyone else and the old meme that their work isn&#039;t good is starting to crack as there are so many of them that some really good tradesmen are rising to the top. I know 4chan loves to look at the trades with rose tinted glasses but it&#039;s really a bad lifestyle.

Here\u2019s are some protips: if you don\u2019t have fifty million, you are not wealthy or successful. That\u2019s called upper middle class and you are just novelty rich. If you don\u2019t have one hundred million, and for Americans, two hundred million, you\u2019re not wealthy. My family for instance is upper class because I know our net worth does not accumulate past two hundred million.<br><br>Finally, let\u2019s say you do somehow generate fifty million minimum by your thirties, like my grandfather did when he was younger. Are you going to have children? No? So your existence means nothing, and no personal experiences you have matter and we don\u2019t need to care about your opinions or status because you\u2019re going to not be relevant in the future. So that leaves yes, you will or do have children. Do you know how to raise them? Do you know how to discipline them? You have no clue, and it\u2019s because you don\u2019t know how to keep generational wealth because you have never had generational wealth in your family. My family takes the idea very seriously, we had wealth before but due to incompetences it was lost in the Great Depression. My grandfather had to earn much of his fortune back. He taught his father how to raise real humans and not slave cattle, because he still comes from relatively blue WASP blood.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Dec2022", "ext": ".png", "w": 881, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 227, "tim": 1674967153121325, "time": 1674967153, "md5": "ag5BhOXv0T0piQrOMS12vQ==", "fsize": 261950, "resto": 0, "id": "GYt1JLiW", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 122, "images": 63, "unique_ips": 63}, {"no": 53479405, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53410417#p53410417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410417</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674967234895521, "time": 1674967234, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479406, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "comfiest hold", "filename": "anonymous psycho", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1107, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967238375027, "time": 1674967238, "md5": "FdGA/H8bh56WZ2bMRMIHkA==", "fsize": 286689, "resto": 53479388, "id": "/Ar04N/D"}, {"no": 53479417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Growing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of a Monero-only standard are what guarantee that when the Crypto Casino finally implodes Monero will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero. Monero&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed that the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die Monero will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it?

I timed the pump at 16.2 with 20x leverage and kept chipping away my stop loss fund over the course of a week until we finally pumped to 19k. Another anon says don\u2019t use a ton of leverage but I had a friend that saw CZ tweet and immediately glued himself to the screen ready to short 100x. If you look at charts there was a nine hour gap before intense plummet, whales raped a ton of shorts before the actual drop, he played thin stop loss and made over 200k overall. I\u2019m not that gutsy like him but he\u2019s the one who taught me to begin with. It really is not hard to win leverage, just play news and don\u2019t get raped by whales who know newbs will try and short news. Short when the whales short. For comparison, one whale made over thirty million alone shorting FTX fiasco, so if he has to short during that there is a moment that exists where he physically has to open the trade. Short when the whales short. My suggestion, if leverage is troublesome for you, is to play with 100 dollar trades and just try to predict until you feel ready. If like you say your intuiting is above average, you CAN make money with leverage.

That&#039;s why it&#039;s an existential crisis, if you&#039;re doubting the cryptographic strengths and checks behind HW wallets you also have to think critically about the software developer for non-HW wallet devices.<br><br>Everything hypothetically has a backdoor, but how likely they are to have one should be looked into. At the very least if you aren&#039;t comfortable with generating your seed on the device, you&#039;re not removing any security by generating a key off-device and importing it to your HW-wallet (aside from the probability of your other device being infected, which actually is a more likely scenario than the HW wallet being compromised). If you&#039;re worried about USB communications get an airgapped HW-wallet that only communicates via QR code and never use the manufacturer&#039;s applications (Metamask can read QR signatures just fine). It gives you the same security as the airgapped laptop, only you can actually use your crypto.<br><br><a href=\"#p53504540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53504540</a><br>The discussion of shamir and multisig wallets didn&#039;t pertain to HW wallets specifically.

Early Christian converts were told to use Godan&#039;s name (God: \u16b7\u16df\u16de), in order to supplant their Native religion with the new Judaic sect that worships Yahweh.<br><br>God is not Yahweh and Yahweh is not God. Yahweh&#039;s name (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4) isn&#039;t God (\u16b7\u16df\u16de). Godan is the only god whose name is God (\u16b7\u16df\u16de). Yahweh and Godan are two very different gods from two different continents. The Middle Eastern Yahweh (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4) is not a god of European origin, unlike Godan, who is. Neither is Godan the god of the Bible, the jewish god Yahweh is.<br><br>Godan/Goden (which is what the Lombards called him) comes from Wodan/Woden (which still today is Oden in Swedish), which is Odin. In proto-Germanic it&#039;s Wodanaz.

Macro discussion", "com": "There are only two big metrics that seem to matter to me, in terms of 1. crypto-specifics and 2. macro/USD.<br><br>1. Crypto blue chip mcap generally less inflationary than fiat due to its own hard-coded monetary policies, scarcity, etc.<br>2. The economy&#039;s predictable boom-and-bust cycles, arguably determined by the fed rates. &quot;the new 2008&quot;, etc. <br><br>Currently it seems like crypto is fucked against the dollar because the dollar is scarce. But on the longer term horizon, it&#039;s still the obvious reason why crypto will continue going up against the dollar, as another cycle of inflation and cheap money resumes.<br><br>Shorter term:<br>- 2023 will be a crabbing year, it&#039;ll be remembered as &quot;the recession year&quot;, or &quot;soft reset&quot; meant to stabilize inflation but I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll see another steep crash again. Rates hikes pessimism priced in, etc.<br>- 2024 will be another stabilizing year, but with more of a positive slow heal narrative.<br>- 2025: money cheaper, markets healed, new boom cycle til ~2032<br>- 2026: new ATHs<br><br>Only real threat to USD hegemony is supposedly China but it is still a paper tiger.
