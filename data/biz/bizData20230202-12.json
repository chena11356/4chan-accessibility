The president of the U.K. Faculty of Public Health told the Daily Mail that a 4day workweek could help lower blood pressure and increase mental health among employees. Jay Love of Slingshot SEO saw his employee-retention rate shoot up when he phased in three-day weekends. Following this line of thought, TreeHouse, an online education platform implemented a four-day week to attract workers, which has contributed to the company&#039;s growth.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The five-day workweek might already have so much cultural intertia that it can\u2019t be changed. Most companies can\u2019t just tell employees not to come in on Fridays, because they&#039;d be at a disadvantage in a world that favors the five-day workweek.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there\u2019s a creative solution to this problem. David Stephens, a consultant based in Houston, detailed in a post on LinkedIn the clever system devised at a company he used to work for. The company was divided into two teams. One would work from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, and the other would work those hours from Tuesday to Friday. The teams would switch schedules every week, so every two-day weekend would be followed by a four-day weekend. The results, Stephens reports, were positive. The company was open five days a week, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. instead of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. He claims that morale skyrocketed. Employees took fewer sick days, visiting the doctor in off hours rather than during the workday.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this scenario, employees still work 40-hour weeks, but they do so over the course of four days rather than five. This arrangement still sounds sub-optimal, though, as working at full capacity for 10 hours is more demanding than doing so for eight. Despite that, the employees at Stephens\u2019s company still preferred 40 hours in four days to 40 hours in five days. They might be even happier\u2014and work even better\u2014if they worked fewer hours in addition to fewer days.</span>", "time": 1675321102, "resto": 53538313, "id": "0Z+qpmgo"}, {"no": 53538374, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)01:59:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53538324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53538324</a><br>I\u2019d rather do 32 hours too but I\u2019d still prefer 40 in 4 days than 5 days<br><a href=\"#p53538329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53538329</a><br>I agree", "time": 1675321180, "resto": 53538313, "id": "0Z+qpmgo"}, {"no": 53538454, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)02:08:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53538313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53538313</a><br>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but we should do what Keynes said<br>15 hour work weeks", "time": 1675321714, "resto": 53538313, "id": "0BF0vs86"}, {"no": 53539371, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)04:38:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I dont wanna work 40 hours no matter how u slice it.

The 8 hour work week was fought for, it wasn&#039;t some kind of cultural enlightenment on the part of business owners. Also, the most productive work is done in the manufacturing and resource extraction industries of the non-western world, so unproductive work dominates in the west. Finance, tech, and government jobs, retail and services, NGOs, venture capital, etc. etc. If you look at it that way, it&#039;s shocking that westerners have to work so hard. So why is that? Other than what&#039;s already been mentioned, greater leisure time would mean people have more time to think and organize about the things they care about. Including politics. So rather than just having boomer and silent gen retirees being more politically active, there&#039;d be larger movements driven by younger generations. Younger generations that aren&#039;t getting much for all their hard work and are concerned by things like global warming. That&#039;s not good, not good at all. Markets like stability and the 8 hour work week provides that. Enough time to consoom while pummeling people with stress and debt so they&#039;re too exhausted to be what a democracy is supposed to have: an active and concerned citizenry.", "filename": "1668997827713191", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 573, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1675339188077678, "time": 1675339188, "md5": "ELSAZnsZQ5dF9Fs3KabOLA==", "fsize": 91545, "resto": 53538313, "id": "cDm7Rpp7"}, {"no": 53540503, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:17:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53540054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53540054</a><br>fuck that only losers will no social life want to go to work 6 days a week", "time": 1675340260, "resto": 53538313, "id": "k844dskH"}, {"no": 53540526, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53538313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53538313</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WHAT IN THE HELL WOULD I EVEN DO WITH AN EXTRA DAY ON THE WEEKEND?

Assuming incomes stay similar, the person with 2 mil can quit working and spend several years burning down that extra 1 million of newly inflated money, while doing nothing productive at all to sustain themselves.<br><br>QE was effectively a massive subsidy for retirees and the ultra-wealthy. A trap to get millennials to buy into a system that offers them nothing in return. Yet not everyone is as blind as they&#039;d expect.

What happens? Typically, we think of central bank policy as affecting real economic activity\u2014employment, unemployment, gross domestic product, for example\u2014through its effects on the real interest rate r. But, as is widely accepted by macroeconomists, these effects dissipate in the long run.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Dec2022", "ext": ".png", "w": 881, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 227, "tim": 1674967153121325, "time": 1674967153, "md5": "ag5BhOXv0T0piQrOMS12vQ==", "fsize": 261950, "resto": 0, "id": "GYt1JLiW", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 265, "images": 113, "unique_ips": 108}, {"no": 53479405, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53410417#p53410417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410417</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674967234895521, "time": 1674967234, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479406, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "comfiest hold", "filename": "anonymous psycho", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1107, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967238375027, "time": 1674967238, "md5": "FdGA/H8bh56WZ2bMRMIHkA==", "fsize": 286689, "resto": 53479388, "id": "/Ar04N/D"}, {"no": 53479417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

If we\u2019re 3 halvings into 32 total halvings, then the estimated break even point for miners at current hashrate going into the last halving would be:<br><br>$22,000 * (2^27) = $2,952,790,016,000 per BTC<br><br>$2,952,790,016,000 per BTC * 21 Million total Bitcoin = $62,008,590,336,000,000,000 BTC Market Cap<br><br>The block rewards shrink so fast that after enough halvings Bitcoin would eventually require a $2.95 trillion price per Bitcoin and a $62 quintillion market cap to sustain the current cost of $7.15 billion/year.<br><br>Even if these numbers were somehow realistic, can you imagine securing a $62 quintillion market cap on only $7.15 billion/year of hashrate? LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967550498520, "time": 1674967550, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479528, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:52:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479388</a><br>Remember to teach your children about Monero.", "filename": "father teaches daughter about Monero", "ext": ".png", "w": 1488, "h": 1488, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674967975748895, "time": 1674967975, "md5": "IA9aY6yr2O8cKXnx0wYfAQ==", "fsize": 3128011, "resto": 53479388, "id": "hxWhAu08"}, {"no": 53479593, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:01:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "for russian monero-chads:<br>we have thread here <br>2ch.life/cc/res/839934.html", "time": 1674968497, "resto": 53479388, "id": "TSXvNt3D"}, {"no": 53479619, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:04:16", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674261391277545", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2176, "h": 3200, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674968656514531, "time": 1674968656, "md5": "YrMEeTOm/GlA4k4iCLs2nw==", "fsize": 1488978, "resto": 53479388, "id": "Zdcl3ipM"}, {"no": 53479756, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:20:59", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674969659484479, "time": 1674969659, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53479388, "id": "qtvM3HDJ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53479915, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trusted technology, growing adoption</span><br><br>Zcash was launched by one of the most respected technical teams in the world.<br><br>Zcash is the &#039;https of blockchains,&#039; protecting your freedom to save and spend as you like.<br><br>Zcash was the first project to implement zk-SNARKs, a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography that gives its users the strongest privacy available in any digital currency.<br><br>Multiple, independent organizations are funded to innovate on Zcash.<br><br>Zcash is already available on top exchanges, digital wallets and a growing number of applications.", "filename": "1621943471634", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1116, "h": 1166, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674971055828570, "time": 1674971055, "md5": "9CbmIjABh69hCgSvb/J4QQ==", "fsize": 218045, "resto": 53479388, "id": "pstI2t3M"}, {"no": 53479927, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:46:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is what Monero chuds don&#039;t want you to know.<br><br>Buy Zcash if you actually want to make it.", "filename": "G63gsFs7wbnasGVs3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1145, "h": 3404, "tn_w": 42, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674971161010922, "time": 1674971161, "md5": "XVHgUjHmgaGUqs4ONbqRLA==", "fsize": 1345614, "resto": 53479388, "id": "pstI2t3M"}, {"no": 53480031, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:04:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479915</a><br><a href=\"#p53479927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479927</a><br>Nice try z-niggers.

My first job out of college was in accounting and I hated it. That&#039;s not the job I&#039;m talking about. After getting fired for intentionally screwing with a few numbers for shits and giggles (I was gonna change them back after someone got the joke) I landed a job as a security guard for the same office building that held my accounting job. I tried to get another accounting job but with my history that wasn&#039;t gonna happen. Briefly tried for some accounting adjacent stuff like entry level finance but they didn&#039;t call back. The whole time I was getting really into marijuana and therefore was getting pretty fed up with the whole interview process. And I remembered the security guards being kinda normal people that just greeted you or whatever and generally stood around, had desks, didn&#039;t seem to have any way of being micro managed or anything. So I applied with them and they are I guess always understaffed so I got an offer pretty much right away.<br><br>Pay was shit, but the fringe benefits were great. Tons of sex on the job. Drugs. I saw a bunch of my old accounting crew all the time and would get drinks comped after work. I could let in the c suite exec&#039;s hookers or mistresses without the senpai ever finding out. I could deliver, you know? It wasn&#039;t just a paycheck. It was a party and a service. <br><br>Eventually I got in tight with a few of the real big guys and they asked me to kind of represent them or whatever from the security side. Just of that building at the time but they had houses everywhere and private security that they employed and whatever. So the stakes seemed kinda high, the pay for being in with them was clearly good. We went to dinner one night, me and three of them, and we were drinking whiskey and just talking the shit when the waitress came by and, I don&#039;t know wtf got into me but I was definitely feeling good and trying to impress them, and I told her &quot;You had me at hello&quot; and she smiled as my hand...", "time": 1675302635, "resto": 53534642, "id": "A7KYq52Y"}, {"no": 53535395, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:51:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53535225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53535225</a><br>I didn\u2019t work in tech support but my brother did.
