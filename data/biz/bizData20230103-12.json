For most of the newgrounds/abs content decay, I think the big reason for the drag of most modern content is the lack of soul. Most of these services offered no compensation for the content produced. It was mostly done for fun. Majority of these content producers were kids in highschool and early college. Once the content creators started to migrate to youtube to host their content in pursuit of revenue that took a lot of that creative energy behind it and drained it away. Once youtube&#039;s algorithm started punishing long form content, and promoted the use of short form content all hope of long form content decayed away. Theres some still around, meatcanyon and flashgitz while crude are still very succesful at long form content.<br><br>Part two, (which is related to part one) is that we grew up. Content we found engaging is different from those that kids now enjoy. Your parents said the same stuff about the things you found great as a kid, and the current zoomers are going to say the same thing about the following generation. That being said, I will say that kids and zoomers take so much at face value and are completely oblivious to how manipulative the content they are exposed to is.<br><br>When watching any sort of short form media, always ask yourself &quot;Is this video made for fun,f or a greater good, or for clout&quot;?

A handful of countries could easily take control of Bitcoin, and in fact China single-handedly could have done that when they banned mining, but they just decided not to. Bitcoin wasn&#039;t attacked because the CCP literally just didn&#039;t feel like it. Also ASIC production is another heavily centralized factor, which could also easily be taken control of. ASIC chains, from start to finish, are all about centralization.<br><br>Monero is only weaker RIGHT NOW because the market cap and therefore mining rewards are a lot lower than Bitcoin. ASICs significantly increase the barrier to entry: Hashrate is proportionally higher on CPU chains because that barrier is eliminated. Aside from the fact that obtaining mass amounts of consumer hardware isn&#039;t as easy as you seem to think, each dollar of security budget is spent a lot more efficiently on CPU chains because proportionally more people are mining on it. To summarize: On ASIC chains, miners pay for hardware and electricity, and attackers do the same. On CPU chains, miners only pay for electricity (because it&#039;s not economically rational to buy dedicated new mining rigs, and so excess profitability is just eaten up by other miners), while attackers pay for hardware AND electricity.<br><br>Even if obtaining a fuckton of consumer hardware was easier than obtaining as many ASICs (it&#039;s not), attackers are still fighting a larger opponent.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;monero would maybe be harder if it had much more nodes</span><br><br>That&#039;s not how nakamoto consensus works.", "time": 1672710288, "resto": 53090277, "id": "9gjxzZVF"}, {"no": 53112003, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)20:45:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53111670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53111670</a><br>All you&#039;ve said is that you choose to completely ignore blockstream and LN despite how important they are, that the block size will be lifted despite bitcoiners universally stating that&#039;ll never happen and treating the 1MB limit as gospel. <br><br>Given how centralized the miners are, and how transparent the Bitcoin blockchain is it&#039;s much more censorable, as has been demonstrated time and again.<br><br>The only things you&#039;ve said about Monero are to regurgitate the vague, tired inflation bug and network attack fud, despite Monero coinbase txs being unencrypted, a successful attack never being executed, no evidence of an inflation bug ever being provided, and no one ever having been traced through Monero.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "PimpHand", "ext": ".png", "w": 961, "h": 999, "tn_w": 240, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672398550412929, "time": 1672398550, "md5": "wjrnsq7UPwnatHvBo8meng==", "fsize": 798594, "resto": 0, "id": "3CYHBxFm", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 229, "images": 63, "unique_ips": 95}, {"no": 53070970, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:10:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52999274#p52999274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999274</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672398647970535, "time": 1672398647, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53070979, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672398907889153, "time": 1672398907, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53071009, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:16:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

It&#039;s important to think of things like the Kadena public network as a particular backend for the Pact language, not in terms of the blockchain being the focal point, with the language supporting it. In fact, Pact is the main selilng point here with Kadena being a particular implementation of a compatible backend. So far, we&#039;ve shown that Tendermint, Kadena, Kuro, and several others in the works can be the kind of web 3.0 backend that people are looking for in modern app design, and so far i think we&#039;re the only ones to do it. Granted, we&#039;re not there yet: Pact is still clunky (we&#039;re working on a complete internal rewrite called Pact Core to be released this year), and the multichain/wallet UX isn&#039;t good. However, I have a lot of bullish hope that our focuses on UX/DX this year will result in something like Apple for blockchains: apps that work together seamlessly, agnostic of blockchain, with at least one very good, scalable architecture available with deep integration into Pact&#039;s features.<br><br><a href=\"#p53109286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53109286</a><br><br>&lt;3", "filename": "FjvotK2XEAI4a0B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 160, "h": 152, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1672726284938121, "time": 1672726284, "md5": "iaETnqcZDOzRZ/BntUqZ4w==", "fsize": 7157, "resto": 53108193, "id": "M8K25Ndc", "trip": "!7Rie0abK/A"}, {"no": 53114303, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)01:20:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53109635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53109635</a><br>Oasis Rose is at 120 now.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

speaking on PRQ<br><br>3 reasons why PRQ &gt; GRT<br><br>1. Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This takes a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant! Rather, it is only to point out that, when looking at the case at hand (i.e., ease for both back-end and front-end development), they are not the top choice.<br><br>THERE IS NO NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED DATA EXTRACTION WHEN THE DATA IS ALREADY COMING FROM DECENTRALIZED BLOCKS!!! The decentralization is only necessary in proving the data hasn\u2019t been tampered with.

It has permanent and irrevisble consequences, ruins the protective function of the cornea and predisposes the eye to infection, chronic dryness, and an effective drastic reduction in peripheral resolution.

Most things in crypto are obviously some kind of scheme/scam. The truth is though, that the government and central banks are devising their own digital currency for the purpose of control and transparency(to them). If they switched from dollars to CBDCs they could basically stop all black market activity and collect tax revenue on everything, which is why they got rid of 500 and 1000 dollar bills years ago. It would of course go a long way for catching and stopping criminals too. On the other hand, privacy coins like XMR allow people to move money around privately and anonymously, circumventing all the aforementioned stuff. It&#039;s not just useful for drug cartels and criminal organizations either, because there&#039;s always going to be people looking to do shit without the government being involved like paying employees under the table. Sending a digital currency on a computer is easier than giving a gazillion fiat bills or sending a check if someone isn&#039;t actually right next to you and is working remotely or something. So there&#039;s your utility: privacy and transparency.

The total calculation: 4.99 times as much work. Estimates and extrapolations were made in this way for thousands of services. (Cataract surgery was estimated to involve slightly less work than a hysterectomy.) Overhead and training costs were factored in. Eventually, Hsiao and his team arrived at a relative value for every single thing doctors do. Some specialists were outraged by particular estimates. But Congress set a multiplier to convert the relative values into dollars, the new fee schedule was signed into law, and in 1992 Medicare started paying doctors accordingly. Private insurers followed shortly thereafter (although they applied somewhat different multipliers, depending on the deals they struck with local physicians).</span><br><br>https://slate.com/news-and-politics<wbr>/2009/09/the-hidden-public-private-<wbr>cartel-that-sets-health-care-prices<wbr>.html<br><br>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/<wbr>2005/04/04/piecework<br><br><br>This is why America has a different healthcare pricing than the entire world.
