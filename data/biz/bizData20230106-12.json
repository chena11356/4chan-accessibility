It is like any other business and I&#039;m just remaking a popular browser game for the roblox audience. <br><br>One takeaway I have is that it is MUCH harder to get your game popular if you don&#039;t have &quot;robux&quot; already - roblox has very low discoverability for new games unless you can advertise it. Because my account is so old it had expensive items I sold to advertise my game, and if I didn&#039;t I would probably not even pursue the platform. Although there are some games that make eight figures a month, they also have teams of people and for every successful game there are tons of passion projects by high schoolers who spent hundreds of hours on it only to make absolutely nothing. <br><br>I guess it is a business like any other - I am not making a passion project, I am making a game I think will be popular (and has high money-making potential). One popular formula for a successful game on roblox is remaking a game that is popular on another platform. <br><br>I&#039;m guessing the whole game-making process (starting from nothing) is taking me 180 hours overall to official release? And I&#039;m also making a game that is more difficult than I had thought.

Now I only buy silver when it&#039;s near the cost of production (around 20-21 USD), because I&#039;m no longer married to my investment, I can see things logically and clearly over long periods of time to limit my downside risk. I&#039;ve diversified into multiple different assets and I&#039;m no longer deluded into thinking a few thousand dollar investment will be my lottery ticket. The fact is most of us are poor and better off spending time managing our money (spending less) and working harder in areas which pay us well for our time, than to obsess for weeks on end over breadcrumbs and conspiracies.

If not just throw whatever decent wager that wouldn&#039;t be devastating for you to lose. If you&#039;ll throw a few hundred into a shitcoin then I see no reason you wouldn&#039;t be willing to gamble on LUNC. I know every shitcoin and their grandmother says this, but there&#039;s a very active community behind LUNC. It is constantly trending on Twitter and it gets a lot of attention on CMC. The development team is in a bit of a slump now that what remains of Terra Rebels has been publicly revealed to be talentless and treacherous kikes, but many of those who left TR are now working on their own thing without all the kikery, which is extremely bullish. Plus you can&#039;t forget about the CZ element of this. He has openly stated that he has obtained LUNC after the crash and has not sold any of it. He is also willingly burning millions of Binance&#039;s profits in support of the burn efforts. Do you think he would do that for any random shitcoin?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REALISTIC price prediction for this year if development is made?</span><br>Being completely realistic and not having crazy expectations for what arises from the ashes of Terra Rebels, I&#039;d say we could be looking at 0.005 eoy if we make decent progress with development and burns and macro conditions improve for crypto. If macro conditions don&#039;t get much better then we could just be looking at a year of steadily crabbing upwards. If we get incredibly lucky and Zaradar really is a 400IQ autist who is capable of repegging USTC which in turn really does burn as munch LUNC as he says it does due to swaps then $1 is absolutely possible. Again, that is in the absolute best case scenario where everything works out perfectly with LUNC developments, there are no more FTX collapses this year, and macro conditions become more favorable.", "filename": "cz_thanos", "ext": ".png", "w": 1350, "h": 1022, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1672865193540211, "time": 1672865193, "md5": "OqBnx705AeZrMSmqnhsneQ==", "fsize": 1441983, "resto": 53135172, "id": "ltNoWnb3"}, {"no": 53135376, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)15:46:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53135250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53135250</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REALISTIC price prediction for this year if development is made?</span><br><br>$0", "time": 1672865201, "resto": 53135172, "id": "rHRuHFU8"}, {"no": 53135438, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)15:51:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53135373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53135373</a><br>Based.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1665111209950096", "ext": ".png", "w": 2048, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672856299229804, "time": 1672856299, "md5": "99FqpLhnxQy8HQogarWrIA==", "fsize": 1716837, "resto": 0, "id": "hffpt4Si", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 169, "images": 47, "unique_ips": 89}, {"no": 53133356, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pedophilia coin", "time": 1672856420, "resto": 53133327, "id": "ymtrQXOI"}, {"no": 53133362, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53070955#p53070955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070955</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672856436957646, "time": 1672856436, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53133327, "id": "hffpt4Si"}, {"no": 53133376, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset.

Long before you knew Leemon Baird as the creator of Hbar and Hedera I was attending Dr. Leemon Baird\u2019s Bible studies on Saturdays. My favorite study was his study on James 3 and controlling the tongue. Hear me out, I have a bad habit of saying fuck, so Dr. Leemon asked if he could personally come to my home so that we could do a study together. Of course I agree, but this is where it gets weird. He shows up at my house with a briefcase and is smiling maniacally. We sit in the couch and after hydrating from PT I need to go to the bathroom and as I\u2019m peeing I feel a hand come across my shoulder. It turns me around and pushes me onto the toilet. I see him open the briefcase and in it there is pictures of other airman with their heads scabbed and shaved. All of a sudden I hear, \u201c would you like a haircut?\u201d Before I could answer I feel a blade come across my head and I can feel my flesh tearing. He proceeds to quote scripture about men with filthy mouths. At this point I\u2019m bleeding and after he\u2019s done he socks me in the mouth. I\u2019m laying on the floor undies at my knees semi-unconscious and the next thing I remember is him taking a camera out of the briefcase and then foot stomping me in the face. I wake up with dried blood on the toilet and a shaved head.

Wisconsin\u2019s coveted northern white sand was proving too expensive to transport to sites across the country. Many companies migrated to Texas, closer to fracking operations that extract oil and gas. But one Texas-based company, Smart Sand Inc., is making a comeback in Wisconsin.<br><br>According to Wisconsin Public Radio, the company reported a 41% increase in sales of northern white sand during the third quarter of 2022. Recently, he company\u2019s sales double year after year. A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission offered a clarifying view into why frac sand mining in Wisconsin is on a momentary rebound.<br><br>Demand for oil and gas dipped during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent years have seen a rebound in that demand, and then the invasion of Ukraine occurred. \u201cThe ongoing conflict in the Ukraine has contributed to dramatic swings in oil and natural gas prices and significant volatility in the oilfield service sector,\u201d the filing states. \u201cAdditionally, current high inflation and other economic factors could lead to a global economic recession that could have a negative impact on global oil and natural gas demand, which may lead to continued volatility in the oil field service sector. We cannot predict if positive pricing trends will continue or if sand prices will increase, decrease, or stabilize.\u201d<br><br>For now, northern white sand has become more valuable. The Smart Sand Inc. filing states that the sand, which is primarily found in Wisconsin, has logistical advantages in regions from the Appalachian basin to Colorado to Wyoming and Canada. \u201cWe expect demand for our frac sand to continue to be supported by customers who are focused on long-term well performance", "time": 1672929209, "resto": 53115780, "id": "H9qr3+We"}, {"no": 53143276, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)09:33:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53142050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53142050</a><br><a href=\"#p53142070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53142070</a><br>Scottie up almost 10% early, just hit a 12 month high", "filename": "1671938954702121", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672929229509595, "time": 1672929229, "md5": "EyZrUcNOWAZuMzLPZpytmQ==", "fsize": 38343, "resto": 53115780, "id": "2OufLzww"}, {"no": 53143295, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)09:35:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53115780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53115780</a><br>Imagine buying gold at ATH. <br>Noob nigger boomers", "filename": "1A65827E-209B-450E-9BA4-10EA17CA3BED", "ext": ".png", "w": 1242, "h": 2208, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672929312389970, "time": 1672929312, "md5": "Vh+KRbNRxkEJDjL4MYR6yA==", "fsize": 375881, "resto": 53115780, "id": "AXV9yXRL"}, {"no": 53143540, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)09:53:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53143295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53143295</a><br>Imagine being a crypto fag.", "time": 1672930410, "resto": 53115780, "id": "P0bUSqzJ"}, {"no": 53143882, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)10:25:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53143540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53143540</a><br>Keep buying the top gramps", "time": 1672932338, "resto": 53115780, "id": "AXV9yXRL"}, {"no": 53143950, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)10:32:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53143295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53143295</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ath</span><br>This nigger can&#039;t even into one year chart.

The issue is doing that has a massive up-front cost and most of the existing foundations that help the homeless misappropriate the funding they are given so there&#039;s a huge disincentive to do something that would make way more money than was ever put into it, the same way every dollar the US spends on education ends up making the country as a whole something like 10-15$", "time": 1672988465, "resto": 53153287, "id": "RnfXmlNB"}, {"no": 53154581, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:02:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53153287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53153287</a><br>google homeless man learns to code", "time": 1672988531, "resto": 53153287, "id": "1i6PW5oV"}, {"no": 53154807, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:39:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53153287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53153287</a><br>military and invest", "time": 1672990776, "resto": 53153287, "id": "SvIoQ0xM"}, {"no": 53154859, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:48:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "church", "time": 1672991312, "resto": 53153287, "id": "C4gkyfhv"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53151213, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)19:43:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ITT we discuss 2023 financial predictions.", "filename": "musk", "ext": ".png", "w": 510, "h": 543, "tn_w": 234, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672965814049389, "time": 1672965814, "md5": "4j0kVMYLrr7MCH+QSsrxzQ==", "fsize": 578176, "resto": 0, "id": "IC2Al/3e", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "itt-we-discuss-2023-financial-predictions", "replies": 13, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 14}, {"no": 53151223, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)19:44:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53151213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53151213</a><br>down", "time": 1672965857, "resto": 53151213, "id": "PjHE4io/"}, {"no": 53151278, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)19:48:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53151213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53151213</a><br>shlomos fart &amp; shart market", "time": 1672966124, "resto": 53151213, "id": "v17UmXhC"}, {"no": 53151296, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)19:49:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53151213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53151213</a><br>Fake bullrun sometime in April, BTC returns to 30k but stalls out there", "time": 1672966198, "resto": 53151213, "id": "ucktjtQf"}, {"no": 53151407, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)20:01:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53151213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53151213</a><br>Elon steps down from twitter, friend larry ellison joins in.
