I already knew we were the descendants of Koxinga aka Zheng cheng-gung \u912d\u6210\u529f, Lord of the Emperial Surname and the king of Nanping, now known as Taiwan. But ive also discovered the fact that we are direct descendants of Zheng He, the Great Voyager of the Ming dynasty who discovered America way before Columbus did. Also the fact that the surname Zheng, comes from the royal bloodline of the Zhou dynasty(225bc). How complicated huh.

It&#039;s also worth noting that the maximum number of transactions per block is not a fixed number and can change over time. For example in 2017 they increased it from 1 to 2 mb.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is what a speculation only asset leads to, you have to find bigger funds to sell to.</span><br>Bitcoin is not only used for speculation, but it&#039;s also as a means of exchange and a store of value. While it may be more expensive to use Bitcoin for high frequency transactions. Some people are willing to pay higher fees for the security and decentralization that it offers. In addition, some use BTC to send and receive payments globaly because it&#039;s faster then legacy systems.

These aliens are millions of years ahead of us and their technology consists of using an undiscovered type of wave. These waves can do things like cause hallucinations, make things appear out of nowhere, and communicate among other things.<br><br>Another weird thing is that he was living a completely normal life prior to the event that triggered this. What triggered this? He started meditating because school was stressing him out. One time he was in deep trance, he encountered an entity. And ever since that moment, he&#039;s claimed that the aliens have been fucking with him.<br><br>They&#039;ve revealed themselves to him. Wouldnt let him sleep. Threatening him. Mocking him. Mentally fucking with him. There&#039;s an event where he claims they made a dollar bill appear on his lap. A store he would know people at would randomly have an entire new staff.<br><br>He claims they have made things appear out of thin air, they are overly obsessed with sex, they feed on our suffering, and they take over our minds. They are interdimentional, reality bending beings. Gods. One day, he had enough.<br><br>Its a long story but he targeted one of these aliens controlling a human. A pastor at the church he regularly attended (because the aliens told him to attend church). He shot him 6 times with a .45 revolver. Striking the man in the back and head. The man survived. And is now an Idaho lawmaker. Kyle was sentenced to 25 years in prison. His manifesto goes into extreme detail. The origins of the aliens, why theyre doing this, how theyre doing it, drawings, lists of names, and specific events of the aliens fucking with him (he claims theyve literally made him spontaneously ejaculate).", "time": 1671434885, "resto": 52927551, "id": "baaYEtMo"}, {"no": 52930633, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)02:32:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52930611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52930611</a><br>There was a Florida man who got headshotted and lived - they took a mugshot too.

It&#039;s basically a minimalist lifestyle and learning ways to save as much of your wagie-cagie check as you can and spend years saving and investing. The point is that the more and more you can reduce your costs of living the faster you can achieve financial freedom. <br>You treat your money, even down to the lowliest penny like capital. Most people think of their money as arcade tickets that enable them to consume. From luxury homes and vehicles to expensive meals and coffees. People work and basically &quot;rent&quot; their entire lives until that fateful day it dawns on them that they have little to no savings or excess capacity. They are a single pink-slip away from financial ruin. I can lose my job tomorrow and keep my head afloat even on a modest job.<br>In every single service you consume, you can essentially &quot;pay yourself&quot; to do it instead.

Yes, KYC is unpopular, but it gets rid of fraud, compliance, and technical issues. It opens doors. Truth is, it might temporarily sting at first, but advertisers are going to be very receptive to a near-zero fraud system with much higher than normal engagement.

That&#039;s why you are currently seeing a lot of Brave wallet ads. By the way, UGP isn&#039;t being &quot;dumped&quot; on you. It&#039;s being distributed via monthly rewards. Yes, it is adding a tiny bit of supply at the end of the month once payouts happen, but the main concern now is retaining opt-in rewards users. The increase in circulating supply is literally like 0.05% from the ad subsidies, and not all the people they get them sell anyways. As far as self-serve goes, the infrastructure is pretty much finished for it, but there is no point in rolling it out yet. One of the main reasons that the search engine was acquired was so that we could expand our ad sales. Search ads are a proven model. Once and demand increases via search, then we can upsell to notification and new tab ads.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "m8id0472elu91", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671078605863817, "time": 1671078605, "md5": "K6e45VOUhLMgRsxfXNt7ow==", "fsize": 1601431, "resto": 0, "id": "T1QcB29f", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 263, "images": 84, "unique_ips": 113}, {"no": 52875609, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52817752#p52817752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52817752</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671078724777639, "time": 1671078724, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875619, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:33:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671078979741420, "time": 1671078979, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52875586, "id": "T1QcB29f"}, {"no": 52875676, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:37:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Of course, this is but a dream since our current societies individual personal responsibility level isn&#039;t where it should be for a society, as I have described, to function correctly.<br><br>So that one catch....you have to choose good, your intentions CANNOT be evil, ESPECIALLY if you are doing it on purpose.", "time": 1671424726, "resto": 52919816, "id": "Lp5ndZzG", "trip": "!!vJs1PyyjPl7"}, {"no": 52929838, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:19:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52929473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52929473</a><br>whatchu wrote there, rabbi?", "filename": "barron", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 333, "h": 500, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671427168680490, "time": 1671427168, "md5": "l9RnRCgwlGuVzP6/Q4gJnw==", "fsize": 53928, "resto": 52919816, "id": "QEwQiUCe"}, {"no": 52929953, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:37:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52929382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52929382</a><br>Tell him I want the building his parents have on college", "time": 1671428243, "resto": 52919816, "id": "FbXPjpbZ"}, {"no": 52930021, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52929473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52929473</a><br>answered well<br>in my hypothetical situation, should the society at large preempt these paranoid insane people from hurting people, for example, by restricting their movement to the confines of an asylum?<br>in other words, does the mental deficit of the insane person (their disconnection from reality) and their propensity to violate the rights of other people (by being paranoid and aggressive) justify the voiding of the crazy person&#039;s natural rights, despite them having not made any actions that violates the rights of another?<br>if it is moral to void this person&#039;s rights for the self-preservation of others, then is it not also moral to destroy the mosquito since it will suck our blood?<br>where I&#039;m going is: is natural law truly empirical, or a logical creation of the rational mind?", "time": 1671428883, "resto": 52919816, "id": "0JpE8Cqd"}, {"no": 52930085, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:59:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52930021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52930021</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t get spoonfed by westworld</span><br>fucking catch up, it&#039;s annoying for the rest of us", "filename": "is50jf7x2yyz", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 637, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671429560495666, "time": 1671429560, "md5": "h2e9ms9t18PBcn8FvVS+lQ==", "fsize": 56665, "resto": 52919816, "id": "QEwQiUCe"}, {"no": 52930104, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)01:03:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52930085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52930085</a><br>a soul is required to have independent thoughts, changnigger", "time": 1671429788, "resto": 52919816, "id": "0JpE8Cqd"}, {"no": 52930187, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)01:18:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;

But the discussion on here is just so retarded now, the FUD is so low level, it&#039;s literally just LARPs, old as fuck senseless FUD, complete misinformation or price talk which makes no sense while everything is down 90% (with LINK actually performing decently and holding a bottom). It&#039;s so much now that it shits up every good thread to the point where 90% of posts are vomit. I don&#039;t know who is behind that, maybe some anons got completely mindraped and are in psychosis or it&#039;s just actually coordinated. In fact I was a fudder for years myself. In the beginning (2018/19) it made sense to poke holes in Chainlink&#039;s fundamentals, it&#039;s how we collectively tested the thesis behind it. Then it was just a meme to FUD because it was literally outperforming every asset in the world during the bear market for 2 straight years. But now it&#039;s just completely mindless spam. There was a debate between Twitter fags a few days ago, one of them was an actual critic but in good faith and with good points. And in the end, he got convinced to accumulate LINK when before he called LINK a charity and worthless token.

Move to Japan or Italy and you can get a decent modest house in a high-productivity area for 25k, if you move to a rural low productivity area its basically free and you can use the money for whatever utilities you need to add. House prices have gone up in our countries from 1-2x the average wage to 10x the average wage (while cost of living has gone up in a similar magnitude), because it keeps the entire financial system afloat. Most people need a mortgage so they pay 20% more than the real price as profits to the banks, people pay property taxes, creates a construction industry, and nowadays having everyone fighting to be landlords to each-other and selling property investing courses just exacerbates the problem (moreso in some countries than others). Land ownership for profiteering takes away the &quot;American Dream&quot; and what feels like should be a basic human right, and logically the problem will only get worse over time. Politicians won&#039;t change anything because their personal wealth is heavily invested in property portfolios. Common people have to accept a 50 year mortgage or renting, at but it &quot;could be worse&quot;. There might be a cascade of sell-offs as the disinherited boomer parasite class needs to fund their retirement, but not enough at once in the scheme of things to matter.

The main concern I have with this decentralized model is that there is little way to regulate its value and thus will tend to be highly volatile. Most governments (at least in the First World) seem to do a decent job keeping their currencies from experiencing wild fluctuations. While it is true that governments, banks, etc. can make bad decisions that adversely affect conventional currencies, it is rare to see financial systems totally collapse (at least in the First World). Furthermore, cryptocurrencies have proven to not be invulnerable to bad decisions by large institutions, as can be seen with the recent FTX drama. Overall cryptocurrencies seem more fragile than conventional currencies, although perhaps future cryptos will manage to fix the volatility problem.<br><br><a href=\"#p52930012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52930012</a><br>How costly/energy intensive is it to store information on the blockchain as opposed to other platforms?

All tokens have a public key associated with them which is paired to a private key that the artist controls. This would allow the artist to upload their songs to the blockchain as encrypted files. And the fans could pay the artist directly through a distribution platform that allows streaming access to the unencrypted versions of these files using a smart contract that the artist created with the distribution platform. The other benefit of hosting on the blockchain is that the artist maintains 100% control of their content.

The main concern I have with this decentralized model is that there is little way to regulate its value and thus will tend to be highly volatile. Most governments (at least in the First World) seem to do a decent job keeping their currencies from experiencing wild fluctuations. While it is true that governments, banks, etc. can make bad decisions that adversely affect conventional currencies, it is rare to see financial systems totally collapse (at least in the First World). Furthermore, cryptocurrencies have proven to not be invulnerable to bad decisions by large institutions, as can be seen with the recent FTX drama. Overall cryptocurrencies seem more fragile than conventional currencies, although perhaps future cryptos will manage to fix the volatility problem.</span><br>the volatility reflects the asset. its wildly speculative how far this is going. however, as a stand alone technology, none of what you listed is particularly relevant to crypto. what youre looking at is a completely new approach to money that empowers the individual and disenfranchises central institutions that have historically held a key chokepoint over all global finance. FTX attempted to do the exact same thing and failed miserably - meanwhile everyone who took advantage of the key point of the technology and performed self-custody were completely immune to such collapses. eventually this volatility will settle as speculation slows down and the technology finds its place in legal and practical terms. until then, enjoy the ride i guess", "time": 1671441945, "resto": 52928964, "id": "Y3R8DGlp"}, {"no": 52931495, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)04:53:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52931274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52931274</a><br>besides, if volatility is your concern, there are stablecoins available that are pegged to real dollar values. youll find this is where a lot of institutional interest comes in as stablecoins have all the benefits of programmable money with significantly less volatility risks", "time": 1671443621, "resto": 52928964, "id": "Y3R8DGlp"}, {"no": 52931507, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)04:54:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52931100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52931100</a><br>Lol you wish boy, these ain&#039;t no play to earn games, you DYOR on it.

The only way to do this is designing a system behind &quot;legality&quot; which is maintained by a unit of account backing the creation subtokens of utility, like legality, to be over the people servicing it with a sort of opt-in-opt-out machanism, for instance, liquid democracy, so that if any system is given no single fucks in any given moment it will drop to the ground and die.", "filename": "1670283683859052", "ext": ".png", "w": 733, "h": 651, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1671443395346317, "time": 1671443395, "md5": "kCN9qPvC3KEZAH5B1J7cTw==", "fsize": 362610, "resto": 52903255, "id": "hBfqKPgU"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 52931410, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)04:39:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I need a 10x shitcoin to put 30k in.

The turnaround is obviously not going as planned, the NFT marketplace is built and what more can be said of it? It&#039;s built. It&#039;s definitely a marketplace for jpegs. GMERICA was a set of gifs, but unfortunately they were way too late to the NFT craze. The NFT Logan Paul bought for like 630k is now worth less than $10. It&#039;s over. No one wants to buy expensive pictures of apes in space suits in this economy. The games that are on there are not exactly drawing in the crowds either. Where are the premium partnerships? It will never be successful if the best game on there is Chess. So I think it&#039;s safe to say GameStop is pivoting away from the NFT side of the business, further evidence of this can be seen with all the blockchain guys leaving, the esports guy got the ax and said it was because his shit was cancelled and GameStop is shifting focus to stores and short term profitability. I really think Ryan is just trying to keep GS from losing money so he won&#039;t have to dilute.

You moron. Why, why does everybody believe this shit. <br><br>France has a shitty, very old reactor fleet which is currently down 35% of its capacity due to corrosoion of one type of reactor they use. Since the french grid is highly centralized and is dependent on nuclear energy. One design flaw in one reactor type whipes out huge parts of their generation capacity. To explaine the absolutly abismal state of the french energy system would take weeks to explain. What your shitty, retard brain needs to know is this. <br><br>A few days ago their forecast for reactor capacity dropped AGAIN. They are currently sucking every available kwh out of the european grid. Germany had to redispatch 700WM to France. italy, Denmark, UK, Germany, Spain and even the Swiss exported everything the interconnections could handel to secure French demand. Their market system is beyond broken and the heavy subsedising of electricity makes france an inefficient fuck.<br><br>On the other hand. Germany managed to decrease gas consumption in the grid by using a diverse set of energy sources and has spare capacity to supply france and other european nations. Germany is a net exporter of energy since the early 2000s.<br><br>France problems with nuclear power are systematic and will take decades to fix.
