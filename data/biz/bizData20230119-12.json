I will never have that issue because I&#039;m thrifty as fuck. Dont get me wrong, I&#039;ll spend money like I spent $400 on an espresso machine and $400 on a grinder. A waste but its the cheapest good one I could get, on sale and it will last me for years. Another example: buddy and I both got hot tubs this summer. He buys a $3k one from Costco, I find one on Craigslist give the guy $100 and my cousins $100 to help me haul it. But make sure to value your time because I had to sink in about $1k in parts to fix mine and many many man hours, but I enjoy the DIY part of things and fixing stuff so while yes I&#039;m wasting time I find it fun. Or refinishing my hardwood floors, I&#039;m wasting time but its fun for me and I wouldn&#039;t be earning money otherwise with that time.

Dont give them anything they want, give them an allowance but make them do chores for it. But do provide them clothes, I have a friend who parents in high school were like &quot;lmao, buy your own&quot;. Mine would provide us stuff but they&#039;re not just gonna give us free money to go to the movie, just basic stuff like our sports, school and living. I say sports because that was big in our house, being an athlete and they paid for all of that. Within reason, they aren&#039;t going to buy me the nice $250 hockey stick but the $80 one on sale. So its not about giving them stuff, its if they know how to handle money and the value of it. I&#039;m a very conservative guy in the sense of I try to conserve everything from my money to even soap, anything that is limited if that makes sense. If I was your son, I would be great to give money to because I would invest it and make the most of it, I wouldn&#039;t go crazy. I didn&#039;t get much help in college from my parents since they are school teachers. Thankfully I got grants so only got out of school with $5k in debt and saved during college and bought a house right out of it. Parents were gonna help with a short term $5k loan to me for the down payment but luckily had enough not to need their help. My parents help provide guidance though, like touring some homes with me and that is what I value the most is help navigating this world. <br>Its a hard question though anon, you do need to help your kids but not too much that they are wasteful and take advantage. Finding that balance is the key. I would say your first child will be very good with money but I have some cousins who are and aren&#039;t so depends. All relies on the values you teach them.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1689897609245324", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674129738649703, "time": 1674129738, "md5": "HX0Owx2b/VAqcXJmp9AAUQ==", "fsize": 1575743, "resto": 0, "id": "CD6iZ/6p", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 12, "images": 10, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 53341495, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:03:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53277880#p53277880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53277880</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674129817517257, "time": 1674129817, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53341487, "id": "CD6iZ/6p"}, {"no": 53341501, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:04:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "DIST is better privacys token that XMR shit scam<br><br>stop sending paid FUDDERS into DIST fourm because you scared", "time": 1674129846, "resto": 53341487, "id": "TEJfnTv4"}, {"no": 53341507, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674130083435726, "time": 1674130083, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53341487, "id": "CD6iZ/6p"}, {"no": 53341540, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:09:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Their modus operandi is to support various tx types, so Seraphis will be used for bridges/swaps where multi-sig is required, I think they worked with Sarang on the Triptych paper to address the multi-sig issue, because it&#039;s active right now, and I looked over &quot;Discreet Core&quot; (their C++ cryptolib) and it&#039;s a modified one of the initial PoC that was published.<br><br>The reason I&#039;m bullish and decided to bunch a dump of BNB into this is because it&#039;s so fucking rare to see a team actually work towards something useful. I think you have a point that 86k tx/s is not gonna mean automatic adoption, but when Discript comes out, with their grants they have talked about, then it&#039;s very obviously likely to attract ADA developers that got treated as exit liquidity by IOHK.<br><br>If AZERO (which Aurem, their confidential proof of stake protocol) is anything to go off of, fees will be really slow because hotseat comittee + inexpensive hardware to validate blocks = cheap fees while still being manageable for validator node operators.<br><br>I&#039;m in, I don&#039;t care if it goes nowhere, I&#039;m happy to hear they got the CEX listing, we need more privacy coins regardless, and for once I&#039;m happy in 6 years of browsing /biz/ that there&#039;s a coin that&#039;s not poopoo. I&#039;m in the testnet group right now, and it&#039;s filled with (non-team) developers trying to build shit, so that&#039;s a good sign.

Understand the type of guys on there, the way they carry themselves, the interactions they have with the female lead. It&#039;s real gay, but I&#039;m telling you there&#039;s knowledge to be gained from those insufferable movies, and don&#039;t settle for a few, get used to watching them. The more you watch the better, just don&#039;t be discouraged if you can&#039;t live up to the characters on screen, keep in mind those movies are portraying an ideal not a norm<br>Other bit of advice is find a dude friend, or several, with successful track records on picking up girls. Ask them for help, like hands on help, have them take you out and select girls and talk to, have them coach you, help you write texts, shit like that. Preferably be a &quot;bro&quot; type of dude, and one that doesn&#039;t respect women as a gender, sometimes their advice is shit, but usually they do enjoy helping out a homie in need", "time": 1674110924, "resto": 53336168, "id": "y7mSRZCz"}, {"no": 53339773, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:55:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53336168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336168</a><br>Anon I want to help you so this is serious advice.

Sexual reproduction is now a choice not a necessity anymore:<br><br>Less than a century ago, people needed to have children because children were needed to provide for the family with incomes and to care for the old. Today, age care is abdicated to social workers and we have welfare protections to bail out old broke retirees, so there is no NEED to have children anymore, rather to the contrary; they are seen as only a burden on free time, money and career choices. This is due to drastically increased capitalist exploitation from Neoliberalism, making children more expensive in the long run and undermining their social importance with cheap foreign labour.<br><br>2.) Lack of Shame Culture due to Feminist Sexual Rights caused by Neoliberalism:<br><br>Another problem is not so much promiscuity itself, but rather the lack of shame associated with reckless or inconsiderate sex due to hook-up culture by the normalisation of abortion as if aborting a fetus is a standard medical procedure for a young woman in her lifetime. I&#039;m still in favour of the allowance of abortion for eugenic practices and perhaps for the choice of individuals under strict conditions like less than 3 months pregnancy, but that doesn&#039;t mean it shouldn&#039;t still be curbed culturally by shaming it as destructive behaviour. Fundamentally, this boils down to the deconstruction of marriage as simply just a legal category and a status symbol due to gay rights as an inevitable consequence of feminism.

They also can&#039;t do this because they think &quot;what is the point?&quot;, if their children will die by 2050 anyway due to climate change. To top this off, a secular and deracinated culture without a national/imperial mythos that is alienated in multicultural society simply can only spend their free time on consumerism anyway; Getting drunk on the weekends at bars and clubs, nice holidays, watching porn, playing video games all day, owning a nice car etc.. all to cope with the destruction of their societies and any possibility to having a family.

The only way to fix it is grabbing women out of highschool and putting a gun to their head and telling them to breed now. Shit like &#039;leftover women&#039; over 25 won&#039;t fix it because 10 years of being a whore ruined their womb making pregnancy difficult and miscarriage rates high.<br><br>China would probably be better off investing in robot wombs and just taking all the eggs from dead women and making frankenbabies from chink chad sperm and giving these frankenbabies to couples.<br><br><a href=\"#p53337189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53337189</a><br>All those old people will just starve the chinks will legalize euthanasia for people over 60 and the government won&#039;t give a fuck, the chinese government has never given a fuck, the entire society is built on rugpulling masses of plebs.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "X4XMR", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673735030577156, "time": 1673735030, "md5": "uLmCVaurQRCCw/dXXCelDA==", "fsize": 993271, "resto": 0, "id": "wgWony5C", "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 310, "images": 99, "unique_ips": 129}, {"no": 53277898, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:25:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53231130#p53231130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53231130</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673735115698271, "time": 1673735115, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53277917, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:26:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673735370054747, "time": 1673735370, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53277991, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:31:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673735479708887, "time": 1673735479, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53278370, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:02:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Geopolitics specialists got rekt. <br>Lucky for me that I sold everything days before bitcoin started its moon mission. <br>Feels so good to be a normie.", "filename": "geopoliticsrekt01", "ext": ".png", "w": 1403, "h": 464, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 41, "tim": 1673737368346005, "time": 1673737368, "md5": "mpoV/2zTpVBJgC/uNk18Kg==", "fsize": 31441, "resto": 53277880, "id": "tkzU9GAy"}, {"no": 53278567, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:16:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "alphabay down?<br>i cant connect", "time": 1673738193, "resto": 53277880, "id": "WE7MISfq"}, {"no": 53278771, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:30:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278370</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gay id</span><br>also lol Monero has climbed on the ratio since the beginning of the bear market.", "time": 1673739017, "resto": 53277880, "id": "/5JeRkzm"}, {"no": 53279043, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:48:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "tfw you cut out the part of the chart where we 2x against bitshit", "time": 1673740124, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279195, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:58:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;STATUS CHECK</span><br>Still an infinite supply shitcoin kek", "time": 1673740714, "resto": 53277880, "id": "v7AXt3Oc"}, {"no": 53279309, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:06:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m not exactly a regular here but I&#039;m surprised there&#039;s not more Nagatoro posting considering that the S2 is airing this season.", "time": 1673741168, "resto": 53277880, "id": "2nXv+nBC"}, {"no": 53279424, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:13:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279195</a><br>so is gold", "time": 1673741628, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279454, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:15:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53277880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53277880</a><br>BUT DOES IT HAVE SMART CONTRACTS?", "time": 1673741752, "resto": 53277880, "id": "qHfxHMxJ"}, {"no": 53279478, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279454</a><br>yes smart people are using it to exchange goods and services", "time": 1673741850, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279488, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:17:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lads when are we going to defeat evil", "time": 1673741873, "resto": 53277880, "id": "zdM1fM/K"}, {"no": 53279510, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:19:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279488</a><br>the outcome was predetermined", "time": 1673741958, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279519, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:19:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278370</a><br>so what gave you the premonition that this would happen?", "time": 1673741984, "resto": 53277880, "id": "Z3BLwzWs"}, {"no": 53280085, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)20:10:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278567</a><br>is i2p the future of the dnm?", "time": 1673745011, "resto": 53277880, "id": "zdM1fM/K"}, {"no": 53281025, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53280085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53280085</a><br>The guys at Dread certainly think so <br>https://old.reddit.com/r/DreadAlert<wbr>/comments/101tqq3/january_3rd_happy<wbr>_new_year_were_still_here/", "time": 1673749857, "resto": 53277880, "id": "tyk38Gk2"}, {"no": 53281112, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:40:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Reminder: Tails emissions means we are all going to make it, together.<br>The maxitards, the Zcringe troons, the taxman, russians, ukranians, jews, and niggers.

ETH only has a throughput of ~12 transactions a second and is at the absolute breaking point of being able to run your own node with retail-grade hardware, and half the nodes are already running on AWS anyway. This is not very scientific, but as a thought experiment consider that for Monero to achieve high levels of privacy, it needs about 8x the average transaction size of Bitcoin (250 bytes/tx vs. 2000 bytes/tx). If you worked through the logistics of making a &quot;private-ETH&quot; but now filled up to the gas limit (say) 8x faster, that means your throughput for the same standard is now at 1/8 the level of the traceable version, which (again, making a lot of non-scientific assumptions) would render a &quot;private-ETH&quot; coin at about 2-3 tps before hitting the breaking point. Smart contract platforms as they currently exist are essentially anti-scaling technology because they allow extreme bloatware and bottleneck easily due to limitations in SSD write-speeds, bandwidth, etc.<br><br>Maybe in a decade or so the bottleneck problems will be minor enough that something like a private smart contract platform would be viable with both reasonable throughput and home node operators, but as it stands it is a complete waste of energy because they cannot even get the spyware smart contract chains to crack above 10-20 tps consistently without running the nodes out of centralized datacenters.<br><br>If a smart contract is considered crucial, it should be curated and added on top of the otherwise &quot;dumb&quot; currency coin e.g. XMR&#039;s atomic swaps.", "time": 1674020293, "resto": 53277880, "id": "buPqRYVJ"}, {"no": 53323330, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:43:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53323292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53323292</a><br>I always thought I understood crypto, but back when BSV came out and I heard people talking about adding smart contracts to a regular crypto, I was completely confused.

Now we have new grads making an average of 70-80k as a couple no kids buying houses because 300k isnt bad when your household income is ~150k.<br><br>If people cant afford these prices, the prices would not be high. get off 4chan and live in the real world. everyone is doing a lot better today than they were in 2005 years ago", "time": 1674088557, "resto": 53335827, "id": "WRYnr6Wr"}, {"no": 53336437, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:39:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53335827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53335827</a><br><a href=\"#p53336243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336243</a><br>https://youtu.be/YqiOk2YI2w4", "time": 1674088769, "resto": 53335827, "id": "8MSPXArC"}, {"no": 53336443, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:40:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53335827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53335827</a><br>https://crimegrade.org/safest-place<wbr>s-in-spring-valley-il/", "filename": "baka", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 622, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674088812588706, "time": 1674088812, "md5": "FPIstEjnP5DgxcK7F3Hu3w==", "fsize": 42098, "resto": 53335827, "id": "4G4apUky"}, {"no": 53336464, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:41:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53336243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336243</a><br>Come live next to people in a mobile for $315,000+", "time": 1674088910, "resto": 53335827, "id": "8MSPXArC"}, {"no": 53336490, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:44:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53336400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336400</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in 2005 years ago</span>", "filename": "romans", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 811, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1674089042146364, "time": 1674089042, "md5": "N2fM5idxefnciAXRX1S+xw==", "fsize": 449942, "resto": 53335827, "id": "JaHAv7VY"}, {"no": 53336498, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53336400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336400</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;. im 26 and literally everyone i knew who went to college is making at least 100k </span><br><br><br>silver spoon pos", "time": 1674089081, "resto": 53335827, "id": "8MSPXArC"}, {"no": 53336510, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:45:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53335827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53335827</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;built in 1895</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wood frame</span>", "time": 1674089130, "resto": 53335827, "id": "+lXtsXC9"}, {"no": 53336656, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:57:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53336443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336443</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://crimegrade.org/safest-plac<wbr>es-in-spring-valley-il/</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not just posting the actual crime numbers</span><br><br>https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/i<wbr>l/spring-valley/crime", "time": 1674089869, "resto": 53335827, "id": "8XyZV5Jt"}, {"no": 53337211, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)20:48:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53336510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336510</a><br><a href=\"#p53336262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336262</a><br>problem", "time": 1674092924, "resto": 53335827, "id": "8XyZV5Jt"}, {"no": 53337276, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)20:53:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53336243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53336243</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.

This is just one of the most recent examples of the abuse Kosta, Antoni, and Kalin are committing with cryptocurrencies and customer personal data. Say nothing of the apparent conflict of interest between Nexo and its customers who have deposited their LINK tokens to get credit and still believe they are not sold to Binance but are insured and in a safe place on BitGo. I leave it to you to decide if this is the truth.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I will also not comment on the fact that Antoni proudly announced Nexo\u2019s partnership with Chainlink, the hidden and main purpose of which is to attract additional resources to open short positions with LINK.

But any real news or a proper m&amp;a announcement and this is taking right the fuck off and not stopping until it&#039;s at the moon. The insane gamma ramp is mostly institutional money, they know shit we don&#039;t, and I fully believe it&#039;s happening this week or next at the absolute latest. All I know is I&#039;m not selling anything until it hits three digits before the decimal.

However they can NEVER escape the fact that to legally short sell you need to borrow a share and then sell it. This prevents the ILLEGAL act of counterfeiting/securities fraud. The SEC has been turning a blind eye to this because they are all the same exact group of finance gangsters. But their books still hold this massive liability. They sold X number of shares but their back room offices show they only have X numbers of real shares. This is the heart of the issue, is that they have always needed people to panic sell in sufficient numbers to ease any risks they were being exposed to. They are in deep fucking shit right now because how else can you rectify the situation without blatantly fucking over investors? The problem is not retail but the criminal enterprises that have been counterfeiting what they thought was a bankrupt company. If have buy 200 shares that are not DRSed, how can they steal my investments from me, refund my money, only for GME price to spike without me. That looks like blatant theft to anyone watching. <br>Not even market makers are allowed to blatantly commit securities fraud on this level. So there is no way out other than to raise the price and buy back the shorts.

A big part of that is because we&#039;re 6 years into this stupid ride at this point, and what do they have to show for it? Basically nothing. Nothing that anyone originally showed up for. No one was going all in back in 2017 because of KYC&#039;d nodes, price feeds, endless academic papers and partnering with every other scam shitcoin of the day. People went all in because of the banking speculation with SWIFT and having a PERMISSIONLESS network of decentralized nodes.

But if that happened wouldn&#039;t the VCs combine their monetary energy and launch a takeover bid like they did with Arbitrum? The VC is all powerful and all knowing and so they deserve primea noctis with tokens like LINK which is the key to the entire system. Sir gay just has to finagle the payments around so that people use blockchains otherwise they wouldn&#039;t. Its funny to me that thousands of teams launch ERC tokens for various purposes back in 2017 but only a handful survived or and much more likely the same group of devs faked all that interest by pretending to be different people paying actors for website headshots, and jeets to wrangle other jeets on telegram while the same group throw money around between different tokens. Thats how interest died so quickly and why everyone is against chainlink for opening the floodgates. no more fake bs from the same group of devs haha imagine the seeth", "time": 1674117024, "resto":
