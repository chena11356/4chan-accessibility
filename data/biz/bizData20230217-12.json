At night the solar doesn&#039;t make electrons. Levelized costs of energy (LCOEs) that you see quoted by environmentalists only take into account the marginal electron, that coal or gas generation being offset on a sunny day by AZ or CA solar.

Some adits were driven into 10m wide veins, but only the very leading edge of the contact was actually mined. <br><a href=\"#p53741494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53741494</a><br>Never hurts to look, just being out in that terrain is bliss.", "time": 1676589099, "resto": 53715469, "id": "InNWfUNP"}, {"no": 53742372, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:17:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So I&#039;m guessing this thread is like a combination between pmg and smg, but even more schizo.", "filename": "pepe", "ext": ".png", "w": 222, "h": 227, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676589460955707, "time": 1676589460, "md5": "FOOorWbhIAVsrgw5imV0Wg==", "fsize": 8094, "resto": 53715469, "id": "YQGoNncV"}, {"no": 53742630, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:37:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Check out FATHOM NICKEL <br>https://fathomnickel.com/wp-content<wbr>/uploads/2023/02/Fathom-Nickel-Inc-<wbr>Corporate-Presentation-February-202<wbr>3.pdf<br>BIG BUX TO BE MADE $$$$$$$$$$$$$$", "time": 1676590671, "resto": 53715469, "id": "RSJ819JN"}, {"no": 53742632, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:37:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53741494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53741494</a><br><br>kek", "filename": "red drank", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 837, "h": 796, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1676590676965596, "time": 1676590676, "md5": "X+r5IUpeqqYvq2R3cJFgQg==", "fsize": 100749, "resto": 53715469, "id": "cQ/03myE"}, {"no": 53742692, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:43:21", "name": "Renewable energy fag", "com": "<a href=\"#p53742630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53742630</a><br>But is it going to dollar town?", "time": 1676591001, "resto": 53715469, "id": "2c7MPzQI"}, {"no": 53742701, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:43:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "gimme your best idea of shit to mine/rockhound around vegas. heres a pic of the an old mined out vein at the mining museum in tonopah", "filename": "1669847991138", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 640, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676591023716376, "time": 1676591023, "md5": "QOZEssWbhE0i1YwVJbaSww==", "fsize": 123005, "resto": 53715469, "id": "MjFSB5js"}, {"no": 53742718, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:44:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "old transformer or capacitor circa 1903", "filename": "1650961566689", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676591097350132, "time": 1676591097, "md5": "q9DFdQqOhA7mkG7nBTeBNQ==", "fsize": 116123, "resto": 53715469, "id": "MjFSB5js"}, {"no": 53742752, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:47:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "fuck your warnings, nigga", "filename": "1673515284608", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676591274218935, "time": 1676591274, "md5": "0v3miQq4AwrGi0xX5ucrIA==", "fsize": 121074, "resto": 53715469, "id": "MjFSB5js"}, {"no": 53742765, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:49:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53742630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53742630</a><br>Get lost, @RocketRed.<br>Look at your last two pump-and-dumps ...

If you think about it any timeline in which a bunch of household investors got handed hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars would take minimum several years of hard work behind the scenes to actually get done, I think a lot of people forget that the ending where this actually all pays out is basically analogous to completely upending the state of finance as a whole and making actual fraud or chicanery wholly untenable if not impossible in the end result of it. Things have to be in place and in order and a lot of beds have to be made and penises washed before that can happen.

I have a literal list of places to help with the money once this all comes to fruition. I will live off the grid, I will pay my taxes, I will give untold sums to the betterment of other peoples lives, I will not give in to hate or sin or greed or malice just because I&#039;ll have the power to make all of those a reality and more than enough motivation to do so, and I will embrace the horrible state of the world with open arms and crush it with unending love until it yields and becomes something better. I have found God again in all of this, after more than a decade of questioning and rejecting him for my own reasons. This has all been the greatest lesson I could&#039;ve ever been taught and for that I am thankful. I will make the world weep with how much I give unto it, how much love I can show, how much good I can do, how much hate I can destroy. And I will do it without being a complete faggot either, and in saying that have nothing against actual fags but am more using the word in the south park definition than anything else. I will laugh, smile, cry, be joyous, know sadness and pain few can imagine let alone endure, and I will do it all with a smile for having had the opportunity. To do anything less with such a chance is heretical and antithetical to the very act and experience of humanity. There is nothing anyone can do about it short of killing me and in doing so they would make a martyr and doom themselves. The kids are alright, things are gonna be just fine, I have faith in those that hold the strings, and for all of my complaints I understand how hard this all actually is and the own limitations imposed upon me by my current circumstances and perspective.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1675439180797735", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2792, "h": 4037, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676206543268876, "time": 1676206543, "md5": "pLF/i7hFbJcVjDfuMq/aLw==", "fsize": 2232893, "resto": 0, "id": "gaig2M8k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 277, "images": 86, "unique_ips": 87}, {"no": 53679958, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53589386#p53589386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53589386</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1676206623747923, "time": 1676206623, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53679954, "id": "gaig2M8k"}, {"no": 53679963, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it?

Then I realized that it wasn&#039;t just them, or even the government. It was true the princess was a jew who had erectile dysfunction and was the laughing stock of the kingdom.
