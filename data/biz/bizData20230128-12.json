The most a job is good for is to obtain capital for investments. Nothing more. Nothing less. Employers should stop trying to get people to live a job and understand that no one actually works to be the best bitch. They do it for a paycheck. Employers need to create better incentives such as more flexible hours, more pay, and less hours worked. Basically they need to fuck off with the obsession with efficiency i.e. who gives a fuck if your overall roi is not maximized as long as it&#039;s decent.

Bitcoin is a blockchain and hex is a erc20 token but both have many things in common. You need to remember richard was a maxi and throughout the years of bagholding bitcoin some things basically started to bother him, so he invented a token with the fundamentals of bitcoin. Hex was also given for free to btc holders.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inflation = yield </span><br>Now back to your question, in hex you don&#039;t need a mining rig or to join a centralized pool to earn the inflation. You lockup your tokens from your own wallet and don&#039;t need to trust a platform, exchange or any middlemen. You interact directly with a immutable smartcontract that pays inflation to users, the payout occurs daily and is based on the T-Share&#039;s you own, the yield can be redeemed after you unstake. Imagine T-Share&#039;s like a variable, T-shares consist of the amount of hex you stake and the staking length. (t=a*l). <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;something you might want to know </span><br>Hex has something i call micro halvings. We know the halving happens every 210k blocks (4 years). Inflation gets reduced, the only way to maintain the same payout is by increasing your hashrate. In hex the T-Share rate goes up everytime a adress is unstaking. T-Share&#039;s and Hashrate determine how much of the inflation you&#039;re getting. Look it up here https://hexdailystats.com/ 3 years ago we started with with a sharerate of 10,000 and the daily payout was under 2-3 hex per T-Share, today the sharerate sits at 25,5k with a daily payout of over 6 hex.", "filename": "BXJXsASCYAAqKnv", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 631, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674908311584808, "time": 1674908311, "md5": "AHoOFAHQWH9NUpEQmpuCIg==", "fsize": 30391, "resto": 53470766, "id": "p36BK2Sj"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53469516, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)01:52:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wtf, Reddit is based now?", "filename": "blockchain usecases", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1644, "h": 2359, "tn_w": 174, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674888749070046, "time": 1674888749, "md5": "oeAe+XILg8g17pIexVXZiA==", "fsize": 205383, "resto": 0, "id": "E3QLJYh0", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "wtf-reddit-is-based-now", "replies": 44, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 39}, {"no": 53469538, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)01:55:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53469516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53469516</a><br>retards.

The arbitrage opportunities are not going to be 5x. The idea is USTC\u2019s peg is \u201cfloating\u201d in the sense it has minor fluctuations around whatever value it is pegged to. The arbitrage opportunity is created when USTC floats above its pegged value thereby incentivizing swapping out of LUNC to profit from USTC floating above peg. Swapping out LUNC has an added benefit in that enough swaps will push the USTC price back down to the pegged value (as people sell their USTC). In the pre-crash environment, the inverse was also true; people would swap out UST for LUNA when UST floated below peg. It was a nifty little trick that generated a lot of value and arguably could still work. However, the new swaps will only be one way because we don\u2019t want any LUNC minted. <br><br>I think the main issue is there are lots of technical challenges with repegging USTC to any value that are out of my depth to explain.", "time": 1674752283, "resto": 53436370, "id": "RTRqMKIT"}, {"no": 53446876, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)11:59:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53444877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53444877</a><br>The irony of it all is that lunc has more volume and more interest in it.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674525330036483", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1792, "h": 2688, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674528949550978, "time": 1674528949, "md5": "eQqdb8RP8r6wqVFYYE46dw==", "fsize": 1341589, "resto": 0, "id": "HlPPWoQL", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 232, "images": 83, "unique_ips": 109}, {"no": 53410434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53362323#p53362323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53362323</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674529029185211, "time": 1674529029, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410443, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:45", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674529065836512, "time": 1674529065, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53410417, "id": "QZ5UEoSQ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53410452, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:58:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674529281556892, "time": 1674529281, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410517, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:02:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

This typically means 3 things happen:<br><br>1) average rent increases by that amount per year<br>2) your job should increase your salary by that amount each year<br>3) a home&#039;s value should increase that much each year <br><br>What does this mean for the rentcuck? Well, that raise you got is going straight to rent. That&#039;s right, every penny. Meaning you&#039;re fucked when food and everything else increases as well. You&#039;re literally becoming more and more poor every year if you&#039;re only getting a 3% annual raise (tons of people don&#039;t even get raises)<br><br>What happens to the MortgageChad\u2122? Not only does his &quot;rent&quot; remain the same - allowing him to allocate that raise towards other things - buy his home also increases in value. Essentially, by owning a home, MortgageChad\u2122&#039;s &quot;inflation raise&quot; is quite literally an actual raise, and not one that is just meant to &quot;keep up with inflation&quot;<br><br>I mean, when you factor in the &quot;stagnant rent&quot; that is a mortgage along with a home&#039;s annual increase in value along with the fact about 30% of &quot;rent&quot; is going into a piggy bank via equity - MortgageChad\u2122&#039;s are most likely &quot;saving&quot; 10% more a year opposed to their rentcuck counterpart. I mean in 10 years my mortgage will be the same and your rent is likely to double lol<br><br>Anyways, thanks for reading my blog.

Furthermore, the last 10 years of historically low interest rates have contributed to a housing market boom, which has led to higher prices for both buyers and renters. However, as interest rates start to rise, it is likely that home prices will decrease and renters will be in a better position to find more affordable housing options.
