They also lowered the relief on the state quarter and ATB quarter series obverse, and the new shitty Women&#039;s series Washington obverse also has a low relief. GAY.

With the price steadily rising for long enough, it will experience a 2019 like run. When line goes up normies will pile in regardless of how hard Chainlink is to understand. Suddenly they will act like the oracle problem was the only thing holding crypto back and the reason for crypto having failed to gain real adoption all this time. They will praise Chainlink as the most ingenious thing since sliced bread. This whole cataclysm will not happen however, if Chainlink runs are interrupted before they draw attention. <br><br>I&#039;m not saying this is deliberate, as I have a hard time believing that, but it is very uncanny how if you were to try and prevent option b from happening, you would do it exactly like what has been happening with Chainnlink.

You are taking money from a victim. It is zero-sum. Be it stocks, bonds, crypto, whatever. So you have to think like a general on the battlefield.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "168972789564", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1431, "h": 1106, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 193, "tim": 1671495074320435, "time": 1671495074, "md5": "FO2prahRc0zhiZPmPBQVpQ==", "fsize": 1447627, "resto": 0, "id": "f4sg7tZ4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 115, "images": 44, "unique_ips": 58}, {"no": 52942076, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:12:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52875586#p52875586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52875586</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671495178054615, "time": 1671495178, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942093, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671495436933397, "time": 1671495436, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942167, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:18:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Many middle-class individuals view their home as their biggest investment because it is often the most valuable asset they own, and they may also have a mortgage or other debts tied to the property. Owning a home can also provide a sense of pride and accomplishment, as it represents a significant financial and personal commitment. Additionally, the value of a home can appreciate over time, providing potential financial benefits for the owner.

The opposite of hard money is easy money. Every cryptocurrency is easy money. Anyone can make their own coin with features btc doesn\u2019t have, like anonymity or smart contracts or faster transactions. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Those other coins might be better code but they aren\u2019t harder money, because someone could come along tomorrow and make an even more anonymous, or even faster coin.

There will be an infinite number of cryptocurrencies, but only 21 million btc. Unless that changes, it will remain the hardest money for no other reason than because it is the first, and everything else is easy, inflationary money. They could even change the code to make it slower than it is now and it would still be the hardest money.

If you can afford to buy and run an array of asics, you can easily afford a few bucks for storage.<br>As the network grows this storage becomes another resource to earn money from, miners will be able to charge for access to archived data.<br>Halving leads to half the block reward for mined blocks to be shares by the miners. This drops profits by half too where the hashrate remains the same. other factors are running costs and efficiency of the asics. as profitability reduces the less efficient miners sell off their equipment and buy more efficient and competitive asics.<br>The problem I&#039;m pointing out is that as profits reduce due to halving block rewards, this profitability can drop below that of even the most efficient ASICs.

I entered early 2017 and experience every bit of the 2017 bullrun. I didn&#039;t make it because as a first time market participator I was delusional and held past the top. I did go from $3k to 600k though and I did it much like how many did it in 2021 with the animal tokens. However once everything crashed and the bear market settled for multiple years I grew weary and now timid. I was completely out of crypto by end of 2018 but by mid 2020 at the end of the bear market I got into the Defi summer and made a decent amount of money again but this time by buying smart utility driven hyped tokens after doing research. This was a 180 from my 2017 days of buying the first shitcoin that I read on r/cryptocurrency back when it only had 100k subscribers in it. Because of this &quot;different&quot; kind of success making a profit from defi tokens the &quot;smart&quot; bear market way of not going all-in, getting in early after doing your research, vetting projects, etc, etc. I ended up holding onto this same investment process all throughout the bull market. This made me money but not nearly enough. I should have shifted back to the reckless extremely risk based shitcoin flipping. <br><br>Looking back it&#039;s amazing how I fumbled two completely separate bullruns by doing the opposite thing both times. This is also why newbies that entered crypto in 2021 which was way more newbies than in 2017 made more potential profit during the run than I had despite my vast knowledge in both crypto and markets. Sure they vast majority didnt sell and made the same rookie mistake I did in 2017 but that&#039;s besides the point I&#039;m making.

I think if we have another bullrun like 2021 I can crack 10mil.<br><br>I had the same experiences for the most. Showed up in 2016 and enjoyed 17/18 and kinda floundered a bit in 19/20 and barely did crypto but I came back about 2 months before the animal token era.
