It is true that going from the current skewed system to an ideal system is near impossible. That makes the ones wanting to make it better seem like idealists. The main points of difference would be:<br>- Initiation of force is regarded as unproductive and can only be acceptable as a form of self defence. Fend off attackers, fire back if threatened etc. If you take away governments monopoly on force you can reduce it to a numbers game. There are more people willing to cooperate on a voluntary basis and agree that force is not needed than there are people who are out to use force to steal.<br>- As with all systems that are highly complex, some sort of &#039;order or hierarchy&#039; would have to occur. The difference would be that the hierarchy is on a voluntary basis. Yes there are people who have more to say than others, but they are there because we agree that they are suited for the job. This can be due to experience, intelligence, morals or a combination of the above.<br>This differs from the current system because it means that they do not get a monopoly on violence, they can be replaced by another member of the larger group if they can not fullfill their role and their position is not guaranteed (contrary to the current systems)<br>This also means that all the systems currently in place by governments will need to have a free market equivalent. If you need a service, you pay for it, but you will not pay for other peoples services, as is the case now with governments.

Open source, decentralized, APIs, partnerships, you name it. We&#039;d be one of the first companies in line for something like Chainlink, if the decentralized smart contract space had more value over traditional data exchanges. There&#039;s a catch though, an underlying flaw more deeply embedded in the bedrock of LINK than the very code itself. The flaw is with the concept, and it&#039;s this: Companies won&#039;t actually go through the hassle of trusting their data API&#039;s through crypto.<br>Now I can already hear your keyboards going frantic, but hear me out. /biz/ hates banks, and traditional data providers. But actual companies, businesses, and investors do not. There&#039;s an old saying you might have heard of: &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it!&quot;. The idea that any of our bosses would give us the go ahead if we approached them to put our companies valuable data in a smart contract on a cryptocurrency called Chainlink, that they&#039;ve never heard of, we&#039;d be laughed out at best and fired on the spot at worst. We already have API data buyers and providers we trust.<br>&#039;But Chainlink is trustless!&#039; I hear you cry, but is that really a good thing? Just listen to the sound of it. Businesses don&#039;t want to spend millions of dollars on something that is trustLESS, they want something trustFUL. &#039;But the reputation system!&#039;, doesn&#039;t that defeat the whole point of your coin? If companies only trust nodes with high reputation, what&#039;s the difference between trusting banks and data providers that already have reputation, but in real life not on a computer screen.<br>The fact is, LINK is going to share the same fate as ETH will. A lot of &#039;real world application&#039; hype, with a lot of &#039;crypto world application&#039; reality.

For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn&#039;t take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once.

Whether the Rewards BAT is genuinely all from their UGP reserves or from their dubious Transparency page purchases, or a mix of both, doesn&#039;t matter to me if I get paid.

Ironically Brendan Eich fucking hates ESG bullshit yet it seems like BAT is fully on board with putting faggot tranny goodboy points above actual utility and increasing the value of BAT.

It&#039;s sad but it&#039;s true. Trannies won&#039;t agree with me but I could literally tell Brave was starting to warm up to the idea of promoting BAT and even market it somewhat at the tail end of the Trump admin, when we had Jay Clayton in charge at the SEC. Once old man Joe was elected SEC (including Clayton to be fair) did a 180 and the crackdown on Crypto began. True corruption. Brave/BAT can never flourish in an ecosystem where only the most corrupt ESG-promoting demons give their pound of flesh to the freaks in charge.

Therefore, if a cryptocurrency meets the definition of an investment contract, it will be considered a security and subject to regulation as such.", "filename": "199584592659363853", "ext": ".png", "w": 587, "h": 551, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1671758416552926, "time": 1671758416, "md5": "ONIDXwMSeHwNOh0WvbpEyg==", "fsize": 317825, "resto": 52986023, "id": "t3p7QYh9"}, {"no": 52986517, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:22:04", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "20221130_083821", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4080, "h": 3060, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671758524761600, "time": 1671758524, "md5": "vsiWVgOXWmv1wxCHJQuL9w==", "fsize": 2780713, "resto": 52986023, "id": "pfsuF6fo"}, {"no": 52986523, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:23:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52986023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52986023</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cryptocurrency is considered a security if it meets the definition of an &quot;investment contract&quot;</span>", "filename": "p4VJHkd", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1671758584486986, "time": 1671758584, "md5": "lmtolA8N37llTUduHuSnWQ==", "fsize": 117219, "resto": 52986023, "id": "PbDMKIj+"}, {"no": 52986831, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:59:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u201cWhen I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\u201d", "filename": "24A0744D-2851-4E43-8898-F389ACFA00CF", "ext": ".png", "w": 573, "h": 435, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1671760793959996, "time": 1671760793, "md5": "ySJC/6Rf520olX8HURBB4Q==", "fsize": 159728, "resto": 52986023, "id": "+s4LZg/f"}, {"no": 52986876, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:05:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52986510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52986510</a><br>The SEC declared FTT a security<br><br>How do you explain this and how will it affect other tokens (basically all exchange tokens or utility tokens in general)?", "time": 1671761110, "resto": 52986023, "id": "+s4LZg/f"}, {"no": 52987085, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:28:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52986510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52986510</a><br>Answer my question mr wise man speaking (no irony)", "time": 1671762515, "resto": 52986023, "id": "+s4LZg/f"}, {"no": 52987163, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:36:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52987085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52987085</a><br>It is gpt-3 garyposting.

So, even if [the money supply] is growing more slowly now, it doesn\u2019t matter. There is so much inflation already in the pipeline. And the only thing that was keeping our inflation rate lower was the fact that the dollar was rising when everybody thought the Fed would quit hiking. But now that the dollar is falling, that is going to add fuel to the inflation fire. I think it\u2019s going to burn a lot hotter in 2023.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "168972789564", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1431, "h": 1106, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 193, "tim": 1671495074320435, "time": 1671495074, "md5": "FO2prahRc0zhiZPmPBQVpQ==", "fsize": 1447627, "resto": 0, "id": "f4sg7tZ4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 272, "images": 79, "unique_ips": 107}, {"no": 52942076, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:12:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52875586#p52875586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52875586</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671495178054615, "time": 1671495178, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942093, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671495436933397, "time": 1671495436, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942167, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:18:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

A fiat currency can be divided much more easily, sold by bankers as a means of fast tracking financial growth that would be hindered by gold, needing to mine in order to track with GDP, storage. Wealth can now be more easily concentrated in a few select hands. Instead of people holding gold or gold backed notes that would allow wealth to pass generation to generation they now must constantly work and produce to try to keep up with a constantly devaluing dollar.
