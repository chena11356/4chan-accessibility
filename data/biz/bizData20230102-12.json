Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "PimpHand", "ext": ".png", "w": 961, "h": 999, "tn_w": 240, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672398550412929, "time": 1672398550, "md5": "wjrnsq7UPwnatHvBo8meng==", "fsize": 798594, "resto": 0, "id": "3CYHBxFm", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 169, "images": 50, "unique_ips": 75}, {"no": 53070970, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:10:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52999274#p52999274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999274</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672398647970535, "time": 1672398647, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53070979, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672398907889153, "time": 1672398907, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53071009, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:16:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

They will also signal external agents their damages are effective, even up to delicate vicious circles between the weakened immunity of target and the misleading apparent requirement for stronger defenses.<br>- Go meta: Do not lose oneself in inconsequential details. Keep the mind detached from what seems to be happening, letting peace and clarity flourish through the composed unfolding of biological thought processes.<br>- Do not panic: Be patient. Do not let oneself controlled by fears, as things may get worse. Fears are usually the most important source of miscalculations and unpleasant perceptions, but always heal with time.<br>- Be loving: Never forget the richness and fundamental beauty of every perspective. Even villain roles may not deserve suffering. https://youtu.be/AkoML0_FiV4 <br>- Appear strong and reputable: Respect yourself.

Ampleforth is NOT an algorithmic stablecoin. It is not a stablecoin at all. It has a stable-ish price, but it was never intended to be a stablecoin. So what&#039;s the purpose then? To be a financial primative, ETH, BTC and stablecoins aren&#039;t suitable to be financial primitives for reasons I won&#039;t get it into here.<br><br>2. The rebase is NOT free money. It is the same as the price going up with bitcoin, but instead your share of the supply goes up.<br><br>3. Spot is NOT a stablecoin. It is intended to be a store of value like bitcoin, but way more stable and inflation resistant. Arbers may keep spot&#039;s price pretty stable though like a stablecoin.<br><br>4 Spot is NOT back by Ampl, but by a derivative of Ampl that stripped away the volatility of Ampl (Tranche). Tranches are commonly used in the finance world but most crypto people aren&#039;t deep into finance so this seems new to them. The A tranche is configured to be 80% resistant to supply shocks for now. And that 80% supply shock has to happen in 4 weeks (that is the length of the tranch bond). Due to new tranches getting minted each week, each tranche is more resilient that the last. Ampl can go to 0 for one day, and the supply will contract a maximum of 7.7%. Even it Ampl&#039;s supply contracts by 90%, Spot will only lose 15% of value in one month due to collateral being rolled over. With luna 90% price crash pretty much destroys the whole ecosystem. Destroying Spot/Ampl is the same as trying to destroy bitcoin. It would literally require every holder to burn all of their tokens.<br><br>5.

I hope this new year is mirthful for you, and that you remain in high spirts throughout. <br><br>May your hard work drill a hole through your inkwell.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Anon", "filename": "henry-robert-morland-a-boy-writing-a-letter-by-candlelight", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 392, "h": 470, "tn_w": 208, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672644970412758, "time": 1672644970, "md5": "sr63+LgnLl7DYX/VWR8BUA==", "fsize": 53482, "resto": 0, "id": "qQpsMimc", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dear-biz", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 53103213, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:00:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;his ancestors were not Aryan freemasons therefore he doesn&#039;t live in a white enclave in the southern hemisphere avoiding all northern hemisphere cucks with their wars, cold weather and general poverty</span><br>F", "time": 1672646412, "resto": 53103042, "id": "CLkuBwB1"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53102148, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)00:24:16", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "it&#039;s unironically over", "com": "it&#039;s over bros. bitcoin is dead forever", "filename": "over", "ext": ".png", "w": 781, "h": 664, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 212, "tim": 1672637056415000, "time": 1672637056, "md5": "td7XbokuQIgi0/vkvzMVog==", "fsize": 62716, "resto": 0, "id": "ye7J5WfM", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "its-unironically-over", "replies": 8, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 53102161, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)00:26:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;since it happened before, it MUST happen again!</span><br>Fucking bulltards, I swear to God.", "time": 1672637160, "resto": 53102148, "id": "ZpDw49Li"}, {"no": 53102183, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)00:29:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t know about alt season</span>", "time": 1672637370, "resto": 53102148, "id": "t+23nC04"}, {"no": 53102341, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)00:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53102161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53102161</a><br>bro he said its over are you stupid?", "time": 1672638623, "resto": 53102148, "id": "R/zPRlfi"}, {"no": 53102359, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)00:52:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t get that understand it happened once for BTC therefore it&#039;s priced for a cycle like last time</span><br>Ngmi", "time": 1672638755, "resto": 53102148, "id": "IdIOqWGe"}, {"no": 53102743, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)01:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53102341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53102341</a><br>He&#039;s obviously being ironic, you stupid ape.", "time": 1672642005, "resto": 53102148, "id": "ZpDw49Li"}, {"no": 53102747, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)01:47:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I boughted", "time": 1672642050, "resto": 53102148, "id": "qfoOVS9O"}, {"no": 53103184, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)02:56:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53102148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53102148</a><br><br>Yeah bobos are retards.
