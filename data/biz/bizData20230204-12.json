Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674261391277545", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2176, "h": 3200, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675363740444426, "time": 1675363740, "md5": "YrMEeTOm/GlA4k4iCLs2nw==", "fsize": 1488978, "resto": 0, "id": "2frkKXYE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 187, "images": 83, "unique_ips": 61}, {"no": 53546656, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53479388#p53479388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479388</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675363983473723, "time": 1675363983, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53546578, "id": "29Gt0B4s"}, {"no": 53546680, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:54:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675364308863250, "time": 1675364308, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53546578, "id": "29Gt0B4s"}, {"no": 53546801, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:59:26", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "1620261867754", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1675364366724476, "time": 1675364366, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53546578, "id": "4t13Nuhw", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53546904, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:03:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bitcoin is kill.<br><br>https://ordinalswallet.com/inscript<wbr>ion/bb6f577e30e6840dce0474f3c3c5513<wbr>4404688e844982a49161502d3d69e322di0<wbr>", "filename": "maxresdefault", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675364638629209, "time": 1675364638, "md5": "vfXF2sz+U76NalUW/Rs+hw==", "fsize": 105923, "resto": 53546578, "id": "caIYEF9H"}, {"no": 53546989, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:07:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Monerochan x Avachan lesbian makeout session when?", "filename": "1675320580313669", "ext": ".png", "w": 896, "h": 1344, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675364855674254, "time": 1675364855, "md5": "qwDIWAIsazkY+X8DiPxjeQ==", "fsize": 1636445, "resto": 53546578, "id": "QI+aEiRg"}, {"no": 53547165, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:15:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53546989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546989</a><br>Get your pajit shit out of this general <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE", "time": 1675365345, "resto": 53546578, "id": "caIYEF9H"}, {"no": 53547269, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Tapping in.<br>Fuck Bitcoin, and Bless Ordinal.<br>This year is the year Bitcoin finally dies.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Din<wbr>EKqtCDkg", "filename": "Monero-chan Doodle Momiji Stack Edit Upscaled", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675365664054347, "time": 1675365664, "md5": "jJ5IIf5zTuKRE+yEg9J0TQ==", "fsize": 773903, "resto": 53546578, "id": "tBd4mv6G"}, {"no": 53547900, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:55:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53546989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546989</a><br>Cute girl, too bad it&#039;s representing a worthless &quot;smart&quot; contract project.", "time": 1675367707, "resto": 53546578, "id": "RRDW9gIT"}, {"no": 53548002, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:00:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53547269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53547269</a><br>Fuck CBDC coin.", "filename": "FURPFxWWUBkiPAg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 709, "h": 697, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1675368022576683, "time": 1675368022, "md5": "dPeqjeACyprlJzvdpPA1tA==", "fsize": 118937, "resto": 53546578, "id": "RRDW9gIT"}, {"no": 53548295, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:17:20", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53546904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546904</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bitcoin is kill.</span><br>yes", "filename": "pizza", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 645, "h": 645, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675369040398653, "time": 1675369040, "md5": "yzavsPHRqlLPISCKyvMR4w==", "fsize": 87817, "resto": 53546578, "id": "mNqAs1EJ"}, {"no": 53548811, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:46:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53548295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53548295</a>", "filename": "1140815934", "ext": ".gif", "w": 481, "h": 201, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1675370810444505, "time": 1675370810, "md5": "87pYB59m1cxwv6d7jyzbOA==", "fsize": 2381987, "resto": 53546578, "id": "t0TLRW7S"}, {"no": 53548844, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:48:14", "com": "https://youtu.be/96vyHj4VKn8", "time": 1675370894, "resto": 53546578, "id": "4oDTFjze", "trip": "!hPFV6Brm5A"}, {"no": 53549107, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)16:02:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/biz/thread/53479388#p53543253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53543253</a><br>LOL what the fuck, this is actually so good for Monero.

Hes such an anomaly it took 15 years for someone like him to come around. His first ever sponsorship was for 10,000 dollars and guess what he ddi with that money? Gave the lot to a homeless crackhead at an intersection. He deserves his fame because he went against the youtuber instinct of earning money for themeslves. He decided &quot;fuck it, the lot is going to other people so I get more growth&quot;. For that he deserves it. Sheep retards (OP and all the haters) are mad because hes gotten famous for going down a path that literally NOBODY tried for 15 years.

It can not be minted from thin air it is backed by the energy. Why is this important ? It provides an escape route to the informed individuals. While your boomer 1st world parents deem bitcoin risky while holding an inflationary central bank ponzi fiat currency. 3rd and 2nd world countries have no option other than choosing bitcoin like Argentina, Turkey and Nigeria where yearly inflation is more than 50%. Who cares about those countries anon ? True but do not underestimate the money these people have, their potential economic boom is mostly limited with their corrupt governments who print unlimited fiat ponzi papers.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Theory is that Decentralization starts with chaosly prices and gravitates towards an orderly manner.

Does this mean that a trillion dollars have been pumped into the coin? No, not even a hundred dollars, yet its market cap is over a trillion. This simple example illustrates how na\u00efve market cap discussions are when it comes to crypto.<br> <br>XRP\u2019s price will be determined by utility, not by market cap. For example, SWIFT moves around $5 trillion dollars per day. $5 trillion divided by 100 billion XRP = $50 dollars per coin, and this is assuming that SWIFT owned all the supply. XRP is going after more than just SWIFT, it is going after a $2.7+ quadrillion market. Market cap means nothing.<br><br>XRP will handle much more than SWIFT; it will eliminate the need for nostro accounts (worth $27 trillion), tap into the $2.7 quadrillion global transfer market, as well as interact with other blockchains and technologies. In other words, if XRP\u2019s price was low, it wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the trillions/quadrillions within its 100 billion coins.<br> <br>XRP will likely be pegged to precious metals and/or a basket of assets to make the price even more stable and liquid over time, likely by governments, central banks, and institutions like the IMF.<br><br>Find out more regarding XRP: <a

I wanted to oil up her tits and slide around. But she wasn&#039;t into it. So I may need to figure that one out. Is it weird that she leaves the door cracked an inch or two during the massage? She&#039;s in 69 position on me with her tits out. And also the wall doesn&#039;t touch the ceiling on one side.

Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty&#039;s forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at one-hundred-and-forty-five million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than one-hundred-and-forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared.

I\u2019m slightly obsessed with clean water so let me weigh in here. You have two real options:<br>Option 1 - Top loading water dispenser. Any halfway decent mid tier system is fine. However, you want 5gal GLASS jugs, not plastic. Doesn\u2019t matter if they say bpa free, you want glass. This is assuming close enough to somewhere you can refill with RO water. Most Whole Foods and a few other places have it just look around. Price is usually around $2 per 5gal. High PH water is a meme so don\u2019t be a retard. If you live too far to do that then fine get delivery. Costco does it for like 25 a month.<br><br>Now of course you\u2019ll still be showering etc. in trash water but at least it\u2019s topical for the most part. You and your family will be ingesting significantly higher quality water which is the most important aspect. This is the most cost effective option. Get a shower filter if you wanna go the extra 15%<br><br>Option 2 - If you have the money to blow, a whole house water filter isn\u2019t a bad idea. Also not bad for resale either. Do your research on filters. I had one on my last house and was pretty happy with it. Worth it if you have the funds. <br><br>Personally running option 1 at my current house. Mainly bc I like cold fucking water without having to fill up shit and put it in the fridge. I want it immediately, out of a tap, but that\u2019s me.

HR wanted each person to tell everyone about a time they committed a racist micro aggression. So we had the usual. Some chick crossed the street when they saw Tyrone coming. She apologized no directly to the black females in the group but was looking at them. The black females were looking solemn like they were hurt that they keedz were treated so unjustly. Next person said they picked a different lab partner in school because he felt he wanted to get a passing grade lol. Another admitted to going to a different oil change place with less Jamal&#039;s because the last time they didn&#039;t put the oil cap back on and oil sprayed everything in the engine compartment haha. I talked to him later he said he smelled buring oil and lifted his hood. It got to me and I told them I breathe through my mouth when I am near blacks. Like in the elevator, or if I pass them or they are walking in front of me. There were audible gasps in the room. HR took me aside and told me to go home the rest of the day.
