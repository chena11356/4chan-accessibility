It&#039;s a million times better for trading major indexes than CFDs. Spreads are as small as they can be, there are great platforms, you are on the open market and not fighting against your broker (so no conflict of interest, remember, T212 makes money from you losing money in CFDs, futures brokers don&#039;t care, they make money from comissions), much better tools for execution etc. Futures brokers require a bit more effort and capital to get started compared to trash tier brokers like Robinhood and T212.<br><br>AMP global is the sister company of AMP futures, and also offers CFDs, Forex and some more, compared to AMP futures, which only has futures contracts. It&#039;s also more accessible (easier to make and fund an account), but the platform selection for them is very limited compared to AMP futures.<br><br>As for leverage in futures, it works a bit differently. For an MES contract (smallest S&amp;P futures), you usually need 40$ of margin and every point of move on the futures price equals 5 dollars of change in the value of your position. So in essence, with 40$ of margin, you get the same exposure as you&#039;d get with buying/selling 5 CFDs on the US 500 in T212, which would required close to 1000$ of margin. So it works differently, but in practice, it&#039;s similar to having massive leverage, ~1:500. You can also scale it.

Then I look at the wallets and noticed Binance owner like almost 60% of the tokens. Then I looked at their futures and perpetuals and noticed that there were about 170M Jasmy that were set for liquidation on the short side to 0.0055USD. And it\u2019s slowly inching towards it , and thought to myself that if this position was reached then it would liquidations which would then cause even more liquidations as it fills the orders of the shorts further up. Then I looked at other perpetuals on kucoin and a bunch of the other ones and noticed that they had large amounts which were sitting there waiting to be liquidated. So if /biz/ got together and caused a short squeeze on Jasmy , it would pump the price double to what it is now , and also make our money go up because we all bet on the perpetuals together. <br>I am curious if it would work if a bunch of racist internet autists came together to squeeze Japan and Sony.<br>We can tell Reddit later once we need exit liquidity? <br>You anons in?

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "TimingIsEverything", "ext": ".png", "w": 1044, "h": 1376, "tn_w": 189, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674245596678027, "time": 1674245596, "md5": "yOgEvdL4Fhq0x09PyZ/pHw==", "fsize": 413734, "resto": 0, "id": "xl7/llK9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 231, "images": 71, "unique_ips": 87}, {"no": 53362347, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:14:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53341487#p53341487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53341487</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674245674099985, "time": 1674245674, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53362323, "id": "xl7/llK9"}, {"no": 53362365, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:15:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674245946149923, "time": 1674245946, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53362323, "id": "xl7/llK9"}, {"no": 53362454, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:20:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Also, find the parlors where they don&#039;t even mention the word tip at the end or at any point. You&#039;ll eventually find one where they don&#039;t even expect anything more than $20 or $40 tips. They won&#039;t rush you as much and it&#039;s just a better experience knowing that they aren&#039;t trying to hustle you. But the hustle ones can be good too if you want someone specific. Just gotta accept that you are paying a higher price. So make sure it&#039;s worth it if you do. Have your hygiene on point though. Haircut, deodorant, shower, trim your bush and shave your beard /trim it. Brush teeth, mouth wash, mints, clean clothes. When you arrive, lay face up but cover your junk so that you can give the initial appearance that you&#039;re there for a real message. When they walk in, they&#039;ll typically tell you to lay on your stomach instead. But be polite and ask if it&#039;s okay if they do only your quads and chest and stomach. They usually have no problem if you ask nicely. They&#039;ll start with chest usually. Then ask if they can rub your chest and stomach with both hands at the same time while standing behind where your head is. Like from chest down to stomach. Then after a few minutes ask if they can reach from stomach down to quads in one stroke with both hands. Show them with your hands how you want it because showing them is best since language barrier may be a issue. When they do this they may say they can&#039;t reach. This is when you can try to show /suggest that they put their knees on the table next to your head, basically in a 69 position. Now if they do this part, you&#039;re in for some fun.

Just go to one and don&#039;t expect anything to happen. It may not especially if you&#039;re nervous. Just go in like it&#039;s a everyday thing for you. Don&#039;t be pushy but don&#039;t be afraid to say what you want or hint at areas you want massaged. Being a little forward with them puts them at ease because they know that you are a regular at these sort of things. They will ask if you&#039;ve been to that location before. You ALWAYS say yes. Say about 5 weeks ago. That way it&#039;s long enough that they may have forgotten you if you really did. If they ask which girl say you can&#039;t remember the name. They usually don&#039;t ask too much beyond that though. Sometimes don&#039;t even ask that at all. Walk in, have 60 dollars ready to hand to them right when you walk in the door. Have a tip in $10 increments in your pocket. Lay the tip out on top of the chair where they can see that you have a stack of cash. It&#039;s gonna be only 4 ten dollar bills but it looks like a decent amount visually. That&#039;s gonna ensure they know you are good to go. Fully undress. Cover butt with towel. 4 inch penis isn&#039;t gonna make them laugh at all. They&#039;re Asian they have tiny hands anyway. You don&#039;t need to be experienced here. Just close your eyes and show you&#039;re enjoying yourself. Don&#039;t say nervous things like &quot;oh I guess I&#039;m having a hard time getting it up today&quot; just let them do the talking. Don&#039;t say too much unless you&#039;re telling them what you want them to do to you. Yes they&#039;re generally older. Not always. But you&#039;re not having sex with them they&#039;re just massaging the dick so don&#039;t think too much into the age thing.

An automotive-size inline single-cylinder diesel engine was modified to install an additional hydrogen direct injector. The engine was operated at a constant speed of 2000 revolutions per minute and fixed combustion phasing of \u221210 crank angle degrees before top dead centre (\u00b0CA bTDC) while evaluating the power output, efficiency, combustion and engine-out emissions. A parametric study was conducted at an intermediate load with 20\u201390% hydrogen energy fraction and 180-0 \u00b0CA bTDC injection timing. High indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) of up to 943 kPa and 57.2% indicated efficiency was achieved at 90% hydrogen energy fraction, at the expense of NOx emissions. The hydrogen injection timing directly controls the mixture condition and combustion mode. Early hydrogen injection timings exhibited premixed combustion behaviour while late injection timings produced mixing-controlled combustion, with an intermediate point reached at 40 \u00b0CA bTDC hydrogen injection timing. At 90% hydrogen energy fraction, the earlier injection timing leads to higher IMEP/efficiency but the NOx increase is inevitable due to enhanced premixed combustion. To keep the NOx increase minimal and achieve the same combustion phasing of a diesel baseline, the 40 \u00b0CA bTDC hydrogen injection timing shows the best performance at which 85.9% CO2 reduction and 13.3% IMEP/efficiency increase are achieved.", "time": 1674369765, "resto": 53376781, "id": "+7WHmKVP"}, {"no": 53384029, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:42:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/01<wbr>/charles-hugh-smith/contrarian-thou<wbr>ghts-on-the-petro-yuan-and-gold-bac<wbr>ked-currencies/<br>He covers oil and gold obviously that&#039;s in the title.

What I do expect is substantial multipliers (although by no means early bird crypto style 10x&#039;s) in the coal sector followed by dividend increases, which can then be rotated into uranium when the time comes, instead of being married to our uranium bags now and being destroyed anally without lube by opportunity cost.
