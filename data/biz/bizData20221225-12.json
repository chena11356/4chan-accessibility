Instead, you should go 100% ALGO. Imagine if the MIT professor who invented zero knowledge proofs and verifiable random functions decided to completely rework the concept of a decentralized smart contract blockchain. That professor is Silvio Micali and that blockchain is Algorand. Pure Proof of Stake is non-dilutive and actually allows for all nodes to get a chance at participating in consensus without concentrating the supply of ALGO into the hands of a few whales. Smart contracts time out and pay for storage by locking up ALGO so gas is unnecessary, fees are a formality to prevent spam. all transactions are final the instant that their block is confirmed, and blocks consistently confirm every 4-5 seconds, with a long series of upgrades on the development pipeline. It is a statistical impossibility for Algorand to fork. Once the currently slow and gradual release of ALGO ends around 2030, Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) will actually make ALGO deflationary since 1) in order for a wallet to interact with any ASA, it must \u201copt-in\u201d to it with a transaction, and 2) for each ASA a wallet is opted in to, that wallet must hold 0.1 ALGO. While that metric can be changed through governance, it can only go as low as 1 microALGO (0.000001 ALGO). With serious financial institutions, novel blockchain applications, and a growing base of passionate developers gravitating towards the speed, security, and functionality of Algorand, ALGO is an absolutely necessary DCA for this bear market. We can and will go lower, but $100 by 2030 is more than reasonable.", "filename": "04ba9c78f0a018ffd66055d7baee227d77ecc5ec339ec19b885e8b3ff4f771eb_1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 458, "h": 552, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671955179200543, "time": 1671955179, "md5": "dSbrrWHjXvg8RnjeU8LpeQ==", "fsize": 49415, "resto": 53007421, "id": "rli8J5FY"}, {"no": 53010081, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)05:58:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53007786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53007786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; solana</span><br><br>Maybe they should do some more testing", "time": 1671965900, "resto": 53007421, "id": "gvv0NWdg"}, {"no": 53010319, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:01:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53007421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53007421</a><br>NEWFAGS GETTING SCAMMED", "filename": "idiota", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 250, "h": 131, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1671969703705028, "time": 1671969703, "md5": "9ZKEHsnunhB1/pwzO0XA6g==", "fsize": 4312, "resto": 53007421, "id": "WjAt03GO"}, {"no": 53010325, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:03:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53007421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53007421</a><br>Thanks just bought 100k", "time": 1671969818, "resto": 53007421, "id": "yCqEI7iu"}, {"no": 53010402, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:20:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53009453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53009453</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; $3 when first on exchanges in 2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; $0.17 today</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Zero demand, Zero utility, All hype, Bullshit Partnership</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; dumping of ALGO ends around 2030</span><br>It&#039;ll be dead looong before then<br><a href=\"#p53010319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53010319</a><br>price chart, bullshit hype and bagholder cope of Idiota and Algoscam bagholders look identical", "filename": "1651c9e9-943d-4878-a1de-a66807d39bbc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 650, "h": 712, "tn_w": 114, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671970854390125, "time": 1671970854, "md5": "2+M8GVu5kxkLq6JcttP72Q==", "fsize": 31899, "resto": 53007421, "id": "N5TMwhft"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53010321, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:02:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ORN maybe worth it to add this coin to your Watchlist.", "filename": "che", "ext": ".png", "w": 609, "h": 544, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 223, "tim": 1671969736899345, "time": 1671969736, "md5": "v0jRhAOlC/sVIwSmdZL8lg==", "fsize": 52161, "resto": 0, "id": "HzxjZlq+", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "orn-maybe-worth-it-to-add-this-coin-to-your", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 53010381, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:16:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53010321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53010321</a><br>Nehh I only have Btc in my bag just buy and hodl I\u2019m not type of trader.

Those XRP are in escrow and we believe that they are earmarked for the banks once adoption hits. The banks that are given this XRP will be the banks that survive, the ones that either did not pack their bags before adoption or are unwilling to buy post adoption will end up going out of business due to not being able to transfer funds intrabank. No one thinks that XRP is going to be a massively traded token once adoption hits. We expect it to act exactly how banks use reserve currencies (well supposed to use them, we know they dont). It will simply sit somewhere until a xborder remittance is being processed. The buy/sell of XRP will happen in a split second before being converted into the correct currency.

So Alice goes onto her local crypto exchange and uses her Bolivianos to buy $10m worth of XRP. She sends that to Bob, who immediately sells it on his crypto exchange for Guarani.<br>So what does that actually accomplish? It seems like the main problem with cross-border (meaning cross-currency) payments would be for lack of a better word &quot;exit liquidity&quot;. That is to say, the problem with Alice just sending Bolivianos is that there wouldn&#039;t be enough liquidity in the Paraguayan currency exchanges to be able to convert it. And especially if you have a situation where you mostly have currency being sent from one country to another (i.e. first-world residents sending money home to third-world countries).<br>It seems like XRP would just make this problem worse, because there&#039;s even less chance that there would be enough liquidity on either the Boliviano-XRP or Guarani-XRP pair.

And since you and I don&#039;t own these data centers, these corporate nodes decide what transactions are approved. In other words, you open the network to censorship. This is precisely how Infura was able to censor Tornado Cash a few months back. Most people rely on node infrastructure providers like Infura, Alchemy , etc. because the Ethereum blockchain is chunky. A 2TB hard drive might be sufficient now, but if we&#039;re going to see widespread adoption later, take into account that the limit right now is 20TB and they&#039;re expensive, and beyond this the other solution is data centers, or making your own data center lol.<br><br>I also don&#039;t think Monero can survive without Bitcoin.

Nakamoto consensus is hyper efficient because a block header (timestamp, nonce, etc.) is only necessary once and is 80 bytes, and transaction ordering information solves the rest of consensus for the entire network because nodes can create blocks on their own without &quot;sending blocks&quot; to anyone (which is how most people think it works), and the transaction ordering data is roughly 6 bytes per transaction (so on a 250 byte average tx we&#039;re already dealing with an astonishing 97.4% efficiency compared to just pure mempool data).<br><br>In your example of (say) 1500 tx in a block, we would have ~9,080 bytes of information needed to achieve global consensus against ~375,000 bytes for the raw tx data (using 250 bytes/tx), which would make the overhead about 2.4%.", "time": 1671918338, "resto": 52993483, "id": "xLnZzODR"}, {"no": 53005997, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)17:01:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53004735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53004735</a><br>question marks are not an argument<br><br><a href=\"#p53003917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53003917</a><br>not an argument. look I want monero to work and be secure and private. the tech just isn&#039;t there yet.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1640435575462", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4572, "h": 4040, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1671853920036373, "time": 1671853920, "md5": "JMG275ZjGKZZeCWMkkVD4Q==", "fsize": 3937075, "resto": 0, "id": "1U+pzxG9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 89, "images": 39, "unique_ips": 47}, {"no": 52999287, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:53:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52942053#p52942053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52942053</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671854022165243, "time": 1671854022, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671854353882828, "time": 1671854353, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999336, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brainlet here, is there a way to swap monero for bitcoin or vice versa, <br>pls dont laugh ):", "time": 1671854363, "resto": 52999274, "id": "Sjyu/3Jr"}, {"no": 52999339, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

So here is one a bit more condensed down.<br><br>Supercomputers cannot run randomX as they are extremely specialized towards one task, and might not even have the hardware to preform some of the operations needed. Case and point, the top are literally running on GPUs.<br>For data centers, a similar thing occurs. Take a look at AWS&#039;s instances and plans, and you can see that they are custom tailed towards a specific need, like loading handling, rendering, simulations, fast/slow data storage, databases, etc. So a generic algorithm like randomX, that uses various aspects of a customer grade CPU, will run sub-optimal on all of them.<br>Additionally, data centers are used for everything, so asking them to turn it off, while possible is extremely costly. You would be asking them to turn of essential infrastructure for the backbones of the internet, that comes with a huge price tag. And you can count in the fact that data centers don&#039;t utilize 100% CPU, cooling and electricity issues. And overall it does not make sense to use them on a large scale.<br><a href=\"#p53010310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53010310</a><br>I&#039;m too bored to do the napkin math again, but iirc it would cost $400 million just in the cost of CPUs to get the power required for te 51%. Add 4GB DDR4 RAM to each, plus a PSU, plus a motherboard, plus all that is required to cool such a behemoth. And you can easily go over 1 billion USD to attack a small drug dealer&#039;s currency still in its early days.<br>And yes you can try to make a custom CPU just for randomX, but it&#039;ll essentially be the same as modern AMD CPU, with some overhead.

Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This takes a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant! Rather, it is only to point out that, when looking at the case at hand (i.e., ease for both back-end and front-end development), they are not the top choice.<br><br>THERE IS NO NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED DATA EXTRACTION WHEN THE DATA IS ALREADY COMING FROM DECENTRALIZED BLOCKS!!!

It&#039;s centralized. Centralization is faster and easier than decentralization.<br>2. It evolves more rapidly. PRQ&#039;s team has already moved on to a completely new project, while GRT&#039;s team is still working its first project.<br>3. Small and scrappy. GRT has a team of dozens if not hundreds of people, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. PRQ has a small team and very little money, so it knows how to fight for its survival and relevance with limited resources.<br>4. Legality. PRQ&#039;s business confidently operates in full compliance with the law of the United Kingdom. GRT indexes the data of sanctioned smart contracts, its DAOs are incorporated in tax havens, and some of its validators run in countries of questionable diplomatic standing. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t want anyone to control it, and this is wrong.<br>5. Affordability. GRT makes its users pay fees for its services. PRQ just asks that its users hold the token for services, and sell it when they&#039;re done.<br>6. Focus. PRQ&#039;s small team is focused on lots of different projects at once. GRT is focused on one project, and it doesn&#039;t even lend NFTs.<br>7. For the common man. PRQ has lots of small customers. GRT is used by amoral global entities like Goldman Sachs and the WEF.<br>8. Economics. GRT holders have to stake to earn a worthwhile cut of fees, and risk volatility with their investments. PRQ is a real business that gets paid directly for its services without a need for frivolous nonsense like profit sharing or value accrual.<br>9. Marketing. PRQ isn&#039;t afraid to talk about price action and predictions on official outlets. GRT aggressively discourages it in all their official communities and communications.<br>10. Specialization. PRQ was built by engineers. GRT has to hire engineers, cryptographers, data scientists, financial analysts, designers, and devrels to help build their product, and that&#039;s expensive.", "time": 1671871962, "resto": 52993237, "id": "FC9F7UB+"}, {"no": 53001084, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:41:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52999004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999004</a><br>How can you say that 99% of the tokens are released when the circulating supply is 170 million and the total is like 300 million?", "time": 1671874878, "resto": 52993237, "id": "IohuMduE"}, {"no": 53001170, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:12:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000769</a><br>Yeah don&#039;t trust that guy on that kind of info, he claimed GRT could not go below 10c, which is why he&#039;s now shilling PRQ lmao", "time": 1671876747, "resto": 52993237, "id": "jLJNQvLI"}, {"no": 53001198, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000940</a><br>Who&#039;s meant to fall for this bait?", "time": 1671877210, "resto": 52993237, "id": "YmuIbZEV"}, {"no": 53001212, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:24:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>Should we buy their new token when it&#039;s released?", "time": 1671877487, "resto": 52993237, "id": "ftj8mLGM"}, {"no": 53001228, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:28:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>999999 other shitcoin scams claimed this retarded shit (surely your pajeet coin partnered with aws) and of course not even the most established cryptos are used in any of that.", "time": 1671877736, "resto": 52993237, "id": "5jmbcW24"}, {"no": 53001269, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:38:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "because they don&#039;t plan to use their Reserve which is locked atm.

It didn\u2019t collapse organically you can decide for yourself why it happened. Most people speculate an attack from FTX, blackrock or inside sabotage by Do Kwon or even a mixture. Either way a quantum mint happened and it crashed Luna from $100 to under 0. Millions of dollars turned into thousands. Some call it the largest loss of wealth in history, people were destroyed and many committed suicide. During the aftermath people were lost on what to do and different sides started arguing. Ultimately Do Kwon decided on a fork against the advice of CZ who wanted to just burn the supply. Do Kwon basically jumped ship and left the old chain up for grabs. This is why we have LUNC and TUNA today.<br><br>LUNC was going to be listed alongside TUNA on basically every exchange. This needed to happen because Do Kwon wanted an airdrop to pre crash wallets. The problem was Do Kwon needed LUNC to die because all its liquidity and attention belonged to TUNA, but having it on every exchange just drew more attention and gave hope for its revival. The hope drew in the shorters trying to kill the baby phoenix. This was the first big shakeout it was a literal poo-op telling people to sell and buy link and matic instead.<br><br>This eventually passed when a group of rebel devs, who work for free, wanted to revitalize the chain. With this break a new villain also appeared, GCR and his faggot disciples. This is where the current drama started as the rebels got compromised. At first they wanted to mint more LUNC to create USTN to airdrop to crash victims as a sacrifice. Then they want to hand over all governance to 9 people who get paid $60k+ a year to destroy the coin.

While many LUNC holders liked the idea of increased independence from TFL, Agora users criticized the proposal for being vague and lacking details on how the $150k would be spent specifically. The proposal passed and it was discovered that a portion of the $150k would be spent paying Discord moderators, &quot;community relations&quot; team, and other useless bloat. It was also revealed 4 out of the 12 of TR&#039;s &quot;active members&quot; were people whose primary role was Discord moderator. People called out TR for presenting a proposal that was ostensibly about developing a wallet and then using the funds to pay for things like Discord moderation and that 1/3 of their active members did not meaningfully contribute to anything to LUNCs technical development. Instead of receiving and constructively responding to the critical feedback, TR members like Rexx and ClanMudhorn acted smug about it and basically told everyone in was none of their business how TR spends the money, even though the proposal was explicitly for wallet development, and that Discord moderation was a very important job. While all of this was happening, Zaradar had already indicated he was stepping away from TR over disagreements about funding. The wallet fiasco was the final straw. Without a serious developer like Zaradar associated with TR, the community no longer has any patience for them. Ultimately,TR&#039;s fall is for the best because they were a case study of the Pareto Principle in action.

Grifted of over $5k across 3 months only to get a middle finger and nothing else. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at least that only took a year to save haha</span>", "filename": "1663787769068641", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 668, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671926075022763, "time": 1671926075, "md5": "eJsUJruozx1YHoYtgop4Qw==", "fsize": 52702, "resto": 53006570, "id": "TJ16RQVK"}, {"no": 53006870, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)18:59:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53006600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53006600</a><br>That will 100% not happen", "time": 1671926362, "resto": 53006570, "id": "2hCAdzZl"}, {"no": 53006916, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:04:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53006787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53006787</a><br>Not everyone that\u2019s selling bought a house for tip too priced and not everyone cares as much about their financials as this board does. <br><br>The sooner you realise that you\u2019re literally creating a make believe world to fit your narrative, the sooner you can make better decisions and stick to them.", "time": 1671926654, "resto": 53006570, "id": "2hCAdzZl"}, {"no": 53007026, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:25:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53006870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53006870</a><br>Ok boomer", "time": 1671927919, "resto": 53006570, "id": "lkYrt7NS"}, {"no": 53008553, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:47:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53006600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53006600</a><br>much of the silent generation is still alive desu. boomers will not die off for a while at least. what is more likely to happen is boomers will keep trying to prop up the value of housing preventing a crash + recovery so all the millenials who cant afford a home yet will not be able to pay these high prices and the ones that have manged to afford one wont have their wealth increase. <br>boomers are going to try to hold onto their wealth and drag millenials and the entire market down with them in the process. the ONLY release valve is crypto. buckle up niggers", "time": 1671943661, "resto": 53006570, "id": "ahZMxRBX"}, {"no": 53008573, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:49:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53006570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53006570</a><br>Wait a year and they will be panic selling for much cheaper.", "time": 1671943784, "resto": 53006570, "id": "oG14T4fj"}, {"no": 53008887, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)00:42:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53006916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53006916</a><br>Holy hamburgers.

Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since. They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH.

They finally got the chain back up (they had a xchain version, bech on like 8 chains, echs main feature was that it was interoperable with nearly every major chain) and decided to shut down their bridges (at this point IBC was disabled due to the chain halt). They gave people 7 day notice to get rid of their bech before liquidity was pulled (there is a 21day unbonding period for staked ech so if you didnt agree, tough you had no choice). They shut the bridges down...and suddenly the chain was a silo and had 0 connection to any outside chains, or even a CEX meaning there was no way to trade in and out of the network........Then they got a cex to list them, the cex was a known scam cex who stole peoples deposits. Then they got a different cex to list them...it was also a scam cex that would not allow anyone to create an account. So we were still stuck. Finally after about 3 months total they got IBC working again, they added liquidity..but they put less than 1k split between 3 pools, when the bech pools from before had something like 60k liquidity.

That way, you&#039;ll get yourself into the Soundcloud algorithm.<br><br>And I believe it&#039;s very important to mention that it&#039;s OK to look back at your work and delete/private old stuff.

Too often now companies tack on manipulative themes of social causes. Along with various manipulative audio and imagery advertisers abuse our brains to embed their products in any way possible, even using guilt, shame, and social conformity to paint a false picture of reality. This distopian future we live in takes advantage of every day people, and pushes them into believing the NEED when in reality they werent even searching for the product or services. Advertisers have attempted to interupt every cognition they can to try and sell as much as possible. The generation of advertisers that control the world are torturing the public, and it shows. They utilize peers to get as close to you as possible, sometimes turning even your loved ones into an advertisement. Where do we draw the line, where do we, the public, stick up for ourselves and stop letting these forced perceptions manipulate our people. Advertisers have utilized computer algorithms to maximize how much they can distract people with content that is most similar to their everyday hobbies, jobs, and tasks. I say we draw the line. I say we redefine what our reality is, instead of letting these corporations invade our minds all day everyday. People are not immune, no one can stop them from pushing infinite agendas on you to extract the only thing they care about\u2026your money. No corporation does anything if it would not profit them.

Equities (Tech notably) have not responded Friday\u2019s move up in yields. The DXY is moving sideways at the cusp of breaking out of its wedge. Ultimately, equities look to have one more leg lower with yields hitting the upper target of 3.9%, VIX rallying substantially (20%)+ to test last week\u2019s high and form a potential short term double top, and the DXY moving up sharply (1.5%).

Even Semis, which had a whopping 40% discount, are now only -9%. Numerous big caps are forming positive divergence regarding their RSIs.

Defensives, financials, and energy look to be potential leaders of any near-term future bounce.<br> <br>\u2022 The SPX is down 9% from its 12/13 high. Historically, the B wave correction occurs after the SPX drops 7-12%. There is a large demand zone at 370-372.

A break above 80 opens the door to a 90 handle, but only if the 76 level holds. If the above thesis plays out, crude may backtest 75-77 one last time before rocketing higher.

What&#039;s your point?<br><br>Virtually none of the &quot;bears&quot; on any of these sites have any actual financial interest in tesla. Short interest is around 2%. Back in 2018 when Elon made the fake $420 buyout squeeze, short interest was closer to 20%. <br>You can claim that tesla is seeing tax-loss selling, or that it&#039;s had a massive 70% decline, or whatever, but compare it to virtually any other tech stock. Almost all of them are already back at or below their pre-covid levels by now. Tesla still has another 75-80% to fall just to return there. Tesla longs are still almost universally in profit right now. The only losers are the S&amp;P and other ETF holders that loaded up as Tesla became the miracle stock that all &quot;passive&quot; ETFs had to include these past few years. Based on net-selling, Elon is essentially the only person that&#039;s actually benefitted from these moves.<br>You may convince yourself that this is some kind of capitulation, on the basis that tesla has lost it&#039;s status as one of the last survivors of the bull market. You&#039;re not wrong there - AAPL is the final survivor. There is no capitulation in TSLA holders though. This is still just long term profit taking. Today&#039;s sellers are last year&#039;s winners, afraid to see their rapidly dwindling stack of gains. It&#039;s the very beginning of bears becoming re-engaged in the name.<br>Of course, some longs will double down here, seeking to retake their all time portfolio highs, noting that it&#039;s worked every time before. Some new investors will jump in, trying to &quot;buy the dip&quot;, to get a discount on the greatest company of all time.<br>None of it will work though.
