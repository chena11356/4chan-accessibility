Everything that has ever happened in my life has influenced my in such a way that I would be here posting tonight and feel compelled to post it. I don\u2019t see why this is difficult for to understand, it\u2019s even laid out for you in my post. I replied to two anons? Why did I reply to them? Because they were posting about hereditary and determinism and it compelled me to post about how we don\u2019t have free will. It\u2019s a perfect example of how external factors (their posts) coupled with what is inherent in me (my ideas about free will and willingness to share them) were the determining factors in my behavior. Do I FEEL like I made conscious a choice to post it? Yes. Was at I really a choice? No, not really. You could think about the choices people make in terms of drug addiction as a way to \u201csimplify\u201d the idea. Why does a heroin addict seek out heroin? It\u2019s because of the neural pathways in their brain that were created by their heroin use that compels them to. It\u2019s not because of anything outside of chemical reactions going on their brain as a result of their biology, their upbringing, their environment or all of the circumstances in their life that led them to seek out heroin in the first place. All of these things coalesce to influence the decisions people make, but none of it has anything to what we conceptualize as \u201cfree will\u201d. Just because you\u2019re not a drug addict doesn\u2019t mean that your brain doesn\u2019t work the exact same way. It does, it\u2019s just less blatantly obvious. Think about your personality for example? Why do you behave the way that you do? It\u2019s because, in a sense, you are addicted to behaving that way. You have been molded by all of the factors I previously mentioned into becoming the person that you are today. It wasn\u2019t a choice, it was a the effect of all of the causes in your life and a subsequent habitualization of that effect.", "time": 1673499971, "resto": 53230398, "id": "EAJ9cIaj"}, {"no": 53233170, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:06:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;53233147</span><br>You don\u2019t even realize the irony in responding to my post.

Moisturized means maintaining proper hydration and moisture levels in the skin, hair, and other tissues, which is important for maintaining healthy, glowing skin and preventing dryness and other issues. Happy is a feeling of contentment and joy that can come from various sources and is an important part of a well-rounded and fulfilling life.

Focused is a state of mind that allows for concentration on a specific task or goal and requires discipline and concentration. Flourishing is a state of growth and thriving, being in a positive and healthy state, which can be achieved through self-care, positivity, and a commitment to personal growth.

As anons filter into the Discord once we release the link this issue will go away over time.<br>- Anons haven&#039;t reached a consensus on which way to vote on the proposals 11242 and 11243, but it&#039;s a moot point at this time since the proposals are going to pass anyways.<br><br><a href=\"#p53205297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53205297</a><br>That is completely fair to do.

They believe in the potential of Polygon and want to see it succeed. Plus, having a concentrated supply means that it&#039;s more secure against 51% attacks. And just because the top 3 entities control over half of the supply staked doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re going to launch an attack, they&#039;re just invested in the network. And yes, only 6 admin keys are required to change the entire network at any time, but those keys are distributed among multiple members of the Polygon team, not just one person. And who cares about the number of validators, as long as they&#039;re all working together to secure the network. And the blockchain has never been halted or shut down, that&#039;s just a rumor. And 33 TPS is more than enough for a growing network like Polygon.

I live in a rich urban area full of multimillion dollar houses, but it is still urban with access to public transit, walkable streets, restaurants, grocery stores, and is still high density in comparison to suburbs (though lower density than further downtown). Of course, if you live in the fucking ghetto city life sucks. Just like if you live in the ghetto in ANY other area in the country. Alabama for example has rural areas WITH NO SEWAGE SYSTEMS. That doesn&#039;t mean every rural area is bad. That shit is just as bad as the worst areas of Detroit for other reasons. But I believe wealthy urban areas are objectively nicer than wealthy rural areas because you get the best of both worlds. More space, more public infrastructure, art and entertainment investments (rich people love investing in museums and shit) and connections to poorer areas which frankly have more robust art and entertainment scenes because poor people are wildin and rich people are boring. I lived in suburban locations for most of my life, including rural locations for periods of time, and I understand the appeal but being in wealthy urban areas is the pinnacle for people that aren&#039;t shut-in anti-social NEETs and off-grid type folks.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1672965660054996", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 3072, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673487111853484, "time": 1673487111, "md5": "nyGVK2nQqd1x5/RNQwRwYA==", "fsize": 1397266, "resto": 0, "id": "gyDU8H+Y", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 66, "images": 29, "unique_ips": 34}, {"no": 53231154, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:33:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53181100#p53181100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53181100</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673487196611969, "time": 1673487196, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53231130, "id": "gyDU8H+Y"}, {"no": 53231168, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:34:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673487451257592, "time": 1673487451, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53231130, "id": "gyDU8H+Y"}, {"no": 53231229, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:38:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Some FTM maybe. Smaller things like LPT and FLOW. Maybe some LINK, DOGE, SHIBA as there are communities behind that can pump them. You&#039;ll need to create a portfolio and use limit orders to take your initial investment out at time. If the market continues to go up, everything will go up more or less. The question is just how much. Take some small amount for some real cheap token like NOW (0x02753ee6a439be76cfaf828cebe02ce8<wbr>8ecff8b5), because they are easy to pump an very volatile. And play the good old pump&amp;dump game. Never put everything on one card and always have an exit-strategy. Check out for spikes in trading volume. They can be an indicator that a token or coin is in an accumulating-phase with the plan to further pump it. Don&#039;t buy at ath. You&#039;re usually too late to the party at that point. It&#039;s often not the question of the coin or token itself you buy. It&#039;s more about where it is at a specific moment. There is no mind to buy in after a vertical chart comes down until it bottomed out. Just the likelihood that you buy in too expensive is too high. And the probability that it&#039;ll pump vertically again any time soon is quite low. Any coin or token can be fine, when your&#039;re at the right place the right time. High revenue is made by pumps and dumps on the market. These are created by hypes, emotions, promises and a created phantasy of a bright future that usually never comes. That drives the price. Not so much by fundamentals. They&#039;ve more some long-term impact on the price. But even....strong communities are more important for the price than any fundamentals. So....if something is hyped hard and everywhere it&#039;s rather time to go, than to buy in, as the risk is quite high to get ripped off.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Problem-FBI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2036, "h": 1356, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673178448792995, "time": 1673178448, "md5": "I29tv2wUVd0kQimXu3vzNg==", "fsize": 1150964, "resto": 0, "id": "igNLpwnN", "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 315, "images": 104, "unique_ips": 112}, {"no": 53181106, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:48:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "pedophile spambot threads", "time": 1673178517, "resto": 53181100, "id": "OPbX2eGO"}, {"no": 53181110, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:49:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53133327#p53133327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133327</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673178543092988, "time": 1673178543, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53181100, "id": "igNLpwnN"}, {"no": 53181118, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:50:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673178805501679, "time": 1673178805, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53181100, "id": "igNLpwnN"}, {"no": 53181148, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:54:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.
