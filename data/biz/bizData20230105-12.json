you could just put your money into a US stock market and bank on guaranteed longterm, yearly or almost entirely yearly positive returns, is gone. Almost certainly forever. It&#039;s done. The US economy is gonna be on a global decline and contraction path from now on going forward, and stagnation is the best case scenario.<br><br>Emerging markets overseas are where all of the money is going and where all of the future business is going to be happening. Communist places, frankly. The USSR had a lot of geographic disadvantages which led to it losing the coldwar. But communist or socialist countries out there today don&#039;t have those disadvantages. China or India don&#039;t have those disadvantages. So that just leaves the US with the reality that is an inefficient, free market, capitalist system that is attempting to economically compete against far more agile, intelligent and centrally planned communist and socialist economies. Ultimately, those economies are more efficient and the efficiency is key to their success. They result in lower costs of living. People don&#039;t have to pay landlords, or shareholders, or make payments to the ultrawealthy capitalist parasite class. And it&#039;s all just so much more efficient and works out better. That&#039;s why they grow and we contract. So understand that they&#039;re gonna take over the global economy over the space of the next few years. Possibly Russia, too. And that&#039;s the future. It&#039;s the end of the USA and any investor who doesn&#039;t understand that is gonna lose his shirt for many years to come in US markets.", "filename": "fuckamerica", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1011, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1672858596704049, "time": 1672858596, "md5": "LaV1WwUKVv66HaJ5YSpq0Q==", "fsize": 38342, "resto": 53133715, "id": "zfYqtGJQ"}, {"no": 53135939, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:30:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133846</a><br>fucking commie<br><br>but us markets do stink", "time": 1672867830, "resto": 53133715, "id": "e5VLjk4U"}, {"no": 53135981, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:33:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133846</a><br>good post. what markets / countries would you recommend investing in", "time": 1672868027, "resto": 53133715, "id": "iAaaKc+6"}, {"no": 53136018, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:35:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133846</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;communist states are more efficient</span><br>kek", "time": 1672868156, "resto": 53133715, "id": "DpEJPy/f"}, {"no": 53136348, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:06:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133715</a><br>Use 25x leverage", "time": 1672869985, "resto": 53133715, "id": "q+/NlxXl"}, {"no": 53136363, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:07:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133715</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Smart rich anons</span><br>They don&#039;t exist here.", "time": 1672870056, "resto": 53133715, "id": "gLRPOrW4"}, {"no": 53136454, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:14:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53136348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53136348</a><br>This and don\u2019t be wrong.", "time": 1672870490, "resto": 53133715, "id": "tuvsTHXT"}, {"no": 53136519, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:20:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133715</a><br>Gamble it on a shitcoin that will 25x", "filename": "0358F6D8-2F12-4F30-9443-785584061CDB", "ext": ".gif", "w": 978, "h": 827, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1672870828248122, "time": 1672870828, "md5": "PMnwWpMXilwGYG7mZCjT6Q==", "fsize": 1352558, "resto": 53133715, "id": "ziQXlZ0Z"}, {"no": 53136556, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:24:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133715</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Smart rich anons please tell me how to turn 200k into 5 million</span><br>Wait until ETH is $400<br>Go all-in<br>Wait 3 years<br>Done", "time": 1672871078, "resto": 53133715, "id": "i4RWcomX"}, {"no": 53136713, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:38:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53133846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133846</a><br>Communism doesn&#039;t exist, hasn&#039;t been relevant for 30 years.

It achieves this by taking blockchain transactions to the BbC-2022 layer and parsing them through the node network incentivized by super linear sequencing which Sergey said is very close to finish line. This activity is incentivized through semi-permeable staking allowing LINK token holders to benefit for verifying data both on main chain and Blockchain Byzantine Consensus 2022 layer. <br><br>The obvious benefits of super fast transaction speeds also brings exponential economies of scale! What this means sir is if farmer has 500 Kg cow for sale, he can put the beast to market on the blockchain to verify the weight in a trust less system faster than global SWIFT system.

Again, if you go back to the remarks I began with, I think if you go far enough back and look at certain types of texts, for example, the Hermetica, okay? And read them without the standard academic approach with metaphysics eyeglasses on, and read them rather as a topologist--as a mathematician\u2014would read these texts, or as even a materials engineer, you know, might read these texts, what pops out of these things is a profound metaphor of a physical medium that creates information, and that\u2019s a very modern idea. In fact, it\u2019s so modern, you know, it starts popping up in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and begins to kind of spread from there. All of this stuff is popping out of the Soviet Union.<br><br>So in other words, way back when\u2014if we go back to the Hermetica\u2014here we\u2019re dealing with a text approximately, oh give or take, you know, 2,000 years old, so in others words... But it\u2019s an Egyptian text even though it\u2019s written in Greek. Its provenance is clearly Egyptian, okay? So this is very old and yet it contains this profoundly sophisticated physics metaphor.<br><br>That\u2019s what really popped out at me, you know, when I was reading these texts. It wasn\u2019t that I was supposed to be looking and seeing Platonic Universals, you know, the chair-of-all-chairs and the horse-of-all-horses. No. None of that was what was popping out at me. What Plato\u2019s talking about is topology. He\u2019s talking about common surfaces with common forms, okay? So I\u2019m looking at this, and then I\u2019m looking at the Nazis, and they\u2019re coming up with these theories essentially in the \u201920s and \u201930s that are looking at the physical medium as an engineer-able reality. In other words, in a certain sense, as an information-creating medium. So... And again, the key to creating stable information is rotation, okay?

Well this guy\u2019s name is Karl Maria Wiligut. Okay? He has a number of aliases that he wrote esoteric treatises under. But his basic conception is that the whole universe arises out of a tension between two counter-rotating spirals which create the \u201cWorld Egg\u201d. Okay?<br><br>And when I saw that I thought: Oh boy! Because of course in the Bell, you know\u2014which I rationalize as basically a kind of hyper-dimensional torsion physics device\u2014you\u2019ve got these two counter-rotating drums into which they\u2019re putting this high-density liquid, which I think may have even incorporated an isomer as one of its components. And of course an isomer is one of these high-spin isotopes, that if you de-excite it, it will release massive amounts of energy.<br><br>Well, you\u2019ve got these two counter-rotating drums, and I\u2019m thinking: Well, here\u2019s the physics that they\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ve got these two counter-rotating things. And over here, Himmler\u2019s Rasputin is saying: Well, this is all coming out of two counter-rotating systems. You know? So I think, clearly, you had an ideological culture in the SS that, rather than inhibiting scientific progress, really kind of forced them to pursue all of this higher-dimensional physics.<br><br>BR: It actually gave them an inspirational boost.<br><br>JF: Yes. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, the kind of... the final nail in the coffin, as far as I\u2019m concerned is, if you look at the swastika itself, you know, and view that as not so much the corporate logo of the Nazi Party but as an ideogram of this whole physics idea...", "time": 1672812551, "resto": 53097031, "id": "YOWy2WnD"}, {"no": 53127214, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:11:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Let\u2019s assume the project\u2019s underway when the Nazis take power.

He corresponded with the Austrian physicist, Thirring. You know, the Lense-Thirring Effect. Satellite drag and all this, you know.

I know every shitcoin and their grandmother says this, but there&#039;s a very active community behind LUNC. It is constantly trending on Twitter and it gets a lot of attention on CMC. The development team is in a bit of a slump now that what remains of Terra Rebels has been publicly revealed to be talentless and treacherous kikes, but many of those who left TR are now working on their own thing without all the kikery, which is extremely bullish. Plus you can&#039;t forget about the CZ element of this. He has openly stated that he has obtained LUNC after the crash and has not sold any of it. He is also willingly burning millions of Binance&#039;s profits in support of the burn efforts. Do you think he would do that for any random shitcoin?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REALISTIC price prediction for this year if development is made?</span><br>Being completely realistic and not having crazy expectations for what arises from the ashes of Terra Rebels, I&#039;d say we could be looking at 0.005 eoy if we make decent progress with development and burns and macro conditions improve for crypto.

If we get incredibly lucky and Zaradar really is a 400IQ autist who is capable of repegging USTC which in turn really does burn as munch LUNC as he says it does due to swaps then $1 is absolutely possible. Again, that is in the absolute best case scenario where everything works out perfectly with LUNC developments, there are no more FTX collapses this year, and macro conditions become more favorable.", "filename": "cz_thanos", "ext": ".png", "w": 1350, "h": 1022, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1672865193540211, "time": 1672865193, "md5": "OqBnx705AeZrMSmqnhsneQ==", "fsize": 1441983, "resto": 53135172, "id": "ltNoWnb3"}, {"no": 53135376, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)15:46:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53135250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53135250</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REALISTIC price prediction for this year if development is made?</span><br><br>$0", "time": 1672865201, "resto": 53135172, "id": "rHRuHFU8"}, {"no": 53135438, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)15:51:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53135373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53135373</a><br>Based.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1665111209950096", "ext": ".png", "w": 2048, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672856299229804, "time": 1672856299, "md5": "99FqpLhnxQy8HQogarWrIA==", "fsize": 1716837, "resto": 0, "id": "hffpt4Si", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 72, "images": 25, "unique_ips": 46}, {"no": 53133356, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pedophilia coin", "time": 1672856420, "resto": 53133327, "id": "ymtrQXOI"}, {"no": 53133362, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53070955#p53070955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070955</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672856436957646, "time": 1672856436, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53133327, "id": "hffpt4Si"}, {"no": 53133376, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672856758674221, "time": 1672856758, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53133327, "id": "hffpt4Si"}, {"no": 53133447, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:27:33", "name": "Hodlin&#039; Caulfield", "filename": "nyan monero", "ext": ".gif", "w": 476, "h": 280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 73, "tim": 1672856853338891, "time": 1672856853, "md5": "L5S0IDmd8oWxMwMrFtAIVA==", "fsize": 25808, "resto": 53133327, "id": "9AqUhDdw"}, {"no": 53133456, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:27:51", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br><br>IRC- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/tzm4s<br>Aliases- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/bjbx3<br>Extras- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/daxte<br>Nodes- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/ke2k8<br>Mining- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/c7na4", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1672856871815231, "time": 1672856871, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53133327, "id": "qO3u0LWA", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53133492, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:30:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/biz/thread/53070955#p53133103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133103</a><br>So I just <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;git clone --recursive https://github.com/monero-project/m<wbr>onero</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cd monero &amp;&amp; git submodule init &amp;&amp; git submodule update</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ulimit -d 2000000</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;env DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local gmake release-static</span><br><br>everything goes well until this point<br>https://pastebin.com/3D7aNCPr", "time": 1672857011, "resto": 53133327, "id": "qO3u0LWA"}, {"no": 53133541, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:34:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I keep hearing the argument that privacy on BTC Layer 2 is impossible because the base layer is publicly visible.
