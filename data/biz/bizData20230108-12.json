There must be a compromise, and there must be a check on the system to prevent inequality that leads to either a lack of ability or the lack of ability to provide for needs.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Problem-FBI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2036, "h": 1356, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673178448792995, "time": 1673178448, "md5": "I29tv2wUVd0kQimXu3vzNg==", "fsize": 1150964, "resto": 0, "id": "igNLpwnN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 15, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 53181106, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:48:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "pedophile spambot threads", "time": 1673178517, "resto": 53181100, "id": "OPbX2eGO"}, {"no": 53181110, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:49:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53133327#p53133327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133327</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673178543092988, "time": 1673178543, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53181100, "id": "igNLpwnN"}, {"no": 53181118, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:50:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673178805501679, "time": 1673178805, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53181100, "id": "igNLpwnN"}, {"no": 53181148, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:54:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

The economy has basically been running on a credit card for decades and we have been consuming our capital while creating bogus IOUs and pretending like these financial assets have any chance in hell of being paid back. <br>The bond market is $46TN in size. That is twice the size of the U.S. GDP. So there is zero chance in hell that any of these things can be paid back. <br>This becomes a simple task of understanding where are these bonds? And what are they doing? Well, they are owned by foreign nations all over the world, they are owned by our pensions, insurance companies and retirement accounts. These bonds also represent a MASSIVE glut of purchasing power that is being hidden that could easily attempt to vacuum up all remaining capital. <br>They pay for our imports that are a whopping $700BN annually. That is $700BN of goods that we can then leverage into corporate profits, taxes. They prop up real estate and stock valuations as yields remain low. <br>So even at a cursory glance we can see there is a metric fuckton of risk here.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1665111209950096", "ext": ".png", "w": 2048, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672856299229804, "time": 1672856299, "md5": "99FqpLhnxQy8HQogarWrIA==", "fsize": 1716837, "resto": 0, "id": "hffpt4Si", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 307, "images": 86, "unique_ips": 140}, {"no": 53133356, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pedophilia coin", "time": 1672856420, "resto": 53133327, "id": "ymtrQXOI"}, {"no": 53133362, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53070955#p53070955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070955</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672856436957646, "time": 1672856436, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53133327, "id": "hffpt4Si"}, {"no": 53133376, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672856758674221, "time": 1672856758, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53133327, "id": "hffpt4Si"}, {"no": 53133447, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:27:33", "name": "Hodlin&#039; Caulfield", "filename": "nyan monero", "ext": ".gif", "w": 476, "h": 280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 73, "tim": 1672856853338891, "time": 1672856853, "md5": "L5S0IDmd8oWxMwMrFtAIVA==", "fsize": 25808, "resto": 53133327, "id": "9AqUhDdw"}, {"no": 53133456, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:27:51", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br><br>IRC- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/tzm4s<br>Aliases- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/bjbx3<br>Extras- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/daxte<br>Nodes- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/ke2k8<br>Mining- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/c7na4", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1672856871815231, "time": 1672856871, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53133327, "id": "qO3u0LWA", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53133492, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:30:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/biz/thread/53070955#p53133103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133103</a><br>So I just <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;git clone --recursive https://github.com/monero-project/m<wbr>onero</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cd monero &amp;&amp; git submodule init &amp;&amp; git submodule update</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ulimit -d 2000000</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;env DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local gmake release-static</span><br><br>everything goes well until this point<br>https://pastebin.com/3D7aNCPr", "time": 1672857011, "resto": 53133327, "id": "qO3u0LWA"}, {"no": 53133541, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:34:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I keep hearing the argument that privacy on BTC Layer 2 is impossible because the base layer is publicly visible.

Mankind can be divided into two races, or groups. Those who are furnished with the immortal soul, like Judas, can come to know the God within and enter the imperishable realm when they die. Those who belong to the same generation of the other eleven disciples cannot enter the realm of God and will die both spiritually and physically at the end of their lives. As practices that are intertwined with the physical world, animal sacrifice and a communion ceremony centered around \u201ccannibalism\u201d (the consumption of Jesus\u2019 flesh and blood) are condemned as abhorrent. The other Gospels say that Jesus had to die this sort of substitutionary justice pleases the lower gods and angels. The true God is gracious and thus does not demand any sacrifice. Jesus told Judas \u201cYou shall be cursed for generations\u201d and then added, \u201cYou will come to rule over them\u201d and \u201cYou will exceed all of them, for you will sacrifice the man that clothes me.\u201d Judas is a divinely appointed instrument of a grand and predetermined purpose. Jesus favours Judas above other disciples by saying, \u201cStep away from the others and I shall tell you the mysteries of the kingdom,\u201d and \u201cLook, you have been told everything.

ICP cannot cash the &quot;muh decentralized world web3 omnicompooter&quot; check from a technical standpoint, sorry to break it to you. Hosting a website on a BFT crypto cloud host that has strictly worse flexibility, performance, and UX than AWS/Azure is not a valuable proposition. The only people who care about this are baggies and people who are concerned about whatever they&#039;re doing being censored off traditional cloud compute, which is a small minority of builders and capital (nevermind that you can get voted off the IC with a 51% vote on the NNS lul). The IC has far worse throughput capacity than avalanche, partly because it&#039;s old tech and partly because it isn&#039;t optimized for actual transaction throughput. It really is not an L1 or L0, it&#039;s outclassed Cosmos, Solana, Avalanche etc. in that regard.<br><br>Fun fact though, webhosting/cloud compute subnets could certainly be built on avalanche. What you and most other midwits don&#039;t seem to understand is that avalanche is merely a consensus platform with arbitrary trustless message passing between subnets. A subnet is merely a subset of validators who agree to process data in some arbitrary way. So you can create a subnet or a network of them with minimum hardware requirements identical to ICP, running a webhosting VM, no historical state preservation, goofy tokenomics, etc. and you can still interoperate with every other subnet on avalanche. In fact, if someone went through the trouble to rip out all the shitty classical consensus beacon garbage, etc. you could run the IC VM on avalanche but it would be faster and actually stands a chance of being a permissionless decentralized system.<br><br><a href=\"#p53157400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53157400</a><br>Only clueless midwits says this", "time": 1673018168, "resto": 53139923, "id": "Gv4N1PEN"}, {"no": 53159172, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)10:57:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53147206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53147206</a><br>BNB has 21 validators, your point is, exactly?", "time": 1673020665, "resto": 53139923, "id": "rdcMYIhH"}, {"no": 53160606, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)12:41:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53141505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53141505</a><br>MATIC is a good one.

The APY is 12%, but the supply inflation rate is currently 24%. This means that if you purchase 1% of the supply and stake it for one year then you&#039;re left with owning 0.88% of the supply you lose -12% ownership each year. Only the developers and 16 VC are allowed to own more and more of the supply each year. Thats where the extra 12% APY goes to. At least with ETH, my stack actually grows when I stake. If i own 1% of the supply and stake it then the next year i will own 1.04% then 1.08%. This is how whales measure wealth growth, not using meme dollars but by how much more % of the supply we own. ETH killers can fork ETH they can copy the dapps and code by they cannot copy its sound tokenomics, it has even surpassed bitcoin and shattered the digital gold narrative. The flippening will commence soon.

The Spanish mined 9 million ounces a year with primitive methods and equipment for centuries without any resources. They simply mined until they ran out of ore and then found another vein and mined it. All at a profit.

Always a nice surprise to see actual discussion here instead of the usual onslaught of mematic signalling. <br><br>Revolutions have always been set into motion by small groups of radical intellectuals. Even if we legally mandated an hour of reading per day for every US citizen it would make little difference. You can lead a horse to water but... The common person just wants to get through life as smoothly as possible and enjoy whatever pleasures come their way. The masses will only fight back against the system when their current situation becomes completely unbearable, the revolutionary minority directs their efforts and offers a way out. And the masses will tolerate a surprising amount of discomfort and humiliation before they consider their situation unbearable; they are like the boiling frog. I think Americans today are getting very close a level of discomfort that they will not tolerate. <br><br>You reminded me of a speech that Jonathan Bowden gave to a small audience in London. Here is an excerpt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There\u2019s a degree to which I personally think that the doctrine of vanguardism is the way out of the dilemma that we face. All Communist movements believe that the proletariat needed to be saved from itself. They believe that the masses were degraded by feudalism and by capitalism. They believe that only an elite or a vanguard party could raise the masses up to socialism as the inverse of the capitalism they wish to replace. All Communist movements that flourished in Western and other societies throughout most of the late 19th and 20th centuries based themselves upon the vanguard principle. These movements were tiny. Smaller than the number of people gathered in this room in central West London tonight by a long way.</span><br><br>1/2", "time": 1673067514, "resto": 53167403, "id": "WJFaqq7w"}, {"no": 53168236, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)00:00:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53168122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53168122</a><br>Elon &quot;Mr House&quot; Musk, Caesar &quot;El Guzman&quot;&#039;s Legion, or Donald J. &quot;Yes Man&quot; Trump?

The problem we&#039;re seeing today is the direct result of the people who are in charge of society being dumber than the people who founded it. That is why society is collapsing. We need to massively boost IQ and things will get better almost immediately. Morality doesn&#039;t disappear when you have intelligent people in fact it typically increases more neurons connecting with other neurons in the brain relating to empathy and sympathy connected to logic etc. <br><br>btw you can never control a society more than an individual can control themselves. self control is an aspect of intelligence ergo raise intelligence more self control less need for brutalistic control", "time": 1673073295, "resto": 53167403, "id": "i/Uk6DxL"}, {"no": 53168769, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)01:35:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53168719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53168719</a><br>Alexander the great conquered the ancient world because he allowed the individual cultures he conquered to retain their individuality, rather than forcing them to assimilate.", "time": 1673073345, "resto": 53167403, "id": "RtcMAaLb"}, {"no": 53168784, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)01:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53168764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53168764</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;to get along and be happy and live in a more perfect society.</span><br>we&#039;re not asking them to be happy and get along, we&#039;re asking them to be more efficient.<br>I agree with most everything else you are saying though.<br>I think the current elites are aiming for greater efficiency through degradation and control of people rather than cultivating innovators and smarter people.

History has been a relentless struggle between competing groups for power, itself happening within the framework of historical materialism whereby big picture movements and events are the results of geographic, ecological, and economic variables that shaoe the actions and attitudes of all involved in a very deterministic way. Ex: bronze age Mediterranean and Near Eastern kingdoms coalescing around centralized warrior-king social hierarchies, which evolved for historical and geographic regions. These kibgdims grew ever more centralized and powerful until they but off more than they could chew and collapsed under their own weight in the face of a random environmental stressor (drought).

This has an accelerative, exponential effect. Wealth is being increasingly concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, while the majority are forced into poor and working-poor classes. This is hard to track of course because absolute quality of life has been slightly improving for our poor--even those in poverty in the US have phones and are fat, even if their debt burden increases exponentially. In the end we&#039;ll have a corportocratic hellscape with indentured servitude and a government that is notional and there just to make us appeased and which is primarily responsible for military and LE matters.

The true blackpill is that life is about genetic determinism. Men are not born equal. Height, race, intelligence, all of these things which are IMMUTABLE and GENETIC determine your life. <br><br>In the case of intelligence, we know that IQ determines life outcomes pretty strongly. One only needs to read the bell curve to know this. There will always be an elite and a proletariat. German aristocratic families, who were bankrupted after world war two, recovered their wealth after only a generation. Michael Faraday, who was born in squalor in victorian England, became one of the greatest scientists of that time. Twin studies, i.e. studies of twins separated at birth show that environment matters little. It is a common fallacy that the environment you were raised in, or the schools that you went to determine your success, but it&#039;s actually the genetic lottery instead. If you are intelligent, you will create an intellectually stimulating environment for yourself.<br><br>People who are average and below average in intelligence can&#039;t mentally envision objects in their head. They don&#039;t have an inner monologue. They can&#039;t perform abstract reasoning. They may as well be soulless animals, or blank slates. The NPC meme is real. <br><br>It&#039;s pretty obvious that our mean IQs are decreasing. More stupid people are procreating than smart people, who waste their fertile years in college. Women don&#039;t select for intelligence either, they select for height and facial symmetry. Intelligence is shown to be actually negatively correlated with the number of sexual partners. Just look at the number of white women who get with niggers in the US. The idiocracy movie was right. With the introduction of the vaccine, the middle of the bellcurve was culled, with only the smartest and the dumbest not taking the vaccine.

I go back and forth to the philippines often, and have been since I was 24. I have a shit ton of friends there that are deeply involved with the dance scene and the night life scene so they have some social clout that I take advantage of. Most of them stay in the nicer part of Manila however a few live in Quezon city which is a trash heap. I&#039;ve been all around the islands and it&#039;s some of the most beautiful places I&#039;ve ever experienced in my entire life. The low cost of living is true to an extent. If you want to upgrade your lifestyle, you will have to pay up. There is mega money investment all across SEA and this region of the world won&#039;t always be considered a shithole. It&#039;s changing. There are parts of Manila that are more luxurious than anything I&#039;ve ever seen at home in Canada. Nicer nightclubs than anything I&#039;ve ever seen as well. If you have that USD income, you&#039;re set for sure. As for the women.. they&#039;re &quot;good&quot; in that these people are generally very nice and welcoming to me but the vast majority of them are unattractive. My friend works for GMA (major tv network there) and I&#039;ve sat in the studio audience for a couple talk shows. In the entertainment world there, they tend to prop up the lighter skinned pinoys, especially the half-white ones who can easily rise to the pinnacle of their modelling scene. Not many halfies but when you do encounter them, they&#039;re lightyears more beautiful than the regular fare. No blacks is true but they worship American culture and blacks are a part of that. Expect to see a lot of black American imitation among the youth, just as you would expect in America. The girls definitely melt for good looking white men, and it&#039;s not about money or a green card or whatever.. that&#039;s mainly cope from Asian men. The warm weather is incredible if you&#039;re on the islands. On the mainland, it makes for a smelly and smoggy mess.", "time": 1673046243, "resto": 53152090, "id": "QH/mqdhk"}, {"no": 53165273, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)18:40:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53152090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53152090</a><br>Man, you don&#039;t know what&#039;s coming.

When I called home to inform them of an issue, parents picked up, apologized, and disciplined their child. They made sure their kid did homework. They were there to pick their kids up from school. They showed up to PTO meetings, made sure there was funding for things like woodshop, cooking, sewing, auto repair classes, sporting equipment, transportation. Field trips had chaperones, students did fundraisers to make sure everyone could afford it.<br><br>Gen X on the other hand has been an absolute shit show. Every year it gets worse. The Zoomers in school today are by far the worst children I have ever taught. For as much bullshit that is spewed about how Boomers didn&#039;t work for it, Gen X is the entitlement generation. They want their kid in the honors class, even though they didn&#039;t meet the prerequisites. They want homework eliminated, and there&#039;s no late work policies. They want free lunch provided for all. Transportation to/from school should be someone else&#039;s responsibility. No more field trips - no chaperones and don&#039;t even consider asking a Zoomer to raise money in a fundraiser. They also are the reason students are never sent out of the classroom, and out-of-school detention is out of the question. They have all the information about their child&#039;s grades right on the internet, copies of all assignments available online, and still show up to parent-teacher conferences asking &quot;so how&#039;s my little Carson doing?&quot;.<br><br>Thank god I&#039;m done with these fuckers in 2 years.", "filename": "act scores", "ext": ".png", "w": 852, "h": 740, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1673150895850826, "time": 1673150895, "md5": "Ew2Tkvyh65oaQ7O9iOtOAQ==", "fsize": 1037132, "resto": 53173615, "id": "SY9ARJ5f"}, {"no": 53179260, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)00:45:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53178696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53178696</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;act exam</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Affluent Chinese Tutors exam</span>", "time": 1673156739, "resto": 53173615, "id": "A2pBkMQA"}, {"no": 53179493, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)01:21:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53177175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53177175</a><br>I don&#039;t work in tech and neither do you. <br><a href=\"#p53177482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53177482</a><br>zoomers are retarded, I don&#039;t blame their parents for wanting nothing to do with them", "time": 1673158896, "resto": 53173615, "id": "oH6gzA+t"}, {"no": 53179561, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)01:32:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53178696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53178696</a><br>Modern schooling makes no sense with the advent of the internet anyway.
