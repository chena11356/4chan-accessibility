Your average carpet laying company or curtain store will be completely unaffected by AI. If you look at most industries that most plebs work in, you&#039;ll find that the actual work has been pretty much the same for a very long time. Plus these businesses just can&#039;t afford the economy of scales or the capital overheads for avant garde robotics driven by machine learning. Your average curtain cleaning company probably employs 3-5 people earning a bit over minimum wage, it&#039;s just not financially feasible to get a loan to start implementing the robotics to do the job. <br><br>In large companies AI will absolutely start shredding numbers. Say you have an airport with multiple systems, and you have thirty different system administrators and assorted technicians running the Information Technology for it. Well, AI will be able to cut that number down by a good portion by being able to point out problems and independently search for solutions. you could reduce your staff down from 30 to 20 instantly as a lot of problems that have you going back through internal wikis and looking online have a set of AIs just hunting for the solution. That&#039;s a cost saving of around a million a year in wages right there.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674261391277545", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2176, "h": 3200, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675363740444426, "time": 1675363740, "md5": "YrMEeTOm/GlA4k4iCLs2nw==", "fsize": 1488978, "resto": 0, "id": "2frkKXYE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 106, "images": 54, "unique_ips": 35}, {"no": 53546656, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53479388#p53479388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479388</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675363983473723, "time": 1675363983, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53546578, "id": "29Gt0B4s"}, {"no": 53546680, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:54:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it?

And then these team members go around me to my manager and complain because I didn&#039;t set up a (wasteful multi-person) call with the other team, even though they have full schedules. I get the decisions that day after assembling a lot of information but my manager complained later on.<br><br>If you&#039;re not part of the normie club, they assume failure until proven otherwise.

The token is the data payload. It is basically the transfer and call mechanism. You need the token to write data onto different blockchains from different offchain and cross chain environments. They want usage so they abstract this operation using ocr to save on costs. the rent seekers on the various layer ones chainlink nodes service are responsible for taking up the majority of the costs. Chainlink do not want to pass these costs on to the end users yet so they try and collectivize the data write part of the operation so that everyone wins except for the token holders or so it seems. The majority of capital in crypto is not connected to usage or more broadly fundamentals. So fundamentally it is still a speculative environment and there is something about what chainlink does that upsets almost everyone in crypto. I can offer speculation as to why they are upset but maybe you already know? Maybe someone else will contribute to this thread.

Both do the exact same thing, they suppress your central nervous system and both will eventually kill you. I had to learn how to control my anxiety naturally after my doctor pulled me off the meds. I had no withdrawals. I was taking almost 4mg of clonazepam a day for almost 10 years. She said I had been taking them so long that they weren&#039;t even doing anything anymore and were basically a placebo. So anyway, there are 2 foolproof ways to control anxiety naturally, and they both consist of wearing yourself out naturally. Your two choices are to either masturbate to climax or go to the gym. My body naturally adapted over time to masturbate when I get anxiety. I love to smoke weed but weed generally comes with nervousness, and someone with anxiety, that generally doesn&#039;t mix well. So my body adapted. It knew that when I feel anxiety masturbating is the best option to calm it. So whenever I smoke my dick gets diamonds.
