Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Problem-FBI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2036, "h": 1356, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673178448792995, "time": 1673178448, "md5": "I29tv2wUVd0kQimXu3vzNg==", "fsize": 1150964, "resto": 0, "id": "igNLpwnN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 205, "images": 68, "unique_ips": 90}, {"no": 53181106, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:48:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "pedophile spambot threads", "time": 1673178517, "resto": 53181100, "id": "OPbX2eGO"}, {"no": 53181110, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:49:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53133327#p53133327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133327</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673178543092988, "time": 1673178543, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53181100, "id": "igNLpwnN"}, {"no": 53181118, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:50:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673178805501679, "time": 1673178805, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53181100, "id": "igNLpwnN"}, {"no": 53181148, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:54:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Or maybe they live somewhere in the middle of bumfuck-nowhere, where you can get paid for some methhead cum?

I\u2019m not talking about the number of nodes or node providers, I\u2019m referring to the central point of control that is the NNS and the role it plays. Democracy is not decentralization. The NNS has control over literally every aspect of the network, and without it, the network cannot function. This is in contrast to governance in other crypto projects, where users vote to make changes to very specifically designed aspects of a project that simply cannot be automated otherwise.<br><br>The NNS has control over the entire topology of the network, meaning subnets are not created or load balanced at the protocol level, spawning new ones when all others are at max capacity, it is simply DFINITY picking from a pool of nodes to spawn a new subnet. Again there is plans for DFINITY to secede and let the enthusiasts(?) manage these things but again Democracy is not decentralization.<br><br>This leads into why I stated that asynchronous smart contracts are not well implemented. This thread goes into more detail as to why the subnet model hinders this core aspect of the ICs design. TL:DR? Subnets only make sense for synchronous state machines, putting asynchronously communicating cannisters together in a centrally controlled &amp; designed subnet means that developers are limited in the kinds of network topology that will be running their app. This is in contrast to Avalanche\u2019s subnet model where the Dapp developer has control over the subnet\u2019s creation, it\u2019s rules for gas, and whether node joining is permissioned or permissionless.", "time": 1673427696, "resto": 53219238, "id": "lWOnBjqF"}, {"no": 53219245, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)04:02:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53219240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53219240</a><br>The second point is that the network is not scalable. You might think this is untrue based on DFINITYs marketing, however think about what scalability is; it\u2019s the ability to increase and decrease in throughput. With node rewards on the IC, nodes are minted a fixed amount of dollars worth of ICP regardless of the amount of transactions they process, this means the network requires constant growth as node rewards increasingly debase ICP the bigger the network becomes. The network cannot scale downwards from a point of massive expansion without breaking into a death spiral as noted by some people on this forum. This also means to prevent a death spiral in the event of the network expanding then contracting the NNS would have to delete various subnets and remove nodes from the network and the cannisters they host to prevent a death spiral. This is a fragile system.<br><br>This is in contrast to every other blockchain network which can expand and contract dynamically depending on demand, which is in my opinion one of the most impressive aspects of blockchain networks, that they are anti-fragile (at least the good ones are).<br><br>My final point is that DFINITY views the IC as a commercial product and not a sovereign network like the Ethereum Foundation views Ethereum.

I&#039;m your host, Jim Cramer, and today we&#039;re going to be discussing one of the most talked-about companies in the market right now, Gamestop. Now, I know that many of you out there are holding onto this stock, hoping for a turnaround, but let me tell you, the numbers don&#039;t lie. Gamestop&#039;s financial position is dire, and it&#039;s only a matter of time before the company goes under.<br><br>First of all, let&#039;s talk about revenue. Gamestop has been struggling to keep up with the shift to digital gaming and online sales. This company&#039;s brick and mortar approach is no longer relevant and is not adapting fast enough. In addition, they have a heavy debt load, and they&#039;re not generating enough cash flow to cover it. And let&#039;s not forget about the intense competition they&#039;re facing. The video game industry is constantly evolving and changing, and Gamestop simply can&#039;t keep up. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Sony are eating their lunch, and it&#039;s only a matter of time before Gamestop is left behind.<br><br>Now, I know that some of you may be thinking, &quot;But Jim, what about the recent stock price spike? Surely that&#039;s a sign of a turnaround?&quot; Well, let me tell you, that spike was fueled by speculation, not by fundamentals. It&#039;s nothing more than a bubble waiting to burst. In short, Gamestop is a company that is past its prime and is not adapting to change. The numbers don&#039;t lie, and it&#039;s clear that this company is headed for a fall. My advice to you: If you&#039;re holding onto Gamestop stock, it&#039;s time to sell, and sell now. Because if you don&#039;t, you&#039;re going to be the one left holding the bag when the bottom falls out!", "filename": "Jimmy-Chill", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673413347704912, "time": 1673413347, "md5": "namy4hwWkHYgAoM3jNXiqQ==", "fsize": 41211, "resto": 53214800, "id": "60QVUerY"}, {"no": 53217742, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:04:18", "name": "Eemji", "com": "Still comfy holding<br>wagmi frens<br><br><a href=\"#p53214800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53214800</a><br>checked", "filename": "EemjiComfyHolding", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 461, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1673413458408927, "time": 1673413458, "md5": "nl5tw0cfCN7Y/UgwHM9UpA==", "fsize": 806829, "resto": 53214800, "id": "Ssih46bR"}, {"no": 53217746, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:04:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217724</a><br>Look, one of the shills learned you can turn up the character limit on ChatGPT! <br><br>Congrats shilly, you are half an IQ point higher then the average short", "time": 1673413488, "resto": 53214800, "id": "S2FcCJOw"}, {"no": 53217776, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:09:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217724</a><br>Bubbles", "filename": "Screenshot_20220618-175622_VLC", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2208, "h": 1768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1673413746343929, "time": 1673413746, "md5": "Av1zItsJep8MPOTxb3YzFQ==", "fsize": 1038046, "resto": 53214800, "id": "TjL2qzA1"}, {"no": 53217787, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:10:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the new GME tranny discord script is &#039;they&#039;re hiding the shorts overseas&#039;</span><br>lmfao", "time": 1673413842, "resto": 53214800, "id": "90afOe0X"}, {"no": 53217793, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:11:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Might buy some BBBY because I think it would be funny to own shares in a delisted company", "time": 1673413879, "resto": 53214800, "id": "CiUbyg/U"}, {"no": 53217815, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:14:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217793</a><br>Do you not have MMTLP?", "time": 1673414057, "resto": 53214800, "id": "iyGzZpSy"}, {"no": 53217820, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:14:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217793</a><br>It&#039;s not, it&#039;s mostly just sad.", "time": 1673414070, "resto": 53214800, "id": "IB037OT1"}, {"no": 53217844, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:18:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217815</a><br>KeK some quality cope and seething on the stock there.

As anons filter into the Discord once we release the link this issue will go away over time.<br>- Anons haven&#039;t reached a consensus on which way to vote on the proposals 11242 and 11243, but it&#039;s a moot point at this time since the proposals are going to pass anyways.<br><br><a href=\"#p53205297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53205297</a><br>That is completely fair to do.

The only thing that every node must participate in is the primary network consisting of X (DAG for payments), C (EVM chain), and P (records validation/staking periods and a registry of all subnets).

You could further encode it by swapping each pair afterwards so word 1 becomes word 2, 3 becomes 4 and so on. <br>There&#039;s loads of ways of doing it.

Nickel and cobalt are among key materials for lithium-ion batteries found in electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

It has less direct economic mobility and requires a safe place unlike currency and is slow in growth unlike other investments, but I truly think everyone should have some gold. God knows if this house of cards clown world economy ever does collapse, things quickly default back to a economic reality and what a person can touch and feel. So it&#039;s a good bit of diversification to have.

It was a deep, reddish-pink color, and was covered with a thin layer of skin that was dotted with tiny bumps and ridges. As it entered the vagina, the Internet Computer was surrounded by the warm, moist folds of the labia, which parted and stretched to accommodate its size and shape. As ICP moved deeper into the vagina, the tissues of the vagina stretched and expanded, forming a tight, snug fit around the shaft of the Internet Computer. The movement was slow and deliberate, with a gentle rocking and thrusting motion that was both rhythmic and sensual. The Internet Computer and the vagina moved together in perfect harmony, forming a seamless, synchronized connection that was both physical and emotional. The sensations were intense and pleasurable, with a rush of warmth and pleasure that radiated from the genitals and spread throughout the body. As ICP and vagina continued to move together, the sensations became more intense and more pleasurable.

It was a deep, reddish-pink color, and was covered with a thin layer of skin that was dotted with tiny bumps and ridges. As it entered the vagina, the Internet Computer was surrounded by the warm, moist folds of the labia, which parted and stretched to accommodate its size and shape. As ICP moved deeper into the vagina, the tissues of the vagina stretched and expanded, forming a tight, snug fit around the shaft of the Internet Computer. The movement was slow and deliberate, with a gentle rocking and thrusting motion that was both rhythmic and sensual. The Internet Computer and the vagina moved together in perfect harmony, forming a seamless, synchronized connection that was both physical and emotional. The sensations were intense and pleasurable, with a rush of warmth and pleasure that radiated from the genitals and spread throughout the body. As ICP and vagina continued to move together, the sensations became more intense and more pleasurable.

IMO it&#039;s not out there. What I experienced was if I worked a &quot;lower wage&quot; job that was fulfilling.... people including management and ownership treated you like shit anyway and tried to pay you as little as possible thinking you&#039;re in low wage job because you were forced to be instead of finding it fulfilling. I busted a lot of people&#039;s asses in the hierarchy above me because they forgot that I didn&#039;t need their money, could quit anytime, had 10x the education they did, and also usually had more experience than they did. Telling regional bosses and ownership to their faces to never speak to me like that again was satisfying and worked but it was no way to build a career. I experienced first hand how idiots let &quot;management&quot; go to their heads.<br><br>On the flip side, I tried the banking route. I worked my way one of the C-suite&#039;s right hand men at two different jobs... and got to experience the shittiness of that. I had a female C-suite executive as a boss once; she was the best boss I ever had, a real badass bitch. Her superiors - the owners of the company - treated her like shit. Just petty good ol&#039; boy bullshit. It was hard to watch knowing she was one of the most competent and hard-working people in that company. I did the whole job hop for higher pay thing, got $20K raises, all that - it was never worth it for me. I&#039;ve now worked directly - as in special projects, ask me for internal consulting stuff for like three CEOs... made me realize I don&#039;t want to ever be the CEO of a company I don&#039;t own and control.

No one is going to want to take out a loan that increases in value over time.", "time": 1673416562, "resto": 53217475, "id": "aoLvU7sL"}, {"no": 53218888, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)02:56:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53218071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53218071</a><br>Lets not forget that alternatives exist<br>Litecoin, Dogecoin, everything else", "time": 1673423803, "resto": 53217475, "id": "qRG8LksK"}, {"no": 53218908, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)02:59:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217593</a><br>limited supply doesn&#039;t make it &quot;deflationary&quot;, this is a buzzword and lowq&#039;s intuitively understand that it is a buzzword even if they don&#039;t know why", "time": 1673423993, "resto": 53217475, "id": "fYgmfiGF"}, {"no": 53218916, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)03:01:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217475</a><br>normies don&#039;t care about decentralization and self custody<br>it&#039;s a really niche market", "time": 1673424071, "resto": 53217475, "id": "AB/IBt/m"}, {"no": 53219146, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)03:41:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53217475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53217475</a><br>Here&#039;s youre answer its sergeys video.
