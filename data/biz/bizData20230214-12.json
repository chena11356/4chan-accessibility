They couldn&#039;t have been further from the truth. Link had obvious use cases and was used right from the beginning. Granted, by some less known project, but it was USED! Your Kleros-Skleros shit was/is not. You literally haven&#039;t had a single case in the last 30 days and your last case was in Proof of Humanity, which is a laughing stock of crypto atm. Your shitty &quot;Proof or Humanity&quot; garbage got abused by a bunch of third worlders who have been able to register multiple accounts and multiple rewards. Speaking of your other platforms, which are blatant shitty ripoffs of Fiver. Not a single one of them is used. Yep, you heard, don&#039;t believe me? Go check them on Kleros dashboard. Translation from Chinese to English 0 cases in the last 60 days. Technical court? 0. French-Eng? 0. Should I continue? Ok, let&#039;s look at the team. Maybe, they have some visionaries? No, they have some obese alcoholic who spends all his time playing video games and drinking and some French faggot who can&#039;t form a coherent sentence. What a brilliant duo! These deluded tranny-r*editors will try to convince you that somehow Kleros was endorsed by Vitalik Buterin. While Vitalik Buterin did in the past register for POH court, it literally means nothing.

Let me tell you a story about a metal by the name of Osmium.<br><br>Osmium is the single rarest metal on Earth. It makes up about 50 parts per trillion in Earth&#039;s crust. Or, 0.00005 parts per million. For comparison, Silver makes up 0.1 parts per million, and gold, 0.001. Osmium is a useful material - it is the single densest naturally occurring element. It has a myriad of unique properties that should make it incredibly valuable. Is is absolutely essential to certain electrical contacts. Yet, despite it&#039;s myriad of use cases and extreme rarity, Osmium has lost 30% of it&#039;s value since 1980. What should&#039;ve been an obvious investment, due to it&#039;s scarcity and usefulness, has instead, fallen severely. Do you know why this is? Because every possible use case for osmium can be filled by something cheaper. For each use of this element proposed, a far cheaper, more abundant one could be used instead. This is something that investors had failed to consider - and so, they lost their money. <br><br><br>The same is true for silver - and this is why 10 years ago it crashed in price and has not recovered since. I want you to look at the image you posted, in your first reply, as proof. Tell me, of all the use cases listed, how many of them could actually only be filled by silver? The answer is very few. Why would you use a rare, precious metal for something a cheaper substitute can do? Gold, just like silver, and most other precious metals, are not valuable because of what they can be used for - because there&#039;s not much most precious metals can do that other elements can not. The sole and single exception to this is Rhodium, having a use in catalytic converters no other material can fill. And that&#039;s it. What makes precious metals so valuable is their scarcity and historical value - not their use cases. Silver has neither of these, and it&#039;s uses can be filled by other, more abundant elements. Thus, it&#039;s price will not rise.", "filename": "Osmium", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4824, "h": 3099, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1676329127995082, "time": 1676329127, "md5": "rf3tNUsj7vDhCZXiRsVdmA==", "fsize": 3612544, "resto": 53696019, "id": "EV1HAvae"}, {"no": 53697696, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:04:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Silver is good money", "filename": "EDC65830-4099-40DA-8DFB-26FB1E5BFE76", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1164, "h": 1644, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676329444603131, "time": 1676329444, "md5": "2bK7WyOFH8woGYZ1OnKQvA==", "fsize": 307572, "resto": 53696019, "id": "kgwxvtZl"}, {"no": 53697706, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:05:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53696019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53696019</a>", "filename": "4DEE7309-7861-4EB9-AE45-0C9DD0456824", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676329513691975, "time": 1676329513, "md5": "ie79WKS2F/4d0jBMPr9QOg==", "fsize": 374659, "resto": 53696019, "id": "kgwxvtZl"}, {"no": 53697726, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:07:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53697696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53697696</a><br>Those numbers are completely bogus kek", "time": 1676329667, "resto": 53696019, "id": "P53DrCF7"}, {"no": 53697847, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:22:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53697640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53697640</a><br>Genuine question.

The entire process takes a long time and it costs a lot of money and the companies don&#039;t generate any income while they are doing it, so there&#039;s always a high chance that they will have to issue new stocks to raise money and then dump on the holders. Then there&#039;s also the fact that if you aren&#039;t a big pharma company like Pfizer then the regulatory agencies aren&#039;t going to be as friendly, and if you are trying to patent a drug that big pharma might want later down the road then they might deny you.

I threw together a few of the key points in picrel. Their last earnings report was really good and they are on a nice trajectory with their revenue. I suspect it would plateau a bit from here since they were starting from practically nothing, but it&#039;s still nice to see. They also have a nice cash balance at $26m so they most likely wouldn&#039;t be looking to do an offering anytime soon and dilute the shares.<br><br>The thing I don&#039;t like that popped up recently was insider selling. It was only $4k and the guys total share count is now at 0 so maybe he just left the company? Not sure, but even though it was a small amount I never really like to see insider selling especially when the price on the stock is so low.<br><br>Another thing that I noticed that is weird with them is that some of their trials seem a bit meme-ish like the last one they announced. They are doing a trial with mushroom tea which is a little strange imo and to me it kind of smells like they are just trying to pump out a higher volume of trials so that they can put out more news releases maybe?<br><br>Overall like I said I think it is the 2nd best stock in the sector but I think TRUFF is just miles ahead with everything, most important of which is the hype factor with Wiz Khalifa and stuff.

He believed his group had inside knowledge on chainlink to spur massive investment in them. His talking points towards these OG linkers were as follows;<br><br>1) He propositioned that smart contracts were the future of derivatives.

This problem he posited is that smart contracts cannot exist on an institutional level without verification of the data going into the contracts. Otherwise, bad actors such as data providers like Bloomberg, ICE, ect, could take advantage of the smart contracts by placing huge bets and then providing bad data to make the contract execute in their favor. Ostensibly, the chainlink oracles would solve this dilemma by providing a voting method on the data that exposes those bad actors to financial loss, and provides financial incentives to provide good data.<br><br>Cont.", "filename": "12D43DB6-0C78-4FF6-AC6C-706DAAEE53BB", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676226721880506, "time": 1676226721, "md5": "+29ingXB+w6pCDa5BAm1Cw==", "fsize": 203162, "resto": 0, "id": "nRK9K95/", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-chainlink-con", "replies": 134, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 53}, {"no": 53682463, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)13:33:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "3) he proposed that due to this, chainlink would become a standard integrated protocol on the Swift network, that chainlink would be allowed access to the global financial messaging network to standardize communication between oracle, contract, and institution to, once again, increase the speed and execution of derivatives contracts massively.

Over the past 20 years, the largest parts of the derivatives market that have broken have not been with the consumers, but rather with the producers. First we can look at the LIBOR scandal, this was a scandal where-in banks had been rigging the overnight rate, the fixed leg rate for that 400 trillion in derivatives, by submitting intentionally manipulated bids to the overnight lending markets. All pricing sources for LIBOR gave the same false rate, just as all all oracle\u2019s would have. Second we can look at the 2008 crash, in which securities which should have been rated much lower than their actual credit rating were given triple A ratings due to collusion between the rating agencies and the banks forming the CDO\u2019s and mortgage bonds. Linkers CAN attempt to subvert this by saying oracles could have looked at the underlying credit ratings to compile the bonds themselves and ran the algorithm, however that brings us to our third point now:", "time": 1676226784, "resto": 53682453, "id": "nRK9K95/"}, {"no": 53682468, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)13:33:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the subversion of the algorithm providers.

For example, exchanging CBDC&#039;s for cryptos or other CBDC&#039;s will be much easier on the developer end if using Chainlink, which Swift confirmed themselves, and if web3 really does take off (which Eric Schmidt said it will eventually), Chainlink will be used alot for that. If there is any sort of crypto adoption into the real world whatsoever, Chainlink will most likely be involved to some degree.<br><br>I guess it boils down to: Will blockchain actually solve any problem in the real world whatsoever?

Its no different than time traveling to 2015, and arguing that bitcoin is simply part of greater fool theory and failed as a currency. You might be right to some degree, but is it enough that you can&#039;t profit immensely off of it still?

Admittedly this is a problem with the current setup for the chainlink network, though one that&#039;s difficult to solve, as the only parties currently using it are DeFi, which for the most part do not care or require the sort of security staking offers, and are comfortable with a centralized service. <br><br>The big chicken and egg question is, will tradfi services (potentially swift and others) eventually demand access to blockchain and be the first party that require true staking? Or will true staking be implemented somehow with DeFi first, and be used to prove the network&#039;s potential and attract tradfi? <br>If that question were already answered, there&#039;d be no debate on chainlink, either the value would have already skyrocketed and you would have missed it, or it would have crashed back towards ICO levels as the market moved on.

Look at what those apes at Chainanalysis are capable of - they\u2019ll cover DONs eventually. <br><br>The elites can slowly but surely put up the right parameters to ensure that the majority of the data providers on the network are not manipulating data. <br><br>Time for nap nap.", "time": 1676353895, "resto": 53682453, "id": "s2QoA/TL"}, {"no": 53701110, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)00:54:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53682453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53682453</a><br><a href=\"#p53682463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53682463</a><br><a href=\"#p53682468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53682468</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lol what if someone lies to the oracle?</span><br><br>I promise you the devs have already thought of this.", "time": 1676354067, "resto": 53682453, "id": "RwZ+fYrK"}, {"no": 53701185, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:05:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53682453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53682453</a><br>This poster is German (Germany: home of such fine crypto products as Unibright and Lition), and therefore wrong.", "time": 1676354753, "resto": 53682453, "id": "IYKSYFM5"}, {"no": 53701391, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:31:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53700951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53700951</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;someone named moonman says icp is good</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they bought</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;someone named assblaster says link is good</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they bought</span><br>Anon, I...", "time": 1676356310, "resto": 53682453, "id": "2DHR+TfN"}, {"no": 53702629, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)05:20:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53700983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53700983</a><br>filters are useless when half the threads purposefully evade them", "time": 1676370006, "resto": 53682453, "id": "C3AV5u0x"}, {"no": 53702797, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)05:53:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "so linkies prefer bumping their schizo suppression thread full of NIGGER combo spams instead of engaging in actual discussions about the project<br>really makes you think", "time": 1676372030, "resto": 53682453, "id": "C3AV5u0x"}, {"no": 53703083, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)06:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53699256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53699256</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this entire thread is a massive troll?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;astro tier posting</span><br>predictably, link shills resort to blame the imaginary adversary tripfags instead of attempting to refute the arguments, &quot;cause all of these things were discussed in 2018&quot;<br>newsflash people, it&#039;s been 5 years since then, it&#039;s about time to reevaluate and have an honest discussion<br>if you feel these issues have been debunked, please go ahead and offer your rebuttal instead of more arrogant and condescending useless shitposting", "time": 1676374981, "resto": 53682453, "id": "C3AV5u0x"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53703081, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)06:42:43", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "ded", "com": "this board is dead <br><br>a couple months ago there was 200 reply threads about fucking watches<br><br>how do i profit from this?", "filename": "1673064373464541s", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 250, "h": 222, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 222, "tim": 1676374963247408, "time": 1676374963, "md5": "yXVqT5leW59KbSkYnVEDdw==", "fsize": 7543, "resto": 0, "id": "MN8L+gYl", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ded", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53703066, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)06:40:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Should I shill out $20/monthly use for a visually pleasing CV maker site?

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1675439180797735", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2792, "h": 4037, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676206543268876, "time": 1676206543, "md5": "pLF/i7hFbJcVjDfuMq/aLw==", "fsize": 2232893, "resto": 0, "id": "gaig2M8k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 133, "images": 42, "unique_ips": 54}, {"no": 53679958, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53589386#p53589386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53589386</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1676206623747923, "time": 1676206623, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53679954, "id": "gaig2M8k"}, {"no": 53679963, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it? Do I have to store GBs worth of data like when running an XMR node?</span><br><br>It is literally as easy as installing an Android app and no, there are no storage requirements, the node only consumes some bandwidth.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cool, I&#039;m sold.

It&#039;s easier to date young dumb chicks that can&#039;t hurt you unless you let them. Although I&#039;m talking about trying to date or marry a head of state or someone actually important in a business role, not saying dating or marrying a woman with a degree or some money that isn&#039;t a retard is a bad idea. It generally isn&#039;t, so long as you can outcompete them. When you can&#039;t then it all falls apart and you end up screwed and alone. Some folks take this constant and pervert it completely and go for way underage chicks or just want a slave instead of a wife, which is about as dumb as being with someone that is more powerful or wealthy than you and based from the same insecurity. Either go for someone that&#039;s a notch below being your equal or go for someone that wants to actually be a mom and a woman and let you lead and you&#039;ll find happiness and so will they. Fundamentally the question is like asking why does a military pick smarter people to lead than the standard for the people they command - because they&#039;re not retarded. You can be superior or be roughly equal and things can work, if you&#039;re inferior as a man it will never work and you and your partner will be wildly unhappy.
