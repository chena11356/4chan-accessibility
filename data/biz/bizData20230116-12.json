That will tell us when returns on stocks have begun changing from negative to positive. With positive returns, that means that stock values will be growing rather than shrinking.

People despise weakness, so you can look like a troll and still smash if you are honest, open, and vulnerable (not weak people hate weaknes). And of course you need accept that not every girl will like you and that is fine.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "X4XMR", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673735030577156, "time": 1673735030, "md5": "uLmCVaurQRCCw/dXXCelDA==", "fsize": 993271, "resto": 0, "id": "wgWony5C", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 122, "images": 41, "unique_ips": 57}, {"no": 53277898, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:25:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53231130#p53231130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53231130</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673735115698271, "time": 1673735115, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53277917, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:26:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673735370054747, "time": 1673735370, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53277991, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:31:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

If we\u2019re 3 halvings into 32 total halvings, then the estimated break even point for miners at current hashrate going into the last halving would be:<br><br>$22,000 * (2^27) = $2,952,790,016,000 per BTC<br><br>$2,952,790,016,000 per BTC * 21 Million total Bitcoin = $62,008,590,336,000,000,000 BTC Market Cap<br><br>The block rewards shrink so fast that after enough halvings Bitcoin would eventually require a $2.95 trillion price per Bitcoin and a $62 quintillion market cap to sustain the current cost of $7.15 billion/year.<br><br>Even if these numbers were somehow realistic, can you imagine securing a $62 quintillion market cap on only $7.15 billion/year of hashrate? LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673735479708887, "time": 1673735479, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53277880, "id": "wgWony5C"}, {"no": 53278370, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:02:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Geopolitics specialists got rekt. <br>Lucky for me that I sold everything days before bitcoin started its moon mission. <br>Feels so good to be a normie.", "filename": "geopoliticsrekt01", "ext": ".png", "w": 1403, "h": 464, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 41, "tim": 1673737368346005, "time": 1673737368, "md5": "mpoV/2zTpVBJgC/uNk18Kg==", "fsize": 31441, "resto": 53277880, "id": "tkzU9GAy"}, {"no": 53278567, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:16:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "alphabay down?<br>i cant connect", "time": 1673738193, "resto": 53277880, "id": "WE7MISfq"}, {"no": 53278771, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:30:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278370</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gay id</span><br>also lol Monero has climbed on the ratio since the beginning of the bear market.", "time": 1673739017, "resto": 53277880, "id": "/5JeRkzm"}, {"no": 53279043, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:48:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "tfw you cut out the part of the chart where we 2x against bitshit", "time": 1673740124, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279195, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:58:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;STATUS CHECK</span><br>Still an infinite supply shitcoin kek", "time": 1673740714, "resto": 53277880, "id": "v7AXt3Oc"}, {"no": 53279309, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:06:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m not exactly a regular here but I&#039;m surprised there&#039;s not more Nagatoro posting considering that the S2 is airing this season.", "time": 1673741168, "resto": 53277880, "id": "2nXv+nBC"}, {"no": 53279424, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:13:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279195</a><br>so is gold", "time": 1673741628, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279454, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:15:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53277880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53277880</a><br>BUT DOES IT HAVE SMART CONTRACTS?", "time": 1673741752, "resto": 53277880, "id": "qHfxHMxJ"}, {"no": 53279478, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279454</a><br>yes smart people are using it to exchange goods and services", "time": 1673741850, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279488, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:17:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lads when are we going to defeat evil", "time": 1673741873, "resto": 53277880, "id": "zdM1fM/K"}, {"no": 53279510, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:19:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53279488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53279488</a><br>the outcome was predetermined", "time": 1673741958, "resto": 53277880, "id": "mjfDUnk/"}, {"no": 53279519, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:19:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278370</a><br>so what gave you the premonition that this would happen?", "time": 1673741984, "resto": 53277880, "id": "Z3BLwzWs"}, {"no": 53280085, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)20:10:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53278567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53278567</a><br>is i2p the future of the dnm?", "time": 1673745011, "resto": 53277880, "id": "zdM1fM/K"}, {"no": 53281025, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53280085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53280085</a><br>The guys at Dread certainly think so <br>https://old.reddit.com/r/DreadAlert<wbr>/comments/101tqq3/january_3rd_happy<wbr>_new_year_were_still_here/", "time": 1673749857, "resto": 53277880, "id": "tyk38Gk2"}, {"no": 53281112, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:40:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Reminder: Tails emissions means we are all going to make it, together.<br>The maxitards, the Zcringe troons, the taxman, russians, ukranians, jews, and niggers.

Tension between mine owners and union agitators led to a lockout in 1889. Many Italian immigrants arrived to cross the picket lines but eventually staged their own strike in 1894, encouraging the industry to bring in African Americans to break the strike. Relations between the races rapidly deteriorated, leading to the riot that ended the use of black strike breakers. Governor John Peter Altgeld&#039;s response to the August 4 attack on the black community by displaced Italian miners ultimately revealed his support of fellow immigrants over African Americans.[11] Another riot erupted in 1895 when recent Polish, Lithuanian, Italian, and Belgian immigrants raided the black section of town and burned, looted, and injured 14 blacks. Black victims of the riot took their attackers to court and used their status as citizens to win the case against the new immigrants.[12]", "time": 1673821746, "resto": 53281458, "id": "6wQhU6ZK"}, {"no": 53291839, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:52:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53283722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53283722</a><br>my advice for australians is buy a boat, take up sailing and settle an abandoned island", "time": 1673826725, "resto": 53281458, "id": "6wQhU6ZK"}, {"no": 53292169, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)19:28:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53291839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53291839</a><br>or just seamax or asiamax in general", "time": 1673828930, "resto": 53281458, "id": "6wQhU6ZK"}, {"no": 53292645, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)20:12:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53283470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53283470</a><br>that 50k is gonna be all cash I bet. probably a shit ton of stuff wrong inside so the banks won&#039;t give you a mortgage. then you gotta drop 150k to get it going. yeah great deal", "time": 1673831572, "resto": 53281458, "id": "xMlCAZNV"}, {"no": 53292742, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)20:20:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53283440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53283440</a><br><a href=\"#p53283425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53283425</a><br>Certain industries (munitions, waste disposal, animal processing) are usually rural for nuisance reasons, yes. But generally, the more value added things like medium-heavy manufacturing, medical tech, aerospace, and the office and R&amp;D teams that support those plants, will be on the outskirts of cities. This is because this offers easy access to rail/water transport for some industries (like metal finishing), proximity to vendors, proximity to a larger more skilled labor pool, etc... Businesses don&#039;t site in urban areas just for fun, the taxes are way higher. They site there because the value of doing so is worth the burden.<br><br>I&#039;m from SE Kentucky.

All subnets benefit from the virtues of snow family consensus protocols which are sub second finality (no waiting for confirmations or slots), decoupling tx throughput/TTF from the number of validators (unlimited decentralization), every node in a subnet taking part in consensus of every block (no complex/vulnerable/centralized beacons, committees, etc.), the protocols are extremely light weight (nodes run on a consumer laptop), and they are supremely efficient which removes consensus as a bottleneck for throughput (every other chain is kneecapped by the properties of either nakamoto or classical consensus).<br>Avalanche can run literally any other chain&#039;s VM and it will do it faster in a more decentralizable manner.

Big whale traders who have a decisive effect on the price, they don&#039;t just look at the Stoch RSI and sell because the Stoch RSI is high, they sell because of trading-related reasons; they think/see that whalebros and the masses aren&#039;t buying any more, that buying pressure has diminished to a certain point, causing the price to not rise much anymore, there being too many sellers so too much money would be required to keep pumping the price, or the whales had already achieved nice profits via leverage and wanted to secure those profits so they sold. That&#039;s what&#039;s reflected in the indicators like the Stoch RSI. So within a certain timespan if whales sell off after putting a certain amount of money in, and then sell off again later after a similar amount of money was put in, and this repeats yet again, then on the Stoch RSI you&#039;ll see it going down around the same point area. From the whale traders perspective he&#039;s selling at what for him seems like a top, due to various reasons, and then on the Stoch RSI it also looks like a top, visually, so it&#039;s all the same thing really.
