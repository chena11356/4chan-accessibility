Here is how the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission describes it:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On the morning of November 9 at approximately 10 AM ET, after the announcement of the then-contemplated Binance acquisition, Ellison held an \u201call-hands\u201d meeting with Alameda staff. In that meeting, Ellison acknowledged that earlier that year, she, Bankman-Fried and other individuals had decided to use FTX customer assets to pay Alameda\u2019s debts, and that Wang and another FTX executive were aware of this. Specifically, in that meeting, Ellison stated that, \u201cstarting last year\u201d Alameda was \u201cborrowing a bunch of money by open term loans\u201d and used those assets to \u201cmake very illiquid investments.\u201d Ellison further explained that following the widespread decline of digital asset prices most of Alameda\u2019s loans had been recalled and, in order to meet those recalls, Alameda borrowed \u201ca bunch of funds\u201d from FTX, which in turn \u201cled to FTX having a shortfall in user funds.\u201d Ellison informed Alameda staff that FTX had \u201calways allowed\u201d Alameda to borrow customer assets, and did not require collateral for those loans. She also explained that Alameda could access user assets without requiring FTX\u2019s approval as the \u201cstructure\u201d allowed Alameda to \u201cgo negative in coins.\u201d In response to an employee question, Ellison also acknowledged that her November 6 tweet to the Binance CEO offering to buy his FTT holdings at $22 per token was \u201ckind of a misleading thing to tweet\u201d and expressed remorse. Shortly after this meeting, most of Alameda\u2019s staff resigned.</span>", "time": 1672039962, "resto": 53014305, "id": "rX6h0NLM"}, {"no": 53017639, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:33:43", "name": "Money Stuff December 22", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017635</a><br>\u201cGo negative in coins\u201d is an incredible euphemism, really. The idea is that Alameda could deposit, say, 1,000 Bitcoin at FTX, and then it would have a balance of 1,000 Bitcoin. And then it could withdraw, say, 3,000 Bitcoin from FTX, and then it would have a balance of -2,000 Bitcoin. If you have a negative balance at your bank, bad things happen. When Alameda had a negative balance at FTX, that was just fine. Until it wasn\u2019t.<br><br>Ellison and Gary Wang, the former chief technology officer of FTX, have agreed to plead guilty to federal fraud charges for their role in the FTX implosion. (The plea agreements say that Ellison and Wang face maximum sentences of 110 and 50 years in prison, respectively, though presumably they will end up with substantial discounts for cooperating.) Last night, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda, landed in New York to face similar charges. There is something of a prisoner\u2019s-dilemma situation here, in that there was in theory the possibility that everyone at FTX and Alameda could have stuck together and said \u201cwhat, we never did anything wrong,\u201d and that they might have persuaded a jury of that.

And, as I have argued, even if this story was true, it is not much of a defense to fraud charges, because FTX was going around telling everyone that it had good automated risk systems that would prevent it from doing exactly this sort of dumb thing, and lying about that is itself fraud.

Those loans were backed in significant part by Alameda\u2019s holdings of FTT\u2014an illiquid crypto asset security that was issued by FTX and provided to Alameda at no cost. Ellison, acting at the direction of Bankman-Fried, engaged in automated purchases of FTT tokens on various platforms in order to increase the price of those tokens and inflate the value of Alameda\u2019s collateral, which allowed Alameda to borrow even more money from external lenders at increased risk to the lenders and to FTX\u2019s investors and customers, all in furtherance of the scheme.</span>", "time": 1672040405, "resto": 53014305, "id": "rX6h0NLM"}, {"no": 53017680, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:41:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017633</a><br>Trends move the market pleb.

On more than one occasion, Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction, actively engaged in the trading of FTT with the goal of supporting the price of the token. On these occasions, Alameda adjusted the trading parameters of its trading bots in order to support the price of FTT.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For example, in 2019, there was downward pressure on the price of FTT as the token was being unlocked for early-stage investors. Bankman-Fried became concerned about, among other things, the psychological effect of the price of FTT dropping below a specific threshold, and instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT to support the price and avoid that outcome. In another instance in 2021, the price of FTT was again facing downward pressure from external events, this time related to substantial sales of FTT by a third party. Bankman-Fried again instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT on trading platforms to support the price.</span>", "time": 1672040671, "resto": 53014305, "id": "rX6h0NLM"}, {"no": 53017708, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:47:30", "name": "Money Stuff December 22", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017693</a><br>Here again you might be able to get around the objective facts, which are basically that Alameda, a crypto market maker, was buying FTT tokens when other people were selling.

What was the good outcome here? Why do all this? Many financial crimes have essentially the shape of Ponzi schemes, which by their nature snowball: You take some money from new customers to pay fake returns to old customers, which requires you to take even more money from newer customers to keep paying the fake returns, etc., until the hole gets too big and you go to prison. If you start by stealing $1,000, pretty soon you need to steal $10,000, and then $100,000, and then you find yourself running a billion-dollar Ponzi. And there\u2019s rarely a way to come back from that. It is hard to make back a billion dollars at the roulette tables.", "time": 1672040850, "resto": 53014305, "id": "rX6h0NLM"}, {"no": 53017714, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:48:32", "name": "Money Stuff December 22", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017708</a><br>You can keep this going for a while, if you are good and lucky; Bernie Madoff ran a huge Ponzi for years. But that doesn\u2019t really help. The longer you run the Ponzi, the deeper the hole gets; being respectable and trusted for decades doesn\u2019t really get you the billions of dollars you need to plug the hole. It is hard to grow your way out of it; growth mostly makes the problem worse.<br><br>But there is something different about running a crypto exchange, taking out margin loans against tokens that you made up to invest in crypto venture capital projects. The asset that you are borrowing against is essentially confidence in you: in your exchange, in crypto generally, in your role as a leading figure in crypto. If that collapses, then your finances collapse and you find yourself in a Bahamian jail cell. But what if it doesn&#039;t? If you go on long enough, then those FTT tokens that you made up \u2014 that entitle customers to discounts on FTX trading fees and a share of FTX revenue \u2014 become more and more valuable, and your decision to lend money against them looks fine. (Your decision to manipulate them looks fine, too, because in hindsight you can say \u201cof course we bought when people were selling, we thought they were a bargain, and we were right.\u201d) Ultimately maybe those tokens become so valuable that they dwarf the customer money that you, uh, misplaced, and you can easily plug the hole with the tokens.", "time": 1672040912, "resto": 53014305, "id": "rX6h0NLM"}, {"no": 53017735, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:53:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017568</a><br>You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about.

The plan, with Terra, was for it to become so popular and widely accepted that people would pay a lot of money for Luna, its native token, and then Terra\u2019s promoters would sell a bunch of Luna to raise money to make TerraUSD a fully backed stablecoin. \u201c\u201cThe basic structure of the trade,\u201d I wrote, \u201cis (1) Ponzi, (2) acceptance, (3) diversification, (4) permanence.\u201d This did not work, because before Terra could complete its diversification it lost market confidence, and everything went to zero.

It was an effective way to implicitly short bonds, and profit off the inevitable inflation. The Fed is explicitly targeting a 2%+ inflation floor - all risk is to the upside.<br>Even today, owning a home can still be beneficial due to the nature of fixed-rate mortgages. If rates decline, you can simply refinance your mortgage to attain the lower rates. If they increase further, existing mortgage holders continue to win out as they pay less than future buyers. Your mortgage has a free option implicitly built-in.<br>By holding a mortgage, you&#039;re paying a flat rate for the next 30 years that can only ever get cheaper for you (via refinancing). As a renter, your costs will rise every year.<br><br>That said, there are downsides too. You&#039;ve mentioned depreciation/maintenance expense. The reality is that if you&#039;re buying a house today, you&#039;re likely buying something 30-40 years old, and paying as if it&#039;s brand new. Population growth has increased the value of housing over the decades and obscured the reality that these are, in fact, depreciating assets. Housing is a living expense. It is not an &quot;investment&quot;. The long term trend of population growth is dying out in many parts of the world, and as populations stop growing there is less need for new homes. There is less competition for the present pool of homes. The whole paradigm is about to shift. <br>I believe that homeowners will still continue to win out over rentcucks, in general.

Don&#039;t think for a second that individual shares won&#039;t reach 8 or 9 digits.

I have 50 shares in my brokerage for the ultimate gamble for easy to access instant cheap blue chip stocks, and 250 shares in CS. If I get rugged by my broker, I&#039;m willing to sell 50 shares that I have DRS&#039;d for funny looking Chinese phone numbers and use the 200 shares to collect my upcoming quarterly or annual dividend. Honestly, I&#039;m content knowing that I&#039;m not paper handing and that my fake shares in my brokerage MUST be bought to stop a short squeeze.

But nothing people anywhere on the internet can affect my decision to buy GME. I\u2019ve already made the decision to buy it. I think the stock is going to short squeeze and I like the company under Ryan cohen\u2019s leadership regardless. Any expert or media outlet telling me I\u2019m wrong, I simply don\u2019t believe. So I don\u2019t have much to gain from 4chan or reddit. I just want to learn this current Goofy Goof is shorting GameStop fiasco so I can understand the current situation better.

It didn\u2019t collapse organically you can decide for yourself why it happened. Most people speculate an attack from FTX, blackrock or inside sabotage by Do Kwon or even a mixture. Either way a quantum mint happened and it crashed Luna from $100 to under 0. Millions of dollars turned into thousands. Some call it the largest loss of wealth in history, people were destroyed and many committed suicide. During the aftermath people were lost on what to do and different sides started arguing. Ultimately Do Kwon decided on a fork against the advice of CZ who wanted to just burn the supply. Do Kwon basically jumped ship and left the old chain up for grabs. This is why we have LUNC and TUNA today.<br><br>LUNC was going to be listed alongside TUNA on basically every exchange. This needed to happen because Do Kwon wanted an airdrop to pre crash wallets. The problem was Do Kwon needed LUNC to die because all its liquidity and attention belonged to TUNA, but having it on every exchange just drew more attention and gave hope for its revival. The hope drew in the shorters trying to kill the baby phoenix. This was the first big shakeout it was a literal poo-op telling people to sell and buy link and matic instead.<br><br>This eventually passed when a group of rebel devs, who work for free, wanted to revitalize the chain. With this break a new villain also appeared, GCR and his faggot disciples. This is where the current drama started as the rebels got compromised. At first they wanted to mint more LUNC to create USTN to airdrop to crash victims as a sacrifice. Then they want to hand over all governance to 9 people who get paid $60k+ a year to destroy the coin.

While many LUNC holders liked the idea of increased independence from TFL, Agora users criticized the proposal for being vague and lacking details on how the $150k would be spent specifically. The proposal passed and it was discovered that a portion of the $150k would be spent paying Discord moderators, &quot;community relations&quot; team, and other useless bloat. It was also revealed 4 out of the 12 of TR&#039;s &quot;active members&quot; were people whose primary role was Discord moderator. People called out TR for presenting a proposal that was ostensibly about developing a wallet and then using the funds to pay for things like Discord moderation and that 1/3 of their active members did not meaningfully contribute to anything to LUNCs technical development. Instead of receiving and constructively responding to the critical feedback, TR members like Rexx and ClanMudhorn acted smug about it and basically told everyone in was none of their business how TR spends the money, even though the proposal was explicitly for wallet development, and that Discord moderation was a very important job. While all of this was happening, Zaradar had already indicated he was stepping away from TR over disagreements about funding. The wallet fiasco was the final straw. Without a serious developer like Zaradar associated with TR, the community no longer has any patience for them. Ultimately,TR&#039;s fall is for the best because they were a case study of the Pareto Principle in action. Now the real developers like Big Z and Jacob Gadikian can do their thing with less noise from the Discord crowd. <br><br>Tl;dr TR burned whatever goodwill remained towards them by taking $150k from the community pool to pay Discord trannies.", "filename": "Baboona2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 927, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671868799734110, "time": 1671868799, "md5": "heViEwYRrDPj0KmnnZziZg==", "fsize": 273717, "resto": 53000196, "id": "GtG5VwhP"}, {"no": 53000779, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)03:07:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I hate to keep posting this diamond hands guy but why is no one talking about this?

He put in a lot of work at the beginning and it was only as the Alex chapter of the LUNC saga unfolded that we started to turn on him. Ed\u2019s emotional pro-USTC baggie posts and Alex simping lost him a lot of good will no doubt.

The problem nobody realizes with mental health is it isn\u2019t in your head but stress and trauma stored in your body. This is why talk therapy and meds don\u2019t work. <br><br>The guy behind TRE David bercelli in collaboration with Peter Levine of Somatic Experiencing figured out two things. One was, wild animals never have long lasting effects of stress and anxiety after getting attacked by predators because they instantly tremor out the stress and trauma. So a croc snaps at a zebra, zebra freaks and gets away, tremors, then goes back to grazing 1 min later like nothing ever happened. He also noticed that in 3rd world countries when in bomb shelters that after a bomb went off the kids would naturally shake, but the adults wouldn\u2019t. Because we have all been conditioned to think shaking is weakness. So the kids would shake and end up fine and the adults wouldn\u2019t and would go on to develop PTSD. <br><br>But we have a built in mechanism to tremor and shake to release all this pent up stress and trauma and reset our nervous systems. So all these cops, vets, and tendie eating anime jerking off NEETS who want to kill themselves just need to tremor and they\u2019ll be fine.<br><br>All of 2019 I wanted to kill myself from derealization and depersonalization (dissociation) brought on by anxiety and stress because of thyroid issues.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1640435575462", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4572, "h": 4040, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1671853920036373, "time": 1671853920, "md5": "JMG275ZjGKZZeCWMkkVD4Q==", "fsize": 3937075, "resto": 0, "id": "1U+pzxG9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 132, "images": 56, "unique_ips": 58}, {"no": 52999287, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:53:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52942053#p52942053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52942053</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671854022165243, "time": 1671854022, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit.

Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671854353882828, "time": 1671854353, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999336, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brainlet here, is there a way to swap monero for bitcoin or vice versa, <br>pls dont laugh ):", "time": 1671854363, "resto": 52999274, "id": "Sjyu/3Jr"}, {"no": 52999339, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Case and point, the top are literally running on GPUs.<br>For data centers, a similar thing occurs. Take a look at AWS&#039;s instances and plans, and you can see that they are custom tailed towards a specific need, like loading handling, rendering, simulations, fast/slow data storage, databases, etc. So a generic algorithm like randomX, that uses various aspects of a customer grade CPU, will run sub-optimal on all of them.<br>Additionally, data centers are used for everything, so asking them to turn it off, while possible is extremely costly. You would be asking them to turn of essential infrastructure for the backbones of the internet, that comes with a huge price tag. And you can count in the fact that data centers don&#039;t utilize 100% CPU, cooling and electricity issues.

Add 4GB DDR4 RAM to each, plus a PSU, plus a motherboard, plus all that is required to cool such a behemoth. And you can easily go over 1 billion USD to attack a small drug dealer&#039;s currency still in its early days.<br>And yes you can try to make a custom CPU just for randomX, but it&#039;ll essentially be the same as modern AMD CPU, with some overhead.

The fact that users must compete for block space is an anti-spam measure. See how feeless networks like Nano get DoSed every now and then to see why fees are important. They are even more important for Bitcoin because miners need to be incentivized some other way after block rewards dwindle down the road from here. The counter-argument is that increasing the size of blocks will reduce fees and allow more users to transact over the network. That&#039;s not necessarily true. When this happens, the blockchain will have increased in size significantly and very few people would be able to run Bitcoin Core at home, most would have to exclusively rely on data centers. And since you and I don&#039;t own these data centers, these corporate nodes decide what transactions are approved. In other words, you open the network to censorship. This is precisely how Infura was able to censor Tornado Cash a few months back. Most people rely on node infrastructure providers like Infura, Alchemy , etc. because the Ethereum blockchain is chunky. A 2TB hard drive might be sufficient now, but if we&#039;re going to see widespread adoption later, take into account that the limit right now is 20TB and they&#039;re expensive, and beyond this the other solution is data centers, or making your own data center lol.<br><br>I also don&#039;t think Monero can survive without Bitcoin.

Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This takes a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant! Rather, it is only to point out that, when looking at the case at hand (i.e., ease for both back-end and front-end development), they are not the top choice.<br><br>THERE IS NO NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED DATA EXTRACTION WHEN THE DATA IS ALREADY COMING FROM DECENTRALIZED BLOCKS!!! The decentralization is only necessary in proving the data hasn\u2019t been tampered with.

It&#039;s centralized. Centralization is faster and easier than decentralization.<br>2. It evolves more rapidly. PRQ&#039;s team has already moved on to a completely new project, while GRT&#039;s team is still working its first project.<br>3. Small and scrappy. GRT has a team of dozens if not hundreds of people, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. PRQ has a small team and very little money, so it knows how to fight for its survival and relevance with limited resources.<br>4. Legality. PRQ&#039;s business confidently operates in full compliance with the law of the United Kingdom. GRT indexes the data of sanctioned smart contracts, its DAOs are incorporated in tax havens, and some of its validators run in countries of questionable diplomatic standing. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t want anyone to control it, and this is wrong.<br>5. Affordability. GRT makes its users pay fees for its services. PRQ just asks that its users hold the token for services, and sell it when they&#039;re done.<br>6. Focus. PRQ&#039;s small team is focused on lots of different projects at once. GRT is focused on one project, and it doesn&#039;t even lend NFTs.<br>7. For the common man. PRQ has lots of small customers. GRT is used by amoral global entities like Goldman Sachs and the WEF.<br>8. Economics. GRT holders have to stake to earn a worthwhile cut of fees, and risk volatility with their investments. PRQ is a real business that gets paid directly for its services without a need for frivolous nonsense like profit sharing or value accrual.<br>9. Marketing. PRQ isn&#039;t afraid to talk about price action and predictions on official outlets. GRT aggressively discourages it in all their official communities and communications.<br>10. Specialization. PRQ was built by engineers. GRT has to hire engineers, cryptographers, data scientists, financial analysts, designers, and devrels to help build their product, and that&#039;s expensive.", "time": 1671871962, "resto": 52993237, "id": "FC9F7UB+"}, {"no": 53001084, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:41:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52999004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999004</a><br>How can you say that 99% of the tokens are released when the circulating supply is 170 million and the total is like 300 million?", "time": 1671874878, "resto": 52993237, "id": "IohuMduE"}, {"no": 53001170, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:12:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000769</a><br>Yeah don&#039;t trust that guy on that kind of info, he claimed GRT could not go below 10c, which is why he&#039;s now shilling PRQ lmao", "time": 1671876747, "resto": 52993237, "id": "jLJNQvLI"}, {"no": 53001198, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000940</a><br>Who&#039;s meant to fall for this bait?", "time": 1671877210, "resto": 52993237, "id": "YmuIbZEV"}, {"no": 53001212, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:24:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>Should we buy their new token when it&#039;s released?", "time": 1671877487, "resto": 52993237, "id": "ftj8mLGM"}, {"no": 53001228, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:28:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>999999 other shitcoin scams claimed this retarded shit (surely your pajeet coin partnered with aws) and of course not even the most established cryptos are used in any of that.", "time": 1671877736, "resto": 52993237, "id": "5jmbcW24"}, {"no": 53001269, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:38:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "because they don&#039;t plan to use their Reserve which is locked atm.

It&#039;s centralized. Centralization is faster and easier than decentralization.<br>2. It evolves more rapidly. PRQ&#039;s team has already moved on to a completely new project, while GRT&#039;s team is still working its first project.<br>3. Small and scrappy. GRT has a team of dozens if not hundreds of people, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. PRQ has a small team and very little money, so it knows how to fight for its survival and relevance with limited resources.<br>4. Legality. PRQ&#039;s business confidently operates in full compliance with the law of the United Kingdom. GRT indexes the data of sanctioned smart contracts, its DAOs are incorporated in tax havens, and some of its validators run in countries of questionable diplomatic standing. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t want anyone to control it, and this is wrong.<br>5. Affordability. GRT makes its users pay fees for its services. PRQ just asks that its users hold the token for services, and sell it when they&#039;re done.<br>6. Focus. PRQ&#039;s small team is focused on lots of different projects at once. GRT is focused on one project, and it doesn&#039;t even lend NFTs.<br>7. For the common man. PRQ has lots of small customers. GRT is used by amoral global entities like Goldman Sachs and the WEF.<br>8. Economics. GRT holders have to stake to earn a worthwhile cut of fees, and risk volatility with their investments. PRQ is a real business that gets paid directly for its services without a need for frivolous nonsense like profit sharing or value accrual.<br>9. Marketing. PRQ isn&#039;t afraid to talk about price action and predictions on official outlets. GRT aggressively discourages it in all their official communities and communications.<br>10. Specialization. PRQ was built by engineers. GRT has to hire engineers, cryptographers, data scientists, financial analysts, designers, and devrels to help build their product, and that&#039;s expensive.", "time": 1672041864, "resto": 53016271, "id": "d6XBtkR1"}, {"no": 53018176, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:25:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017798</a><br>kek nice subtle GRT shill", "time": 1672046758, "resto": 53016271, "id": "R4nDDuwj"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53017951, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:44:13", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "I made 60k this year by scamming racist frogs in Mongolian basketweaving forum", "com": "Thanks, biz &amp; happy new year", "filename": "1639171661988pe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 206, "h": 245, "tn_w": 206, "tn_h": 245, "tim": 1672044253235116, "time": 1672044253, "md5": "S2Xrg35gtnU64hmsCaJgkQ==", "fsize": 8488, "resto": 0, "id": "It2t+0SV", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-made-60k-this-year-by-scamming-racist-frogs-in", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 53017957, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:45:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017951</a><br>not cool, bro. not cool", "time": 1672044331, "resto": 53017951, "id": "c61GTWRk"}, {"no": 53017981, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:49:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017957</a><br>It&#039;s simple actually, just need 10 minutes to make BSC shitcoin and they will always buy it.<br>idk, they just trust me. dumb fucks", "time": 1672044581, "resto": 53017951, "id": "It2t+0SV"}, {"no": 53018165, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:23:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "raj... u bhenchode...", "time": 1672046580, "resto": 53017951, "id": "QnUefdir"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53017570, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:21:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There is nothing wrong with golddiggers", "filename": "1641588349956", "ext": ".png", "w": 944, "h": 746, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 197, "tim": 1672039283069524, "time": 1672039283, "md5": "p6bHk3a3srf+ZXJ+FdlaAA==", "fsize": 74181, "resto": 0, "id": "WAhxb0OX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "there-is-nothing-wrong-with-golddiggers", "replies": 25, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 53017576, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:23:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m 46 years old and now I&#039;m ready to settle down</span>", "filename": "1662717838461853", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 442, "h": 694, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672039381162569, "time": 1672039381, "md5": "Zr3RIrvQo38mPynm1BZd0A==", "fsize": 25384, "resto": 53017570, "id": "4YxOa6XD"}, {"no": 53017582, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:24:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53017570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53017570</a><br>Me either I plan to become one", "time": 1672039452, "resto": 53017570, "id": "oMFR7eJ+"}, {"no": 53017606, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:28:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "She became her own husband.
