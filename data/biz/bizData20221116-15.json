Just like dip slurpers are afraid they&#039;ll miss the dip and get in too late and miss the bottom, and miss out on gains, bear market sellers fear that the market will start to fall again before they can get out of it, before they can lock in a profit, and that they will miss out on the fall in the market.<br><br>Weeks turn into months, months into years, and every time the market falls, people think it may be a bottom, only to be disappointed later (or excited if they are short) when it puts in another new low.<br><br>People sometimes wonder aloud how it is that so many people missed out on silver at $5/oz, even down to $4/oz at times, and $300/oz gold, how is it that everyone could walk past such low prices ?

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1667824257250336", "ext": ".png", "w": 2870, "h": 2060, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 179, "tim": 1668458211649341, "time": 1668458211, "md5": "yjBlL1vNGyxm7KnVhq5n1A==", "fsize": 3613160, "resto": 0, "id": "nwC2U7M0", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 182, "images": 78, "omitted_posts": 177, "omitted_images": 77, "last_replies": [{"no": 52473928, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473912</a><br>do you have the seed phrase? is so ur prob fine. if not, ur a moron.", "time": 1668631958, "resto": 52434276, "id": "J3NUbIWH"}, {"no": 52473936, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:53:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473928</a><br>yeah of course i have the seed phrase", "time": 1668631982, "resto": 52434276, "id": "04KSt0JN"}, {"no": 52473970, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:54:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473936</a><br>then stay comfy king.", "time": 1668632067, "resto": 52434276, "id": "J3NUbIWH"}, {"no": 52473987, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:55:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473913</a><br>Why not just buy from localmonero?<br>I feel like you are over complicating things", "time": 1668632111, "resto": 52434276, "id": "JAMtCSjS"}, {"no": 52473988, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:55:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473970</a><br>likewise, king", "filename": "pepe clink", "ext": ".png", "w": 868, "h": 379, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 54, "tim": 1668632113100336, "time": 1668632113, "md5": "9IP24xy6Zpqbm/zHk9lYZQ==", "fsize": 225781, "resto": 52434276, "id": "04KSt0JN"}], "last_modified": 1668632113}, {"no": 52473718, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:41:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hehe", "filename": "Fhtm7GnVQAIsWwr", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 579, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 212, "tim": 1668631273121819, "time": 1668631273, "md5": "XjNcxc8F0HG1FSkJDf0ioA==", "fsize": 40319, "resto": 0, "id": "QCQCXN6u", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hehe", "replies": 11, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 52473874, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:49:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473805</a><br>shes got nice saggy jew tits, would", "time": 1668631753, "resto": 52473718, "id": "pN5bprxQ"}, {"no": 52473882, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:49:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473718</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thought it was some kind of mad /pol/ edit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it\u2019s 100% real lol</span>", "time": 1668631799, "resto": 52473718, "id": "jd5wIaKt"}, {"no": 52473915, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:51:25", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "A252D6F2-C1DB-49AA-86D9-F4382C87E465", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 690, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1668631885739256, "time": 1668631885, "md5": "kkiCPZxcHy8fkb+OZ0I7Iw==", "fsize": 84709, "resto": 52473718, "id": "vioZWGky"}, {"no": 52473943, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52473799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52473799</a><br>Their entire &quot;holy&quot; book is about how to trick their desert storm god by playing around the meaning of words so they could ignore all his rules without technically breaking them.

Kebin has always talked in terms of a time window for regulators coming for crypto in force, and I think the extreme late side of that was 2023. Earlier action would have taken a lot of this extreme contagion out of the market.

CZ will never be allowed near fully-regulated markets in a Western country. And that&#039;s before the whole Iran sanctions thing and whatever punishment falls out of that. Plus, the FTX/FTX US contagion really challenges the prospects for the likes of Binance US and UK being around much longer. Kraken is probably fine if not really going anywhere exciting- and Jesse Powell is largely persona non grata in US media because of his public anti-woke stance.

Feel free to rip it apart.<br><br>Markets are currently shaky but inflation numbers are coming in and giving people hope. However, the inflationary effects of the deep industrial corporations (I&#039;m talking the corps who run the power grid, marine engine manufacturers, oil &amp; gas, shipping, OEMs, suppliers of OEMs and raw material providers) are feeling the effects of the inflation from the war/Covid and have been mostly holding off raising prices, cutting into their margins for a while now but are starting to feel the pain. Earnings call Q4 2022 and over next year will continue to spook investors which will hold the market down while smart money buys valuable assets for cheap and people who believe in crypto DCA into bitcoin and other alternatives with some backing. Some companies will go bankrupt and gobbeled up by bigger players for cheap so competition decreases. As the next year progresses and Russia is forced back towards their border, things keep stalling until something pops and Russia collapses on itself. New goverment will be installed in Russia (probably Navalny) and it will be &quot;liberated&quot; opening up new flows of raw materials back to a starved world economy. This will probably be late 2023 or even 2024 though. In this meantime leading up to this, companies will probably have tightened the belt and gotten rid of some loose baggage, causing a flood of cheap labor into the market which drives down wages of low skilled jobs but keeps skilled workforce which will not see significant raises. This increase in workforce puts pressure on the goverments for support so they start printing again and the cycle begins again with a bull run build up in ~2025-2027 until the next crisis comes.

Never add to a losing position. Once you&#039;ve made your initial purchase of a security, if it starts losing value, the worst thing you can do is average down.<br><br>2. Don&#039;t buy things you don&#039;t understand. If you can&#039;t explain to another person why you&#039;ve made this investment in five sentences or less, you shouldn&#039;t be buying. <br><br>3. Avoid bizarre pipe dream investments. Futuristic technology stocks are 99% dogshit. <br><br>4. Losers don&#039;t win. In other words, a stock that is trending downwards is likely to continue trending down. Stop listening to scam artists promising huge returns on some vaguely defined deep value stock when it&#039;s crashing *cough cough cathie wood cough*<br><br>5. Have a medium to long term view. If you buy something, either have a target exit or hold for 5 years minimum. Also, have an exit plan and stick to it.<br><br>6. Don&#039;t invest politically. The market doesn&#039;t fucking care about your politics.<br><br>7. Stick to your chosen strategy. Changing what you&#039;re doing every 5 days is how most people fuck themselves.<br><br>8.", "time": 1668620715, "resto": 52469087, "id": "A/QgkdYe"}, {"no": 52471707, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:46:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "become a paypig, at least you get some sexual satisfaction out of that", "time": 1668624362, "resto": 52469087, "id": "KfTw5aWD"}], "last_modified": 1668624362}, {"no": 52469429, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)11:22:52", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "BTC, The Big SHORT", "com": "https://www.tradingview.com/chart/B<wbr>TCUSDT/tdh9xzL4-Bitcoin-Short-Signa<wbr>l/", "filename": "T6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1069, "h": 466, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1668615772011548, "time": 1668615772, "md5": "fPJv09wu1QvrLxppOmfPgw==", "fsize": 86886, "resto": 0, "id": "0foDVIoq", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "btc-the-big-short", "replies": 11, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 52469744, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)11:42:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52469557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52469557</a><br>Those order amounts change as the price changes. i.e you might see a large increase of orders at the 14k range if price moves further south or you might see a large amount of orders get taken out and put in for even lower amounts if we move south quickly..<br><br>All this shows you is that there are a lot of buys in for lower prices as is always the case.", "time": 1668616939, "resto": 52469429, "id": "SO3R6RUr"}, {"no": 52470863, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)12:49:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "r8 my bitcoin cash short", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 300, "h": 447, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668620995806519, "time": 1668620995, "md5": "moXO+UPQL6tfwhFZ4SDmUQ==", "fsize": 31081, "resto": 52469429, "id": "ijjntypt"}, {"no": 52471252, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52469557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52469557</a><br>if anything the past year should have thought you its that orderbooks are mostly spoofed", "time": 1668622400, "resto": 52469429, "id": "uJwCkHl/"}, {"no": 52471455, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:28:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52469429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52469429</a><br>thats a long entry dumbass. you are shorting against institutions. didnt you see that massive amount of volume on that tiny little candle?", "time": 1668623313, "resto": 52469429, "id": "ZgWSSlhN"}, {"no": 52471649, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:42:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52469557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52469557</a><br>dont listen to op he is a plant to gather liquidity. go drain reddit asshole.", "time": 1668624158, "resto": 52469429, "id": "ZgWSSlhN"}], "last_modified": 1668624158}]}]
