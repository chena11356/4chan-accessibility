Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "time": 1670726547, "resto": 0, "filedeleted": 1, "id": "pC++OEQJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 125, "images": 43, "omitted_posts": 120, "omitted_images": 41, "last_replies": [{"no": 52830548, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)02:57:30", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "h5t46dvsdj471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3024, "h": 4032, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670831850338526, "time": 1670831850, "md5": "lGjKioBImPqJGpgCUiHbVQ==", "fsize": 801075, "resto": 52817752, "id": "pC++OEQJ"}, {"no": 52830577, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:04:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52830548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52830548</a><br>chad king", "filename": "fastman", "ext": ".png", "w": 411, "h": 448, "tn_w": 114, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670832254004510, "time": 1670832254, "md5": "ELDu+yZArvXfkpzFimviSg==", "fsize": 215700, "resto": 52817752, "id": "jrU4qNof"}, {"no": 52830966, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)04:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52830548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52830548</a><br>Why the fuck would you ever wear this?

During his free time, he enjoyed tinkering with various odd experiments, such as freezing different objects and liquids. Eventually, this led to him freezing a container filled with his own urine in his family\u2019s refrigerator. After a few weeks, Dominic noticed that his frozen pee had acquired a peculiar odor and looked a bit different from the ordinary.<br><br>Out of curiosity, the daring teen decided to make some money off of his curious concoction, so he posted an advertisement online offering &quot;collectible frozen urine.&quot; Much to his surprise, within a few days, he began receiving orders from a group of neo-Nazis. The idea of selling his frozen pee to a group of hate-filled people was abhorrent to Dominic, so he decided to take down the ad.<br><br>Unfortunately for Dominic, the neo-Nazis had already paid for the frozen pee and threatened dire consequences if he refused to provide what they requested. In the end, Dominic had no choice but to comply, so he quickly sent them their order through the mail. He was relieved to have made his delivery without any further disruption, but he never forgot the nightmarish experience he went through.<br><br>From then on, Dominic decided to forgo any bizarre experiments and focus on his studies instead.
