Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Dec2022", "ext": ".png", "w": 881, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 227, "tim": 1674967153121325, "time": 1674967153, "md5": "ag5BhOXv0T0piQrOMS12vQ==", "fsize": 261950, "resto": 0, "id": "GYt1JLiW", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 63, "images": 37, "unique_ips": 37}, {"no": 53479405, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53410417#p53410417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410417</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674967234895521, "time": 1674967234, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479406, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "comfiest hold", "filename": "anonymous psycho", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1107, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967238375027, "time": 1674967238, "md5": "FdGA/H8bh56WZ2bMRMIHkA==", "fsize": 286689, "resto": 53479388, "id": "/Ar04N/D"}, {"no": 53479417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967550498520, "time": 1674967550, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479528, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:52:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479388</a><br>Remember to teach your children about Monero.", "filename": "father teaches daughter about Monero", "ext": ".png", "w": 1488, "h": 1488, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674967975748895, "time": 1674967975, "md5": "IA9aY6yr2O8cKXnx0wYfAQ==", "fsize": 3128011, "resto": 53479388, "id": "hxWhAu08"}, {"no": 53479593, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:01:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "for russian monero-chads:<br>we have thread here <br>2ch.life/cc/res/839934.html", "time": 1674968497, "resto": 53479388, "id": "TSXvNt3D"}, {"no": 53479619, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:04:16", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674261391277545", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2176, "h": 3200, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674968656514531, "time": 1674968656, "md5": "YrMEeTOm/GlA4k4iCLs2nw==", "fsize": 1488978, "resto": 53479388, "id": "Zdcl3ipM"}, {"no": 53479756, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:20:59", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674969659484479, "time": 1674969659, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53479388, "id": "qtvM3HDJ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53479915, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trusted technology, growing adoption</span><br><br>Zcash was launched by one of the most respected technical teams in the world.<br><br>Zcash is the &#039;https of blockchains,&#039; protecting your freedom to save and spend as you like.<br><br>Zcash was the first project to implement zk-SNARKs, a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography that gives its users the strongest privacy available in any digital currency.<br><br>Multiple, independent organizations are funded to innovate on Zcash.<br><br>Zcash is already available on top exchanges, digital wallets and a growing number of applications.", "filename": "1621943471634", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1116, "h": 1166, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674971055828570, "time": 1674971055, "md5": "9CbmIjABh69hCgSvb/J4QQ==", "fsize": 218045, "resto": 53479388, "id": "pstI2t3M"}, {"no": 53479927, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:46:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is what Monero chuds don&#039;t want you to know.<br><br>Buy Zcash if you actually want to make it.", "filename": "G63gsFs7wbnasGVs3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1145, "h": 3404, "tn_w": 42, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674971161010922, "time": 1674971161, "md5": "XVHgUjHmgaGUqs4ONbqRLA==", "fsize": 1345614, "resto": 53479388, "id": "pstI2t3M"}, {"no": 53480031, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:04:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479915</a><br><a href=\"#p53479927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479927</a><br>Nice try z-niggers.

They hold their value pretty well (not as well as actual Toyotas though), and for what you get it&#039;s a deal compared to BMW or Mercedes.

Negotiate the fuck out of your total amount. Try your hardest to not have a market adjustment and tell them you will finance with them if they give you X price. For example, car is 36,000.

They&#039;ll fuck you up the ass with the rate, but that&#039;s OK because 2 months from now you will go to your local credit union and you&#039;ll refinance for a 3-8% lower interest rate.

Entrepot.app, Yumi.io, or Memecake. Entrepot has the most utility. I suggest staying away from NFTs unless you want to get a few bluechips like Motoko Ghosts or Poked Bots. People will want me to include the works of Ludo but the truth is he is a bit shaky. He feels like the type of guy who would go to a different chain for 50k in his pocket. If you are going to buy a Ludo NFT, buy Pineapple Punks. They have the most upside considering they are really the only PFP project he has and they are relatively cheap. If you want degen moonshots try to go for 0% royalty pixel NFTs. As of now these include Monkey Infinity and PC Heads (I didn&#039;t include DFINITY Bananas because it is obviously a rug). If you only have to buy one, I suggest Monkey Infinity because it has more hype around it since it wasn&#039;t an airdrop. PC Heads is way more decentralized but degens don&#039;t care about holder %. Upcoming 0% royalty free NFT mints are Shibakas and IC Templars. Shibakas is ran by the same guy who made PC Heads. I don&#039;t know about IC Templars but James seems chill with him.

This competition may make it difficult for Parsiq to gain traction and attract a large number of users.<br><br>Complexity: Parsiq&#039;s technology is based on blockchain and requires a good understanding of the underlying technology to be able to use it effectively. This complexity may discourage many businesses and individuals from adopting the platform.<br><br>Lack of awareness: Many businesses and individuals may not be familiar with Parsiq&#039;s technology and its benefits, which could limit its adoption. To overcome this challenge, Parsiq will need to invest in marketing and education initiatives to raise awareness of its platform and its features.<br><br>Security concerns: Blockchain technology is still relatively new, and there are concerns about its security and stability.

My real parents died in a house when my mother knocked over a candle giving birth to me. I survived because my dad threw me out of a third story window into the concrete sidewalk which cushioned my fall but left me with two disfigured legs. That was my first memory. A few weeks later as a baby I was then sent to an orphanage for children with cancer because they messed up my paperwork and marked down that I was four years old. At the orphanage I was routinely beaten by the other boys with a wooden spoon they kept hidden under the wall. I still have the welts to this day. I was adopted at the age of two by a pair of italian men in long island. At the age of two I was routinely placed inside a man-made ring in my living room and forced to fight against our house dogs (a pit named Lucy and a Chihuahua named Nacho) for a large group of men to bet on. If i didn\u2019t finish my chores i was held upside down on the clothes line outside and sprayed with a hose. By four i had begun to lose my hair because of the stress. I could walk because my legs were still broken from my accident so i had to crawl around on my hands and knees back and forth to my kindergarten a mile away. It was there i met my first crush Emily. She was a blond haired girl. She was the only person that was ever nice to me, she called me charlie brown. When I had finally got the nerve to talk to her the teacher told me they would be holding me back a year because my tongue was too short and it was giving me speech problems. The next year I remember crawling past a classroom and seeing all my fellow classmates together with their new teacher while it had to go back to my old one. At the age of 8 i had learned that i had contracted cancer from my step dads cigarettes. They told me i had 2 years to live.", "time": 1675071774, "resto": 53492503, "id": "zYr6fG+Q"}, {"no": 53493938, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)04:46:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53492602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53492602</a><br>Take some Vitamin D, Vitamin B and some Fishoil son.", "filename": "1655846739676", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675072007303341, "time": 1675072007, "md5": "AHvIwAH25Kav7jKn4ftRCQ==", "fsize": 328196, "resto": 53492503, "id": "ssOH893l"}, {"no": 53493940, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)04:46:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53493241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53493241</a><br>Start working out, eating healthy and sleeping properly.

I then crawled back home under my neighbors porch and i connected to his internet and downloaded coinbase on my new phone.

His costs stayed the same. That is because his labor-costs will actually decrease (I didn&#039;t model the distinction between &quot;required input&quot; and &quot;required output&quot; into which you can explode the value-stream, because trying to specify a graph with multi-edges is already murder). But his required costs actually do go down. And since BillY is still willing to transfer 50 value to Xavier, Xavier will rationally keep the total of 50 and increase the toX-component - he can produce cheaper, but sell at the same price, because it&#039;s cheaper to buy and run a CNC machine and an AI than to pay Louis with his high input costs and high profit margin. He can even lower the price.<br>Now let&#039;s split BillY too (I won&#039;t try to visualize this anymore), into BillY, and MegacorpY. BillY is Louis&#039;s son. Since his income comes from Louis, recently laid off, he doesn&#039;t have 50 value to spend. He maybe has 2 from selling roasted rats. MegacorpY does have 50, or maybe 40, value that it&#039;s willing to spend - great cost-savings.<br>Let&#039;s write this whole scenario out in words again:<br>Louis works at Xavier&#039;s toy shop, producing toys that his son Billy buys. Xavier buys a CNC machine - expensive at first, but it pays off, and Louis&#039;s hands are no longer rheumatic from working on wooded toys 12 hours a day. He DOES notice that the job market is getting bad, but he just has to hunker down and use some elbow grease. The next year, Xavier buys one of those AIs that everyone is talking about. It can design the toys - great for Xavier, but now Louis gets laid off. Billy can&#039;t buy any more toys and they become homeless. Xavier loses his child-customers, but maybe he can still sell to the CEO&#039;s kid. Or he goes bankrupt.", "time": 1675079798, "resto": 53490204, "id": "JAB6zJ4J"}, {"no": 53494709, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:58:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53494693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53494693</a><br>So yeah, the end result is that humans approach the limit of being cut out of any and all value streams.

I&#039;m still fuzzy on the particulars of spreads. Not really sure what futures are or even what ETFs are but right now I&#039;m just getting used to the flow of the market. Just from using my Robinhood app, I&#039;m looking at different stocks, figuring out when investors tend to pump and when they tend to pull out. I&#039;ve noticed every time I made a prediction based on a solid observation I was correct. But every time I got bullish for no reason, like I saw something moving up and decided to buy in, then I lost money every time.<br><br>So to me trading is about three things.

Realistically just doubling your money in that short of a time frame is an incredible feat.

I&#039;m now not paying income tax on the revenue as almost all of it is coming as a loan repayment. This LLC was liquid as it had assets, liabilities and cashflow. I could very easily have taken a loan out for it, used that to pay back my own loan and watched it fold when crypto crashed. I didn&#039;t though.

This is where Jack saw his opportunity to make a profit.<br><br>Jack decided to use his living room as the headquarters for his monkey diaper operation. He rearranged the furniture to make room for shelves and boxes of monkey diapers. He created a website, put up some online advertisements, and started taking orders. The orders started coming in, and Jack was amazed at how profitable this business was.<br><br>To keep up with the demand, Jack hired a few friends to help him pack and ship the orders. He also invested in high-quality packaging materials to ensure that the diapers arrived at their destination in good condition.<br><br>As the business grew, Jack realized that he needed more space. So, he rented a small warehouse to store the diapers and hired more people to help with the packing and shipping. Jack&#039;s living room operation had turned into a full-fledged monkey diaper empire.<br><br>Customers were thrilled with the quality of the diapers and the fast shipping. Word of mouth spread, and Jack&#039;s business continued to grow. He was even approached by pet stores and zoos to become their supplier of monkey diapers.<br><br>Years went by, and Jack&#039;s monkey diaper business became one of the largest in the country.

Why?<br>Because batteries are just not economical relative to pulling energy from the grid, I could buy batteries that would cover the times I don&#039;t have adequate solar for about 15k USD and if I project the lifetime delivered kWh divided by that cost, it works out that the per kWh cost is about 0.16 USD. Grid electricity here is 0.07 USD for off peak (and peak is 9am-10pm, so exactly when I mostly don&#039;t need it). Batteries are just not competitive at all with the grid presently.<br>Meanwhile, that smaller isolated purely off grid system for the critical circuits runs all my compute hardware / everything I need to make a living day in and day out and stay online / work from home, and I can power it off a battery system that while still having the same per kWh cost, is 20% of the total cost of the full off grid scenario in question, and the LPG generator backing gives me a 100 kWh deep store. So most of the time everything just runs off the primary array and the LPG generator and battery backup stay idle, but if the grid is ever down, I can survive for months on end purely off the secondary solar array, battery backup, and LPG generator.
