Fantom haunts me in my dreams.<br>Fantom started as a vaporware project in 2018 during the ICO era when many ICO scams are popular. Fantom is one such project. The project was being spearheaded by a gook scammer named Ahn Byuhn Ik and his gook scamming cronies. Realizing that it\u2019s actually not that simple to make a dag-based blockchain with their low gooky IQ, they enlisted the help of Andre \u201cRugpuller\u201d Cronje.<br><br>Andre \u201cRugpuller\u201d Cronje in turn enlisted the help of his slavic cronies and concocted a plan to inflitrate the HBAR HQ where Leemon \u201cThe Genius\u201d Baird is residing. Andre and his cronies succeeded in coaxing the HBAR code from the genius Leemom Baird during his deep slumber and left the HBARbarians who were guarding the HQ dumbfounded after finding out their code is being used in Fantom\u2019s consensus mechanism.<br><br>That is the nutshell biz and I highly encourage you to spread this, copy and paste this and spread it around redit, twitter and biz in order to protect newfags of their money. We must not let the Fantom menace pump as it will result in catastrophic monetary losses among the newfags (already down 95% from ath).

Anonymous (ID: yjxEVDe6 ) <br>01/23/23(Mon)14:17:00 No. 53404344<br>/Biz/ I need to educate you about Fantom\u2019s past. Why it should never have existed and why it is a giant utter scam that makes me seethe in my waking moments and in my sleep. Fantom haunts me in my dreams.<br>Fantom started as a vaporware project in 2018 during the ICO era when many ICO scams are popular. Fantom is one such project. The project was being spearheaded by a gook scammer named Ahn Byuhn Ik and his gook scamming cronies. Realizing that it\u2019s actually not that simple to make a dag-based blockchain with their low gooky IQ, they enlisted the help of Andre \u201cRugpuller\u201d Cronje.<br><br>Andre \u201cRugpuller\u201d Cronje in turn enlisted the help of his slavic cronies and concocted a plan to inflitrate the HBAR HQ where Leemon \u201cThe Genius\u201d Baird is residing. Andre and his cronies succeeded in coaxing the HBAR code from the genius Leemom Baird during his deep slumber and left the HBARbarians who were guarding the HQ dumbfounded after finding out their code is being used in Fantom\u2019s consensus mechanism.<br><br>That is the nutshell biz and I highly encourage you to spread this, copy and paste this and spread it around redit, twitter and biz in order to protect newfags of their money. We must not let the Fantom menace pump as it will result in catastrophic monetary losses among the newfags (already down 95% from ath). I also recommend that we steer them in the right direction by recommending HBAR as a better and more authentic and safer investment to newfags.

Seems like the best way to do it due to Ichan having a large short in GME and he can&#039;t close it so if Cohen buys BABY off him with GME shares in a reverse IPO through Teddy then he gets to close his position, he becomes a long in GME, Cohen uses about 20m shares out the pool, so it would dilute GME a bit but then the value of BABY is rolled into the price of a GME share so the value and profit it makes is now part of the valuation so it balances out and in fact means GME becomes profitable and can then begin issuing dividends, the complete end game for naked shorts.", "time": 1674560309, "resto": 53404732, "id": "I3VVV18J"}, {"no": 53414524, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:05:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53414346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53414346</a><br>If you actually have read this then you\u2019re mentally incapable of understanding the squeeze won\u2019t squeezazle until march or at least late feb.

They can keep the algo humming along but the back offices are on fire.<br>What is worrisome to me is that no one is stepping in to fix the problem or force the shorts to close. This is likely due to the fact that they are so over leveraged that they can&#039;t close. And they also know that the stock market is so full of hot air and counterparty risk that there is no chance in hell of covering and no one has anything to left to do or say. It&#039;s like having a minute to run as far away as you can from a nuclear bomb. It&#039;s pointless. <br>The big thing we are all waiting for here is whether or not these short squeezes can even be unwound without destroying the whole financial system. Is the U.S. on the cusp of an actual collapse? Why isn&#039;t anyone doing anything to save face if they don&#039;t actually think the system will continue on for whatever reason. If not at least Wallstreet and the banks are the ones set to implode. The problem being they were counterfeiting so many companies and stealing so much money that they have no hope of cleaning up the mess they created. So who is going to pay? Who is going to honor these obligations? <br>I say this all of the time, but the best way to hedge these short squeezes is to have precious metals. We either get paid or shit is severely fucked.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674525330036483", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1792, "h": 2688, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674528949550978, "time": 1674528949, "md5": "eQqdb8RP8r6wqVFYYE46dw==", "fsize": 1341589, "resto": 0, "id": "HlPPWoQL", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 112, "images": 47, "unique_ips": 58}, {"no": 53410434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53362323#p53362323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53362323</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674529029185211, "time": 1674529029, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410443, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:45", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674529065836512, "time": 1674529065, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53410417, "id": "QZ5UEoSQ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53410452, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:58:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674529281556892, "time": 1674529281, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410517, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:02:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674529343481590, "time": 1674529343, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410559, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:05:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;53410476</span>", "filename": "no", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 999, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1674529533827566, "time": 1674529533, "md5": "QjpClOIkPLdZ6LtJ+ARZYQ==", "fsize": 165333, "resto": 53410417, "id": "k4cf0H+D"}, {"no": 53410567, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:06:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the only coins that make sense holding right now<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;XMR: anonymity </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ETH: dApps</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BIT: self governance</span>", "time": 1674529579, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HoiK+XKn"}, {"no": 53410621, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trusted technology, growing adoption</span><br><br>Zcash was launched by one of the most respected technical teams in the world.<br><br>Zcash is the &#039;https of blockchains,&#039; protecting your freedom to save and spend as you like.<br><br>Zcash was the first project to implement zk-SNARKs, a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography that gives its users the strongest privacy available in any digital currency.<br><br>Multiple, independent organizations are funded to innovate on Zcash.<br><br>Zcash is already available on top exchanges, digital wallets and a growing number of applications.", "filename": "1621943471634", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1116, "h": 1166, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674529903675033, "time": 1674529903, "md5": "9CbmIjABh69hCgSvb/J4QQ==", "fsize": 218045, "resto": 53410417, "id": "hv8KfB56"}, {"no": 53410643, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:13:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is what Monero chuds don&#039;t want you to know.<br><br>Buy Zcash if you actually want to make it.", "filename": "G63gsFs7wbnasGVs3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1145, "h": 3404, "tn_w": 42, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674530018276040, "time": 1674530018, "md5": "XVHgUjHmgaGUqs4ONbqRLA==", "fsize": 1345614, "resto": 53410417, "id": "hv8KfB56"}, {"no": 53410654, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:15:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How many anons are going to fall for the low quality bait this thread?", "time": 1674530110, "resto": 53410417, "id": "A4L6ws9v"}, {"no": 53410736, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I didn\u2019t get any replies on moneromarket :(", "time": 1674530514, "resto": 53410417, "id": "CWpg8fjs"}, {"no": 53410772, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:25:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;53410476</span><br><a href=\"#p53410567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410567</a><br><a href=\"#p53410621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410621</a><br><a href=\"#p53410643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410643</a><br><a href=\"#p53410654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410654</a><br><a href=\"#p53410736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410736</a><br>All we&#039;re missing now is the &quot;stop buying&quot; and the &quot;when are we making it&quot; anons and we&#039;ve got a full set.", "filename": "20230123_202455", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674530734478445, "time": 1674530734, "md5": "+Zgpw6F8i9verq7q9rMGtw==", "fsize": 155858, "resto": 53410417, "id": "8znrj02z"}, {"no": 53410796, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:27:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53410772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410772</a><br>Don\u2019t know why you @\u2018d me but I am just upset no one replied to me at moneromarket.

This proposal motions to design an optional randomised encryption system for developers that wish to create proposals without revealing the full code to be stolen, and revealing half of the code to show proof that the work is complete. The encryption is randomised, making it impossible for developers to intentionally release and get paid for half-finished work. The encrypted half of the proposal is revealed when payment is released to the developers, and a second voting period follows where the DAO can audit the full code and choose whether to implement it or not. This proposal has received a lot of criticism from community members who wish for developers to trust to be paid by the DAO, whilst another section of the community believes a trust-less framework such as this is fundamental to the DAO. <br>https://dscvr.one/post/9180263/moti<wbr>on-to-build-the-encrypted-bounty-sy<wbr>stem<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Latest Bread</span><br>Anons working on a frontend<br>A group is in talks with a team of devs to start work on the stablecoin protocol<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Telegram</span><br>/sns1community<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Discord</span><br>/2kgnM4cQQc<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter</span><br>twitter.com/SNS1dao<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DSCVR Portal</span><br>dscvr.one/p/sns1<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Taggr Realm</span><br>taggr.top/#/realms/sns-1<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SNS-1 OC group</span><br>oc.app/#/gttbe-dyaaa-aaaaf-a6gpa-ca<wbr>i<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Links</span><br>sneed.one", "filename": "SneedPunk2077", "ext": ".gif", "w": 424, "h": 239, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674637828572111, "time": 1674637828, "md5": "r7uJWcV2hD62K9APM8vRIw==", "fsize": 3084878, "resto": 0, "id": "FPVh8FeR", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sneed-sns1-general-6-sneedpunk-edition", "replies": 12, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 53428342, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:13:21", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674352081556727", "ext": ".gif", "w": 231, "h": 209, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1674638001683482, "time": 1674638001, "md5": "6QfodxTOvJ3OJfX3ykds0g==", "fsize": 4019723, "resto": 53428329, "id": "9RV2mxmH"}, {"no": 53428369, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53428329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53428329</a><br>It&#039;s quiet, sneed bros.

I staked $1300 worth of Algo-(memecoin)-LP in a farm in Cometa. But the thing is, the farm requires you to do the actual LP stake on the Tinyman DEX rather than Cometa. So I did that. Staked my $1300 LP position, then watched my 100+% APR yield farm start to make its magic with those passive rewards that can be compounded. Then I noticed something scary. In Tinyman, whereas an hour ago I had $1300 in LP tokens worth in Tinyman, now Tinyman says I supposedly have $0 in that same liquidity pool. And yet, on Cometa itself, my stake in the LP yield farm is still listed as $1300 and the claimable passive rewards in that farm are still calculated as if it were $1300 worth of LP I had staked.

Did I not get rugpulled but instead Tinyman just transferred all my funds to Cometa so I can collect my rewards and compound my stake more easily there? Or did I get rug-pulled on Tinyman but Cometa has some kind of 1-1 insurance program where you always receive at least a $1-$1 peg value on your Cometa yield farms of what your stake cost initially on Tinyman DEX was no matter whether or not your LP in Tinyman got liquidated or not?<br><br>Or am I way, WAY overthinking this?

Y&#039;see there&#039;s thread for different topics, mostly shitcoins, but there&#039;s also some good general threads too. You&#039;ve got the gold and silverbugs over in /PMG/, the commodities chads over in /CMMG/, the stock market general is in /SMG/ and then there&#039;s various and sundry general threads for specific cryptos or stocks like /TLCG/ and /GME/ and /BBBY/. You&#039;ll notice that a lot of these threads have negative comments about what the thread is about in them, and generally the more there are and the better english they&#039;re written in the more likely it is they&#039;ll actually pay out bigly. You can find these various threads by clicking the catalog button up at the top left corner of the page and then typing whatever you want to search for into the search bar.
