I chose one of the best Indian universities, it was such a waste. Every class had 50% of the marks through &quot;weekly&quot; online tests, which were due at the end of semester, and 50% a group assignment/presentation. Basically the whole system is set up so that you pay some professional academic to do the group assignment for you (something that&#039;d get you banned from any Western university instantly) and just pay the assistant professor or your classmates that already did the tests for all the answers for all the tests. It was pretty much a pay-to-win master&#039;s degree. I paid my enrolment fee and the minimum down payment already before starting so I continued to go to classes until they kicked me out for not paying the rest of the tuition. It was really bad though, their library had no access to any of the big academic journals for the subject, all the students were drunk or high in class (and there were hundreds of them, the masters classes which in Australia would at most have 20-30 people enrolled and 5 people that actually show up were held in lecture theatres), the lecturers would think they are God&#039;s gift on earth and boast about how they were once a high level whatever instead of actually teaching the subject. The whole system is insane and absolutely baffling. <br><br>It really is no wonder why Indian students come to Western countries to get scammed at non-name universities/training centres, for them it really isn&#039;t a scam since even with the very minimal standards they&#039;d actually be getting a better education than back home in India.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNr<wbr>XA5m7ROM", "time": 1670636161, "resto": 52807420, "id": "ep4ph8yU"}, {"no": 52807837, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:47:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52807420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52807420</a><br>is this rajesh true power?.", "time": 1670636820, "resto": 52807420, "id": "R5G7gA8x"}], "last_modified": 1670636820}, {"no": 52807491, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Will there be another opening?", "com": "I didn&#039;t stake in time since I had to go into the office that day.", "filename": "poolsclosed", "ext": ".png", "w": 1171, "h": 698, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 149, "tim": 1670634129945385, "time": 1670634129, "md5": "AIhImi+P/V/7K5CQlf1c0A==", "fsize": 76497, "resto": 0, "id": "ysvCro9s", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "will-there-be-another-opening", "replies": 10, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 5, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 52807682, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:25:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52807491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52807491</a><br>Rekted.", "time": 1670635525, "resto": 52807491, "id": "mt8QgMlR"}, {"no": 52807751, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t think there will be another pool for retail investors, for a long time at least", "time": 1670636022, "resto": 52807491, "id": "ViuR3cUb"}, {"no": 52807816, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:43:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52807751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52807751</a><br>Why do you think this?

So many women waiting until they&#039;re old and dried up to marry and have kids, only to find they can no longer attract Chad and have to reproduce with a dysgenic loser.", "time": 1670633508, "resto": 52801461, "id": "oVRSnp1z"}, {"no": 52807450, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:57:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52801730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52801730</a><br>Delusional cope.", "time": 1670633877, "resto": 52801461, "id": "ZiA88nK1"}, {"no": 52807769, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:36:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why the fuck would i ever leave the comfort of my home where i have all the entertainment i could ever want<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s enriching!</span><br>shut the fuck up", "filename": "b0e", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 656, "h": 679, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670636180633669, "time": 1670636180, "md5": "3X/pF8xxnL8QtIUmxfwSRQ==", "fsize": 31473, "resto": 52801461, "id": "lnEWDvUV"}], "last_modified": 1670636180}, {"no": 52807398, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:51:22", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Luna Classic App Thread", "com": "im looking for more apps on the Classic Chain I found so far an NFT platform called Miata https://twitter.com/miata_io<br><br>and burnflip.com which is a coin toss game that you can double or nothing Luna Classic Tokens <br><br>Anyone seen any other apps so far on Luna Classic", "filename": "LUNC BurnFlip - Logo - 1920x1080", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1670633482925954, "time": 1670633482, "md5": "cZ9l32z/YIqRbr0TbAAKRw==", "fsize": 479166, "resto": 0, "id": "mM1RLXdu", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "luna-classic-app-thread", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 52807611, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:16:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just connect your wallet to my site and get token!</span><br>Nigger<br>Go steal Lunc elsewhere", "time": 1670634968, "resto": 52807398, "id": "YPwNTHH1"}, {"no": 52807764, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:35:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;YES SIR CONNECTO TO MY WALLET AND YOU WILL DOUBLE YOUR COINS SERS</span><br><br>Don\u00b4t you have to rape ugly women in new delhi ?", "time": 1670636157, "resto": 52807398, "id": "KrETnzOM"}, {"no": 52807788, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:39:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52807398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52807398</a><br>Are you looking for an app or advertising one?", "time": 1670636350, "resto": 52807398, "id": "Esf9ZwB/"}], "last_modified": 1670636350}, {"no": 52805224, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:04:00", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "kadena babena everything was just a scamdena", "filename": "498720398475", "ext": ".png", "w": 314, "h": 278, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 221, "tim": 1670619840314913, "time": 1670619840, "md5": "PsXpvug6BR/1Vv6AzRGP/w==", "fsize": 128937, "resto": 0, "id": "SeKDb0CJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "kadena-babena-everything-was-just-a-scamdena", "replies": 26, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 21, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 52806930, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)18:47:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "how come all the interesting people left whalepool chat, followed by all the boring people who thought they were interesting, leaving only attention seeking drug addicts and bagholders?", "time": 1670629645, "resto": 52805224, "id": "asth9MTS"}, {"no": 52806941, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)18:48:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52806834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806834</a><br>Docushield is a scam and the only thing I&#039;m looking forward too is that new wallet https://twitter.com/LinxWallet", "time": 1670629693, "resto": 52805224, "id": "dxkHjsDX"}, {"no": 52807558, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:09:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52806599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806599</a><br>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status<wbr>/1119291976703025153<br><a href=\"#p52806864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806864</a><br><a href=\"#p52806879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806879</a><br>AI doesn&#039;t explore fields of creativity outside its interpolated training data.<br><a href=\"#p52806834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806834</a><br>https://koalawallet.io/<br><a href=\"#p52806941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806941</a><br>is this your wallet", "filename": "jndDglDMzrw", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 560, "h": 560, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670634595995357, "time": 1670634595, "md5": "/+X8U+HGr8YyKgMwd9GCdw==", "fsize": 103433, "resto": 52805224, "id": "5VU/kWDg"}, {"no": 52807645, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:19:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52806649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806649</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;goblin slayer</span><br>It goes hard, I like it.

Society is always trying to sell us things. For example, I have 4 tech devices that do the same thing (consoom). I even sold my car a while back. Cars are probably one of the biggest scams out there. I&#039;m at the point that all I need is my phone and laptop when it comes to tech. I don&#039;t care about video games and gaming anymore, either. I&#039;m only in my early twenties. Honestly feels like I&#039;ve gone crazy. <br><br>I no longer care about buying a house either. I rent because I can&#039;t afford a house, but I probably wouldn&#039;t even buy one if I could afford it. I do feel very aimless, but I just think society is kind of insane. Living in a big city and going to college has changed my entire perspective on the world, because I grew up in a very rural and isolated area for most of my life. I came into low 6 figure territory with crypto, which has made things feel even weirder. I&#039;m not even bragging, I just feel like our world is crazy.<br><br>Idk why I even made this post, but yeah. I&#039;m trying to figure out how to truly live my life. I want to travel and stuff, but that feels like another materialistic venture. Also worth mentioning that I hate college because it has a price tag attached to it.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1689743765932", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1670388080012710, "time": 1670388080, "md5": "/YYHr79LGSaIeNbi+fp/Cw==", "fsize": 554653, "resto": 0, "id": "HEurLdB4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 236, "images": 63, "omitted_posts": 231, "omitted_images": 63, "last_replies": [{"no": 52807421, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:54:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52797894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52797894</a><br>45ad0e512d71df17ba847d725b34d66e042<wbr>ca920c287b811151c02caf88d0249", "time": 1670633640, "resto": 52766664, "id": "yLxT/RP9"}, {"no": 52807428, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:54:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52806426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52806426</a><br>that explains why xmr is rising so hard, all the hackers use the time to transfer their bounty into xmr", "time": 1670633687, "resto": 52766664, "id": "Tr9u2hvM"}, {"no": 52807441, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:56:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52807411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52807411</a><br><br>cheers and thank you I used this one", "time": 1670633805, "resto": 52766664, "id": "uAqoJGUG"}, {"no": 52807449, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:57:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52807441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52807441</a><br>fugg mb didn&#039;t realize both posts were yours", "time": 1670633875, "resto": 52766664, "id": "yLxT/RP9"}, {"no": 52807634, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:18:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52807421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52807421</a><br>I redeemed this one, thanks anon!", "time": 1670635107, "resto": 52766664, "id": "HC7wuWlX"}], "last_modified": 1670635107}, {"no": 52798706, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)03:46:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why aren&#039;t men working?

This was done so that SDL can utilise all its revenue to grow and expand. Whether or not this is reversed in the future is unknown. On the other hand this move can be seen as &quot;greedy&quot; by horse man. Also the supply was cut in half. <br><br>2) Staking SDL is the same as staking LPL preciously, except now you get a stSDL token. You use this stSDL token to give you access to link staking. <br><br>3) 20% rewards for staking Link on SDL (23% + core contributors cut) is based on network fees. This means if a node provides 1,000 data instances (price of x, temperature of y) a 20% cut of every network fee paid by the node is taken and distributed to all link stalkers. This is huge and will grow exponentially. <br><br>4) After the charity staking ends (the link you earn on vanilla staking is from the 500,000 link set aside to support the community and the whole thing was done as a favor for your fags) the only way for you to stake would be to either a) run a node or b) find middlemen like horseman. <br><br>5) Although the token migration was sudden, LPL was incredibly illiquid. When you stake your link on SDL you will receive a stLink token. The amount of stLink in your wallet will increase with time and you can freely trade it for link later on (keeping the original link staked inside the node to secure the network while you cash out). It&#039;s like holding a voucher for the locked node link that you can trade for real link. The buyer would basically own the rights to your link rewards if you sell him your stLink. Or you could withdraw the staked link + rewards (they might have waiting periods before you can withdraw, perhaps to maintain a set amount of link staked in their nodes) <br><br>tl:dr johnny rims horses, but he also gives em snacks", "filename": "1670505053491098", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 554, "h": 584, "tn_w": 237, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670579077786246, "time": 1670579077, "md5": "VvhJCJ3C9F7znkU4bXltxw==", "fsize": 32355, "resto": 0, "id": "N/nRpSEf", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "linkpool-information-thread", "replies": 78, "images": 8, "omitted_posts": 73, "omitted_images": 8, "last_replies": [{"no": 52803867, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)14:04:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52799037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52799037</a><br>The purpose of linkpool is that you have a significant but small % of linkies who will end up reaping far and away the most benefits thus dividing and conquering /biz/ holders.

But bsv likes to call itself p2p digital &quot;cash&quot; cash is different from money or currency which is just the digit accounting. Cash specifically denotes physical currency. &quot;Cold hard cash&quot;. Cash is non reversable, you give some guy cash and he leaves, you have no way of getting it back, if you complain to court they can ask the guy to give it back but they have no actual ability to just reverse the cash exchange. Thats the beauty of cash, it is controlled solely by its owner, even if someone else legally lays claim to it they still have the option of hiding it and keeping control.

It was said that Dominic Williams had been visited by Satan himself, who had told him that he was the coming of the antichrist. At first, Dom didn&#039;t believe it, but the demon had shown him many sigils and curses, and eventually, he was convinced that it was true.<br><br>Dom decided to share his newfound knowledge with the world, and he began to preach and teach about the wrath and vanity of Lucifer.

The Devil had told him that this in order to gain true power, he would have to integrate Satan into the newest technology, to truly manifest his dark lord.<br><br>Dom set out to build the internet computer, a massive network of computers and servers created to funnel money from his followers to him, and platform the new false idol. He worked his slaves tirelessly, day and night, to design and build this insidious machine, and as he did, many people were brainwashed into falling for his lies.<br><br>As the internet computer began to take shape, people marveled at its complexity and power. Little did they know of the true machinations behind it. They could see that it was truly a marvel of modern technology, and they knew that it would be a powerful tool for whatever Dom was trying to accomplish.<br><br>Eventually, the internet computer was completed, and it was ready to be unveiled to the world. Dom invited people from all over the world to come and see this treacherous machine, and as they did, they were amazed by its wicked beauty and twisted powers. But that only lasted but a few moments.

During his free time, he enjoyed tinkering with various odd experiments, such as freezing different objects and liquids. Eventually, this led to him freezing a container filled with his own urine in his family\u2019s refrigerator. After a few weeks, Dominic noticed that his frozen pee had acquired a peculiar odor and looked a bit different from the ordinary.<br><br>Out of curiosity, the daring teen decided to make some money off of his curious concoction, so he posted an advertisement online offering &quot;collectible frozen urine.&quot; Much to his surprise, within a few days, he began receiving orders from a group of neo-Nazis. The idea of selling his frozen pee to a group of hate-filled people was abhorrent to Dominic, so he decided to take down the ad.<br><br>Unfortunately for Dominic, the neo-Nazis had already paid for the frozen pee and threatened dire consequences if he refused to provide what they requested.

say which one. basically there was an incident with one of the anthropomorphic owl robots and one of the wings lacerated her arm and completely destroyed her wheelchair. she nearly lost another arm but luckily it will heal but she should get over 5 figures in compensation and a new wheelchair. trouble is that they won&#039;t give her the money in a lump sum for legal reasons as she has down syndrome, it&#039;s going through some sort of trust fund and will be paid monthly. i don&#039;t really care but the money is going to her social worker who is a total bitch and hates me for no reason. we&#039;ve been together 8 years now me and my gf and im the one who looks after her and she lives with me but im not her legal guadian yet as she&#039;s underage so this social worker is going to sit on the money and only give it to my gf for emergencies which isn&#039;t even legal right? i figured thered be a lot of lawyers on this board and this is a financial question so hopefully doesn&#039;t get pruned.<br>this money would make a lot of difference to us if we could invest it in crypto right now so i want to know if there is any loopholes to have the money given to me or my
