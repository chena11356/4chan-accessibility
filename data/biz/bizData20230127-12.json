Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674525330036483", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1792, "h": 2688, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674528949550978, "time": 1674528949, "md5": "eQqdb8RP8r6wqVFYYE46dw==", "fsize": 1341589, "resto": 0, "id": "HlPPWoQL", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 193, "images": 72, "unique_ips": 93}, {"no": 53410434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53362323#p53362323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53362323</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674529029185211, "time": 1674529029, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410443, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:57:45", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674529065836512, "time": 1674529065, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53410417, "id": "QZ5UEoSQ", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53410452, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:58:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674529281556892, "time": 1674529281, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53410417, "id": "HlPPWoQL"}, {"no": 53410517, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:02:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

This proposal motions to design an optional randomised encryption system for developers that wish to create proposals without revealing the full code to be stolen, and revealing half of the code to show proof that the work is complete. The encryption is randomised, making it impossible for developers to intentionally release and get paid for half-finished work. The encrypted half of the proposal is revealed when payment is released to the developers, and a second voting period follows where the DAO can audit the full code and choose whether to implement it or not. This proposal has received a lot of criticism from community members who wish for developers to trust to be paid by the DAO, whilst another section of the community believes a trust-less framework such as this is fundamental to the DAO. <br>https://dscvr.one/post/9180263/moti<wbr>on-to-build-the-encrypted-bounty-sy<wbr>stem<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Latest Bread</span><br>Anons working on a frontend<br>A group is in talks with a team of devs to start work on the stablecoin protocol<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Telegram</span><br>/sns1community<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Discord</span><br>/2kgnM4cQQc<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter</span><br>twitter.com/SNS1dao<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DSCVR Portal</span><br>dscvr.one/p/sns1<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Taggr Realm</span><br>taggr.top/#/realms/sns-1<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SNS-1 OC group</span><br>oc.app/#/gttbe-dyaaa-aaaaf-a6gpa-ca<wbr>i<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Links</span><br>sneed.one", "filename": "SneedPunk2077", "ext": ".gif", "w": 424, "h": 239, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674637828572111, "time": 1674637828, "md5": "r7uJWcV2hD62K9APM8vRIw==", "fsize": 3084878, "resto": 0, "id": "FPVh8FeR", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sneed-sns1-general-6-sneedpunk-edition", "replies": 98, "images": 23, "unique_ips": 44}, {"no": 53428342, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:13:21", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1674352081556727", "ext": ".gif", "w": 231, "h": 209, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1674638001683482, "time": 1674638001, "md5": "6QfodxTOvJ3OJfX3ykds0g==", "fsize": 4019723, "resto": 53428329, "id": "9RV2mxmH"}, {"no": 53428369, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53428329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53428329</a><br>It&#039;s quiet, sneed bros.

That professor is Silvio Micali and that blockchain is Algorand. Pure Proof of Stake is non-dilutive and actually allows for all nodes to get a chance at participating in consensus without concentrating the supply of ALGO into the hands of a few whales. Smart contracts time out and pay for storage by locking up ALGO so gas is unnecessary, fees are a formality to prevent spam. all transactions are final the instant that their block is confirmed, and blocks consistently confirm every 4-5 seconds, with a long series of upgrades on the development pipeline. It is a statistical impossibility for Algorand to fork. Once the currently slow and gradual release of ALGO ends around 2030, Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) will actually make ALGO deflationary since 1) in order for a wallet to interact with any ASA, it must \u201copt-in\u201d to it with a transaction, and 2) for each ASA a wallet is opted in to, that wallet must hold 0.1 ALGO.

The arbitrage opportunities are not going to be 5x. The idea is USTC\u2019s peg is \u201cfloating\u201d in the sense it has minor fluctuations around whatever value it is pegged to. The arbitrage opportunity is created when USTC floats above its pegged value thereby incentivizing swapping out of LUNC to profit from USTC floating above peg. Swapping out LUNC has an added benefit in that enough swaps will push the USTC price back down to the pegged value (as people sell their USTC). In the pre-crash environment, the inverse was also true; people would swap out UST for LUNA when UST floated below peg. It was a nifty little trick that generated a lot of value and arguably could still work. However, the new swaps will only be one way because we don\u2019t want any LUNC minted. <br><br>I think the main issue is there are lots of technical challenges with repegging USTC to any value that are out of my depth to explain.", "time": 1674752283, "resto": 53436370, "id": "RTRqMKIT"}, {"no": 53446876, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)11:59:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53444877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53444877</a><br>The irony of it all is that lunc has more volume and more interest in it.

SPY will be sub $200 and Americans will begin rushing to the banks to withdraw all their money.<br><br>Normies will be priced out and all other shitcoins become irrelevant. BTC will be sub $5,000. /biz/ will be a sea of rage wojaks except for one little green glimmer of hope. There will be no more shills no more hate. Just us vs Kenny, Bezos, Steve and the world.
