High indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) of up to 943 kPa and 57.2% indicated efficiency was achieved at 90% hydrogen energy fraction, at the expense of NOx emissions. The hydrogen injection timing directly controls the mixture condition and combustion mode. Early hydrogen injection timings exhibited premixed combustion behaviour while late injection timings produced mixing-controlled combustion, with an intermediate point reached at 40 \u00b0CA bTDC hydrogen injection timing. At 90% hydrogen energy fraction, the earlier injection timing leads to higher IMEP/efficiency but the NOx increase is inevitable due to enhanced premixed combustion. To keep the NOx increase minimal and achieve the same combustion phasing of a diesel baseline, the 40 \u00b0CA bTDC hydrogen injection timing shows the best performance at which 85.9% CO2 reduction and 13.3% IMEP/efficiency increase are achieved.", "time": 1674369765, "resto": 53376781, "id": "+7WHmKVP"}, {"no": 53384029, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:42:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/01<wbr>/charles-hugh-smith/contrarian-thou<wbr>ghts-on-the-petro-yuan-and-gold-bac<wbr>ked-currencies/<br>He covers oil and gold obviously that&#039;s in the title.

The dump which occurred around that time had already begun before the &quot;FTX&quot; news. The chart at the time looked bearish as hell, the Stoch RSI was very high and a multitude of other indicators were bearish at the time, so buyers were lacking, hence it was obvious that a dump was coming.<br><br>Events like the FTX shit function as a sieve which filters out the high IQ anons from the low IQ anons. Low IQers always latch on to the event/news and always think dumps happen due to that, and never look at the charts.<br><br>Happenings/events/news is almost always either a coincidence or - more often - a smokescreen set up for planned &quot;manipulation&quot; trading. Like for example lets say some whales want to dump the price and they KNOW some negative event is coming thanks to having insider knowledge, and so they&#039;re waiting for that happening and when it happens then they do the dump. Then normalfags just think the dump occurred due to the happening/news. Very cringe, but many such cases.<br><br>Sometimes the players involved in the dump, or pump, even cause &quot;the happening&quot; themselves. The same is done with pumps too of course, for example when BTC pumped after Elon Musk put &quot;Bitcoin&quot; in his twitter profile description text, the price most probably didn&#039;t pump only due to that. Sure, Elon doing that contributed a little bit to the price going up but most likely some whales (maybe Elon himself or some of his buddies, maybe Saylor) had planned to do a big pump to prevent the price from organically falling further due to too many sellers (in that specific moment it was actually very close to going under a critical support level), and so to cover up what would&#039;ve looked like very obvious manipulation he put Bitcoin on his twitter so everyone would think that&#039;s why it pumped.", "filename": "Stoch RSI and FTX", "ext": ".png", "w": 1316, "h": 434, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 41, "tim": 1674372756252458, "time": 1674372756, "md5": "Zvgihs8yvBi3ZP9ceYTzcg==", "fsize": 75462, "resto": 53383913, "id": "fsUe3wmB"}, {"no": 53383990, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:33:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53383943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53383943</a><br><a href=\"#p53383936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53383936</a><br>Does this look familiar ?<br><br>Don&#039;t mind my porn it helps me think when look at my graphs.", "filename": "Screen Shot 2023-01-22 at 1.31.59 AM", "ext": ".png", "w": 2876, "h": 1546, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1674372802835464, "time": 1674372802, "md5": "nfUbNQHqEv30wllxJJpoXg==", "fsize": 2260472, "resto": 53383913, "id": "EToJWRM2"}, {"no": 53384013, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:38:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53383985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53383985</a><br>Meds", "time": 1674373137, "resto": 53383913, "id": "1dQTYrl1"}, {"no": 53385501, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)07:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53383913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53383913</a><br>&quot;it has to go back down&quot;", "filename": "mmemechart", "ext": ".png", "w": 953, "h": 644, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1674390224611536, "time": 1674390224, "md5": "uCI5t/POekzUlB0D8mVlbQ==", "fsize": 562547, "resto": 53383913, "id": "TAVU2Asn"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53383643, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:33:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Whats with all the sudden Kenshi shilling?", "filename": "1235236", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 375, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1674369227719996, "time": 1674369227, "md5": "+CBogDfW27kXvseTqyzb2A==", "fsize": 40804, "resto": 0, "id": "DOqd98XO", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-with-all-the-sudden-kenshi-shilling", "replies": 6, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 53383654, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:35:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "telegram fags", "time": 1674369301, "resto": 53383643, "id": "yhmrt/iC"}, {"no": 53385095, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:22:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Actual legit project<br>tons of recent collaborations<br>and they just removed the buy/sell tax, so liquidity is on the menu boys<br>it&#039;s the chance of your life, consolidate your BNB shitcoins into it and enjoy", "time": 1674386524, "resto": 53383643, "id": "4mE80xUh"}, {"no": 53385110, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:25:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53383643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53383643</a><br>good game<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXo<wbr>24imR_54", "time": 1674386709, "resto": 53383643, "id": "YR49uwmD"}, {"no": 53385118, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:26:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53383643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53383643</a><br>Co-ordinated shilling.

There he found out about crypto, came up with a sharding consensus algo called Blockflow that he presented to Ethereum&#039;s Vitalik but when they spoke Ethereum had already decided to move to Pos. There is a podcast about this on Twitter. Anyway long story short he realizes the best and only way to leverage blockflow is to launch its own blockchain so he launches the Alephium L1. I like what Alephium has done so far, Cheng is not just smart but he is great at executing if you pay attention at what&#039;s been happening. Today with Alephium you have a pow L1 that can handle everything onchain without L2s, up to 400tps right now and even more tps with more shards. It has its own virtual machine Alfred and language Ralf. Alfred and Ralf are equally expressive but much safer than EVM and Solidity. The project seems very well funded too, they have a big team working on it full time. I think Nvidia and AMD have an interest in Alephium succeeding since it&#039;s a gpu mineable coin. This will benefit their ecosystem as Nvidia and others will gladly pour money into it to bootstrap dev activity. So as you can see there are many paths to success for Alephium from here no matter how you turn it and very few ways it could fail considering that team and devs fire on all cylinders and it&#039;s at only $2m market cap.", "filename": "TLl", "ext": ".png", "w": 1194, "h": 608, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 63, "tim": 1674356919531188, "time": 1674356919, "md5": "75wlFRjhfijos2qInFxNRQ==", "fsize": 364934, "resto": 53381107, "id": "GbyKe7Sl"}, {"no": 53382302, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)22:10:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53382198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53382198</a><br>why", "time": 1674357027, "resto": 53381107, "id": "GbyKe7Sl"}, {"no": 53383361, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:52:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53382281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53382281</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think Nvidia and AMD have an interest in Alephium succeeding since it&#039;s a gpu mineable coin.</span><br>holy shilling batman!", "time": 1674366743, "resto": 53381107, "id": "eDb9V6cb"}, {"no": 53383443, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:04:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53382281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53382281</a><br>I appreciate you taking time and effort to type up this summaries, I would be interested to hear what other anons say about this as it\u2019s the first I have heard of it", "time": 1674367479, "resto": 53381107, "id": "BTigjpF1"}, {"no": 53383460, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:06:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Looks like the only place to buy this is an exchange I\u2019m not allowed access to.", "time": 1674367580, "resto": 53381107, "id": "qSM/Mbcd"}, {"no": 53384219, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)03:29:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53381606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53381606</a><br>yeah only on that shady scamming exchange with under $10k volume. not buying your shitty bags OP", "time": 1674376145, "resto": 53381107, "id": "mz/fJiw/"}, {"no": 53384399, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53384219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53384219</a><br>I&#039;m not selling.", "time": 1674378897, "resto": 53381107, "id": "GbyKe7Sl"}, {"no": 53384459, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:31:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thanks for the bread OP<br><br>But whoever made this website should change that auto switching of the first text block (on my phone at least).", "time": 1674379874, "resto": 53381107, "id": "dE+e7vJq"}, {"no": 53384507, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:41:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can you not shill this again I wanna accumulate", "time": 1674380463, "resto": 53381107, "id": "0+LmnCBb"}, {"no": 53384581, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:55:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "explain sUTXO, how it works not how good it is", "time": 1674381301, "resto": 53381107, "id": "XmAgmRhd"}, {"no": 53384633, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)05:05:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53384581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53384581</a><br>It&#039;s a hybrid of stateful and UTXO model.

Read the top image, in Cardano you can build things with limitations because it&#039;s UTXO. In contrast, the programmability of Alephium is exactly the same as Eth&#039;s. Alephium also handles 400tps onchain, no L1s required, contrary to Eth. Also Alephium has a much safer environment for Dapps (Alfred+Ralf) compared to EVM+Solidity. This is important because democratizes development. Today to build in Ethereum you need to spend a lot for audits, because Ethereum is notorious for bugs and exploits. So only big organizations or VC funded (and approved) projects can afford to gain public&#039;s trust. Whereas in Alephium more inherent security means less need to bribe auditors to say code is good. More access to small developers or small entities to build cool stuff without being stigmatized as &quot;unsafe&quot;, You may say but how then will users know a dapp is safe on Alephium? It will be much easier because 1) you won&#039;t have nightmares that we have seen on Eth so users will be starting from a higher level of trust and 2) Ralf is much easier to review/audit so any bad code will be much easier to weed out by simple peer reviews.", "time": 1674388561, "resto": 53381107, "id": "GbyKe7Sl"}, {"no": 53385356, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)07:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Scam and marketing thread (too obvious)", "time": 1674388836, "resto": 53381107, "id": "ZPPRgSce"}, {"no": 53385428, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)07:13:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53385328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53385328</a><br>cardano is eUTXO", "time": 1674389604, "resto": 53381107, "id": "XmAgmRhd"}, {"no": 53385466, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)07:19:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53385428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53385428</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eOTXO</span><br>yes which is in the UTXO spectrum. stUTXO is a hybrid (utxo+account) that supports ETH-like mutable states so it allows to easily build dApps as powerful as on Ethereum.

And it&#039;s truly all over the place.<br>From what i remember, silver always was at 0.07ppm, and gold at around 0.004. So basically 15x rarer, which was the commonly accepted ratio used by countries for the conversion rate for so long while both still were monetary metals. Which is logical.<br><br>The first link you&#039;ll find if you type &quot;elements abundance on earth&quot; is literally a WEF link lol. Which is displaying pic related, coming from Visual Capitalist (the irony...). If you look there, they missed a 0 for gold, putting it at 0.04ppm instead of 0.004, which is a pretty big mistake, it implies silver and gold are equally rare in the earth&#039;s crust... Doesn&#039;t look very serious from the WEF to check on this. <br><br>But anyway. That&#039;s where it become confusing, the 2nd link on google : the wiki page, here they changed the earth&#039;s crust abundance of gold for one of their source, but not the other.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abund<wbr>ance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust<wbr>#cite_note-4<br><br>Both sources are dated from April 2007 (probably when the wiki entry was created) : it&#039;s Barbalance and WebElement. They tend to have pretty similar results for all the elements, but JUST for gold, Barbalance cite 0.001ppm, while WebElement says 0.003ppm.<br>Which is an abberation. Never i&#039;ve witnessed this 0.001 figure before, and iirc the commonly accepted figure always have been 0.004... Even on this very wiki page. <br><br>So why did they shadow-edit this page?

Its hard as shit to get ahead in life now, not just working 9-5 for the rest of your life. The sooner you start saving the sooner you can get ahead in life. Chainlink is a meme started by 4chan (an infamous trolling board) to lead people to financial ruin. This is NOT A JOKE. Don&#039;t let your saved wealth be thrown away over night. Vitalik Buterin the creator of ethereum said himself the days of making x100 or x1000 are over, that right the guy who created the second most popular crypto said himself those days are over. Now 4chan is trying to get people to lose even more money after the December/January bloodbath. Smart money already exited the crypto world. Crypto is basically a highly specialized database, companies don&#039;t need this. They will just create their own private blockchains. There is no need for crypto chainlink isn&#039;t even needed to run the nodes. Think XRP when you think chainlink. The company ripple (smartcontracts) is doing well but the coin XRP(chainlink) isn&#039;t even needed for the companies technology. Considering what Vitalik said &quot;The days of making x100 or x1000 returns are over.&quot; Chainlink needs a 399900% increase in price over the next couple of months to reach $1000 this is ludicrous. Don&#039;t fall for it, chainlink its a meme to fuck you over. Consider this for chainlink at current price to reach $1 you need an increase of 700% or a 233% increase every month until EOY.

Flare was built to be as close to and as simple to use as the most commonly used defi applications. They did this in order to make it seamless for users and devs to jump on and use/build things. The truth of flare, the reason it is so different than anything else is because the protocol acts as an &quot;overprotocol&quot;. Flare is natively compatible with every thing. Everything from your current bank account, to your BTC wallet. It will pick up and read any data out there and be able to use that data onchain. It has a similar system as chainlink where the FTSO providers become &quot;trusted&quot; data suppliers, which means that they have put up and locked enough collateral in case what they do is malicious, making attacks extremely expensive and nigh impossible. Everything on flare will benefit from these providers as everything becomes insured against malicious actors. The two years sucked, but I think anons will look back in a year or two and realize that if we would have gotten the drop on time, we would have fucked up the trades due to the stupid games the government has been playing.

Multichain moved 39.23M in the past 24 hours so lets use that as a starting point. That means, in order for a chain to do as much traffic on flare as it does on eth, there has to be 78.46M usd worth of flare locked up by that single bridge provider in order to meet the requirements (now this isnt 100% correct, as I dont have a breakdown of how much money is being moved at any given moment, which is what matters, but even when you break that figure down by 24 hours to get a good hourly rate, it still needs 3.26M USD worth of flare locked up if the hourly rate is stable).

Other networks have launched similar assets (deus) and have been shut down extremely fast.

But aside from this angle. It doesnt change that the team is trying to stay on the *right* side of regulation. What I mean by this is that, I dont believe the team is going to be the ones releasing the assets. They are basically going to connect everything on the backend, which will then enable to the assets to be created by a different dev (decentralized) outside of the main team. Its all about optics, its the reason we got our airdrops at a $.00 value, they are meticulously paying attention to details...the team from what I understand is also autistic as fuck and I imagine they dont want to play the usual crypto moonboy games that are played in every other discord...But either way, the way they run their discord has little bearing on how they manage the network and this point, we dont have enough info on that(although the fip1 was a bad start). <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If a chain can be shutdown by the sec its a centralized shitcoin</span><br>It wouldnt take a chain shutdown to stop an f asset.

However. While There are very underhanded things the SEC has done, they do give a few benefits (same as the CFTC, any regulatory body really), namely the safety of funds. They prosecute scams, remove them from existence, and help recover stolen funds. Many of the problems that regulatory bodies bring are mired deep in the code of law, something that has been so arcanely written that no one can understand it aside from a few sleezy lawyers. By trying to work with these regulatory bodies though, we can remove the ability for them to do harm to the space. We can cause all of the arcane laws, that are sometimes ignored, or sometimes misapplied, to instead of being done in the world of man, be done in the world of computers, in an unmutable way. Basically, rules will be defined and then ALWAYS used. If done like this, the SEC would only step in when someone creatively steps outside of these hard coded rules and attempts to scam people. They would effectively be neutered in their ability to meddle in finances.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "TimingIsEverything", "ext": ".png", "w": 1044, "h": 1376, "tn_w": 189, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674245596678027, "time": 1674245596, "md5": "yOgEvdL4Fhq0x09PyZ/pHw==", "fsize": 413734, "resto": 0, "id": "xl7/llK9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 171, "images": 52, "unique_ips": 71}, {"no": 53362347, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:14:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53341487#p53341487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53341487</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674245674099985, "time": 1674245674, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53362323, "id": "xl7/llK9"}, {"no": 53362365, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:15:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674245946149923, "time": 1674245946, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53362323, "id": "xl7/llK9"}, {"no": 53362454, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:20:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "BTC-halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674246009018185, "time": 1674246009, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53362323, "id": "xl7/llK9"}, {"no": 53362456, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:20:24", "com": "Reporting in<br>###################################<wbr>#<br>IRC - https://pastebin.com/kP1gZ1Hk <br>Education - https://pastebin.com/V0SFR8qU <br>Mining - https://pastebin.com/Rd1V8P5L <br>Nodes - https://pastebin.com/j6Vv2Xn6", "filename": "1620261867754", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1674246024513739, "time": 1674246024, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53362323, "id": "RwA+W5nG", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53362545, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:25:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STOP BUYING", "time": 1674246305, "resto": 53362323, "id": "FjICd0FA"}, {"no": 53362585, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:27:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m impressed, the general never 404s", "filename": "XMR_ANSI_CANDLE", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1674246469469582, "time": 1674246469, "md5": "j/6hx/Le3/UA2BTyQR8rwQ==", "fsize": 11609, "resto": 53362323, "id": "mArxO/cA"}, {"no": 53362692, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:34:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/biz/thread/53341487#p53353243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53353243</a><br><a href=\"/biz/thread/53341487#p53351606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53351606</a><br>Great work, is it out yet?

The one who I did know, a friend of a friend and at the time I thought was a friend, trooned out hardcore, tried raising the little boy as a TheyThem, went fully SJW-derangement from 2020 onward (getting worse and worse as their marriage crumbled) (and for the record I&#039;m kind of a left-ish guy generally) they ended up divorced, the troon goes full Scorched Earth &quot;Woman Scorned&quot; saying horrific shit about the mother (&quot;I won&#039;t tell you what happened, but it&#039;s definitely abuse&quot;) and got dunked on hard in the divorce proceedings. Struggling to hold down a job for more than 6 months at a time, couchsurfing, changed name to something even more Troony, barely sees the kid but always blasts on social media whenever they do get to see him. Ironically becomes a genuine mentally-unstable-unreliable-deadbe<wbr>at-dad. <br><br>At the time I thought it wouldn&#039;t be that bad an idea. I thought very highly of them. And the mother, as I say, was beautiful and I wouldn&#039;t have minded her bearing my child. But watching it play out, wow. Sorry that that was your experience, makes me think even better of the decision to opt out. They coulda made my life hell, especially if the Troon found out I was A Nazi(tm)", "time": 1674354069, "resto": 53379984, "id": "90LzH7VM"}, {"no": 53381917, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:23:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53381900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53381900</a><br>Also I sold TSLA on October 12th, 2019.

Because, the MSM has been claiming every year since 2014 that the Russians were going to invade Ukraine and they never did before 2022.

Around the time she did that, &quot;Dad&quot; (quotes imply a Dad-affiliated person) engaged me in a bout of the hand slapping game and he proceeded to really slap the shit out of my hands very hard. I played that game with Dad on many occasions without being hurt but &quot;Dad&quot; was really slapping the shit out of me that day and hurting the bones on the backs of my hands. Decades later when I was working with a strength and conditioning coach, we were doing speed drills and he explained to me that the way to be fast in that motion is to flex the psoas muscles. Since the psoas is right where Helene hurt me with her anal rape tool, right directly where the sharp pain exploded when she was &quot;taking my temperature&quot; with her anal thermometer several inches up my ass, I think &quot;Dad&quot; was admiring his handiwork that day, confirming that he had gotten Helene to sabotage my life by fucking my guts up. After this severe anal trauma, it became comfortable for me to wear my pants lower on my waist than someone whose guts didn&#039;t get fucked up in anal rape trauma, and that turned into years of strife with Dad always telling me to pull my pants up.<br><br>On that note, when they say saggy pants in prison means &quot;receptive to anal sex,&quot; do you think the prison elders had a meeting to determine what signal should mean that, and the chosen saggy pants from a hat? Perhaps it is more comfortable to wear them lower when someone has fucked your guts up by raping your asshole? I really cannot overstate the strife that resulted between Dad and I from high pants not being a natural thing for me, and even very many more problems in my later life can be attributed at least indirectly to the eroticism I ended up associating with anal penetration due to my childhood anal rape.
