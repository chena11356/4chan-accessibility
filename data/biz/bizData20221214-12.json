During the 1-year-long ICO people could buy HEX for ETH, Richard called it adoption amplifier. In a way, this was the main way to get HEX because the airdrops you got from holding BTC were minimal compared to the amounts you could get if you bought with ETH. But the fraud happened after the first batch of ETH came in. The contract/address that the ETH landed in was not dormant, Richard had access to it. And he literally started taking out ETH from that address and started to mint more HEX with it. He also used the ETH and HEX to wash trade up the price on uniswap. That means he faked demand and manipulated the price, but that&#039;s also not the real fraudulent thing. By recycling the same ETH over and over in the HEX ICO he basically diluted his own investors, because the amount of HEX per ETH was determined by the amount of ETH was deposited that day. And Richard&#039;s recycling diluted that by multiples. It&#039;s a complete fucking fraud, he never disclosed this could or would happen. He sold his investors a &quot;fair&quot; tokenomics and distribution beforehand, and then completely fucked the system by making an infinite printer for himself, while directly taking away HEX from investors.", "filename": "RDT_20221214_0950185261059032804772188", "ext": ".png", "w": 1887, "h": 1158, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1671011519450224, "time": 1671011519, "md5": "Su1rFCJDEJBmfSXHH4H79Q==", "fsize": 1349644, "resto": 52860701, "id": "DQ2k7+3g"}, {"no": 52861949, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)06:13:01", "name": "Vaperguy", "com": "<a href=\"#p52861085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52861085</a><br>Hello dolphin man.

Tne wealthy make money off of welfare is why. Who do you thinks owns all the housing projects? What do people on welfare spend their money on? (answer mega corp shit). Wealthy people paying for welfare is just a temporary medium of which the money eventually returns back to them, it\u2019s an illusion, it makes no difference how much they pay as they\u2019ll get it back and the super wealthy are only super wealthy in the first place because of the parasitism of the working class so in essence it\u2019s the working class that are paying for it anyways. Ultimately the more money being extracted from the middle class to welfare class enriches the elite corporate class, the portion the elite pays for welfare doesn\u2019t out weigh the benefits they get from the overall welfare state that the majority contribute to. This is why as we get more poor as the elite get more rich, they are squeezing the middle class of their value by using social programs/welfare as one of their mediums to do so, of course there is many other schemes. The understand politics one just needs to follow the flow of money to understand why elite support certain things like welfare states. Only people that have an above room temperature iq can think outside the box like this and come to the logical conclusions.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "time": 1670726547, "resto": 0, "filedeleted": 1, "id": "pC++OEQJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 246, "images": 62, "unique_ips": 100}, {"no": 52817763, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:43:38", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br>IRC- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/tzm4s<br>Aliases- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/bjbx3<br>Extras- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/daxte<br>Nodes- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/ke2k8<br>Mining- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/c7na4", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1670726618118821, "time": 1670726618, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 52817752, "id": "N03p/zlR", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 52817767, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52766664#p52766664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52766664</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1670726634737312, "time": 1670726634, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52817752, "id": "pC++OEQJ"}, {"no": 52817772, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:44:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit.

Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1670726894768796, "time": 1670726894, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52817752, "id": "pC++OEQJ"}, {"no": 52817812, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:49:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

I remember you posting about this some months back. I have about 50k laying around doing nothing and really like the idea of running my own business. Me and the wife pull in about 220k and only have 70k in expense. Use to me not working, long story but I make 6 figs now. Have about 5k a month to do whatever with. I have an IT and bar/restaurant background about a decade in each. <br><br>Please dont waste time replying to people with shitty comments and attitudes it derails the thread and doesnt do anything. I&#039;ve actually seen a guy exactly like you in my old neighborhood. Drove a giant truck around with a trailer that was always parked on street. Would have this black dude with him that was borderline homeless. His day laborer , seemed like a nice enough dude tho. <br><br>Anyways this sounds like a thing someone sort of mentors you into. Or maybe had a friend that kind of told you want to buy or start with. If I was going to try to do this I would look into IT equipment buying it up from random places. Or taking it for free. Saying I am going to recycle it. When I&#039;ll just repackage and buy whatever missing pieces it needs. Then resell it all another reseller. Trying to make connection and networking with other companies to find out who needs what seems like a huge pain in the ass. I feel like it would still be easier just to get a loan , buy a dive bar and let that collect income for me. Instead of essentially learning a new skill and becoming a salesman. But ya 250k for one year is okay, but not great compared to what my family is bringing in now and I work mostly from home tech job. I do want to have independent income that isnt reliant on an employer though. I find that very attractive in what you do. <br><br>I heard someone say, first you invest in stocks, make money.

So you may already know that AssetMantle is a layer-1 blockchain for Metaverses, Games, Interchain NFTs, Decentralised Identities(DIDs), Tokenized Real Estate, and more. However, the vision is to leverage NFTs for real-world use cases, enterprise integrations, and an interoperable Web3 ecosystem. This is a big project, and is already getting the attention of Samsung. They&#039;ve got a suite of products like MantleBuilder, which allows for a no-code custom NFT storefront, and Mantleplace which is an NFT marketplace utilizing DIDs. AssetMantle also has MantleWallet, MantleExplorer and a budding open-source infrastructure. For the more technically-savvy, they&#039;re utilizing InterNFT standard for Interchain NFTs and Tendermint consensus engine for fast finality transactions. InterNFT was first commissioned by Inter Chain Foundation(ICF) and has had Polkadot, Akash Network, Secret Network, Developers from WorldWideWebConsotrium(W3C) and several open source teams contribute since then. MNTL token is on mexc and can also be bought via the Osmosis DEX on eth and bridge with gravity.

One concern is that the network relies on a network of &quot;oracles&quot; to provide external data to smart contracts.

This could potentially compromise the security of the smart contracts that are built on the network.<br><br>Additionally, the decentralized nature of the network means that there is no central authority to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data provided by the oracles. This could lead to inconsistencies and conflicts within the network.<br><br>Another potential flaw is the scalability of the network. As the network grows and more smart contracts are built on it, the demands on the network&#039;s resources may increase, potentially leading to slower transaction times and higher fees.<br><br>Overall, while Chainlink offers a promising solution to the problem of providing external data to smart contracts, there are some potential challenges that the network may face in the future.", "time": 1670989555, "resto": 52852701, "id": "8llKpmUi"}, {"no": 52859912, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)00:20:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52855854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52855854</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bunch of useless whores hired for ESG points and paraded around by Sir Gay to please globohomo&#039;s narrative are discussing concepts they can barely understand</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1043 views after one year</span><br>Terrific success!

According to a recent study, one in every 200 Bahamians is in prison. The rate of imprisonment, at 478 per 100,000, is one of the highest in the world - almost four times that of the UK and Canada. The prison remains grossly overcrowded. Cells measuring 1 by 3 metres in the maximum security F Block for example contained 3 prisoners each. This block held prisoners in punitive isolation alongside those with mental health problems and others with communicable diseases such as TB. In near darkness, prisoners slept on cardboard in many cells. Space was further limited by two buckets \u2013 \u2018slop\u2019 bucket and a bucket for washing \u2013 with prisoners required to defecate and urinate in front of each other. The recent Prison Reform Commission highlighted four aggravating factors worsening overcrowding: lack of legal representation, high numbers on remand, lack of early-release schemes and incarceration for minor, non-violent offences, such as vagrancy. Addressing the issue of overcrowding would mean providing humane living conditions for prisoners and working conditions for staff and would also be cost effective. <br>He went from a multi billionaire to this in one (1) month", "filename": "943", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1111, "h": 597, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1670991771945035, "time": 1670991771, "md5": "AoYiLwYxSGOs0+gpjj8EDA==", "fsize": 388392, "resto": 52855960, "id": "g0Ta6ymh"}, {"no": 52859380, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:27:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52856143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52856143</a><br><br>He has classic ashkenazi features", "time": 1670992063, "resto": 52855960, "id": "ZfPHFIk/"}, {"no": 52859405, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:29:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "He\u2019s never gonna make it out that Bahamian prison alive.
