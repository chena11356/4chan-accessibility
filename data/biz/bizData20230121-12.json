The concave curvature is lacking as well. The symbols are all watermark tier and something akin to a microsoft excel doc. The uniqueness stopped existing in the mid 2000&#039;s where the era of metal craftsmanship was at a middlemen level of smelting. It was a process that had eyes come up with new and exciting designs that really were eye popping developments. When you see them now it is a pale comparison.

I think we&#039;re just going to range from 15K-45K back and forth over and over again for the next few years. There will be plenty of rallies and plenty of dumps but no single clear direction at any point, it will be a crab market. No one is calling this yet and people are just going back to the normal thinking of assuming that this is either a bull trap or the bull market is back without considering any other options. Since no one is expecting an unremarkable crab market for the foreseeable future, that&#039;s what I am now expecting.</span>", "filename": "89902342-0406-455A-8279-6792C6073168", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 738, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1674300846183244, "time": 1674300846, "md5": "e6+VTYAIrDixtjzCSZZf/g==", "fsize": 21203, "resto": 53371341, "id": "OjdYDsJR"}, {"no": 53372654, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:38:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53372597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53372597</a><br>I meant institutions like banks, saylor is more of a permabull and founder ceo, I&#039;d expect it to be different for bloated companies that cycle through mbas and have the new guy sell off the &quot;mistakes&quot; of his predecessor. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my guess is these guys hold a lot more bitcoin than you&#039;d expect, and they haven&#039;t had to sell since they still have high paying jobs</span><br>yea this is kind of concerning seems pretty likely now that you mention it", "time": 1674301136, "resto": 53371341, "id": "0EN1cCqz"}, {"no": 53372887, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:12:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53371873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53371873</a><br>already above that<br><a href=\"#p53372511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53372511</a><br>you are wrong", "filename": "1674250803827342", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 572, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1674303132384905, "time": 1674303132, "md5": "o8zlQnYZuG+/XL0I/Jb6bQ==", "fsize": 22565, "resto": 53371341, "id": "iPhf1J/V"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53350962, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:29:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Dog with bat thread.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "TimingIsEverything", "ext": ".png", "w": 1044, "h": 1376, "tn_w": 189, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674245596678027, "time": 1674245596, "md5": "yOgEvdL4Fhq0x09PyZ/pHw==", "fsize": 413734, "resto": 0, "id": "xl7/llK9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 86, "images": 35, "unique_ips": 43}, {"no": 53362347, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:14:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53341487#p53341487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53341487</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674245674099985, "time": 1674245674, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53362323, "id": "xl7/llK9"}, {"no": 53362365, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:15:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674245946149923, "time": 1674245946, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53362323, "id": "xl7/llK9"}, {"no": 53362454, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)15:20:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

That means if I lose my job tomorrow I can cut out most of my variable spending and fall back on only 30K/yr like a NEET. This is my secret sauce to my financial well-being. I do not make long-term commitments to recurring non-variable expenses. That&#039;s how no one ever has any money.

There&#039;s no point in either emotionally fighting it or pretending that it won&#039;t happen. If there is no lender of last resort in a market, this is the result of leverage + distributed risk. The reason people don&#039;t see this is that they do not see the whole system and the dependencies and other influences that events have on each individual asset (regardless of where it&#039;s held or by whom), and the effect that a change in asset-price or asset-liquidity has on those that hold that risk. In practice, a leveraged system is bound to collapse, and if that leverage is widely distributed (de facto, if not contractually), then systemic collapse is inevitable.<br>However, we should separate sentiment and supply-demand-mechanics, both drivers of trading price, from each other. In a mass default, the price is driven, at first, by forced selling, as participants try (and eventually fail) to meet their liabilities. This has an auto-effect of driving sentiment negative. As the mass defaults occur, there is already a supply shock, though initially masked by the forced selling to meet liabilities. After the forced selling is done, the supply shock can, but doesn&#039;t have to, start to drive markets, if there are unbacked, asset-denominated-liabilities left. If not, or if not in sufficient amounts to be called, the force disappears and the price can start behaving &quot;neutrally&quot; again, i.e. the force of leverage becomes non-operational. Given that price is just one data point per instant, you cannot deduce the individual forces driving it without additional information, and the view that people generally default to is that &quot;price up = asset good&quot;, &quot;price down = asset bad&quot;, even if they should rationally be happy that they can buy something valuable from someone who has to sell at any price.", "time": 1674301209, "resto": 53372339, "id": "ZcV606cr"}, {"no": 53372680, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:41:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53372666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53372666</a><br>If someone was forced to sell his gold coins at $1.2K/ounce, or even $0.5K/ounce (current market price $1.9K/ounce) because the loan shark is going to break his legs otherwise, wouldn&#039;t you happily take them?

In the 2018 bear market the vast majority of our bears predicted the 3k bottom many months in advance (want proof? here you go - here&#039;s a collection of over 60 screenshots of posts months before the 3k bottom: https://a.cockfile.com/PqhaCN.rar ) and the vast majority of our bears have predicted an 8k/9k/10k bottom for about a year now (contrary to what the paid shills will tell you). <br><br>To the newfags who aren&#039;t aware of that, see: &gt;&gt;https://warosu.org/biz/?task=sear<wbr>ch2&amp;ghost=yes&amp;search_text=bottom+10<wbr>k&amp;search_subject=&amp;search_username=&amp;<wbr>search_tripcode=&amp;search_email=&amp;sear<wbr>ch_filename=&amp;search_datefrom=2021-0<wbr>2-04&amp;search_dateto=2022-11-07&amp;searc<wbr>h_op=all&amp;search_del=dontcare&amp;search<wbr>_int=dontcare&amp;search_ord=new&amp;search<wbr>_capcode=all&amp;search_res=post<br><br>That shows posts mentioning the word bottom and 10k before the so-called &quot;FTX&quot; dump (didn&#039;t happen because of FTX). The anti-10k anons (the shills claiming 15.5k was the bottom and saying it won&#039;t go to 10k) are now claiming the 10k calls were only made after that &quot;FTX&quot; dump, which of course is totally false. Hence why the results are set to show posts before that event. Scroll down to the bottom and click on the [+24] etc buttons to view older posts. Naturally when anons say &quot;10k&quot; they also expect a small dip below that, not for the price to stop at exactly 10k, and sometimes anons said 9k and 8k and 9500 etc, and also posts like &quot;11k to 9k&quot; etc, so that search result does not show all 10k-related posts; only those saying specifically 10k.
