It&#039;s a gamble that gold will be revalued, but if it is and you can&#039;t afford to pay the high interest rates on your house, then you can sell your house and then sit on your gold until the market price adjust for them both. Considering all of us here know that the western markets are filled with fake value such as gold derivatives, banks and governments will just keep on doing what they are doing until they can&#039;t get away with it any longer.

During these times, short sellers covering their positions likely contributed to increases in GME\u2019s price. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period. Figure 6 shows that buy volume in GME, including buy volume from participants identified as having large short positions, increased significantly beginning around January 22 and remained high for several days, corresponding to the beginning of the most dramatic phase of the run-up in GME\u2019s price.&quot;", "time": 1671536213, "resto": 52946230, "id": "rRRcTdVK"}, {"no": 52947788, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:37:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947776</a><br>So you admit I am not a paid shill, just a bored /biz/ citizen?", "filename": "stages of cope", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1083, "h": 4822, "tn_w": 28, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671536249391398, "time": 1671536249, "md5": "krEexh/WdbdC1R8pVduH5A==", "fsize": 1019273, "resto": 52946230, "id": "heEbod7D"}, {"no": 52947797, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:38:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947782</a><br>First mention of naked shorts in this thread is from you, now give us some proof to support your claims faggot", "time": 1671536311, "resto": 52946230, "id": "MAteOGTw"}, {"no": 52947799, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:38:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947695</a><br>Kenny himself called us conspiracy theorists<br>https://twitter.com/citsecurities/s<wbr>tatus/1442953101061734402", "filename": "Screenshot_20221220-123729~2", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 982, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1671536323181698, "time": 1671536323, "md5": "SAZUZz8YNiP9UbAGbywMeQ==", "fsize": 173706, "resto": 52946230, "id": "IUTAJiDA"}, {"no": 52947809, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:39:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947776</a><br>BB, AMC, NOK are all just as shit as GME.", "time": 1671536395, "resto": 52946230, "id": "heEbod7D"}, {"no": 52947814, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:40:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947756</a><br>CFD- &quot;There is no delivery of physical goods or securities with CFDs.&quot;<br><br>Token -&quot;They own a derivative that is backed by actual shares.&quot;<br><br>Now that you have been proven wrong and given proof of naked shorts existing are you gonna come up with another way to be wrong?", "time": 1671536452, "resto": 52946230, "id": "symlNI1i"}, {"no": 52947819, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:41:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947788</a><br>You are either a paid shill or a fucking idiot who does it for free", "filename": "1623827530391", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 655, "h": 341, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1671536495501657, "time": 1671536495, "md5": "tVOq8gBcFoMeVFKQmSqAEg==", "fsize": 29228, "resto": 52946230, "id": "yUWSHRIc"}, {"no": 52947854, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:46:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "kek stupid dumb fuck nigger BAGGOTS<br>THIS SHIT IS N E V E R SQUEEZING AGAIN<br>STUPID BAGGIES YOU ARE GOING TO DIE POOR LIKE THE NIGGERS YOU ARE", "time": 1671536800, "resto": 52946230, "id": "zZU8NU7V"}, {"no": 52947865, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:47:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947854</a><br>You seem upset.", "filename": "1525564140793", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 639, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671536854188135, "time": 1671536854, "md5": "gDd7OuR4loMPk8e7LgDrCg==", "fsize": 1916963, "resto": 52946230, "id": "jq+e139C"}, {"no": 52947880, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:49:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52947865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52947865</a><br>Of course he\u2019s upset.

Ironically, bsv, regardless of what you think of csw, is quite fast, quite cheap (fractions of a cent) and can scale indefinitely (I believe 50000 tps have been performed on testnet). These technical specs are not anything to ignore and are actually quite impressive when compared to most other L1s. It&#039;s also worth noting that Ripple was invested in by Digital Currency Group (which was invested in by Mastercard). All very interesting stuff that&#039;s got my dot connecting going crazy as of late. Trying to figure out how it&#039;s all connected because I&#039;m now convinced that in addition to xrp there is a play here to be made with bsv. Bitfinex, after years, has all of a sudden ended margin trading for bsv officially today, though the majority of the shorts were closed back on the 12th, all at the same time, which indicates that all the open positions were bitfinex&#039;s own. This all leads me to believe that there&#039;s something coming down the line for bsv that they (bitfinex) are trying to get ahead of. Why else would they kill their own ability to short bsv into the ground after all this time? Curious what others itt think of all this.

The reality is though youll probably be sharing with 5-10 other sellers but on a listing that does 1000 a month thats fine. Ive noticed noobs love to buy toys that sell like 20 a month for a massive ROI, this isnt a bad strategy when youve got some capital but the fact is selling 20 scrub daddys at \u00a32 profit is double the money and I can guarantee Ill sell all those quicker than one thomas the tank toy.<br>My margins are 15-30% Amazon does rinse you on fees but theres literally no other free money glitch like this so its worth it. <br>I use sellerampSAS and Sellertoolkit First one for profit calc and sourcing second one for profit tracking and a few other things.

Sometimes youll have to ungate manually but once youve got decent sales youll get ungated on a lot of things just from having a decent account history. The way to get ungated in the UK is to just order 10 products from a wholesaler and send in the invoice. For example I sell a lot of groceries so i ordered a case of gummy sweets for like \u00a330 and thats the whole grocery section ungated. <br><br>SAS has you covered on sales ranks, their default filter is 25% ROI and smth like 150sales/mo and thats what id go for minimum starting out.

They also hold hella grudes. You think women are bad? They&#039;re still crying about the Holocaust and the Inquisition. Also, consider the moral implications of it. Needless to say, Jews are very morally bankrupt. I wouldn&#039;t call them evil, but they do not give a fuck about Gentiles (which you will ALWAYS be, even if your kids are Jewish) and they will be susceptible to the same shit any kids this age are - tranny groomers, drugs, sigma male bullshit (though I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be different by the time they get to that age, just try to imagine something even more fucked up ig).<br><br>tl;dr - It may or may not be.

We&#039;re probably talking 10BPs here, but the BOJ would not do this voluntarily.<br>Any variable indicating economic flow (prices, bond yields, FX pairs) moves to its equilibrium if undisturbed, i.e. if market forces are allowed to operate freely. Keeping it from its equilibrium takes resources from someone - the central bank, consumers who have to deal with shortages due to price controls, etc. If the BOJ pegs something it&#039;s pegged for 30 years less strictly, it&#039;s a good indicator that it can&#039;t peg it that tightly anymore.<br>A, to stay with the number, 10BPs move is not meaningful ordinarily, but they payoff graph of many participants has considerably steepened due to leverage over the decades, with there being a positive &quot;plateau&quot; (it has a plateau because of hedges feathering adverse market moves up to a point) and a steep drop-off on at least one side. If you go to the edges of the plateau you have hedged, you can quickly barrel into the abyss.<br>To concretize this with the YCC example: the yen had been cratering all year, and suppressing bond yields means that the BOJ has to buy bonds with newly printed yen. Less and less people want yen, so this leads to depreciation in the FX markets, though not necessarily domestic price increases (those would require a base of spenders which Japan doesn&#039;t have, unless the government starts up fiscal spending in a big way, e.g. on the navy). If the yen just starts depreciating rapidly, even without leverage in the Japanese economy, it can kick off a flight to the dollar, which will make it expensive, causing dollar shortages among dollar-debtors, mostly Third World countries. The system is largely predicated on not just the world economy slowing down, but on not a single major economy slowing down, due to the interest rate mechanics of it.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "168972789564", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1431, "h": 1106, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 193, "tim": 1671495074320435, "time": 1671495074, "md5": "FO2prahRc0zhiZPmPBQVpQ==", "fsize": 1447627, "resto": 0, "id": "f4sg7tZ4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 31, "images": 16, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 52942076, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:12:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52875586#p52875586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52875586</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671495178054615, "time": 1671495178, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942093, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671495436933397, "time": 1671495436, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942167, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:18:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

And that&#039;s only if the business even has capital to spare (which most don&#039;t), so in order to use they would have to take out a loan or get investors, but for what? Do they at least earn a yield when they stake or is it just a ticket to enter the ecosystem? Because you always have to apply at least the market interest rate to your capital, that&#039;s the rate at which you can borrow and lend money.

But when you\u2019re really good looking it makes everything easier. <br><br>I\u2019m tallish (over 6 foot) as well so that helps. <br><br>My experience has been that if you are good looking and can figure out to be on dates and take more control of that then you will get laid all the time. Some examples: 1) don\u2019t reveal more about yourself than the woman does; 2) if you have any instinct telling you to not say something, then do not say it. Veer on shyness over being unattractively revealing; 2) don\u2019t be too overly chivalrous. Obviously holding doors and getting the bill is important. But you don\u2019t need to hold cars doors, for example. This isn\u2019t 1945 and it comes off as trying too hard; 3) you don\u2019t have to be a jerk. But don\u2019t he mr. overly nice guy (this one was hard for me because I\u2019m naturally kind of real and easy going with people); 4) don\u2019t compliment women\u2019s looks unless you really think you know what you\u2019re doing (like if it\u2019s necessary for establishing attraction). But usually don\u2019t compliment their looks; and 5) get to the point that you have been on so many dates that they don\u2019t feel like a big deal to you. <br><br>After you go on tons of dates your instincts will improve and you won\u2019t see dates as a very big deal. <br><br>But also, if you get tired of getting women and genuinely become aloof, and your good looking, that\u2019s when they really start coming to you.

The cost of using Bitcoin for transactions is not necessarily determined by the block reward or the number of transactions per block. Instead, the cost of using Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand for block space. If there is a lot of demand for block space, the fees required to get a transaction included in the next block will go up. If there&#039;s less demand, fees will go down. It&#039;s also worth noting that the maximum number of transactions per block is not a fixed number and can change over time.

Anyone can make their own coin with features btc doesn\u2019t have, like anonymity or smart contracts or faster transactions. But it doesn\u2019t matter.

There will be an infinite number of cryptocurrencies, but only 21 million btc. Unless that changes, it will remain the hardest money for no other reason than because it is the first, and everything else is easy, inflationary money. They could even change the code to make it slower than it is now and it would still be the hardest money.

The issue is neither deflation nor inflation, if we take a step back, but volatility: the rate of change of money creation itself must continually increase for it to remain on track, since leverage begets leverage: the more debt you have, the quicker you get wiped if the market moves against you, like when you x100 on a shitcoin. To keep yourself capitalized as a large player, you need more and more nominal money coming in - and at some point, even that&#039;s not enough and you need the market not moving against you at all, hence interest rates (the cost of debt) must be suppressed across the whole economy.<br>However, the more debt there is, the larger the ruggable portion of the money base is, since, if you have 30% debt-to-quity, then an increase in interest rates affects only ~23% of your balance sheet. If you have 100% debt-to-equity, an increase in interest rates affects 50% of your balance sheet. Thus the money supply has to not only keep inflating, it has to keep inflating faster and faster, otherwise the system crashes deflationarily.<br>It&#039;s like driving a car with a bomb in the trunk that&#039;ll explode if you stop slowing down: your speed increases more and more, but the chances of it going to zero because you blew up due to not having been able to accelerate more or due to you crashing against a concrete pillar due to your insane speeding go up too.
