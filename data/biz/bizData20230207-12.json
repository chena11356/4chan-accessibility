By defending the obvious Criminal&#039;s behavior as &quot;Jewish&quot;, Jews themselves are planting the idea in the minds of the accusers that this criminal behavior is inherently Jewish, even when it&#039;s not. The ADL was explicitly formed to run defense of criminal Jews like Meier Lansky by running blackmail campaigns against anybody who might notice the behavior of the Kosher Nostra. They do this not by calling the accusers liars, but by insinuating that their accusations are racially motivated and have nothing to do with the behavior of the individuals. Jews eat this shit up and rush to the defense of obvious criminals by declaring their behavior inherently Jewish, and that&#039;s where actual Antisemitism comes from.<br><br>Anyway, Morgan and Schiff-Kuhn-Loeb were in league with each other and Jacob Schiff worked for the Rothschilds.<br>https://famguardian.org/PublishedAu<wbr>thors/Indiv/MullinsEustice/SecretsO<wbr>fFedReserve/Ch05.htm", "filename": "Rosenbaum Jewish", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1017, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675770315935942, "time": 1675770315, "md5": "gvbFx/wF3Vft9jX8gQ+JWw==", "fsize": 147522, "resto": 53610646, "id": "dyC8DApy"}, {"no": 53612023, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)06:45:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53611464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53611464</a><br>Damn they didn&#039;t mention which companies they were", "time": 1675770319, "resto": 53610646, "id": "eXUubd/S"}, {"no": 53612026, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)06:45:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53611950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53611950</a><br>Don&#039;t care nigger<br>You&#039;re saying fed doesn&#039;t have the mandate.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "qR5CBBA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2448, "h": 3264, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675632296838480, "time": 1675632296, "md5": "VV7a4UQAUxYJzK0m3Pd9Bw==", "fsize": 615391, "resto": 0, "id": "NFozmSdJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 76, "images": 35, "unique_ips": 50}, {"no": 53589412, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:26:53", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53546578#p53546578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546578</a>", "filename": "1653056374364", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675632413998658, "time": 1675632413, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53589386, "id": "NFozmSdJ"}, {"no": 53589428, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:27:50", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool.<br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process.

But one is for sure, if you have a bad trip on DMT there&#039;s no way out, you WILL have to go through it until the trip ends.<br>This in itself might no be bad, we know from psychedelic therapy that bad trips occur as a result of suppressed emotions and memories rising up from the unconscious that your psyche tries to suppress. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to go through the bad trip no matter what. You CAN end a bad trip by taking antipsychotics or benzodiazepines for example, but you have to account for the fact that by doing that you&#039;re not only interrupting the bad trip itself but also the digestive process of negative emotions and experiences that&#039;s taking place underneath the bad experience. This could make unprocessed suppressed emotions and experiences manifest themselves after the trip in different, often neurotic ways (e.g anxiety). <br>Tripping productively is not an easy topic and requires being well informed and prepared before you do it. But you also shouldn&#039;t overthink it. Psychs find you in life, not the other way around.

They&#039;re constantly on a nostalgia trip for an era when they were 15 and life was meaningless because a teenage boy&#039;s actions have zero consequences. A few of them still live with there parents. The ones who aren&#039;t would be better off living with their parents. At least then someone could clean up after them, something none of them seem capable of doing themselves because why mop when you could just be high. All they ever do is eat garbage, play video games, and watch capeshit movies made for idiots.<br>Every now and again they come up with some &quot;business idea&quot; (probably while high) and blow an insane amount of money on startup capital. Gumball machines, t shirts, baked goods, 3D printers, etc. They&#039;ve got loads of this shit but did they ever made any money off it?

I bridged the remaining ETH from Mainnet in Arbitrum One where I bought $1 in Arbino and sold it as a test. It told me selling my $1 was going to drive the price down 37% so I decided to not buy it. I sold my Arbinu for ETH and then bridged the Arbitrum ETH back to Mainnet via the 3rd party Stargate exchange, and then from Coinbase Wallet to Coinbase where I reconverted from ETH to SHIB. When I moved the final ETH back, Coinbase had revoked my trusted device status and it was not sending a code to my phone for 2FA until about my fifth request. Once I got everything sorted out and moved back into SHIB, I noticed I had **far** fewer tokens than I could attribute to price fluctuations and fees. I checked and saw that my final ETH transaction had come back in the right amount so something must have happened to the ETH in my Coinbase Wallet that I didn&#039;t bridge to Arbitrum.
