Full stop. They ban any and all discussion of GME, even the most threadbare of related posts, and they ban people for even discussing it. Even in the comments of einfachmans post to his personal page people are stating they&#039;ve been permanently banned from /r/WSB for just upvoting his post about the situation or commenting on it. At one point the subreddit was algorithmically assigning people as being apes whether they posted about GME there or not, like forcing Jews to wear a Star of David. Multiple moderators have &quot;&quot;&quot;jokingly&quot;&quot;&quot; bragged about being paid by citadel to restrict content posted to the subreddit relating to GME. Similar claims have been made by both OIUNF and other shills that have posted in these generals. Frankly I see only a few ways this can end, especially if reddit wants to go public with an ipo; root the fuckers out and send them to prison while letting the subreddit continue to exist, or forever wear the mark of shame that was letting a major financial institution manipulate sentiment there. Which I&#039;m sure would just go over great with the general userbase, which is very fond of that sort of chicanery.

It didn\u2019t collapse organically you can decide for yourself why it happened. Most people speculate an attack from FTX, Black Rock, or inside sabotage by Do Kwon or even a mixture. FTX was afraid of the competition, Black Rock didn\u2019t like the idea of an enclosed finical system they couldn\u2019t control, and Do Kwon has made comments alluding to a crash of LUNA along with assets and wallets he could take control of after the crash. Either way a quantum mint happened and it crashed LUNA from $115 ATH to under 0.0000X. Millions of dollars turned into thousands and Redditor\u2019s life savings were lost in an instant. Some call it the largest loss of wealth in history, people were destroyed and many committed suicide. During the aftermath people were lost on what to do and different sides started arguing. Ultimately Do Kwon decided on a fork against the advice of CZ who wanted to just burn the supply. Do Kwon basically jumped ship and left the old chain up for grabs. This is why we have LUNC and TUNA today, two fighting nation states like North and South Korea. A divide that shows more blood the closer you examine.<br><br>LUNC was going to be listed alongside TUNA on basically every exchange. This needed to happen because Do Kwon wanted an airdrop to pre-crash wallets. The problem was Do Kwon needed LUNC to die because all its liquidity and attention belonged to TUNA, but having it on every exchange just drew more attention and gave hope for its revival. The hope drew in the shorters trying to kill the baby phoenix. This was the first big shakeout it was a literal poo-op of stinky linkies telling people to sell and buy LINK and MATIC instead. This eventually passed when a group of rebel devs, who work for free, wanted to revitalize the chain.

To make matters worse it was exposed that the rebels got compromised because they were pre-crash baggies. At first they wanted to mint more LUNC to create USTN, a stable but not technically a stable coin, to airdrop to crash victims as a sacrifice. Then they wanted to hand over all governance to 9 people who get paid $60k+ a year to destroy the coin.<br><br>It turned out GCR didn\u2019t have unlimited money because it turned out SBF was stealing customer funds. This lead to a bank run of FTX causing GCR to admit LUNA wouldn\u2019t die by his hand again. This silver lining in the chaos from the FTX crash just made everyone involved shorting LUNC more desperate. Eventually the rebels went dark after paying discord tranny mods $150k to buy roombas and dilators.

They brushed off the claims of market manipulation as mere semantics as they claim lowering the price of LUNC was a good thing.

And tragically, in 2014, Mr Watson auctioned his Nobel Prize medal he won in 1962, stating that &quot;no-one really wants to admit I exist&quot;.<br><br>Harsh.

The PP itself isn&#039;t large enough to require the group to disclose themselves unless they already own a significant amount of shares, and if it&#039;s distributed among a group then it&#039;s even less likely. The best case scenario would be for the financing to have been taken by one single industry buyer, consequently fanning the expedited buyout hype, but I don&#039;t know if a single buyer deal would involve finder&#039;s fees like this one does. Worst case is if this PP goes to some random trading institutions, especially with the no hold. The filing states that the cash will be used for pre-production development, which could end up making Salt more attractive for buyout, already having some work put in, or for that matter could allow Salt to GIA.

In this thread we discuss buying and selling chocolate, the rising prices of cacao products, and the stacking of chocolate bars. You need at least 100 bars to not end up a chocolet when civilization collapses. The availability of chocolate will drop dramatically and the price will increase many times over. A 100g 70% purity chocolate bar is projected to more than double in price before 2024. Start stacking now!<br><br>High cacao content chocolate is storeable food. It doesn&#039;t really go bad; it can last for many decades (there are videos of people eating chocolate from WW2 that&#039;s still okay). The higher the cacao content the longer the chocolate stays good. And it remains perfectly edible and tasty even long after it begins visually deteriorating from the fresh state. Do not buy low cacao content chocolate or any chocolate with non-chocolate stuff in it, like nuts or caramel or other shit, because such stuff goes bad and ruins the chocolate bar.<br><br>Chocolate bars are a powerful barter item in the post civilizational collapse world and a powerful morale booster in times of suffering (hence why soldiers in wars are often issued chocolate), and little girls like chocolate and understand the value of it (as opposed to metals or crypto).

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1672965660054996", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 3072, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673487111853484, "time": 1673487111, "md5": "nyGVK2nQqd1x5/RNQwRwYA==", "fsize": 1397266, "resto": 0, "id": "gyDU8H+Y", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 143, "images": 53, "unique_ips": 67}, {"no": 53231154, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:33:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53181100#p53181100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53181100</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673487196611969, "time": 1673487196, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53231130, "id": "gyDU8H+Y"}, {"no": 53231168, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:34:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673487451257592, "time": 1673487451, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53231130, "id": "gyDU8H+Y"}, {"no": 53231229, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)20:38:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

But then in the same breath he says that you don&#039;t lose anything by selling now because the value of the remaining airdrop is already priced into the 4.5 cents. It&#039;s an overly simplified way to look at the inflation, to say that 1 FLR today will have the same value as 7 FLR in 30 months. The inflation concerns would be real, if everyone just dumped their airdrop each month, but now everyone will be wrapping and delegating it. Most of the airdrop isn&#039;t going to end up in circulation, so the price shouldn&#039;t drop 2-4% every month. And as the Flare network starts getting actual use, the demand will increase. Then of course there are oracle rewards and the agent liquidity pools, there&#039;s money to be made outside of just the airdrop.

So if you can surf it and never get greedy, it might make you money, it&#039;s just not the future.", "time": 1673604984, "resto": 53252034, "id": "EhJJbGmV"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53250839, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:19:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This used to be constantly in the top 20<br>What happened?", "filename": "Screenshot_20230113_081816_Firefox", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 879, "h": 926, "tn_w": 237, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1673590766361339, "time": 1673590766, "md5": "7SPsF3UNct8yeM97dzQ3fg==", "fsize": 110584, "resto": 0, "id": "own8mNTx", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "this-used-to-be-constantly-in-the-top-20", "replies": 14, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 53251091, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:56:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "it being an anus didn&#039;t help", "time": 1673593006, "resto": 53250839, "id": "bvi0IHnX"}, {"no": 53251092, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:57:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53250839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53250839</a><br>ISO20022<br><br>be patient", "filename": "xrpgraph14", "ext": ".png", "w": 2048, "h": 1558, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1673593044018674, "time": 1673593044, "md5": "AERMAqCdSy1xr8sObigRwA==", "fsize": 1537077, "resto": 53250839, "id": "dosL7n/2"}, {"no": 53251105, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:59:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53251091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53251091</a><br>Same with cardano and polkadot, they are anus coins", "time": 1673593156, "resto": 53250839, "id": "R1RzvPig"}, {"no": 53251127, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)02:03:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53250839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53250839</a><br>Coordicide didn&#039;t happen, the one thing that they promised for years", "time": 1673593419, "resto": 53250839, "id": "PEWQbKC0"}, {"no": 53251140, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)02:05:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53251092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53251092</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just wait 17999 years</span>", "time": 1673593540, "resto": 53250839, "id": "2RIyqEJF"}, {"no": 53251198, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)02:14:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53250839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53250839</a><br>more like, what didnt happened? how have these coins been around this long and made no moves of significance", "time": 1673594086, "resto": 53250839, "id": "7o/MqGV9"}, {"no": 53251218, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)02:18:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53250839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53250839</a><br>sometimes dreams are broken", "time": 1673594282, "resto": 53250839, "id": "X7vyhyGu"}, {"no": 53251255, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)02:22:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It\u2019s a flawed mess.

We concluded that, even charging some fees, the Ripple network has a higher potential to be used in IoT devices transactions. Taking into account the time rate and the network stability, we can affirm that at least for now, the Ripple network is best qualified for use on a real IoT ecosystem. Despite the fact that Iota had the highest transactions times, we consider it more viable than Ethereum, at least for now. To reduce the costs of using Ethereum, we need to start having the same instability found in Iota, with the difference that Iota is free.<br><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC8124600/", "time": 1673601714, "resto": 53250839, "id": "D/ixodt1"}, {"no": 53252138, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)04:40:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53252023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53252023</a><br>They wrote this 2 years ago and it still has aged poorly<br>No one is using XRP for IoT devices <br>Cope is strong with you rippletards", "time": 1673602844, "resto": 53250839, "id": "QYDbMRw9"}, {"no": 53252227, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)04:59:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53252138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53252138</a><br>So why has it aged poorly?<br>I don&#039;t think so.", "time": 1673603955, "resto": 53250839, "id": "D/ixodt1"}, {"no": 53252297, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:11:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53252227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53252227</a><br>once only ISO20022 coins are alive (see: <a href=\"#p53251092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53251092</a> ) it&#039;s gonna pump like crazy", "time": 1673604671, "resto": 53250839, "id": "dosL7n/2"}, {"no": 53252316, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:15:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53252227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53252227</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;14 Bi marketcap 2018</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;0,5 Bi marketcap 2022</span><br>x30 to get ATH", "time": 1673604900, "resto": 53250839, "id": "QDb0Z0qh"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53245970, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:52:02", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "BULGARIANS GETTING RAIDED", "com": "the chainlink fudders, and shorters are finally getting arrested ! holy fuck great news for chainlink", "filename": "Screenshot_20230112_235000_Brave", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 1430, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673563922163747, "time": 1673563922, "md5": "hL1dkQH9l5/fhgt+4jkZ0Q==", "fsize": 591061, "resto": 0, "id": "BJNkA5Pf", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "bulgarians-getting-raided", "replies": 25, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 19}, {"no": 53245992, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:53:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "here is the source<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://m.novinite.com/articles/21<wbr>8388/</span>", "filename": "Screenshot_20230112_234905_Brave", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 1481, "tn_w": 60, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673563987116005, "time": 1673563987, "md5": "DAYl0/rcdS+imbQMKBbzQA==", "fsize": 689920, "resto": 53245970, "id": "BJNkA5Pf"}, {"no": 53246075, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:58:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53245992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53245992</a><br><a href=\"#p53245970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53245970</a><br>Sloppy job Simeon", "time": 1673564326, "resto": 53245970, "id": "U16jNFyk"}, {"no": 53246649, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)18:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53246075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53246075</a><br>didnt you notice that the fudders are gone?", "time": 1673566712, "resto": 53245970, "id": "BJNkA5Pf"}, {"no": 53246663, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)18:39:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Who will Linkies blame their failures on now?", "time": 1673566788, "resto": 53245970, "id": "P0pX5Bv/"}, {"no": 53247019, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:06:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Lmao nice", "time": 1673568373, "resto": 53245970, "id": "SUDvv6b3"}, {"no": 53248901, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)21:47:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53247019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53247019</a><br>meme magic has true power, wagmi", "filename": "89697563", "ext": ".png", "w": 473, "h": 500, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673578020421474, "time": 1673578020, "md5": "IXp/MReOOjkBxLGWLY9IfQ==", "fsize": 8659, "resto": 53245970, "id": "BJNkA5Pf"}, {"no": 53248916, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)21:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53245970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53245970</a><br>The fat fuck is really doing it isn\u2019t he?
