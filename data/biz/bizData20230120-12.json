The 4 hourly for example is mockingly low for Bitcoin, go as low as 8H but no more. For shitcoins, maybe 4H, but if they just got released, 1H. And this is only because of the madness tied to them. If you are monitoring Bitcoin on the hourly chart, you are making a huge mistake. Zoom out and look at the percentage movements. Most of them for whatever crossover you can imagine mean nothing.

About a handful of them, maybe even 10. The best strategy in the world you could possibly think of, might end up a losing one through permanently changed conditions. You might be getting the best theoretical profitability doing so, but you also greatly increase your odds of getting REKT. Moreso, with FTX going down under and me getting REKT, I realized you should be running a formula per exchange, or if with subaccounts several per exchange. 4 exchanges allowing for margin trading at 1X (do not use more than this, it is a terrible idea) with your trading stack diversified in them will save you from the worst of it.

But then again if all you do is daily charts I guess volume is irrelevant.<br><br>The images you shared don&#039;t look like those trades are very complex at all and trades taken based entirely on daily closes is laughable.<br><br>Do you really trade these strategies with real money or just see the results with the backtest? Saying you trade for a friend sounds like BS to me. I googled your shared tradingview name and seems like your name is associated with a pretty clear scammy website.

On the two top HDMI cables, Coffee and Diamond, AudioQuest&#039;s patented Dielectric-Bias System (DBS) polarizes the insulation on the 5 primary signal pairs, providing a drop in the perceived noise floor and an increase in dynamic contrast.</span>", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 6.24.41 AM", "ext": ".png", "w": 2096, "h": 1254, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1674217564546675, "time": 1674217564, "md5": "oxalq71mOQVjNQW3BEfkUw==", "fsize": 576353, "resto": 53355227, "id": "itH0uCnp"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53352637, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:33:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Which cryptocurrency have you never regretted buying?", "filename": "hug", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 419, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 149, "tim": 1674185630971109, "time": 1674185630, "md5": "8rXV5JUh6rSr9IfiHdt7gg==", "fsize": 51018, "resto": 0, "id": "G/+yk58D", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "which-cryptocurrency-have-you-never-regretted", "replies": 83, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 79}, {"no": 53352648, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:34:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "All of them taught me something or made me money so none", "time": 1674185671, "resto": 53352637, "id": "01H9s7Xm"}, {"no": 53352650, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:34:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53352637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53352637</a><br>Bitcoin", "time": 1674185687, "resto": 53352637, "id": "kx5ozVth"}, {"no": 53352660, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:36:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "buying the internet computer opened my world up to a world beyond my computers internet", "time": 1674185761, "resto": 53352637, "id": "uFzSPuSO"}, {"no": 53352666, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:37:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53352637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53352637</a><br>Chainlink", "time": 1674185833, "resto": 53352637, "id": "uOtvQjsL"}, {"no": 53352673, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:37:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Unironically LINK", "time": 1674185864, "resto": 53352637, "id": "js/vAVge"}, {"no": 53352674, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:37:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53352637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53352637</a><br>Rocket Pool (RPL)", "time": 1674185877, "resto": 53352637, "id": "mY9xYR7O"}, {"no": 53352708, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:41:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53352650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53352650</a><br>Same", "time": 1674186095, "resto": 53352637, "id": "tC8/BrnR"}, {"no": 53352711, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:41:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve always been unlucky with cryptocurrencies, but I finally made a good profit with Penguin Dex, so Penguin Dex.

I will never have that issue because I&#039;m thrifty as fuck. Dont get me wrong, I&#039;ll spend money like I spent $400 on an espresso machine and $400 on a grinder. A waste but its the cheapest good one I could get, on sale and it will last me for years. Another example: buddy and I both got hot tubs this summer. He buys a $3k one from Costco, I find one on Craigslist give the guy $100 and my cousins $100 to help me haul it. But make sure to value your time because I had to sink in about $1k in parts to fix mine and many many man hours, but I enjoy the DIY part of things and fixing stuff so while yes I&#039;m wasting time I find it fun. Or refinishing my hardwood floors, I&#039;m wasting time but its fun for me and I wouldn&#039;t be earning money otherwise with that time.

Dont give them anything they want, give them an allowance but make them do chores for it. But do provide them clothes, I have a friend who parents in high school were like &quot;lmao, buy your own&quot;. Mine would provide us stuff but they&#039;re not just gonna give us free money to go to the movie, just basic stuff like our sports, school and living. I say sports because that was big in our house, being an athlete and they paid for all of that. Within reason, they aren&#039;t going to buy me the nice $250 hockey stick but the $80 one on sale. So its not about giving them stuff, its if they know how to handle money and the value of it. I&#039;m a very conservative guy in the sense of I try to conserve everything from my money to even soap, anything that is limited if that makes sense. If I was your son, I would be great to give money to because I would invest it and make the most of it, I wouldn&#039;t go crazy. I didn&#039;t get much help in college from my parents since they are school teachers. Thankfully I got grants so only got out of school with $5k in debt and saved during college and bought a house right out of it. Parents were gonna help with a short term $5k loan to me for the down payment but luckily had enough not to need their help. My parents help provide guidance though, like touring some homes with me and that is what I value the most is help navigating this world. <br>Its a hard question though anon, you do need to help your kids but not too much that they are wasteful and take advantage. Finding that balance is the key. I would say your first child will be very good with money but I have some cousins who are and aren&#039;t so depends. All relies on the values you teach them.

The money can disappear easily. Imagine a high earning household, maybe they make even 300K/yr. Taxes take a lot, then they&#039;re living a typical upper-middle class lifestyle. 4K/mo mortgage for a nice house, 2K/mo for two luxury car payments, 1K/mo in family health insurance premiums for 2 adults and 2 kids, 2-4K/mo for private school for the kids, another 1K/mo for food. You can imagine more expenses. Notice a lot of this are recurring non-variable expenses that you can&#039;t easily get rid of too. I make a decent amount of money myself (200K+) but my recurring non-variable expenses are maybe 2.5K/mo. Everything else I spend is variable (my total spend is normally around 3.5-4K/mo).

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1689897609245324", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674129738649703, "time": 1674129738, "md5": "HX0Owx2b/VAqcXJmp9AAUQ==", "fsize": 1575743, "resto": 0, "id": "CD6iZ/6p", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 89, "images": 31, "unique_ips": 36}, {"no": 53341495, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:03:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53277880#p53277880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53277880</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674129817517257, "time": 1674129817, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53341487, "id": "CD6iZ/6p"}, {"no": 53341501, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:04:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "DIST is better privacys token that XMR shit scam<br><br>stop sending paid FUDDERS into DIST fourm because you scared", "time": 1674129846, "resto": 53341487, "id": "TEJfnTv4"}, {"no": 53341507, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674130083435726, "time": 1674130083, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53341487, "id": "CD6iZ/6p"}, {"no": 53341540, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:09:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

I think you have a point that 86k tx/s is not gonna mean automatic adoption, but when Discript comes out, with their grants they have talked about, then it&#039;s very obviously likely to attract ADA developers that got treated as exit liquidity by IOHK.<br><br>If AZERO (which Aurem, their confidential proof of stake protocol) is anything to go off of, fees will be really slow because hotseat comittee + inexpensive hardware to validate blocks = cheap fees while still being manageable for validator node operators.<br><br>I&#039;m in, I don&#039;t care if it goes nowhere, I&#039;m happy to hear they got the CEX listing, we need more privacy coins regardless, and for once I&#039;m happy in 6 years of browsing /biz/ that there&#039;s a coin that&#039;s not poopoo. I&#039;m in the testnet group right now, and it&#039;s filled with (non-team) developers trying to build shit, so that&#039;s a good sign.

That said that CME gap at basically 20k combined with the fact that we&#039;re overbought this month means we should see a correction sooner than later.

Cash out once you obtain your wealth and obtain physical assets and a roof over your head if you do not have one. Rural is always safe. This obtaining of assets and security has to be done swiftly before your bank accounts are demolished. Not even FDIC will be able to save you. You noticed that DAVOS is shown through the mainstream media? That is because they want to let the public know what&#039;s to come. If you are able to obtain a second passport using your grandparents as ancestral proof then do so now while you can.

Tension between mine owners and union agitators led to a lockout in 1889. Many Italian immigrants arrived to cross the picket lines but eventually staged their own strike in 1894, encouraging the industry to bring in African Americans to break the strike. Relations between the races rapidly deteriorated, leading to the riot that ended the use of black strike breakers. Governor John Peter Altgeld&#039;s response to the August 4 attack on the black community by displaced Italian miners ultimately revealed his support of fellow immigrants over African Americans.[11] Another riot erupted in 1895 when recent Polish, Lithuanian, Italian, and Belgian immigrants raided the black section of town and burned, looted, and injured 14 blacks. Black victims of the riot took their attackers to court and used their status as citizens to win the case against the new immigrants.[12]", "time": 1674174318, "resto": 53350868, "id": "llFY33qv"}, {"no": 53350916, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:25:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53350883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53350883</a><br>People still eat at Applebee&#039;s?", "time": 1674174324, "resto": 53350868, "id": "fsspP8Dy"}, {"no": 53350932, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:27:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53350868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53350868</a><br>imagine how many mulatto step children you could raise in that plywood castle", "time": 1674174446, "resto": 53350868, "id": "KZthhde7"}, {"no": 53350944, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:28:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53350868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53350868</a><br>Imagine even taking restaurants into consideration like a reddit NPC.
