Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since. They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;.<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH.

It didn\u2019t collapse organically you can decide for yourself why it happened. Most people speculate an attack from FTX, blackrock or inside sabotage by Do Kwon or even a mixture. Either way a quantum mint happened and it crashed Luna from $100 to under 0. Millions of dollars turned into thousands. Some call it the largest loss of wealth in history, people were destroyed and many committed suicide. During the aftermath people were lost on what to do and different sides started arguing. Ultimately Do Kwon decided on a fork against the advice of CZ who wanted to just burn the supply. Do Kwon basically jumped ship and left the old chain up for grabs. This is why we have LUNC and TUNA today.<br><br>LUNC was going to be listed alongside TUNA on basically every exchange. This needed to happen because Do Kwon wanted an airdrop to pre crash wallets. The problem was Do Kwon needed LUNC to die because all its liquidity and attention belonged to TUNA, but having it on every exchange just drew more attention and gave hope for its revival. The hope drew in the shorters trying to kill the baby phoenix. This was the first big shakeout it was a literal poo-op telling people to sell and buy link and matic instead.<br><br>This eventually passed when a group of rebel devs, who work for free, wanted to revitalize the chain. With this break a new villain also appeared, GCR and his faggot disciples. This is where the current drama started as the rebels got compromised. At first they wanted to mint more LUNC to create USTN to airdrop to crash victims as a sacrifice. Then they want to hand over all governance to 9 people who get paid $60k+ a year to destroy the coin. Eventually all the devs lefts and the rebels are now asking to pay discord mods $150k a year.", "time": 1671862429, "resto": 53000196, "id": "J/t219Ze"}, {"no": 53000323, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:25:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "WAGMI", "time": 1671863109, "resto": 53000196, "id": "bROwL23C"}, {"no": 53000370, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:33:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "baboona luna", "time": 1671863619, "resto": 53000196, "id": "T03DzN6l"}, {"no": 53000545, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)02:09:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000196</a><br>Quick rundown on TR shutting down?

As for the future, Zaradar and Ed are putting together a team. There&#039;s a discussion on the agora forums abouts a new L1 team. There won&#039;t be a new discord and they&#039;re not going to entertain and respond to every retard that comes in with his retarded 80 IQ ideas. This is probably the best path this project could take. Zaradar, in his interview with morphine cat, said that there was way too much noise and people involved with TR and it was difficult to focus and actually fucking code without some dumbass jumping down your throat.

While many LUNC holders liked the idea of increased independence from TFL, Agora users criticized the proposal for being vague and lacking details on how the $150k would be spent specifically. The proposal passed and it was discovered that a portion of the $150k would be spent paying Discord moderators, &quot;community relations&quot; team, and other useless bloat. It was also revealed 4 out of the 12 of TR&#039;s &quot;active members&quot; were people whose primary role was Discord moderator. People called out TR for presenting a proposal that was ostensibly about developing a wallet and then using the funds to pay for things like Discord moderation and that 1/3 of their active members did not meaningfully contribute to anything to LUNCs technical development. Instead of receiving and constructively responding to the critical feedback, TR members like Rexx and ClanMudhorn acted smug about it and basically told everyone in was none of their business how TR spends the money, even though the proposal was explicitly for wallet development, and that Discord moderation was a very important job. While all of this was happening, Zaradar had already indicated he was stepping away from TR over disagreements about funding. The wallet fiasco was the final straw. Without a serious developer like Zaradar associated with TR, the community no longer has any patience for them. Ultimately,TR&#039;s fall is for the best because they were a case study of the Pareto Principle in action. Now the real developers like Big Z and Jacob Gadikian can do their thing with less noise from the Discord crowd. <br><br>Tl;dr TR burned whatever goodwill remained towards them by taking $150k from the community pool to pay Discord trannies.", "filename": "Baboona2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 927, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671868799734110, "time": 1671868799, "md5": "heViEwYRrDPj0KmnnZziZg==", "fsize": 273717, "resto": 53000196, "id": "GtG5VwhP"}, {"no": 53000779, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)03:07:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I hate to keep posting this diamond hands guy but why is no one talking about this?

Kevin raises a lot of capital. Kevin comes to his senses regarding liquidity as Luna collapses and admits the 12c price floor should probably be removed due to the low liquidity and that if a whale dumps a lot in short succession or someone margin trading gets liquidated we have the right to buy cheapies, but that they are going to place their own buy orders at 12c 9c 6c and 3c to let people know that they are interested in doing buybacks in a bear market if a whale panic sold on the illiquid book.<br>There&#039;s no way whales would be able to dump through a 3c wall with the idea that the price would eventually become zero due to too much sale pressure. 9 million euro would buy the entire circulating supply at 3c. You&#039;d get to sell low and I&#039;d get to buy low. I&#039;m happy to buy cheap and everyone else is still unhappy because XCM isn&#039;t 10 euro.

When I let her down, she crumpled on the floor and went into a fetal position and just hugged her legs to her chest and sobbed quietly. I suddenly got very aroused seeing that, so I pulled out my dick (I has actually hit puberty 12, and was hairy, balls dropped and everything functioning) and started jerking off quietly. Eventually, I started to breathe harder, and she noticed what I was doing, and she just looked at me with this look of absolute horror on her face. It was at that moment that I climaxed and sprayed probably my biggest load of cum ever all over face and chest. Then, I picked up her torn shirt from the ground, wiped off my dick and tossed it to her. I told her to clean herself up and that if she ever told anyone, I would go to her house and kill her while she slept, and that if anyone asked who hurt her, she should say a bunch of highschool kids did it.

Has anything like this ever happened before in the history of finance? Some people will cite that diamond company or dutch east india company but those we&#039;re different times, not as many people we&#039;re disseminating information and sharing it actively like we are now on multiple social medias, you can go on Twitter, 4chan &amp; the cringemines to find up to date data on the various metrics we investors of GME use to quantify how fucked the shorts are, wether it&#039;s cost to borrow, dry volume , shares sold short as a percentage of the float on a given day, and many more : we use it to confirm what we already know - shorts haven&#039;t closed and we stand to gain massively until they do. If there was a genuine hope for them to close you would see sophisticated counters to our thesis with provable data and not a herd of mouthbreathers mocking the manipulated price and denigrating the movement to directly register shares and take them outside of the pool of locatable shares to short / borrow against.

Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This takes a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant! Rather, it is only to point out that, when looking at the case at hand (i.e., ease for both back-end and front-end development), they are not the top choice.<br><br>THERE IS NO NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED DATA EXTRACTION WHEN THE DATA IS ALREADY COMING FROM DECENTRALIZED BLOCKS!!! The decentralization is only necessary in proving the data hasn\u2019t been tampered with.

It&#039;s centralized. Centralization is faster and easier than decentralization.<br>2. It evolves more rapidly. PRQ&#039;s team has already moved on to a completely new project, while GRT&#039;s team is still working its first project.<br>3. Small and scrappy. GRT has a team of dozens if not hundreds of people, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. PRQ has a small team and very little money, so it knows how to fight for its survival and relevance with limited resources.<br>4. Legality. PRQ&#039;s business confidently operates in full compliance with the law of the United Kingdom. GRT indexes the data of sanctioned smart contracts, its DAOs are incorporated in tax havens, and some of its validators run in countries of questionable diplomatic standing. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t want anyone to control it, and this is wrong.<br>5. Affordability. GRT makes its users pay fees for its services. PRQ just asks that its users hold the token for services, and sell it when they&#039;re done.<br>6. Focus. PRQ&#039;s small team is focused on lots of different projects at once. GRT is focused on one project, and it doesn&#039;t even lend NFTs.<br>7. For the common man. PRQ has lots of small customers. GRT is used by amoral global entities like Goldman Sachs and the WEF.<br>8. Economics. GRT holders have to stake to earn a worthwhile cut of fees, and risk volatility with their investments. PRQ is a real business that gets paid directly for its services without a need for frivolous nonsense like profit sharing or value accrual.<br>9. Marketing.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1640435575462", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4572, "h": 4040, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1671853920036373, "time": 1671853920, "md5": "JMG275ZjGKZZeCWMkkVD4Q==", "fsize": 3937075, "resto": 0, "id": "1U+pzxG9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 27, "images": 19, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 52999287, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:53:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52942053#p52942053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52942053</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671854022165243, "time": 1671854022, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671854353882828, "time": 1671854353, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999336, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brainlet here, is there a way to swap monero for bitcoin or vice versa, <br>pls dont laugh ):", "time": 1671854363, "resto": 52999274, "id": "Sjyu/3Jr"}, {"no": 52999339, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

It&#039;s the humanists who created the obsession of the plebs with politics.<br>So the photographs made the poor aware of what the monarchs looked like, but they still appear powerful with their gold and jew(el)s and dresses and so on.<br> Anonymous (ID: ywCbM8Un) 12/24/22(Sat)11:37:14 No.53001265<br>Chuddy.png (158 KB, 600x600) google yandex iqdb wait<br>158 KB<br><a href=\"#p53001229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53001229</a> (OP)<br> Anonymous (ID: 7Z9fY2eJ) 12/24/22(Sat)12:02:15 No.53001368<br><a href=\"#p53001229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53001229</a> (OP)<br>Thank you Dr. Chud.<br> Anonymous (ID: IYRcNgRm) 12/24/22(Sat)12:04:02 No.53001374<br><a href=\"#p53001229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53001229</a> (OP)", "filename": "nikok2", "ext": ".png", "w": 353, "h": 252, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1671882691971046, "time": 1671882691, "md5": "mhi8cjotCchbKDoATm2vAg==", "fsize": 193068, "resto": 53001229, "id": "EV5jT3OV"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 52999480, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:20:18", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/ALPH/ Alephium General", "com": "Read carefully because this is the biggest alpha that has ever been leaked in biz.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what&#039;s new in Alephium?</span><br>1. Stateful UTXO: the security with the UTXO model with the programmability of the account model for an L1 that extends on BTC&#039;s security model with the expressivity of Ethereum for a new safer standard for dapps. <br>2. Blockflow Consensus algorithm (POW &amp; UTXO): work of different shards is accumulated due to block dependencies so if an attacker wants to re-org one shard it needs to re-org all the dependencies. Thanks to blockflow no mainchain is required like in Elrond, the network remains lightweight with scale without bottlenecks.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Decentralization: full node for block validation is critical for decentralization in the long term. Unlike most new high TPS chains, Alephium&#039;s full node can be run on consumer-grade computers. The network can scale to support more businesses and more devs without relying on centralized services like INFURA.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Security</span><br>Consensus: Alephium&#039;s security model is the same as other PoW chains. It comes down to PoW vs PoS debate if we want to compare with other new high TPS chains.<br>DeFi security: stateful UTXO model + a new VM + a new DSL (Ralph) are implemented to resolve many of the dApp security issues. This is one of the most exciting parts for me.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scalability</span><br>Alephium has the first operational sharding algo with single-step cross-shard transactions capable of 400 TPS as we speak and 10k with more shards. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Kadena is doing sharding too&quot; </span><br>from user POV: cross shard transactions in Kadena require 2 steps and are difficult to carry out. This creates poor dApp UX, as users have trouble to move funds between chains to interact with dApps on different chains. In alephium it always feels like transacting in same chain thanks to Blockflow.<br>Dev POV: easier VM language Ralph compared to Kadena&#039;s Pack.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Where can I buy?</span><br>Gate<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter</span><br>https://twitter.com/alephium<br>https://twitter.com/wachmc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;investment thesis</span><br>https://pastebin.com/BMi04B6F", "filename": "Alephium", "ext": ".png", "w": 986, "h": 556, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1671855618661234, "time": 1671855618, "md5": "YSDlhqN3SOAdxB6OdkQYNw==", "fsize": 728364, "resto": 0, "id": "8RJsx+W9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "alph-alephium-general", "replies": 3, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 53001441, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:21:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "0/10 gay shit shill", "time": 1671880868, "resto": 52999480, "id": "eLQaZ1FY"}, {"no": 53001503, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:35:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53001441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53001441</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;0/10</span><br>That&#039;s the best part.

Open source, decentralized, APIs, partnerships, you name it. We&#039;d be one of the first companies in line for something like Chainlink, if the decentralized smart contract space had more value over traditional data exchanges. There&#039;s a catch though, an underlying flaw more deeply embedded in the bedrock of LINK than the very code itself.

But actual companies, businesses, and investors do not. There&#039;s an old saying you might have heard of: &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it!&quot;. The idea that any of our bosses would give us the go ahead if we approached them to put our companies valuable data in a smart contract on a cryptocurrency called Chainlink, that they&#039;ve never heard of, we&#039;d be laughed out at best and fired on the spot at worst. We already have API data buyers and providers we trust.<br>&#039;But Chainlink is trustless!&#039; I hear you cry, but is that really a good thing? Just listen to the sound of it. Businesses don&#039;t want to spend millions of dollars on something that is trustLESS, they want something trustFUL. &#039;But the reputation system!&#039;, doesn&#039;t that defeat the whole point of your coin?

Chainlink is sort of like a metaphor for their general inability to integrate with society, where they are rational and right and it&#039;s the world&#039;s fault it&#039;s so irrational and dumb..<br>These people fud because in their mind the world should have figured out LINK in 2019 at the absolute latest, but failed to, and so they&#039;ll seethe and rage at everyone and everything as a way to express this frustration.<br><br>2) People who had LINK stacks but lost them swinging, or gambling, or in a CeFi collapse, or who simply got fudded out of LINK back in 2018 and have been furious ever since. They will never buy LINK because they can&#039;t buy it at $0.30 like they had the chance to back then, and then basically rage at people continuing to hold because &quot;if I can&#039;t make it then neither can you&quot;.<br><br>3) People who try to profit off taking an oppositional position to LINK. Usually grifters like the CLCG/Honeycomb/API3 guys, or NEXO, who are charlatan fraudsters and basically parasitic animals to Chainlink just like there are many fraudster teams that are parasitic animals to ETH. They fud because muddying the waters about Chainlink lets them shill themselves, it doesn&#039;t go much deeper than that.<br><br>4) The seriously mentally ill, like Michael, who also fits in category 2) but has now made a large part of his online identity &quot;being a link fudder&quot; and can&#039;t really distance themselves from that because it&#039;s the only way they can consistently get attention online, which they crave..", "time": 1671826995, "resto": 52993951, "id": "iytFckas"}, {"no": 52995471, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)15:25:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993951</a><br>I&#039;m actually more qualified to talk about this than most anons.I&#039;m employed with a cyber-techno machinations company, I do a lot of security analyst programming type work. Open source, decentralized, APIs, partnerships, you name it. We&#039;d be one of the first companies in line for something like Chainlink, if the decentralized smart contract space had more value over traditional data exchanges. There&#039;s a catch though, an underlying flaw more deeply embedded in the bedrock of LINK than the very code itself. The flaw is with the concept, and it&#039;s this: Companies won&#039;t actually go through the hassle of trusting their data API&#039;s through crypto.<br>Now I can already hear your keyboards going frantic, but hear me out. /biz/ hates banks, and traditional data providers. But actual companies, businesses, and investors do not. There&#039;s an old saying you might have heard of: &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it!&quot;. The idea that any of our bosses would give us the go ahead if we approached them to put our companies valuable data in a smart contract on a cryptocurrency called Chainlink, that they&#039;ve never heard of, we&#039;d be laughed out at best and fired on the spot at worst. We already have API data buyers and providers we trust.<br>&#039;But Chainlink is trustless!&#039; I hear you cry, but is that really a good thing? Just listen to the sound of it. Businesses don&#039;t want to spend millions of dollars on something that is trustLESS, they want something trustFUL. &#039;But the reputation system!&#039;, doesn&#039;t that defeat the whole point of your coin? If companies only trust nodes with high reputation, what&#039;s the difference between trusting banks and data providers that already have reputation, but in real life not on a computer screen.<br>The fact is, LINK is going to share the same fate as ETH will. A lot of &#039;real world application&#039; hype, with a lot of &#039;crypto world application&#039; reality.

It&#039;s sad but it&#039;s true. Trannies won&#039;t agree with me but I could literally tell Brave was starting to warm up to the idea of promoting BAT and even market it somewhat at the tail end of the Trump admin, when we had Jay Clayton in charge at the SEC. Once old man Joe was elected SEC (including Clayton to be fair) did a 180 and the crackdown on Crypto began. True corruption.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "168972789564", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1431, "h": 1106, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 193, "tim": 1671495074320435, "time": 1671495074, "md5": "FO2prahRc0zhiZPmPBQVpQ==", "fsize": 1447627, "resto": 0, "id": "f4sg7tZ4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 307, "images": 88, "unique_ips": 119}, {"no": 52942076, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:12:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52875586#p52875586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52875586</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671495178054615, "time": 1671495178, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942093, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671495436933397, "time": 1671495436, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52942053, "id": "f4sg7tZ4"}, {"no": 52942167, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:18:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

As of right now, in all major PoW coins transaction fees make up a few percent of the total reward a miner receive after a block. Sure thing the shift won&#039;t happen tomorrow, but if Bitcoin won&#039;t address it the problem will never just solve itself. Even after the various halvings, the missing revenue was accounted for with an increase of the price of Bitcoin, not an increase in the role of transaction fees funding the network.<br>In order for the fees to fund the hashrate that Bitcoin has right now, the transaction fees need to go up 50x-100x. However, nobody would want to pay such high fees, so the amount of people that are left paying the increased transaction fees would be less, further driving up the transaction fees. L2s don&#039;t help this, because people would still need to open a channel/deposit liquidity/sign a transaction or whatever the L2 might want. The only way L2s like the LN could survive such a shift would be to start charging more routing fees to keep up and open less channels/prioritize large liquidity channels increasing centralization. Two options that are really unwanted for any L2.<br>But Bitcoin mining in general is fucked for the future. For example, if Bitcoin won&#039;t establish a bottom of 40k USD (or more to account for the increasing electricity prices and inflation) after the 2024 halving of the block reward, the already fragile hashrate will have to shrink. And the ones that will survive will likely be the corpo miners mining on cheap electricity and top of the line ASICs.<br>Alternatively, a not mentioned option is for the network&#039;s hashrate to drastically decrease, where probably some government(s) will step in to run their own miners.

It could be a lot more stable than the leveraged real estate deals you find packaged up in REITs. But the dividend yield indicates a lot of risk is being taken, probably with leverage. It&#039;s worth looking under the hood to see where the yield is coming from and then to ponder, &quot;how could this go wrong?&quot;. Although NLY has had some pretty serious capital depreciation, you would still have made positive returns from the original investment - just nowhere near the 10%+ APY, after factoring in capital depreciation.<br><br>I have no good alternative if you are looking for yields like that. Probably junk bonds, or second/third world sovereigns. Some of them will default and pay nothing back, some will default and pay maybe 70-80% back, some will payout in full.

But if FED goes back to money printing, SPY will be the better hold as JEPI will act as a lower beta SPY (selling into the pump from the bottom due to selling CC). The dividend payouts will force you to pay taxes on your gains every year. Since it&#039;s a fund the dividends may not be &quot;qualifying&quot; dividends, if that&#039;s the case they are forced to be taxed at short term capital gains (like a REIT).

The kikes will never allow it. At first it was hard trying to come to terms with this fact but I eventually came to the conclusion that the only way to be rich, is to pretend that I am rich. So one day I blurted out to my friends and family that I&#039;m very rich and have pretty much made it from crypto for some time but that I&#039;ve been keeping a low profile for obvious reasons. Then I started telling them all about RapidX, Brand Garlinghouse, babacugs, the Masonic Monetary System and how everything is connected. First, they didn&#039;t believe me. Second, every time the price of Bitcoin went up or was in the news they kept asking me about my &quot;bitcoins&quot;, &quot;how about those bitcoins going up lately anon&quot;. It was very hard dealing with this sort of double life so I just kept smiling but deep inside I was seething because the price of XRP was still .25c at that time and I had traded my BTC for more XRP the year before and here I was holding my Ripple bags while the Golden Bull Run was departing without me. Just one disaster after the next, at one point I was shorting XRP because my stack was getting smaller from all the failed longs before. Even that didn&#039;t stick as Ripple made some pathetic announcement about some bank partnership so the price shot up 5% and liquidated me. Then around Christmas the SEC news dropped and nearly brought me to complete ruin. All my longs obliterated, my net worth sunk to new lows not seen since the Great Depression and the despair was taking it&#039;s toll on my health too. In the end my friends and family all think I&#039;m the same loser so nothing has changed except now I&#039;m also known as that &quot;weird bitcoin guy&quot;. I don&#039;t know how much longer I can keep this charade going and I don&#039;t think it even worked. What should I do now? I know as soon as I sell the price shoots to $2k.", "time": 1671819487, "resto": 52951636, "id": "PDXrPbq4"}, {"no": 52994124, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)13:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52994110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52994110</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what should I do now?</span><br>Update the pasta, it\u2019s almost Christmas again.", "time": 1671819600, "resto": 52951636, "id": "Bm1j7a0N"}, {"no": 52994448, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)13:53:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Let&#039;s pump it, goys, goys, goys!<br>2k sats EOY, if we&#039;re naughty!<br><br>Do you goys think Mellon and Babaduck will burn in hell for lying to us and constanly moving goalposts?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2018: XRP $589+ </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; moon iminent, this is the year, Van Jester said so</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; real price december EOY: 0.36 USD</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; ETH december EOY: 131 USD</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2020: XRP $2k EOY</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; moon this year for sure, mellon and babacuck said so</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; real price december EOY: 0.21 USD</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; ETH december EOY: 746 USD</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2021: XRP $2k - $33k EOY</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; this year for sure sure</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; real price December: 0.80 USD</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; ETH price December: 4000 USD</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2022: XRP 55k</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Babacuck says so, he&#039;s never wrong</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I can finally sn33d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2 more weeks</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; trust the plan</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; you have no idea what is coming</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; here&#039;s how trump can still win</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Trump will peg XRP to gold and win the election by a landslide</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go away, newfag!

The problem is it left interest rates too low for too long. It already expanded the money supply so much that we haven\u2019t even had enough price increases to catch up with the previous expansion of the money supply. So, even if [the money supply] is growing more slowly now, it doesn\u2019t matter. There is so much inflation already in the pipeline. And the only thing that was keeping our inflation rate lower was the fact that the dollar was rising when everybody thought the Fed would quit hiking. But now that the dollar is falling, that is going to add fuel to the inflation fire. I think it\u2019s going to burn a lot hotter in 2023. But the economy is going to cool off even more as inflation heats up, and that is a no-win situation for the Fed, and for the country, unfortunately.\u201d</span>", "filename": "Canned-food-and-shotguns", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 281, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671747279405495, "time": 1671747279, "md5": "4fhzfQyF/zxyHBxtk3SFjg==", "fsize": 55126, "resto": 52942680, "id": "vxOE+LGf"}, {"no": 52985139, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)18:20:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52982426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52982426</a><br>How have you lost money on oil?
