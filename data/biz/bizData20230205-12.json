Program Highlights Ten holes totaling approximately 1,200 meters have been proposed to test the main mineralized zones at the Project\u2019s Boston Mine patent and Montgomery Tunnel, as well as historical Induced Polarization (IP) anomalies. \u2022 Boston Mine patent \u2013 4 holes will test historic mineralization including reported historic ore in the mine shaft at a depth of 90 feet grading 2,880 grams per tonne silver (g/t Ag), 25.7 g/t gold (Au) and 3.2% copper (Cu). An additional report stated that there was a six-inch vein at this same depth that assayed 10,885 g/t Ag (ie: more than 1%). These reports are not compliant with NI 43-101 reporting standards and all numbers quoted should be considered as historic. \u2022 Montgomery Tunnel \u2013 three (3) holes will be drilled under and adjacent to the Montgomery Tunnel, where numerous high grade surface samples with abundant visible gold (VG) have been collected. Channel samples taken by Masivo personnel have returned 29.5 g/t Au and 169 g/t Ag over 3 feet and 3.3 g/t Au, 89.8 g/t Ag and 3.1% Cu over 10 feet. \u2022 IP anomalies - At least three holes are planned to test historical IP anomalies that are interpreted to reflect sulfide mineralization that is part of the skarn geology. Based upon the results, a decision will be made as to expanding the IP survey over the rest of the property. Brian Brewer, the Qualified Person for Masivo, stated, \u201cWe are very pleased to take another step in our exploration of the past producing Boston and Montgomery Mines project.

The most popular theory proposes that people migrated from Eurasia across Beringia, a land bridge that connected Siberia to present-day Alaska, and then spread southward throughout the Americas over subsequent generations.[32] The 2021 findings of fossilized human footprints in relict lake sediments near White Sands National Park in New Mexico suggests human presence dating back to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between 18,000 and 26,000 years ago.[33][34][35] This age is based on a well-constrained stratigraphic record and radiocarbon dating of seeds in the sediments. Pre-LGM migration across Beringia has also been proposed to explain purported pre-LGM ages of archaeological sites in the Americas such as Bluefish Caves[36][37] in the Yukon Territory, and Meadowcroft Rock Shelter in Pennsylvania.[38][39]<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativ<wbr>e_Americans_in_the_United_States<br>Go back to Europe, fat boy.", "filename": "75fb8e971972dffe76bf55fd438a4a02_original", "ext": ".png", "w": 1552, "h": 873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675535690114100, "time": 1675535690, "md5": "nZrXC9WRrTLlqE+a+mqyQQ==", "fsize": 1885965, "resto": 53574935, "id": "czVLivll"}, {"no": 53575667, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)13:36:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53575641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53575641</a><br><br>He was an actual nymphomaniac.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1674261391277545", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2176, "h": 3200, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675363740444426, "time": 1675363740, "md5": "YrMEeTOm/GlA4k4iCLs2nw==", "fsize": 1488978, "resto": 0, "id": "2frkKXYE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 273, "images": 102, "unique_ips": 88}, {"no": 53546656, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53479388#p53479388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479388</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675363983473723, "time": 1675363983, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53546578, "id": "29Gt0B4s"}, {"no": 53546680, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:54:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

Instantly.<br>Now imagine a new Seraphis transaction appears with 128 ring members. But because &quot;muh pruning&quot; anyone could tell that a UTXO was spent, literally just match it with the ring members and anyone could tell which transaction was spent. And thus ring signatures are completely useless. This is why key images exist in the first place, to tell that a UTXO hasn&#039;t been used before, WITHOUT revealing which one is being used, so &quot;pruning properly&quot; would mean a complete abandonment of Monero&#039;s untraceability.<br>And I do not see how, zk-proofs for input proofs would solve this, as that&#039;s basically a ring signature on the entire set of transactions, if you reveal which one can be discarded, which is essential in order to &quot;properly prune&quot; anonymity is lost.<br><br>What you can do for pruning is to only store needed hashes and not data, however that still relies to trust the other nodes to, you know, not fake/misreport the hashes. This is what SegWit is doing btw, there is no cryptographic guarantee that after you&#039;ve discarded the &quot;prunable&quot; witness data that the hash is correct.", "time": 1675516120, "resto": 53546578, "id": "Tx9Yuxx6"}, {"no": 53572732, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:11:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53572714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53572714</a><br>no pruning is to prune spent txos that are not part of the utxo set and outputs that can&#039;t be spent are pruned from the utxo set as well but that&#039;s a different thing.", "time": 1675516274, "resto": 53546578, "id": "K+2arDGq"}, {"no": 53572753, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:15:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53572682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53572682</a><br>Yes it is, the critique of zcash is not what they do but how they do it.", "time": 1675516517, "resto": 53546578, "id": "HCzpYN9d"}, {"no": 53572756, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:16:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53572732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53572732</a><br>but in bitcoin pruning mostly means just fucking pruning blocks or only the witness data. bitcoin has a utxo set that can be looked up without needing to look up the blockchain. it can also be assumed from others by simply asking people you trust what is the digest of their utxo set and compare it with the one you got. a person could never guess the sha256 of what you have, so you know it&#039;s fine if it&#039;s a match.<br><br>basically the database is the utxo set, it has no witness data, and the transaction log is the blockchain which is completely discardable.", "time": 1675516586, "resto": 53546578, "id": "K+2arDGq"}, {"no": 53572761, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:17:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53572753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53572753</a><br>i don&#039;t see how you could put everyone into a single ring without a centralized coordinator. these type of things don&#039;t really scale.", "time": 1675516652, "resto": 53546578, "id": "K+2arDGq"}, {"no": 53572796, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:23:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53572761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53572761</a><br>it is already possible.<br>an RSA accumulator does exactly that, it only needs a group of unknown order, which in this case is the trusted setup.<br>Generating groups of unknown order is active research and there are promising ways to do this.<br>Another thing which already works is Ochard with Halo2.

Instead of looking for unicorn women/blacks/hispanics that can code well, why not just overstaff the HR with women? or maybe create some overly specific managing positions that are not really necessary? or maybe a manager of managers? or even better,why not just create an entire made up sector so you can shove a bunch of diversity hires in it?<br><br>Of course all that requires extra money at the expense of efficiency and productivy so this strategy is only &quot;sustainable&quot; during a booming economy because investors don&#039;t care much about profit and safeness because they&#039;re all gambling on the stock market like degenerates. <br><br>Problem is,a booming economy causes inflation to get out of control in the long run so the fed eventually has to come in to try to cause a recession.
