That would be retarded and it&#039;s not like they can deceive any of the big investors with that document either.<br>Like I already said the PEA is simply coming out earlier and it&#039;s naturally pushed because it&#039;s the first official document about the resource and allows for the offers to come in. It&#039;s cleat they&#039;re trying to cause a bidding war with it.<br>FS is the one that clarifies things and allows for proper financing and could be the point where offers actually come in, which is my guess about how things are going to play out.

Then I apply an EMA Cloud facial masque which I leave on for 1 minute while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use a Renko shave lotion with little or no divergence, because divergence dries your face out and makes you look older. Then a Hash Ribbon, then a Moving Average eye balm followed by a final moisturizing stoploss lotion. There is an idea of a Heiken Ashi. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me.

Is there a level of taxation where it is no more consistent?</span><br>Taxes are never, at no level of taxation, consistent with individual freedom and property rights. Taxes are theft. The thieves \u2014 the state and its agents and allies \u2014 try their very best to conceal this fact, of course, but there is simply no way around it. Obviously, taxes are not normal, voluntary payments for goods and services, because you are not allowed to stop such payments if you are not satisfied with the product. You are not punished if you do no longer buy Renault cars or Chanel perfume, but you are thrown into jail if you stop paying for government schools or universities or for Mr. Sarkozy and his pomp. Nor is it possible to construe taxes as normal rent-payments, as they are made by a renter to his landlord. Because the French state is not the landlord of all of France and all Frenchmen. To be the landlord, the French state would have to be able to prove two things: first, that the state, and no one else, owns every inch of France, and second, that it has a rental contract with every single Frenchman concerning the use, and the price for this use, of its property. No state \u2014 not the French, not the German, not the US-American or any other state \u2014 can prove this. They have no documents to this effect and they cannot present any rental contract. Thus, there is only one conclusion: taxation is theft and robbery by which one segment of the population, the ruling class, enriches itself at the expense of another, the ruled.<br>1/9", "filename": "1660461365307316", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1727, "tn_w": 173, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674968768190645, "time": 1674968768, "md5": "U0tYuK5mkymmmlpoD+Tcfg==", "fsize": 250397, "resto": 0, "id": "qI+PIDEt", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "taxation-is-theft", "replies": 29, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 19}, {"no": 53479633, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:06:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479630</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it wrong not to pay taxes?</span><br>Given that taxes are theft, i.e., a moral \u201cwrong,\u201d it cannot be wrong to refuse to pay thieves or to lie to them regarding one\u2019s taxable income or assets.

The \u201cbest,\u201d because lowest tax is a head or poll tax, where every person pays the same absolute amount of taxes. Since even the poorest person must be able to pay this amount, such a tax must be low. But even a head tax is still theft, and there is nothing \u201cfair\u201d about it. A head tax does not treat everyone equally and installs \u201cequality before the law.\u201d For something happens with the tax revenue. The salaries of all state employees and dependents (like pensioners and welfare recipients) are paid out of tax revenue, for instance. Accordingly, state employees and dependents pay no taxes at all. Rather, their entire net-income (after payment of their head tax) comes out of tax-payments and they are thus (on net) tax-consumers living off income and wealth stolen from others: the tax-producers.

But that is hardly surprising. Almost all professional philosophers nowadays are tax-consumers. They do not produce any goods or services that they sell on the market to voluntarily buying or not-buying philosophy-consumers. As a matter of fact, as judged by actual consumer demand, the work of most contemporary philosophers must be considered worthless. Rather: Nearly all philosophers today are paid out of taxes. They live off money stolen or confiscated from others. If your livelihood depends on taxes you will likely not oppose the institution of taxation on principal grounds. Of course this is not necessarily the case. Our \u201cconsciousness\u201d is not determined by our \u201cSein,\u201d a la Marx. However, any such opposition is not very likely. Indeed, as most \u201cintellectuals,\u201d philosophers typically suffer from an over-inflated ego. They believe to do work of great importance and resent the fact that \u201csociety\u201d does not compensate them accordingly. Hence, if the issue of taxation is not simply ignored by them, philosophers have been at the forefront of coming up with tortured attempts of justifying taxes \u2014 of masquerading theft as something \u201cgood\u201d \u2014 and in particular their own, tax-funded philosopher salaries.<br>4/9", "time": 1674968855, "resto": 53479630, "id": "qI+PIDEt"}, {"no": 53479653, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:08:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479640</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Should philosophers consider the economic efficiency of taxation methods, simultaneously with its ethical values?</span><br>In order to speak of an action as \u201cefficient,\u201d it is necessary that we first define a purpose, i.e., a goal or an end. Something can be judged as efficient or inefficient only in light of a goal that is assumed as given. It is the task of economists and so-called \u201cpositive economics\u201d to determine, which measures are effective (or ineffective) in bringing about a given end. For instance, if you want to bring about mass unemployment, then economics tells you that it is efficient to raise minimum wages to, let us say, 100 Euros per hour. On the other hand, if it is your goal to minimize unemployment, then economics informs you that all minimum wage laws should be abolished. But economists qua economists have nothing to say about the permissibility or desirability of the goals in question. This is the task of the philosopher: to determine which goals are just and permissible and which goals are not. (The economist then informs the philosopher which means are efficient or inefficient, in order to reach such justifiable goals.)<br>5/9", "time": 1674968918, "resto": 53479630, "id": "qI+PIDEt"}, {"no": 53479655, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:09:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479630</a><br><a href=\"#p53479633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479633</a><br><a href=\"#p53479640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479640</a><br>I AM GOING TO ASSASSINATE YOU", "time": 1674968942, "resto": 53479630, "id": "G8X5U4le"}, {"no": 53479658, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:09:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "*BRAAAPPPPP* exits", "time": 1674968962, "resto": 53479630, "id": "jAwd87nF"}, {"no": 53479663, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:09:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479653</a><br>But as I already indicated: the philosophy profession simply has not done its job. Philosophers give plenty of advice about what to do or not to do, of course, but their advice carries little or no intellectual weight. In almost all cases, it is mere opinion: expression of personal tastes, nothing more. If you implore about the \u201ctheory of justice,\u201d from which their recommendations supposedly follow, they have no such theory. They can offer only some ad-hoc collection of personal value judgments, which typically does not even fulfill the requirement of internal consistency.<br><br>Any theory of justice worth its salt must recognize first the most fundamental fact of human life: the scarcity of goods, i.e., the absence of super-abundance. For only because of scarcity is it possible that people can have conflicts which each other: I want to do x with a given, scarce resource, and you want to do y with the very same resource. Without conflicts, there would be no need for rules or norms; and the purpose of norms then is conflict-avoidance. In the absence of a pre-stabilized harmony of all interests, conflicts can be avoided only, if all scarce resources are owned privately, i.e., by one identifiable owner rather than, and at the exclusion of, another. And in order to avoid conflict from the beginning of mankind on, so to speak, any theory of justice must begin with a norm regulating the first, original appropriation of scarce resources as private property.<br><br>Most of contemporary (political) philosophy seems to be unaware of any of this. Indeed, I often have the impression that not even the fact of scarcity itself is recognized or fully comprehended.<br>6/9", "time": 1674968979, "resto": 53479630, "id": "qI+PIDEt"}, {"no": 53479671, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:10:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "based hhh poster", "time": 1674969011, "resto": 53479630, "id": "PSbONKVJ"}, {"no": 53479678, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:10:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479663</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What, then, should be the goal of tax policy? Redistribution? Equality? To diminish poverty?</span><br>If taxes are theft, then, from the point of view of justice, there should be no taxes and no tax policy at all. Every discussion about the goals of tax policy and tax reform is a discussion among thieves or advocates of theft, who do not care about justice. They care about theft. There is debate and dispute among them about who should be taxed and how high and what is to be done with the taxes, i.e., who should get how much of the stolen loot. But all thieves and all beneficiaries of theft tend to agree on one thing: the greater the amount of loot and the lower the cost of collecting it, the better are things for them. In fact, this is what all Western democracies practice today: to choose tax rates and forms of taxation, which maximize tax revenue. All current discussions about tax reform, in France, in Germany, in the US and elsewhere: discussions about whether certain forms of taxes such as wealth and inheritance taxes should be introduced or abolished, whether income should be taxed progressively or proportionally, whether capital gains should be taxed as income or not, whether or not indirect taxes such as the VAT should be substituted for direct taxes, etc. etc., and whether the rates of these taxes then should be raised or cut \u2014 they are never discussions about justice. They are not motivated by any principled opposition to taxation, but by the desire to make taxation more efficient, i.e., to maximize tax revenue. Every tax reform that is not, at a minimum, \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d is considered a failure. And only reforms that increase tax revenue are deemed a \u201csuccess.\u201d<br><br>I must ask again: How can anyone consider this \u201cfair?\u201d Of course, from the point of view of tax-consumers this is all \u201cgood.\u201d But from the viewpoint of tax-producers, i.e., of those who actually pay taxes, it is certainly not \u201cgood,\u201d but \u201cworse than bad.\u201d<br>7/9", "time": 1674969041, "resto": 53479630, "id": "qI+PIDEt"}, {"no": 53479685, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:11:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53479678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53479678</a><br>One last remark on the economic effects of taxation: Every tax is a redistribution of wealth and income. Wealth and income is forcibly taken from their owners and producers and transferred to people who did not own this wealth and did not produce this income. The future accumulation of wealth and the production of income are thus discouraged and the confiscation and consumption of existing wealth and income is encouraged. As a result, society will be poorer. And as for the effect of the eternally popular, egalitarian proposal of taxing the \u201crich\u201d to give to the \u201cpoor\u201d in particular: Such a scheme does not reduce or alleviate poverty but, quite to the contrary, it increases poverty. It reduces the incentive to stay or become rich and be productive, and it increases the incentive to stay or become poor and be un-productive.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Should rich people be treated differently than poor people?</span><br>Every person, rich or poor, should be treated the same before the law. There are rich people, who are rich without having defrauded or stolen from anyone. They are rich, because they have worked hard, they have saved diligently, they have been productive, and they have shown entrepreneurial ingenuity, often for several family-generations. Such people should not only be left alone, but they should be praised as heroes. And there are rich people, mostly from the class of political leaders in control of the state-apparatus and from the state-connected elites of banking and big business, who are rich, because they have been directly engaged in, or indirectly benefitted from, confiscation, theft, trickery and fraud. Such people should not be left alone, but instead be condemned and despised as gangsters. The same applies to poor people. There are poor people, who are honest people, and therefore should be left alone. They may not be heroes, but they deserve our respect. And there are poor people who are crooks, and who should be treated as crooks, regardless of their \u201cpoverty.\u201d<br>9/9", "time": 1674969102, "resto": 53479630, "id": "qI+PIDEt"}, {"no": 53479731, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:17:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "giga based", "time": 1674969470, "resto": 53479630, "id": "AUeBbiVB"}, {"no": 53479744, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:19:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "&quot;But muh roads&quot; said the statist. <br><br>Taxation is theft and has no social utility because it&#039;s based on theft.

If you actually look at the history of money, basically you&#039;&#039;ll find that money is whatever the ruling authority says money is.

These days silver and gold are just commodities like any other, used in various industrial processes and silicon chips, that is what they are used for.<br><br>Although it&#039;s wrong to suggest that silver/gold has NEVER been a good investment. During certain inflationary shocks we&#039;ve seen gold become a very good investment. But these periods never last long.

The cases, keys, and items, all have real monetary value and can be sold freely on the Steam Community Market or traded with other steam users. Now, the keys have an always set value of 2.49, because the supply is unlimited and on demand, but the cases and weapons fluctate based on the randomness of the item drop and unboxing system. The weapons are not relevant in the scheme however, just cases. You see each of these cases is treated like any other commodity with its own supply and demand, and as the game ages, the older cases become less common seen here:(https://www.csgodatabase.com/<wbr>cases/). Prime drops are most common, rare less common and discontinued no longer drop. We will just focus on prime, non-prime and rare. Nowadays, cases are rarely .03 USD anymore so this has diminished returns, but it can still easily 10x or 20x within a multi-year time frame. For example the Chroma Case. I bought almost a thousand of these in 2019 for around 5 cents. They are worth now almost 1.41 USD and increase in value every day. That is almost a 30x increase on a simple 50 dollar investment. I have diversified with many cases that were at the time .03 cents or slightly above and every single one in 2-3 years has 20-30x in value, better than almost any stock or security. A simple 500 dollar investment could become almost 15,000 USD with pretty much zero risk at all. That is another important thing to remember, these cases have almost ZERO risk. There is not a single instance of any of them trending downward in value. The only thing that could affect price is the downfall of the game, which will not happen for a long time. Now that you know the method you might be asking &quot;okay, but how do I sell these for real money? Isnt the money locked in the steam economy now?&quot; No. There are multiple methods.

Once you have these funds, buy a stable asset like a CSGO case key at 2.49 a pop in the same value, and find a dealer online who buys keys on bulk through paypal or crypto.

I read some premium article on ZH that explained how the Treasury&#039;s &quot;extraordinary debt ceiling aversion measures&quot; are going to act like a new form of QE in the market. I zealously follow the correlation the Fed balance sheet and the SP500, and my earlier analysis had shown that shit should have started to hit the fan in the spring with QT nuking the market. This article, however, dissected what was happening with the different accounts in the Fed balance as pertains the Fed&#039;s extraordinary measures and it showed that the QT is going to effectively stop even though the top line balance will continue to decrease. This is due to the Treasury draining its &quot;treasury general account&quot; at the Fed as a way to tide the government over until it can start selling Treasury notes to run up the debt more. I think it is no surprise (NO SURPRISE!!!) that the Fed&#039;s QT schedule lines up with the Treasury&#039;s debt ceiling aversion spending at the exact time where I was predicting market catastrophe. Since the start of the treasury general account dump is so weel timed to where I expected the market to crash, I think they have something big up their sleeve which is the object of this premeditation.

Really if you are not street smart enough to know the numbers already you are unlikely to succeed at this. Also NEVER jew anyone on a weed deal, always &quot;hook them up&quot; which means weigh their bag at least a few points higher than the price. The reason you do this is so that the customer becomes loyal and always comes back. People are highly likely to find another dealer if you jew it even by a few points of a gram. Never, EVER sell shitty weed or try to jew it in any way whatsoever. You will have bad consequences. The goal is to be able to give the highest value for the money the customer is giving you in any business venture. You are trying to mess with the numbers to position yourself to be able to provide more value. I had a friend who was very good at selling weed and he ended up just drastically lowering his prices and undercutting everyone in town. He was very good at hiding stuff from the police though. His best trick was to wear boxer-briefs and if the police pulled him over he would hide his illegal stuff in the little pouch in the front of the boxer briefs. Or if you are wearing regular boxers by cutting a hole in the front so you could hide something in there. That trick works 100% of the time in my experience and I have used it too.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "Dec2022", "ext": ".png", "w": 881, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 227, "tim": 1674967153121325, "time": 1674967153, "md5": "ag5BhOXv0T0piQrOMS12vQ==", "fsize": 261950, "resto": 0, "id": "GYt1JLiW", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 23, "images": 18, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 53479405, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53410417#p53410417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53410417</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674967234895521, "time": 1674967234, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53479388, "id": "GYt1JLiW"}, {"no": 53479406, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:40:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "comfiest hold", "filename": "anonymous psycho", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1107, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967238375027, "time": 1674967238, "md5": "FdGA/H8bh56WZ2bMRMIHkA==", "fsize": 286689, "resto": 53479388, "id": "/Ar04N/D"}, {"no": 53479417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Growing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of a Monero-only standard are what guarantee that when the Crypto Casino finally implodes Monero will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero. Monero&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed that the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die Monero will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it?

It has temporarily subsided but will have several melt up legs followed by draw down legs, just like the 1970s. Push inflation has peaked and women\u2019s value will now come back down thanks to AI advancements in pornography. High interest rates will be the norm in this new paradigm and companies that used cheap debt to higher knowledge workers will either not exist in this paradigm or will higher fewer workers, drastically reduce the demand for software developers, human resource employees, project managers, and all sorts of other related \u201ccomputer\u201d positions. House prices will also gradually fall as high interest rates and stagnant wages make it impossible to afford the house prices that were seen in 2021. Similarly, population decline will place a downward pressure on house prices.
