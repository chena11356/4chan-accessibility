Again, if you go back to the remarks I began with, I think if you go far enough back and look at certain types of texts, for example, the Hermetica, okay? And read them without the standard academic approach with metaphysics eyeglasses on, and read them rather as a topologist--as a mathematician\u2014would read these texts, or as even a materials engineer, you know, might read these texts, what pops out of these things is a profound metaphor of a physical medium that creates information, and that\u2019s a very modern idea. In fact, it\u2019s so modern, you know, it starts popping up in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and begins to kind of spread from there. All of this stuff is popping out of the Soviet Union.<br><br>So in other words, way back when\u2014if we go back to the Hermetica\u2014here we\u2019re dealing with a text approximately, oh give or take, you know, 2,000 years old, so in others words... But it\u2019s an Egyptian text even though it\u2019s written in Greek. Its provenance is clearly Egyptian, okay? So this is very old and yet it contains this profoundly sophisticated physics metaphor.<br><br>That\u2019s what really popped out at me, you know, when I was reading these texts. It wasn\u2019t that I was supposed to be looking and seeing Platonic Universals, you know, the chair-of-all-chairs and the horse-of-all-horses. No. None of that was what was popping out at me. What Plato\u2019s talking about is topology. He\u2019s talking about common surfaces with common forms, okay? So I\u2019m looking at this, and then I\u2019m looking at the Nazis, and they\u2019re coming up with these theories essentially in the \u201920s and \u201930s that are looking at the physical medium as an engineer-able reality. In other words, in a certain sense, as an information-creating medium. So... And again, the key to creating stable information is rotation, okay?

Well this guy\u2019s name is Karl Maria Wiligut. Okay? He has a number of aliases that he wrote esoteric treatises under. But his basic conception is that the whole universe arises out of a tension between two counter-rotating spirals which create the \u201cWorld Egg\u201d. Okay?<br><br>And when I saw that I thought: Oh boy! Because of course in the Bell, you know\u2014which I rationalize as basically a kind of hyper-dimensional torsion physics device\u2014you\u2019ve got these two counter-rotating drums into which they\u2019re putting this high-density liquid, which I think may have even incorporated an isomer as one of its components. And of course an isomer is one of these high-spin isotopes, that if you de-excite it, it will release massive amounts of energy.<br><br>Well, you\u2019ve got these two counter-rotating drums, and I\u2019m thinking: Well, here\u2019s the physics that they\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ve got these two counter-rotating things. And over here, Himmler\u2019s Rasputin is saying: Well, this is all coming out of two counter-rotating systems. You know? So I think, clearly, you had an ideological culture in the SS that, rather than inhibiting scientific progress, really kind of forced them to pursue all of this higher-dimensional physics.<br><br>BR: It actually gave them an inspirational boost.<br><br>JF: Yes. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, the kind of... the final nail in the coffin, as far as I\u2019m concerned is, if you look at the swastika itself, you know, and view that as not so much the corporate logo of the Nazi Party but as an ideogram of this whole physics idea...", "time": 1672812551, "resto": 53097031, "id": "YOWy2WnD"}, {"no": 53127214, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)01:11:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Let\u2019s assume the project\u2019s underway when the Nazis take power.

He corresponded with the Austrian physicist, Thirring. You know, the Lense-Thirring Effect. Satellite drag and all this, you know.

Mom was a drug user, and her boyfriend was a drunk and a crack head. When he was like 16 or 17, he caught his mom&#039;s boyfriend choking his mother out while he was tweaked out so he ended up grabbing a machete and cutting off the guys arm, no joke, there were police reports supporting it. He did 2.5 years for it because he was a minor and because he was defending his mom. Then he got out, got into drugs, and took the police on a high speed chase, attacked a police officer, and broke a police officers arm. So now he has to wear a tether and has to go to see a judge this week. Nobody will hire the kid for obvious reasons but I will because lol why not? He&#039;s a good kid that wants to keep his nose clean but needs a job to pay off all the court fees. Hes very respectful and militant about his work.

I don&#039;t think these kids have ever been shown kindness in their lives, and I don&#039;t judge people because I simply don&#039;t care what you&#039;ve done in the past. I&#039;m always kind to everyone that works for me and they&#039;ve all kind of been shocked by the fact that I&#039;m not a monster trying to take advantage of me, so I kind of think they look up to me now. I&#039;ve told them all that I don&#039;t want to do this anymore and they all control their own destiny with the business. If we close, great. If we don&#039;t, great.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "PimpHand", "ext": ".png", "w": 961, "h": 999, "tn_w": 240, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672398550412929, "time": 1672398550, "md5": "wjrnsq7UPwnatHvBo8meng==", "fsize": 798594, "resto": 0, "id": "3CYHBxFm", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 288, "images": 74, "unique_ips": 118}, {"no": 53070970, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:10:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52999274#p52999274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999274</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672398647970535, "time": 1672398647, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53070979, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672398907889153, "time": 1672398907, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53071009, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:16:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Memes aside the country has a real charm especially when you get out of Tokyo itself, the smaller cities are pretty wonderful. I went in the beginning of 2020 before all the COVID bullshit kicked off and got the train(s) from Tokyo to Sapporo to stay for a few days. For someone who hadn\u2019t ever experienced winter in a proper northern hemisphere city that\u2019s blanketed with snow drifts as tall as your waist, it was pretty magnificent. One of the best memories I have is just walking about Sapporo city and the parks at night. I will admit I think it\u2019s a better travel destination as a solo individual or as a couple though, it\u2019s an oddly melancholic country with a feel that would be difficult to appreciate as a kid IMO.<br><br>Do you have kids? If so they might find smaller places a bit boring. Possibly better off sticking around the larger cities because there\u2019s more to do that would appeal to them. Disneyland, for example.<br><br>Also for the sex pests here, claims of Nip women being easy to get laid with are dubious at best in my experience. Maybe if you go to Roppongi where they\u2019re actively looking for white guys. But anywhere else you would need to have a half decent handle on the language and at least be conversational.

They draw the entirety of their modern culture from niggers. They post sassy gifs about niggers. They watch sportsball in worship of niggers. Their biggest event of the year involves throwing parties in honor of niggers playing sports. They use nigger slang like &quot;bruh&quot; and &quot;thot&quot;. When you say &quot;Martin Luther&quot; they&#039;re not thinking of the father of protestantism. They&#039;re thinking of the nigger. Their cities are completely overrun with niggers. They worship their ZOGbot police force disproportionately filled with niggers and their global police force of soldiers filled with niggers. Their men sit around watching nigger ball while their women sit around watching nigger talk shows. They worship niggers like Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson and the late Eddie Murphy while attacking the whites who actually built their country before niggers took over. Their movies are filled with niggers and their music charts are topped by niggers. They send niggers to the Olympics and celebrate when the niggers win because those niggers are true red blooded american niggers. They watch nigger porn to a point where &quot;BBC&quot; does not make them think of an international media company but about nigger penises instead. They will tell you how much they hate niggers and how the mutt&#039;s law meme is a stale joke and they are just pretending to love niggers but the evidence speaks for itself in that America has always been and will be a nation of nigger loving niggers&#039;</span>", "time": 1672776568, "resto": 53116963, "id": "j0AmzcwA"}, {"no": 53121883, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)15:11:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53118030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53118030</a><br><a href=\"#p53118903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53118903</a><br>kek", "time": 1672776678, "resto": 53116963, "id": "85wrJY/m"}, {"no": 53121889, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)15:11:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53120573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53120573</a><br>nonsequitur<br>pepes and hitler are based, women don&#039;t mind<br>soijaks look pathetic and repulsive", "time": 1672776711, "resto": 53116963, "id": "RDNIFvbM"}, {"no": 53121907, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)15:13:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53121866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53121866</a><br>I would be hilariously if she posts stuff like that, but i think she learns about the memes from her whatsapp colleague group", "time": 1672776808, "resto": 53116963, "id": "M8wuK9XW"}, {"no": 53123515, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:30:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53120692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53120692</a><br>Well that was a disappointing cop-out.

Have you ever wondered about the financial scam behind the popular chainlink coffee company? Well, today we\u2019re going to reveal the truth. <br><br>It all starts with a \u201cloyalty program\u201d that promotes customers to purchase more coffee. What customers don\u2019t know is that the program is designed to force them to keep buying coffee. Chainlink is designed to lock customers into a cycle of buying more coffee in order to get rewards points. <br><br>Not only that, but the rewards points don\u2019t even add up. Chainlink customers are losing out on the value of their rewards points by having to buy an increasingly high amount of coffee to get the same rewards. <br><br>What\u2019s worse is that the coffee itself isn\u2019t even that great.

GRT<br><br>1. Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This takes a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant!
