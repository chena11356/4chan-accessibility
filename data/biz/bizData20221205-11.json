Once SNS-1 acquires BTC the DAO will officially become eternal. Eventually the DAO will control assets from any and every chain. SNS-1 Will be the first natively cross chain cryptocurrency all-in-one organization to exist in crypto history. The SNS-1 Will become so powerful there will be no volume for the tokens on the secondary market - the holders will control the most powerful Blockchain entity to ever exist, and no amount of money other than the highest elite level cryptocurrency users will be able to obtain voting rights.<br><br>90% of biz has been priced out in mere days. You think ICP launched too high? SNS-1 launched too low. unbelievably low. you will not buy, and you will miss the most obvious opportunity of your lifetime", "filename": "1669680520445040", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 967, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 188, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670246230221055, "time": 1670246230, "md5": "NaLC2tcdZ7LT+kJJmX90pA==", "fsize": 229170, "resto": 0, "id": "JN9phxeg", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sns1-will-hold-btc-natively-on-the-bitcoin", "replies": 5, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 52740981, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:23:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52740927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52740927</a><br>Reminder that one entity botted 1377 tokens and they still haven\u2019t been unlocked hence these threads", "time": 1670246587, "resto": 52740927, "id": "7Clfeuhs"}, {"no": 52741016, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:27:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52740981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52740981</a><br>1377 tokens botted means 50% of this is unlocked, and 50% are locked. the evidence does not point to these 1377 being owned by one user, but 5.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "EnrageGlowies", "ext": ".png", "w": 746, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669942884426025, "time": 1669942884, "md5": "0//XNa1vGR9Earld8FtvaQ==", "fsize": 120798, "resto": 0, "id": "huUyLv/4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 225, "images": 82, "omitted_posts": 220, "omitted_images": 78, "last_replies": [{"no": 52741819, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:53:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I just finished downloading the full chain and my wallet is synced/daemon is running.

Employers need a way to identify that you&#039;re in the upper 50% in conscientiousness, that you&#039;ll stick to a task for three years, so they ask if you have a degree. So everyone rushes to university, and university makes the degrees more expensive to pay for therapists and gold plated sports teams. Which makes the product worse, since the whole point is to prove that you can stick to it for three years without a therapist. So now you have to stay for 5 years instead of 3 because paying $100k has ensured that too many lazy retards are have the 3y credential. And so on until everyone is spending their entire youth signaling that they&#039;re more dedicated than their peers before they can get a job.
