But I\u2019ve been talked out of it.<br>However, I currently bought an acre in Uganda and am getting it ploughed and planted to produce coffee. <br>It is not profitable yet, but it doesn\u2019t cost me that much either.<br>Selling goods for more than you bought them will always be profitable, but there are ethical ramifications for our actions so I\u2019m putting the CAT6 termination idea on hold.<br>If you have an ethical idea that is good and helps the world, don\u2019t be worried about if it\u2019s profitable, it will work out if you\u2019re making the world better. I don\u2019t think terminating CAT6 cables is ethical, even if I buy the Nepali workers a nice office with AC, TV, and let them smoke pot all day as long as they make 10 cables per hour. <br>We live in a capitalistic world and sadly it\u2019s hard to make the world better ethically.", "time": 1672486850, "resto": 53083057, "id": "8uKHJhdF"}, {"no": 53083185, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)06:41:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53083120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53083120</a><br>how illegal is it to sell replicas.

Looks like an absolute recipe for face plant disaster.<br><br>You can put together a fairly feisty ebike for not a lot if you get one of the volimart hub kits. I&#039;m using one of the chey&#039;nese triangular shapes frame batteries. I think it&#039;s 52v. People have abused the hubs loads. Even though they&#039;re spexificied for 48v and 1kw or 1.5, turns out you can whomp quite a bit more through them. 1 to 1.5kw is definitely where it&#039;s at for a hub and actual practicality. I can out accelerate cars and it&#039;ll do about 25mph purely on the throttle over 15 miles but I usually go slower than that because I&#039;ve fallen off a normal pedal bike at about 25 and it&#039;s not fun, neither is getting blasted in face with the wind rush. It&#039;s not necessary a lot of the time in town because the average speed is lower anyway, but it&#039;s good for getting round constrictions and up hills quicker.<br><br>I&#039;ve seen a lot of kids on scooters. Some of those are fairly bad ass specs wise.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "PimpHand", "ext": ".png", "w": 961, "h": 999, "tn_w": 240, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672398550412929, "time": 1672398550, "md5": "wjrnsq7UPwnatHvBo8meng==", "fsize": 798594, "resto": 0, "id": "3CYHBxFm", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 84, "images": 22, "unique_ips": 37}, {"no": 53070970, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:10:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52999274#p52999274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999274</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672398647970535, "time": 1672398647, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53070979, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672398907889153, "time": 1672398907, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53070955, "id": "3CYHBxFm"}, {"no": 53071009, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:16:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

I.e., not just &quot;foreign currencies.&quot; SPQR traced the creation of XRP to a Rothschild holding company working in concert with the NSA. It also appears that Bitcoin has the same source, and was floated to create widespread adoption, and to coopt anti-banker sentiment. SPQR got spooked and quit, but their videos are still up,.last I looked. If you own 5k XRP you will be the one percent - of those who survive the culling that&#039;s taking place in this era.

The video details the activities of a Silicon Valley CEO, Richard Grayson, and claims that he is a member of the Shadow Token organization and is in possession of powerful assets and information that would prove pivotal in their plot. It is said that Grayson&#039;s company has been linked to the mysterious cryptocurrency project and his ties with the Shadow Token could potentially expose their plans.<br><br>Given the recent surge in public interest in cryptocurrency and anonymous postings on the dark web, it is likely that the FBI will be looking into the claims made by the anonymous source further. Meanwhile, Richard Grayson has denied involvement with the Shadow Token and has publicly denounced the claims made against him.

Normies who have overpriced houses will just refuse to sell at a loss and will live in their house instead of buying a new one. Most home buyers already own a home that was refinanced at a sub 3% rate, they are not gonna sell their current place to buy an even more expensive home at 6%. Inventory is also really fucking low. All the higher rates do is freeze the market, they will have very little impact on prices. The only reason housing crashed in \u201807 was that everyone had ARMs so their own payments skyrocketed as rates increased which led to foreclosures and forced selling. These days everyone has a locked in mortgage that will never become more expensive, and there is zero incentive to sell. My current house has a 1900 PITI payment at a 2.25% 30 year fixed mortgage but it would rent out for $2800. I will never sell it due to how cheap my borrowing costs are, I will keep it and rent it out if I ever move to a bigger place. NOBODY is going to voluntarily sell if they are underwater on their current house, this alone keeps prices high.
