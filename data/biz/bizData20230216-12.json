I have a bunch of different heavy industry pages followed online, a number of them are out of Russia / China, its fun to see the odd gear they post as &quot;new production&quot; or &quot;wholesale from factory&quot;. Almost all of their heavy equipment for mining are direct rip offs of CAT, SANDVIC, Wagner Mining, equipment but they are well over 10 years behind the current models.

Your only solution is having an other call, having an other promise how we will do it better next time etc. Don&#039;t compare yourself to Docters, Lauwers etc. Compare yourself to bureaucrats at local government.", "filename": "19vcz0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 450, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676535893427212, "time": 1676535893, "md5": "xyiJWHAHFuBdoT7c+hhWNQ==", "fsize": 73973, "resto": 53730400, "id": "V2F/OT8g"}, {"no": 53731867, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)03:26:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53730400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53730400</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fully remote 6 figures complaining</span><br>Lol cringe larp", "time": 1676535994, "resto": 53730400, "id": "rTjQIBG2"}, {"no": 53731874, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)03:28:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53730400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53730400</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;((()))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bolt ons</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;post wall</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a whole host of std&#039;s</span><br><br>would not", "time": 1676536094, "resto": 53730400, "id": "IwzMab1m"}, {"no": 53732434, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:12:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53730432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53730432</a><br>It&#039;s not worth being alive at age 46 without a family and having worked your youth away.

The globe is walking away from the dollar system, and as beneficiaries of a $700BN trade deficit, all of the inflation absorbing measures of exporting inflation to foreign central banks as well as consuming massive amounts of goods for our dollars to chase, we will see massive amounts of economic pain that we can not stave off without the rest of the globe subsidizing our economy. There is a terrifying reckoning headed our way that pertains to the MASSIVE size of the bond market that is literally twice the size of the U.S. GDP. We all collectively own this trash paper in countless ways, and we all stand to suffer massive economic losses that will transcend the simpleton notion of &quot;lawl big line go up&quot;. There will be a severe contraction in available goods and no amount of government stimulus will be able to hold this thing together without a MASSIVE deleveraging event. And depending on the actions of foreigners, it is not even a guarantee that the dollar will survive.<br>Finance and accounting can not create a free lunch, and the economy has not organically grown since 1982 if you subtract out net increases in debt/leverage.

It\u2019s about honing your mind really, controlling yourself and controlling your words and emotions so you relay your messages perfectly. <br><br>You have probably done something before like accidentally sneered or flashed a gross look when talking to someone. NLP is about controlling those little things to get your ultimate message across, you want the listener to understand that you\u2019re paying attention and value them, but get across that you find what they\u2019re talking about unpleasant and want to go a different direction with the conversation.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1675439180797735", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2792, "h": 4037, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676206543268876, "time": 1676206543, "md5": "pLF/i7hFbJcVjDfuMq/aLw==", "fsize": 2232893, "resto": 0, "id": "gaig2M8k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 232, "images": 73, "unique_ips": 75}, {"no": 53679958, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53589386#p53589386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53589386</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1676206623747923, "time": 1676206623, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53679954, "id": "gaig2M8k"}, {"no": 53679963, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it? Do I have to store GBs worth of data like when running an XMR node?</span><br><br>It is literally as easy as installing an Android app and no, there are no storage requirements, the node only consumes some bandwidth.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cool, I&#039;m sold.

It was like touching your armpit or skin of raw chicken.<br>When I put my dick inside I was disappointed again. It felt like if my dick was numb. I didnt felt any structure or moisture of the pussy. On the other hand very soon I felt urge to cum.<br>I was dreaming about this for years and it made me so diappointed. I was seeing this girl once a week for two months. I thought I wil eventaully &quot;learn&quot; how to enjoy it but it was always the same shit.<br>Now I&#039;m 31yo. I had 6 different girls since then and now I have regular sex 2-3 times a week. I still dont find any joy in it.

It&#039;s not a place for political discussion in any form, you&#039;ll just get permabanned. <br><br>The worst thing about reddit is that no users even know how it works anymore. From the beginning until like 2012 or 2013, your upvotes and downvotes actually mattered. The number of upvotes you saw on a post was the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes. Then they changed it and made it &quot;fuzzy&quot; so that it didn&#039;t display the exact number of upvotes/downvotes, but an aggregate number that is based on the total number. This was ostensibly done to combat bots, but the reality is that it makes the site easier to control for admins. <br><br>It&#039;s really insane when you think about how much reddit changed in just 10 or 11 years. Back in 2012, Ron Paul was regularly upvoted to the top of reddit. Redditors were doing &quot;money bombs&quot; to fundraise for Ron Paul. Subreddits like r/fatpeoplehate were also incredibly popular at the time. The jailbait subs/porn subs and r/coontown really weren&#039;t ever big, but it was cool that reddit explicitly supported free speech and allowed those communities to exist. <br><br>After 2013 with all the Ellen Pao stuff it just became faggot tranny central station.

It was a truly great website in 2008 and 2009. It had all the best parts of Digg without the shitty parts. Great for text posts, images/memes, and even mp4 or webm video clips eventually. But that&#039;s about it, and video stuff still doesn&#039;t always work well. On a computer you need to download the extension &quot;reddit enhancement suite&quot; for the site to work properly. Personally I just think the people who work at reddit suck dick. Like, if you&#039;re living in the Bay Area, and you work at reddit (lmao), you&#039;re only there because you couldn&#039;t get a job at FAANG companies or Twitter. Working for Reddit is unironically less prestigious even than working for Uber or Doordash (on the dev/corporate side). As a result, reddit sucks. The Reddit App itself genuinely sucks. Third party apps like Reddit is Fun (RiF) are way better. <br><br>Even on a computer...going to reddit.com fucking sucks and it&#039;s practically unnavigable. You have to go to old.reddit.com just to view the site in its original configuration, which is more suited for PC usage. Basically a few years ago reddit revamped the whole site to look better on mobile, and as a result it looks like shit on a computer unless you use old.reddit<br><br>All of that just makes me think it&#039;s a shitty platform. I don&#039;t have tiktok, but it&#039;s clear that tiktok is way more addictive than reddit, and arguably has better content. And that&#039;s really the problem with reddit. It was never designed for OC. It was designed as a content aggregator. <br><br>Even funnier though is that to non-reddit using normies...it&#039;s as bad as 4chan", "time": 1676515706, "resto": 53720407, "id": "NhsdS2So"}, {"no": 53729194, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)21:51:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "4chan IPO when?", "filename": "D2CA45C8-C1AE-48EC-92DF-D7915838334F", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 798, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676515910244629, "time": 1676515910, "md5": "7xLeNqfkVmIJKUwP/UKYog==", "fsize": 178666, "resto": 53720407, "id": "WgTSaOGy"}, {"no": 53729224, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)21:55:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53729161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53729161</a><br><a href=\"#p53728957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53728957</a><br><a href=\"#p53728957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53728957</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It doesn&#039;t matter to faggot investors if that influence isn&#039;t monetized in faggoty quarterly earnings reports</span><br><br>the most hilarious aspect of this is that reddit&#039;s content moderation will ultimately be what destroys it. Just like how moderation killed old web forums whos users flocked to 4chan, reddit, and similar sites in the late 2000s in order to escape over-moderation on smaller forums. <br><br>Anything truly funny and entertaining is edgy. Anything edgy is then banned on reddit so as not to offend the masses of normies. A number of years ago there was r/incels on reddit, and it was one of the greatest subreddits of all time. It was banned and then replaced with r/braincels, which was nearly as good. <br><br>I&#039;m not an incel, though I sympathize, and both of those subreddits were extremely hilarious, with some of the funniest memes and posts I&#039;ve ever seen on the internet. The entire virgin vs chad memes were basically birthed there. That&#039;s good content. That&#039;s the kind of thing that reddit should be fostering to draw in new users and high quality creators. But instead they ban that shit. <br><br>It&#039;s no coincidence that the only edgy and interesting subreddits are those that are ostensibly mocking conservatives or right wingers. r/terriblefacebookmemes is where you go if you want redpilled content on reddit.
