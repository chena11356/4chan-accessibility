On a large enough scale, LSD, shrooms, MDMA... its all easy as fuck to produce, like most other pharmaceuticals. And psychotherapy involves a handful of well guided trips within a year or so, which generally fix a person for good. The real issue (and real money to be made) for large scale psychotherapy would be having enough psych certified trip sitters to perform the therapy sessions.<br><br>Lets say a single trip takes $10 worth of LSD/shrooms and as part of an ongoing psychotherapy you have 6 trips a year, and there are 50 million people w/ mental issues in the addressable market. $10 x 6 x 50m = $3b in revenue. Beyond treating any trauma beyond that, you&#039;ve pretty much &quot;cured&quot; the majority of your customer base and the addressable market shrinks. Lets say half are cured, and the other half repeat the treatment. Now you&#039;re down to $1.5b in revenue. Then $750m. So on. Money isn&#039;t made in producing/selling the drug.<br><br>But think about how much manpower would go into each trip session. Probably 3-5 people per session, each session lasting between 4-10 hours. Now that is fucking expensive. Whether or not you could make money on investing in something like that hinges on how the regulations are implemented. If only psych certified are allowed to run the therapy sessions, then whoever can hire the most psychs the fastest wins.

Another fact.

Merit comes on top of existence. UBI only gets you some of the way. Niggers love UBI because they can pool together rape babies and all to farm more gibs by multiplying. Good and honest folks obviously have to neuter niggers or drown the babies as you would cats in order to solve the overpopulation issue.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "qR5CBBA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2448, "h": 3264, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675632296838480, "time": 1675632296, "md5": "VV7a4UQAUxYJzK0m3Pd9Bw==", "fsize": 615391, "resto": 0, "id": "NFozmSdJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 199, "images": 75, "unique_ips": 93}, {"no": 53589412, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:26:53", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53546578#p53546578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546578</a>", "filename": "1653056374364", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675632413998658, "time": 1675632413, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53589386, "id": "NFozmSdJ"}, {"no": 53589428, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:27:50", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool.<br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it? Do I have to store GBs worth of data like when running an XMR node?</span><br><br>It is literally as easy as installing an Android app and no, there are no storage requirements, the node only consumes some bandwidth.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cool, I&#039;m sold.

The idea that any of our bosses would give us the go ahead if we approached them to put our companies valuable data in a smart contract on a cryptocurrency called Chainlink, that they&#039;ve never heard of, we&#039;d be laughed out at best and fired on the spot at worst. We already have API data buyers and providers we trust.<br>&#039;But Chainlink is trustless!&#039; I hear you cry, but is that really a good thing? Just listen to the sound of it. Businesses don&#039;t want to spend millions of dollars on something that is trustLESS, they want something trustFUL. &#039;But the reputation system!&#039;, doesn&#039;t that defeat the whole point of your coin? If companies only trust nodes with high reputation, what&#039;s the difference between trusting banks and data providers that already have reputation, but in real life not on a computer screen.<br>The fact is, LINK is going to share the same fate as ETH will. A lot of &#039;real world application&#039; hype, with a lot of &#039;crypto world application&#039; reality. Only, this billion supply coin isn&#039;t going to come close to the $1k that Etherum hit.

Its hard as shit to get ahead in life now, not just working 9-5 for the rest of your life. The sooner you start saving the sooner you can get ahead in life. Chainlink is a meme started by 4chan (an infamous trolling board) to lead people to financial ruin. This is NOT A JOKE. Don&#039;t let your saved wealth be thrown away over night. Vitalik Buterin the creator of ethereum said himself the days of making x100 or x1000 are over, that right the guy who created the second most popular crypto said himself those days are over. Now 4chan is trying to get people to lose even more money after the December/January bloodbath. Smart money already exited the crypto world. Crypto is basically a highly specialized database, companies don&#039;t need this. They will just create their own private blockchains. There is no need for crypto chainlink isn&#039;t even needed to run the nodes. Think XRP when you think chainlink. The company ripple (smartcontracts) is doing well but the coin XRP(chainlink) isn&#039;t even needed for the companies technology. Considering what Vitalik said &quot;The days of making x100 or x1000 returns are over.&quot; Chainlink needs a 399900% increase in price over the next couple of months to reach $1000 this is ludicrous. Don&#039;t fall for it, chainlink its a meme to fuck you over. Consider this for chainlink at current price to reach $1 you need an increase of 700% or a 233% increase every month until EOY.

Even the tech company I work for is completely unaware of chatGPT and how much it can help productivity. This thing literally builds basic programs for you. &quot;Build me a program where I can give you a list of currency codes and numbers and if the the currency code associated with the number is not USD, convert that number from its currency code to USD&quot; - you could literally type this and it will create a working program for you in 15 seconds whereas even the most skilled developer would take 10 minutes and closer to 30 for the average programmer after all is said and done.

Instantly, there was a flash of blue light and a wave of heat across Slotin&#039;s skin; the core had become supercritical, releasing an intense burst of neutron radiation estimated to have lasted about a half second.[6] Slotin quickly twisted his wrist, flipping the top shell to the floor. The heating of the core and shells stopped the criticality within seconds of its initiation,[16] while Slotin&#039;s reaction prevented a recurrence and ended the accident. The position of Slotin&#039;s body over the apparatus also shielded the others from much of the neutron radiation, but he received a lethal dose of 1,000 rad (10 Gy) neutron and 114 rad (1.14 Gy) gamma radiation in under a second and died nine days later from acute radiation poisoning.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The nearest person to Slotin, Graves, who was watching over Slotin&#039;s shoulder and was thus partially shielded by him, received a high but non-lethal radiation dose.
