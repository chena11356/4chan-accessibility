This thread is a very sad attempt at deflection. Let me lay it out for you: LINK was hyped up by big tech companies (Microsoft, IBM, Google) and VC firms, who invested millions of dollars into LINK based on vague promises of a technology that didn&#039;t exist and is still nowhere near completion. What makes you think LINK will actually work? How do you know LINK won&#039;t be another crypto bubble? Is LINK a good investment? Will LINK be the next Ethereum? Can LINK ever be used for something other than speculation? If LINK had no real purpose, how come Google, Microsoft, and IBM invested billions of dollars into it? If LINK has no use case, how come every single crypto exchange listed it? If LINK is just a speculative vehicle, why is every single ICO using LINK? Why did Sergey say that the first thing Link wants to do is bring banks into cryptocurrencies? Because banks don&#039;t want competition. Banks don&#039;t want competition because it destroys their control and power. And they don&#039;t care if the value goes to zero, because they already own everything.<br><br>All LINK investors are getting ripped off. They&#039;re taking money for something that has no actual value or usefulness and investing into it under false pretenses. At least with Bitcoin, Bitcoin users can verify transactions and prevent bad actors from destroying the network. With LINK, all anyone knows is that it&#039;ll be used for something someday.

Glattfelder, Stefano Battiston<br><br> The structure of the control network of transnational corporations affects global market competition and financial stability. So far, only small national samples were studied and there was no appropriate methodology to assess control globally. We present the first investigation of the architecture of the international ownership network, along with the computation of the control held by each global player. We find that transnational corporations form a giant bow-tie structure and that a large portion of control flows to a small tightly-knit core of financial institutions. This core can be seen as an economic &quot;super-entity&quot; that raises new important issues both for researchers and policy makers.", "time": 1676449902, "resto": 53716044, "id": "f47H+V2M"}, {"no": 53716215, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:31:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53716169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53716169</a><br><a href=\"#p53716155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53716155</a><br>goddammit\u2026 all the pizza places near you are closed right now\u2026", "time": 1676449912, "resto": 53716044, "id": "qS138dMV"}, {"no": 53716218, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:32:38", "name": "\u07f7", "com": "whoops haha did I click on /b/", "time": 1676449958, "resto": 53716044, "id": "goZMv4ic", "trip": "!SPIN6yJzoU"}, {"no": 53716220, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:32:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53716213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53716213</a><br>they even have a new article<br>https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2363<br><br>The Community Structure of the Global Corporate Network<br>Stefania Vitali, Stefano Battiston<br><br> We investigate the community structure of the global ownership network of transnational corporations. We find a pronounced organization in communities that cannot be explained by randomness. Despite the global character of this network, communities reflect first of all the geographical location of firms, while the industrial sector plays only a marginal role. We also analyze the network in which the nodes are the communities and the links are obtained by aggregating the links among firms belonging to pairs of communities. We analyze the network centrality of the top 50 communities and we provide the first quantitative assessment of the financial sector role in connecting the global economy.", "time": 1676449970, "resto": 53716044, "id": "f47H+V2M"}, {"no": 53716221, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:32:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53716215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53716215</a><br>Don&#039;t give up.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1675439180797735", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2792, "h": 4037, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676206543268876, "time": 1676206543, "md5": "pLF/i7hFbJcVjDfuMq/aLw==", "fsize": 2232893, "resto": 0, "id": "gaig2M8k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 195, "images": 58, "unique_ips": 64}, {"no": 53679958, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53589386#p53589386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53589386</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1676206623747923, "time": 1676206623, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53679954, "id": "gaig2M8k"}, {"no": 53679963, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it?

You shills truly want to keep LINK out of as many hands as possible.<br><br>If you\u2019re wondering where the FUD is coming from it\u2019s cause we\u2019re only months away from the release of CyberCode 2.0 testnet. As an insider, I know you folks have no idea what/the importance of CyberCode 2.0 is gonna be for LINK when the alpha releases around the end of October next year (give or take a few months) so I will spoonfeed you out of kindness of heart: <br><br>CyberCode 2.0 secures the ledger cryptographically to encode transactions at 20x magnitude of legacy infrastructure. It achieves this by taking blockchain transactions to the BbC-2022 layer and parsing them through the node network incentivized by super linear sequencing which Sergey said is very close to finish line. This activity is incentivized through semi-permeable staking allowing LINK token holders to benefit for verifying data both on main chain and Blockchain Byzantine Consensus 2022 layer. <br><br>The obvious benefits of super fast transaction speeds also brings exponential economies of scale! What this means sir is if farmer has 500 Kg cow for sale, he can put the beast to market on the blockchain to verify the weight in a trust less system faster than global SWIFT system. Soon any business who wants to stay relevant will have to buy LINK to have access to CyberCode 2.0 feature. A unique proposition. Those who don\u2019t use this system (powered by LINK) will get left behind.<br><br>Scammer motherfuckers want you to think that banks and other organizations are not currently fulling their bags with cheap LINK as we speak. DON\u2019T LET THEM WIN. If you hold more than 50 LINK right now, you already made it. Immediately when we breach the $8.50 resistance it\u2019ll be too late for you. You have been warned, sir.

I&#039;d also argue that Bitcoin or Ethereum can be used privately if you know what you are doing, and that privacy is a spectrum that falls back on the knowledge of the user, meaning these blanket bans won&#039;t really work on eliminating one crypto currency, but they will affect all of them.<br>Monero is simply digital cash.

They will temporarily bribe miners to mine on their pool by paying more than block rewards. Self interested and economically motivated miners (most hashrate) will take this deal while Bitcoin supporters will try to discourage this. They&#039;ll look for pools to collude with before and after the attack. As they have all the control of building the chain, they will decline every other miners&#039; and pools&#039; blocks. Because all rewards go to the attacker&#039;s pool it&#039;s not economically viable to keep a miner on if it&#039;s not connected to the attacker&#039;s pool. This increases their share of the hashrate and sustaining the attack becomes easier and bribing can be reduced. Bitcoin is now dead and lost all of its credibility.

If they couldn&#039;t pull it off with such a big timeframe and by having direct access to the asic manufacturers, what that means is that no one country will ever have majority. Bitcoin has been around for many years now and too many nations are interested in it now.

Monetary economies are a phenomenon of humans, specifically a phenomenon of our high degree of sociality. It is arguable that monetary economies start in bride prices, because there is anthropological and archeological evidence that early forms of exchange around &quot;money-like&quot; objects was a means of gatekeeping adulthood and familial relations. Powerful people would demand objects as a &quot;price&quot; for marriage, and they would possess the objects. Cowrie shells served this purpose for some coastal people, because they were very dangerous to dive for so they had two uses. They were scarce, so the powerful men could accrue the cowrie shells and control marriages and lucrative familial alliances, and they could culturally disseminate the idea that possessing cowrie shells was a sign of strength because they were dangerous to dive for. You could either dive for cowrie shells as a youth looking to marry, or you could earn them from the powerful men. <br><br>Another thing to note is that even in some of the earliest writings about money it was perceived that money was primarily commensurating people, it serves a social function. Aristotle said money was a way to commensurate the differences between different people. Money made it possible for people of different social strata and positions to meet at the interstices of their roles. The land owning aristocrat could meet the urban craftsman and come to agreements mediated by money, but the equality of the money was (and is) actually key to perpetuating the inequality of each social role.", "time": 1676427466, "resto": 53710055, "id": "oQLjfE7B"}, {"no": 53713692, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)21:22:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53713491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53713491</a><br>Machines still require money to buy, service and run.

Energy doesn&#039;t determine these things, it is the opposite of that. Deterministic relations are functions that produce specific outputs. But the way a complex system produces information, which is the inverse of entropy, is not contained in the input from the higher entropy outside of the system. The sun is a producer of entropy that then hits the earth and seems to transform into a phantasmagoric array of things. Energy enters a computer from the wall, but there is little way to predict from that the architecture or information produced by the computer. In a sense we don&#039;t entirely know the computational capabilities if the computer given some amount of energy. We have a guess based on what we know right now, but that&#039;s exactly the issue. The specific answer to that question of what CAN be produced, in this instance computed, using an amount of energy depends on knowledge of practical things like materials science and laws of physics. So the universe suddenly appears as something made up of matter, energy and information. Energy is associated with entropy, it&#039;s heat and randomness. Information is the opposite, it&#039;s a pattern, redundancy. Complex systems take randomness and produce information, but it&#039;s not clear how much information can be produced by the energy. The only way to figure that out is to look for possible patterns, which we mostly do by looking for existing patterns and trying to figure out how they work to maybe reproduce them for our purposes. Energy is required for this, but you see how it is no more deterministic than a statement like &quot;matter determines what can and cannot exist in the economy&quot;? It actually doesn&#039;t! The opposite!

So we neither know why an economy seeks to extract and use more energy, nor what it uses it for by looking at the energy.

Otherwise, bad actors such as data providers like Bloomberg, ICE, ect, could take advantage of the smart contracts by placing huge bets and then providing bad data to make the contract execute in their favor.

Over the past 20 years, the largest parts of the derivatives market that have broken have not been with the consumers, but rather with the producers. First we can look at the LIBOR scandal, this was a scandal where-in banks had been rigging the overnight rate, the fixed leg rate for that 400 trillion in derivatives, by submitting intentionally manipulated bids to the overnight lending markets. All pricing sources for LIBOR gave the same false rate, just as all all oracle\u2019s would have. Second we can look at the 2008 crash, in which securities which should have been rated much lower than their actual credit rating were given triple A ratings due to collusion between the rating agencies and the banks forming the CDO\u2019s and mortgage bonds. Linkers CAN attempt to subvert this by saying oracles could have looked at the underlying credit ratings to compile the bonds themselves and ran the algorithm, however that brings us to our third point now:", "time": 1676226784, "resto": 53682453, "id": "nRK9K95/"}, {"no": 53682468, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)13:33:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the subversion of the algorithm providers.

This was later deemed illegal and the banks were fined, the undertext being that they had captured the regulatory agencies to change these algorithms<br><br>This is a glaring fucking hole, Linkers will spend all day ensuring you smart contracts will need this oracle industry to provide programmable money, when it actually opens up even larger holes to the manipulation of the contracts via the data providers.

It is already, more or less, automated by the broker essentially. If they choose to hook up their high level interest rate swaps to an API from Bloomberg and automatically settle your position based on that data, then they have every right to do so. The main proposition of crypto has always been the speed of transfer and accounting, you can basically do away with actual custody as custodians can become more or less software providers, not as if that does not already happen.

Its no different than time traveling to 2015, and arguing that bitcoin is simply part of greater fool theory and failed as a currency. You might be right to some degree, but is it enough that you can&#039;t profit immensely off of it still?

Admittedly this is a problem with the current setup for the chainlink network, though one that&#039;s difficult to solve, as the only parties currently using it are DeFi, which for the most part do not care or require the sort of security staking offers, and are comfortable with a centralized service. <br><br>The big chicken and egg question is, will tradfi services (potentially swift and others) eventually demand access to blockchain and be the first party that require true staking? Or will true staking be implemented somehow with DeFi first, and be used to prove the network&#039;s potential and attract tradfi? <br>If that question were already answered, there&#039;d be no debate on chainlink, either the value would have already skyrocketed and you would have missed it, or it would have crashed back towards ICO levels as the market moved on.

OP just thinks data providers will inevitably betray which would ruin the entire idea behind hybrid smart contracts. However, that\u2019s not a guarantee, especially considering the momentum Chainlink has at the moment. If a producer is found to be manipulating their data, their reputation would be annihilated quickly, as there will be a thousand eyes on them when their data comes into the DON. The same cannot be said right now within TradFi, as you can see by checking Twitter during a DeFi hack. There are always people calling it out.

Yes, we know that the broker-signer relationship is digitized for the most part. That\u2019s the case with most of SaaS, but there are still process flow limitations compared to smart contracts. This is undeniable when you see things like YEARN being used or the simple fact that you can borrow and lend on AAVE without a broker in place. That, in and of itself, creates a new standard for finance, and I think even the filthiest of boomers would find it interesting. Ultimately, smart contracts will bring to the forefront all of the flaws of legacy systems, such as being not auditable, middle man value extractions, post-execution process flow limitations, business logic only for basic servicing, etc.<br><br>I\u2019ll bet on Chainlink.

You are conflating reading the data with producing it. Your argument can be deconstructed, as I see it then, into two paths; 1, You will either argue then that the oracles are as involved in the production of the data as the consumption. If say an exploit is found in an algorithm that multiple oracles are supplying to contracts, you will say the oracle that \u201cfixes\u201d it should be right. This dissolves the game theory these oracles are based around now, as they must either choose to provide the correct algorithm as known by the algorithm provider, or they must choose to go with the algorithm that is not broken but not provided for the purposes of the contract consumers needs. This further breaks down when you realize this means staking requirements must be fit to such a market. Examples of this would be around chain splitting due to bugs, do you choose to go with the original chain for data integrity, or the chain with no bugs, or if not a decentralized chain this brings us to: 2, you identify a single data series to watch, you identify explicitly which algorithm to watch, and you choose a central provider for that data, who\u2019s algorithm you use, in which case it no longer matters how many oracles you have reading it as whoever \u201cowns\u201d this algorithm now can be captured. If the chain split and the ETH foundation owns the chain, that is a single point of failure for your contracts. Examples of this would be multiple sources for BIS algorithms but only one BIS. <br><br>It does not make logical sense, and Sybil attacks do not have to be one individual, nor do they have to be intentional.

He asked if I was dating someone<br>and I shyly looked away and giggled and so he said,<br>&quot;Look me in the eyes and answer me.&quot; So I did and told<br>him I was. He coolly said, &quot;ok, how long?&quot; I told him a<br>month and he said, &quot;ok not too long. The reason I asked<br>was because I wanted to ask you out.&quot; The way he acted<br>immediately after made me feel that he is expecting to<br>get what he wants.<br>We&#039;re still hanging out a bit, aka I needed help with<br>my studies and it feels like he keeps trying to create<br>opportunities for bonding.

You typically only get these types of communities developing in cheaper locations. DC is a great example - when it was still chocolate city it had an amazing punk scene. However, as the city is being gentrified and &#039;cleaned up&#039; (it&#039;s pretty sterile now, if not a lot safer) these communities are priced out and move away (punk moved out partially to Baltimore for example). I would find it hard to believe Chicago doesn&#039;t have some counterculture communities because it&#039;s actually much cheaper to live there than most major cities, and I do think that&#039;s the major driving factor. I think NYC is even falling victim to this where most of the interesting counter-culture stuff has been kicked out to further and further boroughs as people are priced out. This is literally when Starbucks and Chase take over all the storefronts and you lose your long-time dive bars, music venues, comedy places, etc. to corporate BS", "time": 1676402242, "resto": 53707492, "id": "jv2qRZ7L"}, {"no": 53708850, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53707492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53707492</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The social/dating scene seems amazing.</span><br>Imagine being this much of a braindead nigger kike.<br><br>I bet you took the &quot;vaccine&quot;.", "time": 1676402475, "resto": 53707492, "id": "bGLG2MJj"}, {"no": 53708939, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:26:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53708480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53708480</a><br>Not too many 10s though.", "time": 1676402813, "resto": 53707492, "id": "LwFfef7p"}, {"no": 53708942, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:27:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53708850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53708850</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the only worthwhile way to live your life is to be on the computer 24/7 and remain a virgin and this lifestyle is purely by choice and not because no one wants to be around me nigger kike faggot reeeeeeee</span><br>alright little buddy!", "filename": "chud", "ext": ".png", "w": 917, "h": 1027, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676402821322511, "time": 1676402821, "md5": "zCyTX9VPxgWbEn6MaQPYWQ==", "fsize": 31905, "resto": 53707492, "id": "jPKHniFS"}, {"no": 53709183, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:42:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53708628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53708628</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women in NYC love balding 5&#039;6 Indian janitors but women in Kansas City don&#039;t it all depends on where you live bro</span>", "time": 1676403765, "resto": 53707492, "id": "f7ETD/fX"}, {"no": 53709285, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:48:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53709183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53709183</a><br><br>i dont think the jeet spammers on this board hocking these dumb dog coins living in mumbai are rage posting in nyc threads as they&#039;re too busy spamming their gay ass discord and telegram groups but whatever you say", "time": 1676404139, "resto": 53707492, "id": "jv2qRZ7L"}, {"no": 53709303, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ok, time for one of you larpers to show us your &quot;Sick NYC apartment&quot;
