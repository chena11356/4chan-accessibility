Eagle premiums suck, but you CAN get some of them back while selling. Boomers also lose their shit with them, have at least a coupe you&#039;re willing to part with. But don&#039;t spend more than $150 your first time. Seriously. Maybe wait even two-three weeks before your next purchase, give yourself enough time to forget about your first buy.

I Just keep buying.<br><br>If you buy collector shit like proofs or limited mintage item, buy it entirely to tickle your own personal coin autism and nothing else, unless you&#039;re really good at scalping and lack inhibition/a soul.

It doesn&#039;t moon, the dollar doesn&#039;t crash, there&#039;s no cannibal raiders or glowies desperately hunting people down for silver. You just hold it, own it, and it keep its value over the years. Myself, I&#039;m content with PMs in that case. I bought them for their value, and it&#039;s only been building wealth. Every ounce is money crystalized whereas fiat feels so fleeting. Not-so easily come, but very easily goes.

They will later pay high premiums to fill in the series. But consider the series&#039; potential popularity: generic and/or cringeworthy series are less likely to appreciate much.<br>- Low-mintage series are often priced very high, but may in time increase in value the most.<br>- Gov&#039;t-issued coins cost least while minted. Once the mintage stops and dealers run out of stock, the prices jump then rise more slowly but still faster than generic silver. Maples, Eagles, Wieners, Britannias, etc. are all nice but boring. The mint may add a privy to add novelty thereby ginning up the price. Stuff that changes overall designs from year to year become series (Somali elephants, Canadian Wildlife, Australian kookaburras or koalas, island nations&#039; series, etc.).<br>- If you buy pieces that appeal to your sense of art, taste, and interests, you will still appreciate them even if the price or value of the PM goes nowhere. Caveat: if you go to sell, it&#039;s harder to part with them.<br>- Some beautiful generics are priced comically high (Germanias, GSM special editions, e.g.) - they don&#039;t follow the market trends as readily, garnering peak price only while fashionable. Be aware: dealers may categorize and price these as &quot;generic&quot; (meaning below spot) when buying them from you. Or the gamble might pay off as they become very popular (Englehard, PAMP, antique miners/refiners, e.g.).<br>- For new generic bars, watch the markups over spot: premiums (added charges) go up for smaller pieces.<br>- Shipping is an added premium. Many online vendors offer free shipping for purchasing a minimum amount (commonly $200).

But when banks issue loans, only the principal is added to the money supply, not the interest on debts. So in our system, debt always exceeds the money supply. As of 2021, the total money supply in the United States (M2 measure) was approximately $19.3 trillion. But the national debt was approximately $28 trillion. There&#039;s not enough money in the system to pay off the national debt. To pay back interest on existing loans, the money supply must constantly expand through the issuance of new loans. At some point, the debt load becomes so high that you run out of borrowers and the lending stops. Then the money supply contracts and there is not enough money being added to the system to pay interest on existing loans. Borrowers begin to default. When they default, the lenders can seize their assets. This system creates a repeating cycle of monetary expansions and contractions. Monetary expansions cause inflation. Monetary contractions cause deflation. Inflation, deflation, confiscation.

Despite being created as a hard fork of Bitcoin, BSV has struggled to gain widespread adoption and has limited use cases compared to Bitcoin. One of the key advantages of Bitcoin is its decentralization. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning that no single entity controls it. This ensures that the network is resistant to censorship, fraud, and other forms of manipulation. In contrast, BSV is heavily centralized and is controlled by a small group of individuals and organizations, which undermines its credibility and security. Another advantage of Bitcoin is its security. Bitcoin has been battle-tested over the years and has a strong track record of being secure and resistant to hacking and other forms of cyber attack. This makes it a reliable choice for individuals and businesses who want to store and transfer value securely. In contrast, BSV has suffered from several security breaches, which raises questions about its ability to protect user funds. Furthermore, Bitcoin has a large and active developer community, which is constantly working to improve the network and add new features and functionality. This has allowed Bitcoin to evolve and adapt over time, and has ensured that it remains relevant and useful in an ever-changing digital landscape. In contrast, BSV has a limited developer community, which has resulted in stagnation and limited innovation.<br><br>In conclusion, Bitcoin is widely considered to be better than Bitcoin SV in terms of decentralization, security, and innovation.

IMGNAI is the ERC-20 utility token for the ImgnAI (Image Generation AI) ecosystem. The project was launched in December of 2022, before the AI-crypto hype began. Available *right now* is a Telegram / Discord-based image generation bot called \u201cNai\u201d, which although is built on the Stable Diffusion engine, uses ImgnAI\u2019s proprietary AI. This is particularly evident in its anime generation capabilities, which surpass those of industry leaders. However, ImgnAI is far from just a \u2018hentai-bot\u2019 and you can generate \u201creal\u201d images via complex prompts with astounding results. The crown jewel of ImgnAI will be an all-encompassing web app to maximize consumer accessibility \u2013 being solely on messaging platforms isn\u2019t a viable business model in the long-run and they\u2019ve known that all along. Between image generation, text-to-speech ability (coming soon), and a revenue system for token holders, this has the makings of a highly-successful crypto project. Most importantly, it\u2019s the consensus #1 in the space and it isn\u2019t close \u2013 it is the thing that every other project is trying to flip, in their own words.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that\u2019s great, but is it actually being used?</span><br>V1 of Nai currently handles between 500k-1M generations per day and is active in 11k+ groups between Telegram &amp; Discord.

When NSFW realism is released in the near-future, the demand for the token will skyrocket even more. Even if nothing else about the project is appealing to you, a basic understanding of human internet behavior should be enough for you to long it. Thankfully, there is a lot more to be bullish on than just nudity or staking when it comes to the token. Major partnerships with NFT collections, industry leaders, and other entities are in the works \u2013 to say this team is effective at marketing would be an understatement. Without even initiating the process, ImgnAI achieved 5 CEX listings (one being Huobi) this week; these exchanges saw the popularity, saw the product, saw the vision and bought in, literally. They bought directly from Uniswap. When larger exchanges like KuCoin and Binance list the token in the future, that will trigger even further price action. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is this a scam?</span><br>No. ImgnAI has been around for more than 1.5 months and you would know if it wasn\u2019t legit by now.

To run SD, you first need a computer powerful enough to handle it. Many people do not have that. Secondly, if you actually want to produce a wide array of art \u2014 say you\u2019re an artist of a particular style \u2014 you need to train your AI properly. This is time-intensive and the vanilla SD does not serve many users with particular tastes well enough otherwise. The team behind this project has designed an idiot-proof user experience that is as simple as adding a bot to a discord. At least for the free content. Once the token is listed on more CEX\u2019s, even the tokenized capabilities will be more accessible. Finally, this is simply better than SD on its own.

People who solely PvE&#039;d, people who just sat around the bank and used the game as a social club.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "qR5CBBA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2448, "h": 3264, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675632296838480, "time": 1675632296, "md5": "VV7a4UQAUxYJzK0m3Pd9Bw==", "fsize": 615391, "resto": 0, "id": "NFozmSdJ", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 45, "images": 29, "unique_ips": 25}, {"no": 53589412, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:26:53", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53546578#p53546578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53546578</a>", "filename": "1653056374364", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675632413998658, "time": 1675632413, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53589386, "id": "NFozmSdJ"}, {"no": 53589428, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:27:50", "name": "Anony\u0271ous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool.<br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

LOL.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming energy costs do not increase at all over the next 120 years, which they will.<br><br>So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.<br><br>https://cryptostackers.substack.com<wbr>/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value", "filename": "btc halving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 550, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 57, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675632683837369, "time": 1675632683, "md5": "8wwfwrnCrlmkSB31ZKo7zQ==", "fsize": 273618, "resto": 53589386, "id": "NFozmSdJ"}, {"no": 53589640, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I am running some nodes.
