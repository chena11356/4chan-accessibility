Being exposed to the more traditional aspects of western culture and fundamentals of bible-based Christianity (thanks internet and religious pamphlets from based Pastor Eli of Jesus is Lord), I&#039;m sort of in the middle ground relative to Philippine culture and social aspects now. While I can see scams and read social cues miles away, I REFUSE to participate in the culture of scamming and corruption here. It&#039;s got me many enemies because of this, especially when I still worked in government because I refused to play ball with their corruption games. You&#039;re right though, it&#039;s really too much if you know the ins and outs of the social environment here and this form of governance and interaction between its people is unsustainable. Philippines will either collapse or get conquered by its neighbors once the western hegemony collapses but that&#039;s at least centuries away.

I go back and forth to the philippines often, and have been since I was 24. I have a shit ton of friends there that are deeply involved with the dance scene and the night life scene so they have some social clout that I take advantage of. Most of them stay in the nicer part of Manila however a few live in Quezon city which is a trash heap. I&#039;ve been all around the islands and it&#039;s some of the most beautiful places I&#039;ve ever experienced in my entire life. The low cost of living is true to an extent. If you want to upgrade your lifestyle, you will have to pay up. There is mega money investment all across SEA and this region of the world won&#039;t always be considered a shithole. It&#039;s changing. There are parts of Manila that are more luxurious than anything I&#039;ve ever seen at home in Canada. Nicer nightclubs than anything I&#039;ve ever seen as well. If you have that USD income, you&#039;re set for sure. As for the women.. they&#039;re &quot;good&quot; in that these people are generally very nice and welcoming to me but the vast majority of them are unattractive. My friend works for GMA (major tv network there) and I&#039;ve sat in the studio audience for a couple talk shows. In the entertainment world there, they tend to prop up the lighter skinned pinoys, especially the half-white ones who can easily rise to the pinnacle of their modelling scene. Not many halfies but when you do encounter them, they&#039;re lightyears more beautiful than the regular fare. No blacks is true but they worship American culture and blacks are a part of that. Expect to see a lot of black American imitation among the youth, just as you would expect in America. The girls definitely melt for good looking white men, and it&#039;s not about money or a green card or whatever.. that&#039;s mainly cope from Asian men.

They already imposed an insane face mask + face shield (lol) rule and had the mandatory masks running for nearly 3 years. I just visited and 90% in the city still wear mask. The level of stupidity is really next level and I get nightmares just thinking about having to interact with bureaucrats and rules that are even more stupid European bureaucrats.<br>- Poor quality of housing - even though I&#039;d buy something &quot;proper&quot; around Greenbelt for about $400k I am concerned about construction quality. The house might collapse, poor fire fighting capabilities in case of fire, erroneous electricity installation - might literally kill me.<br>- Lack of diversity among filipinas. Most girls look ugly af but some are very beautiful. But another concern is that I might get bored af of looking at the same type of women all the time. Something similar happened in Colombia, their women all look the same to me now.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1665111209950096", "ext": ".png", "w": 2048, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672856299229804, "time": 1672856299, "md5": "99FqpLhnxQy8HQogarWrIA==", "fsize": 1716837, "resto": 0, "id": "hffpt4Si", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 225, "images": 63, "unique_ips": 116}, {"no": 53133356, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pedophilia coin", "time": 1672856420, "resto": 53133327, "id": "ymtrQXOI"}, {"no": 53133362, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53070955#p53070955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53070955</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672856436957646, "time": 1672856436, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53133327, "id": "hffpt4Si"}, {"no": 53133376, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1672856758674221, "time": 1672856758, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 53133327, "id": "hffpt4Si"}, {"no": 53133447, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:27:33", "name": "Hodlin&#039; Caulfield", "filename": "nyan monero", "ext": ".gif", "w": 476, "h": 280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 73, "tim": 1672856853338891, "time": 1672856853, "md5": "L5S0IDmd8oWxMwMrFtAIVA==", "fsize": 25808, "resto": 53133327, "id": "9AqUhDdw"}, {"no": 53133456, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:27:51", "com": "Reporting in<br>##################################<br><br>IRC- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/tzm4s<br>Aliases- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/bjbx3<br>Extras- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/daxte<br>Nodes- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/ke2k8<br>Mining- https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/c7na4", "filename": "wirey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1672856871815231, "time": 1672856871, "md5": "N1zF1Bm8EyFY+Aw6AUkKzQ==", "fsize": 272922, "resto": 53133327, "id": "qO3u0LWA", "trip": "!!ZrnK6IK8Nit"}, {"no": 53133492, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:30:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/biz/thread/53070955#p53133103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53133103</a><br>So I just <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;git clone --recursive https://github.com/monero-project/m<wbr>onero</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cd monero &amp;&amp; git submodule init &amp;&amp; git submodule update</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ulimit -d 2000000</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;env DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local gmake release-static</span><br><br>everything goes well until this point<br>https://pastebin.com/3D7aNCPr", "time": 1672857011, "resto": 53133327, "id": "qO3u0LWA"}, {"no": 53133541, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:34:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I keep hearing the argument that privacy on BTC Layer 2 is impossible because the base layer is publicly visible.

His current girlfriend has a 9 year old kid that isn&#039;t his, he&#039;s been helping to take care of over the years. His girlfriend just got a job before christmas and with her first paycheck, she decided to buy a $200 bag of weed rather than buy her daughter Christmas gifts because she said she &quot;has enough already&quot;. He couldn&#039;t believe what he was hearing so he being fresh out of jail he found a way to make money, I&#039;m assuming through selling drugs and bought the little girl some Christmas gifts. His girl bitched that she was allegedly going to give her daughter money for Christmas (which is a lie) and he said he was done with her and they split.

For example there have been a reduction in rapes when prostitution becomes legal and violence has been reduced by people playing violent video games as it keeps them off the streets. You cannot suppress the human condition, only redirect it, so then comes the question what&#039;s your primary grievance. Do you have a problem because you want to prevent victims, or do you have a problem because it offends your sensibilities.

However the environment you&#039;re talking about, social dating apps and the internet, is at this point filled with vapid materialistic whores - male and female. You can find love through these, sure, I&#039;ve seen it - But you are still dating someone &quot;normal&quot;, and normal == whore even still. Normal society is filled with animal behavior, just because they larp as civilized or human does not mean they do not obey eugenic bottleneck pressures such as sexual selection processes. Modern technology has only made the modern human more vapid and materialistic, not less. You can combat this lunacy with salary, net worth, personality and quirk to some degree, many men are able to attract 1.5x their physical equivalent based on six figure net worth alone, so if you are a millionaire you just aren&#039;t trying hard enough. Is this true love? Unlikely. So if you want something more meaningful you&#039;ll need to attempt to SEA max, poverty max, or drug max, etc. Will they love you then? Maybe - Unlikely.<br><br>The only solution I&#039;ve found to actually finding someone meaningful, is to become meaningful yourself. That means pursuing education, STEM specifically, and finding a girl who is interested in more cognitive passions. You can alternatively, find a cute artist girl and connect with her if your art is exceptional. Whatever you do, you must be meaningful, not just nice. Forcing pathological sadism that society reinforces as acceptable is retarded, pursue meaning and you can pursue meaningful girls.", "time": 1673079461, "resto": 53168993, "id": "DP5+mqoT"}, {"no": 53169342, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)03:20:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53168993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53168993</a><br>Work out.

ICP cannot cash the &quot;muh decentralized world web3 omnicompooter&quot; check from a technical standpoint, sorry to break it to you. Hosting a website on a BFT crypto cloud host that has strictly worse flexibility, performance, and UX than AWS/Azure is not a valuable proposition. The only people who care about this are baggies and people who are concerned about whatever they&#039;re doing being censored off traditional cloud compute, which is a small minority of builders and capital (nevermind that you can get voted off the IC with a 51% vote on the NNS lul). The IC has far worse throughput capacity than avalanche, partly because it&#039;s old tech and partly because it isn&#039;t optimized for actual transaction throughput. It really is not an L1 or L0, it&#039;s outclassed Cosmos, Solana, Avalanche etc. in that regard.<br><br>Fun fact though, webhosting/cloud compute subnets could certainly be built on avalanche. What you and most other midwits don&#039;t seem to understand is that avalanche is merely a consensus platform with arbitrary trustless message passing between subnets. A subnet is merely a subset of validators who agree to process data in some arbitrary way. So you can create a subnet or a network of them with minimum hardware requirements identical to ICP, running a webhosting VM, no historical state preservation, goofy tokenomics, etc. and you can still interoperate with every other subnet on avalanche. In fact, if someone went through the trouble to rip out all the shitty classical consensus beacon garbage, etc. you could run the IC VM on avalanche but it would be faster and actually stands a chance of being a permissionless decentralized system.<br><br><a href=\"#p53157400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53157400</a><br>Only clueless midwits says this", "time": 1673018168, "resto": 53139923, "id": "Gv4N1PEN"}, {"no": 53159172, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)10:57:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53147206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53147206</a><br>BNB has 21 validators, your point is, exactly?", "time": 1673020665, "resto": 53139923, "id": "rdcMYIhH"}, {"no": 53160606, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)12:41:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53141505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53141505</a><br>MATIC is a good one.

I am have a newly set up e-commerce store myself.<br><br>First and foremost, learn how to add value. Only then you would be able to add a markup on your products based on this added value. Simply reselling aliexpress level products won&#039;t do it. People are increasingly getting more accustomed to ordering from china as well as brands like Shein will take not only small dropshippers out, but big businesses like Zara out of business. Personally, I am running a print-on-demand store myself and I am shipping them abroad. In this way I add value by offering a web based app for customers to customise products and printing their design on cheap imported Chinese phone cases. It&#039;s been 5 months and I still can not support my self from this business. December I made 1300 euros in profit.<br><br>Second, keep in mind it is very hard to separate customers from their money. Income disparity is becoming increasingly more stark. Corporatism is destroying the middle class and the purchasing power as we used to know it. People have little money for useless shit. If you are selling something it is best to target people&#039;s insecurities. Show directly why they need your product. A person who is balding is likely to give a lot of money and impulsively go for a product that would help his hair, however, a person who is fine with their current fitness clothing would be more hesitant in buying another. Still, keep in mind that tactical sectors have proportionally more competition. <br><br>In terms of marketing, use TikTok. Nothing beats it right now. This is the only place I am making profit on my ads. I don&#039;t even bother with instagram at this point.

Always a nice surprise to see actual discussion here instead of the usual onslaught of mematic signalling. <br><br>Revolutions have always been set into motion by small groups of radical intellectuals. Even if we legally mandated an hour of reading per day for every US citizen it would make little difference. You can lead a horse to water but... The common person just wants to get through life as smoothly as possible and enjoy whatever pleasures come their way. The masses will only fight back against the system when their current situation becomes completely unbearable, the revolutionary minority directs their efforts and offers a way out. And the masses will tolerate a surprising amount of discomfort and humiliation before they consider their situation unbearable; they are like the boiling frog. I think Americans today are getting very close a level of discomfort that they will not tolerate. <br><br>You reminded me of a speech that Jonathan Bowden gave to a small audience in London. Here is an excerpt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There\u2019s a degree to which I personally think that the doctrine of vanguardism is the way out of the dilemma that we face. All Communist movements believe that the proletariat needed to be saved from itself. They believe that the masses were degraded by feudalism and by capitalism. They believe that only an elite or a vanguard party could raise the masses up to socialism as the inverse of the capitalism they wish to replace. All Communist movements that flourished in Western and other societies throughout most of the late 19th and 20th centuries based themselves upon the vanguard principle. These movements were tiny. Smaller than the number of people gathered in this room in central West London tonight by a long way.</span><br><br>1/2", "time": 1673067514, "resto": 53167403, "id": "WJFaqq7w"}, {"no": 53168236, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)00:00:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53168122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53168122</a><br>Elon &quot;Mr House&quot; Musk, Caesar &quot;El Guzman&quot;&#039;s Legion, or Donald J. &quot;Yes Man&quot; Trump?

As you get older or you head into your late 20s, security is soul-sucking and insanely depressing, but you become spoiled because I can&#039;t imagine any security guard withstanding what the average food-service/retail/warehouse wagie endures on a daily basis. Security is a complete sham and you&#039;ll have absolutely zero skills that come from the &quot;experience&quot; of working security, you could possibly land a better security position after getting a YOE. I landed a $25/hr job at a government facility and worked there for 1.5 years as I was finishing up my degree, probably the most comfy time in my life. Working security with nothing to look forward to will make you suicidal. If you&#039;re working just to work, become a truck driver and make 80-100k/year with practically no expenses.<br><a href=\"#p53168196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53168196</a><br>They&#039;ll hire anyone, I had a 65 year old coworker who could barely walk and was practically brain dead, he couldn&#039;t even do basic algebra. He was a great security guard and actually tried so it made everyone else&#039;s job easier. It was kind of fucked up bc he would miss out on OT pay and didn&#039;t even know because he calculated everything wrong.<br><a href=\"#p53168104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53168104</a><br>In security you&#039;re trained to do nothing at all, literally: observe &amp; report, that&#039;s it. You would be a fucking fool to actually try and protect a property against sketchy people, in that case, call the cops immediately and hide. It&#039;s your life, do not fuck around. Let the cops deal with it and 100% you&#039;ll never get fired. My first security job was on a 2 acre property with tall buildings so you had to route through it with a golf cart, basically some guy we worked with fell asleep in his car, almost every 8-hour shift for a fucking year.

However, if I was a hedgie, and I knew this was going down, I would drive the price as low as I could before hand.
