Record deals became loans, where artists paid for all services in house at top price, ended up on the artists credit report, and writen off the labels taxes as losses. Those that made it to touring had to pay back the loan first, then got .27 off every ticket, so artists started doing club appearances for $4K after the label shows, which were all under the table. If you hear a rapper getting shot, prolly because he took a promoters money, or didnt get paid and that promoter ran that town. the more $4k checks you wanted to get in the city you were performing, the shadier the spots got. This was not just rap artists either. That taste of fame made artists &quot;go independent&quot; aka broke once they started performing at strip clubs and walking out having thrown the money in the air. Then you wouldn&#039;t see them until a grandparent died and left inheritance or they settled a car accident, or was dating and ugly fan with a steady paycheck.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "EnrageGlowies", "ext": ".png", "w": 746, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669942884426025, "time": 1669942884, "md5": "0//XNa1vGR9Earld8FtvaQ==", "fsize": 120798, "resto": 0, "id": "huUyLv/4", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 299, "images": 104, "omitted_posts": 294, "omitted_images": 102, "last_replies": [{"no": 52764773, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:22:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52762709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52762709</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;undetected inflation bug is the most likely cause of Monero&#039;s historically awful price action</span><br>Yes.

I sold my online clothing business earlier this year and now operate a local gas station but during my early time as a online clothing man I was lucky enough to have a supplier in town 2 blocks over. I literally would drive down and pick the supplies up and drive back. AND I got a massive discount on things (wont say but it was more than 50% off all sales due to on property purchase) And I would let boxes of clothes sit in my spare room while I built up my advertising and got my product out. It took about 2-3yrs before I saw consistant traffic and even that was probably due to me knowing some females online and they were willing to advertise for me and I gave them a cut of a certain amount of sales as a thanks. But my point is dont get frustrated or upset if you have a box of your brand sitting in the spare room for a bit til it moves. I remember my stack of boxes I had sitting for 9 months before I started moving them enough. <br> keep your head up lil trooper you&#039;ll be fine just dont get to crazy into debt.
