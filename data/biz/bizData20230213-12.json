I think they run 3 or more stages of trials which takes years, and then after that they have to try and get FDA approval, and from there they can attempt to sell the drug/treatment with their newly secured patent. The entire process takes a long time and it costs a lot of money and the companies don&#039;t generate any income while they are doing it, so there&#039;s always a high chance that they will have to issue new stocks to raise money and then dump on the holders. Then there&#039;s also the fact that if you aren&#039;t a big pharma company like Pfizer then the regulatory agencies aren&#039;t going to be as friendly, and if you are trying to patent a drug that big pharma might want later down the road then they might deny you.

I threw together a few of the key points in picrel. Their last earnings report was really good and they are on a nice trajectory with their revenue. I suspect it would plateau a bit from here since they were starting from practically nothing, but it&#039;s still nice to see. They also have a nice cash balance at $26m so they most likely wouldn&#039;t be looking to do an offering anytime soon and dilute the shares.<br><br>The thing I don&#039;t like that popped up recently was insider selling. It was only $4k and the guys total share count is now at 0 so maybe he just left the company?

Otherwise, bad actors such as data providers like Bloomberg, ICE, ect, could take advantage of the smart contracts by placing huge bets and then providing bad data to make the contract execute in their favor. Ostensibly, the chainlink oracles would solve this dilemma by providing a voting method on the data that exposes those bad actors to financial loss, and provides financial incentives to provide good data.<br><br>Cont.", "filename": "12D43DB6-0C78-4FF6-AC6C-706DAAEE53BB", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676226721880506, "time": 1676226721, "md5": "+29ingXB+w6pCDa5BAm1Cw==", "fsize": 203162, "resto": 0, "id": "nRK9K95/", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-chainlink-con", "replies": 44, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 53682463, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)13:33:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "3) he proposed that due to this, chainlink would become a standard integrated protocol on the Swift network, that chainlink would be allowed access to the global financial messaging network to standardize communication between oracle, contract, and institution to, once again, increase the speed and execution of derivatives contracts massively.

Over the past 20 years, the largest parts of the derivatives market that have broken have not been with the consumers, but rather with the producers. First we can look at the LIBOR scandal, this was a scandal where-in banks had been rigging the overnight rate, the fixed leg rate for that 400 trillion in derivatives, by submitting intentionally manipulated bids to the overnight lending markets. All pricing sources for LIBOR gave the same false rate, just as all all oracle\u2019s would have. Second we can look at the 2008 crash, in which securities which should have been rated much lower than their actual credit rating were given triple A ratings due to collusion between the rating agencies and the banks forming the CDO\u2019s and mortgage bonds. Linkers CAN attempt to subvert this by saying oracles could have looked at the underlying credit ratings to compile the bonds themselves and ran the algorithm, however that brings us to our third point now:", "time": 1676226784, "resto": 53682453, "id": "nRK9K95/"}, {"no": 53682468, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)13:33:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the subversion of the algorithm providers.

This was later deemed illegal and the banks were fined, the undertext being that they had captured the regulatory agencies to change these algorithms<br><br>This is a glaring fucking hole, Linkers will spend all day ensuring you smart contracts will need this oracle industry to provide programmable money, when it actually opens up even larger holes to the manipulation of the contracts via the data providers. At minimum your risk of running a smart contract will be entirely linked to which entity\u2019s are trusted to provide the algorithms, the prices, the regulations, far and away above just ensuring one data series is incorrect. <br><br>Second, the speed of execution, this one will be much shorter but essentially when you sign a derivatives contract you are basically ensuring the pricing and monetary value of that trade are entirely owned and executed by the broker who sells you the position. It is already, more or less, automated by the broker essentially. If they choose to hook up their high level interest rate swaps to an API from Bloomberg and automatically settle your position based on that data, then they have every right to do so. The main proposition of crypto has always been the speed of transfer and accounting, you can basically do away with actual custody as custodians can become more or less software providers, not as if that does not already happen.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1675439180797735", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2792, "h": 4037, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676206543268876, "time": 1676206543, "md5": "pLF/i7hFbJcVjDfuMq/aLw==", "fsize": 2232893, "resto": 0, "id": "gaig2M8k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 97, "images": 33, "unique_ips": 43}, {"no": 53679958, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/53589386#p53589386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53589386</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1676206623747923, "time": 1676206623, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 53679954, "id": "gaig2M8k"}, {"no": 53679963, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should I care? Why should I run a node?</span><br><br>Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won&#039;t also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR&#039;s long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack &amp; cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.<br><br>So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK, but how difficult is it? Do I have to store GBs worth of data like when running an XMR node?</span><br><br>It is literally as easy as installing an Android app and no, there are no storage requirements, the node only consumes some bandwidth.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cool, I&#039;m sold.

But speaking from my personal experience, you actually learn these things better by doing and making mistakes on the way, instead of trying to get the hang of things by following some theoretical lessons. Financial markets are by nature unpredictable due to the simple fact that the main actors participating in the action are humans, accompanied with the immense variety of psychological profiles and factors deciding our actions. What may be common sense from your point of view can be completely out of left field seen from another. Think of it like a pvp game. Everyone is playing to win, so what would you do in a situation where bought shares of a coin at $0.1, now worth $10 after a week? <br><br>Still, in order to properly get started, I think it&#039;s wise for you to take the time to read/watch some introductory content to at least have a grasp of what you&#039;re doing and the tech you&#039;re soon going to be interacting with. Despite what I said above about theory, it&#039;s good practice to be curious and to ask questions whenever you need. If there is one thing I have learned, it&#039;s that pride has no place in investing or shitcoining, and you have to be humble in order to actually move forward.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basic explanation of crypto and BTC:</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yy<wbr>AzVmP9xQ <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Smart contracts explained:</span><br>https://youtube.com/watch?v=pWGLtjG<wbr>-F5c&amp;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DeFi explained:</span><br>https://youtube.com/watch?v=k9HYC0E<wbr>JU6E&amp;<br><br>This format might not be to your taste, but I think it does the job.

He was just a bad friend even though we grew up together and got along well, he just was an overall bad influence.

These are two different products.Binance USD (BUSD) is a regulated, fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The Paxos-issued BUSD stablecoin, as well as its reserves, are subject to strict regulatory oversight by the New York Department of Financial Services. BUSD is backed by reserves held in either or both (i) fiat cash in dedicated omnibus accounts at insured U.S. banks and/or (ii) U.S. Treasury bills (including through repurchase agreements and/or money-market funds invested in U.S. Treasury bills).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Binance-Peg BUSD, which is not issued by Paxos and is not regulated by NYDFS, is a separate product. Binance independently mints Binance-Peg BUSD on other blockchains (e.g., BNB Chain, Polygon and Avalanche) and pegs the tokens to BUSD on a one-to-one basis. This allows holders of both tokens to swap tokens between Ethereum and other blockchains.</span><br><br><br>Never knew this distincion, but they will probably go after this.
