"/XMR/ Monero General", "com": "Welcome to the Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world&#039;s leading decentralized P2P privacy cryptocurrency!<br><br>Monero is secure, low-fee, and fungible, meaning users can send XMR around the globe despite corrupt governments or broken financial systems. Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "RegulateThis", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 973, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 126, "tim": 1668719344694386, "time": 1668719344, "md5": "R/tTktZ0aiYBuPvSoCp0iA==", "fsize": 101914, "resto": 0, "id": "YbZlxO2Y", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 7, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 2, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 52492553, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:12:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "*****/XMR/ Monero General Info-Dump*****<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*****/XMR/ Monero General Info-Dump*****</span><br>*****/XMR/ Monero General Info-Dump*****<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*****/XMR/ Monero General Info-Dump*****</span><br><br><br>Learn more about Monero&#039;s key features and excellent future prospects, have some common misconceptions dispelled and discover the cold hard facts about Bitcoin, Zcash and PirateChain.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1668719697693399, "time": 1668719697, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52492495, "id": "YbZlxO2Y"}, {"no": 52492618, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:17:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1667824257250336", "ext": ".png", "w": 2870, "h": 2060, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 179, "tim": 1668458211649341, "time": 1668458211, "md5": "yjBlL1vNGyxm7KnVhq5n1A==", "fsize": 3613160, "resto": 0, "id": "nwC2U7M0", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 306, "images": 118, "omitted_posts": 301, "omitted_images": 116, "last_replies": [{"no": 52492185, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)15:49:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52490546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52490546</a><br>one of my local bitcoin atm requires a bank account to use and the other have to comply and agree to its AML policy + number OTP verification.<br><br>Are both of these good options?", "time": 1668718197, "resto": 52434276, "id": "Q8DU6Lwa"}, {"no": 52492205, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)15:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52491241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52491241</a><br><br>They won&#039;t outlaw privacy, they&#039;ll just outlaw blatently crime-enabling tech like you know what.", "filename": "1651246274836", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668718286850491, "time": 1668718286, "md5": "2VYjgHp6qk49Pf88zqLWCQ==", "fsize": 576849, "resto": 52434276, "id": "tjM/Mhpp"}, {"no": 52492391, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:03:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52492014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52492014</a><br><a href=\"#p52492154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52492154</a><br>Fuck off.

That professor is Silvio Micali and that blockchain is Algorand. Pure Proof of Stake is non-dilutive and actually allows for all nodes to get a chance at participating in consensus without concentrating the supply of ALGO into the hands of a few whales. Smart contracts time out and pay for storage by locking up ALGO so gas is unnecessary, fees are a formality to prevent spam. all transactions are final the instant that their block is confirmed, and blocks consistently confirm every 4-5 seconds, with a long series of upgrades on the development pipeline. It is a statistical impossibility for Algorand to fork. Once the currently slow and gradual release of ALGO ends around 2030, Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) will actually make ALGO deflationary since 1) in order for a wallet to interact with any ASA, it must \u201copt-in\u201d to it with a transaction, and 2) for each ASA a wallet is opted in to, that wallet must hold 0.1 ALGO. While that metric can be changed through governance, it can only go as low as 1 microALGO (0.000001 ALGO). With serious financial institutions, novel blockchain applications, and a growing base of passionate developers gravitating towards the speed, security, and functionality of Algorand, ALGO is an absolutely necessary DCA for this bear market.
