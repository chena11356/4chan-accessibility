Essentially, they&#039;re set to become the uber of cloud based services. Their technology is open source and third parties can create dApps for sale on iExecs secure decentralized marketplace. Datasets and computing power can be rented out, all while using RLC as a means of exchange. Cloud computing is growing and will become a massive part of the IT industry over the next decade. iExec is a leader in this technology, and has been sought after and been used as a consultant for Microsoft and IBM. That recognition speaks volumes for their competency.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If it has a moonshot in its future, what is the likely time frame</span><br>end of 2023 realistically. Their main service- the marketplace for computing resources - goes live in January. Whenever this token has upward pressure, the price tends to skyrocket. It did a 10x from $2 to $20 in less than a week from its coinbase listing, where most coins see a 50-200% bump at most. With the token becoming increasingly scarce due to the low fixed supply, and iexec inversely offering more products on their marketplace requiring more RLC tokens over time, this upward pressure will meet little resistance. Realistic targets are hard to pinpoint, but if iExecs marketplace captures 0.1% of the cloud computing market by EOY 2023, that will make their services worth just shy of $600 million, which will set RLC at $7 a token. This is a lowball, however, as iexec will be the first to offer a service of its kind. at 1% market share, it will be worth $70. RLC has been stable around 0.90-1.20 the last few months, for reference, and has recently shot to 1.32.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s the suicide stack, what&#039;s the make it stack</span><br>870/8700", "filename": "1669179936488779", "ext": ".png", "w": 620, "h": 450, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1672116901168816, "time": 1672116901, "md5": "0p84lMvYjFxefaVV9G+aKA==", "fsize": 5506, "resto": 53026416, "id": "0tAix6NQ"}, {"no": 53027471, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)01:36:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53026416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53026416</a><br>I think RLC is digital dogshit. Why?<br>First of all, it&#039;s on Coinbase. Do you really want normies to invest in the same token as you? It&#039;s also on Coinbase Custody, meaning institutions are dumping on you bagholders.<br>Second, the iExec team has 5 PhDs. It&#039;s a fucking research project. Do researchers care about adoption or the price? No they don&#039;t. They only care about citations and muh research.<br>iExec is also a key member in two projects financed by the European Commission and has a long-lasting partnership with Intel. The EU Is a dying association and Intel is a dying company. iExec likes to partner with dying players in general.<br>The RLC token is not classed as a security under US jurisdiction. What would you prefer? A risky investment or a secure one?<br>iExec does so many revolutionary things. Decentralized cloud computing, decentralized confidential computing, a decentralized marketplace for computing resources, tokenization of dapps, datasets and computing power as NFTs, decentralized oracles ... jack of all trades, master of none.<br>Currently RLC has hardly any usage and its marketcap is rather low.

Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https://yewtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:</span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:</span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining</span><br>archive.is/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop</span><br>Official Gui/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile</span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo", "filename": "1640435575462", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4572, "h": 4040, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1671853920036373, "time": 1671853920, "md5": "JMG275ZjGKZZeCWMkkVD4Q==", "fsize": 3937075, "resto": 0, "id": "1U+pzxG9", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "xmr-monero-general", "replies": 173, "images": 69, "unique_ips": 67}, {"no": 52999287, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:53:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "PREVIOUS THREAD: <a href=\"/biz/thread/52942053#p52942053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52942053</a>", "filename": "162614854231641471", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1298, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671854022165243, "time": 1671854022, "md5": "tDj74Ukb15YeO987b8cVBA==", "fsize": 591817, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br>START MINING IN P2POOL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START MINING IN P2POOL</span><br><br>P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. <br><br>P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero.

In this delusional state, investors tend to become so smitten with expectations of greater profits that they disregard the assets\u2019 potentially weak fundamentals and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.<br><br>This then leads to them recklessly and repeatedly buying into whatever asset is currently rising in the charts, thereby triggering and/or sustaining an asset bubble. This bubble is kept inflated solely by the mass delusion that the market price is justified and will only keep going up in future, effectively becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Note that bubbles can last for years, especially in an age of easy investor on-boarding. However, when history inevitably repeats and the bubble bursts that optimism invariably turns into panic as the asset crashes back down to its real-world value.<br><br>In finance, the &quot;greater fool theory&quot; suggests that one can sometimes make money through the purchase of overvalued assets\u2014items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic value\u2014if those assets can later be resold at an even higher price.<br><br>In this context, one &quot;fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that he can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero.<br><br>This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_<wbr>xWvX1n9g", "filename": "History-of-Asset-Bubbles-Past-40-Years", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1671854353882828, "time": 1671854353, "md5": "H5ssURt9mydZY7RQK9whAw==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 52999274, "id": "1U+pzxG9"}, {"no": 52999336, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)22:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "brainlet here, is there a way to swap monero for bitcoin or vice versa, <br>pls dont laugh ):", "time": 1671854363, "resto": 52999274, "id": "Sjyu/3Jr"}, {"no": 52999339, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked </span><br><br>Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K.

So here is one a bit more condensed down.<br><br>Supercomputers cannot run randomX as they are extremely specialized towards one task, and might not even have the hardware to preform some of the operations needed. Case and point, the top are literally running on GPUs.<br>For data centers, a similar thing occurs. Take a look at AWS&#039;s instances and plans, and you can see that they are custom tailed towards a specific need, like loading handling, rendering, simulations, fast/slow data storage, databases, etc. So a generic algorithm like randomX, that uses various aspects of a customer grade CPU, will run sub-optimal on all of them.<br>Additionally, data centers are used for everything, so asking them to turn it off, while possible is extremely costly. You would be asking them to turn of essential infrastructure for the backbones of the internet, that comes with a huge price tag. And you can count in the fact that data centers don&#039;t utilize 100% CPU, cooling and electricity issues. And overall it does not make sense to use them on a large scale.<br><a href=\"#p53010310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53010310</a><br>I&#039;m too bored to do the napkin math again, but iirc it would cost $400 million just in the cost of CPUs to get the power required for te 51%. Add 4GB DDR4 RAM to each, plus a PSU, plus a motherboard, plus all that is required to cool such a behemoth. And you can easily go over 1 billion USD to attack a small drug dealer&#039;s currency still in its early days.<br>And yes you can try to make a custom CPU just for randomX, but it&#039;ll essentially be the same as modern AMD CPU, with some overhead.

He is an old man with wrinkles. Why should I care what they say? But I&#039;d like to highlight that yes, I am selfish, and yes, I believe I inherently deserve more than other people. I am special. I was born into nothing, just poverty, but I&#039;ve been able to spend most of my life avoiding work and travelling. Unironically women have helped me a lot; met a girl from halfway across the world to meet me and we travelled a lot and then my next gf lent me like 5k while I was not working for nearly two years. I paid it all back.<br><br>I&#039;m not interested in working unless it&#039;s for myself. Being a wagie is only for yourself in a small part, with most of your effforts benefitting anyone but you. I have not held one job for more than six months. My CV is a complete lie. When I work, I figure out the quickest and most efficient way to do the least amount of work in most amount of time. So if 8 hours means doing nothing I&#039;ve accomplished my mission. When you don&#039;t buy retarded shit all the time, like the newest phone or stuff on loan, you realize that living is not that expensive. The most expensive thing is rent. This can be cut down by either volunteering while travelling in the 1st world -- hostels are the best because you&#039;re basically given accommodation in the city, typically in the city center or thereabouts, and your job is to check people in and do some basic shit; in reality that translates to sitting around at a desk and flirting with girls or chatting shit up with people 90% of time, very ideal for hookups and fast friends -- or by going to 2nd or 3rd world. Eastern Europe is quite cheap, especially off season. Southern Europe is cheapish too. Proper 3rd world like SEA or India don&#039;t cost much either, with flights usually being the most expensive item. Southern America is similar, but it is lot more dangerous than SEA or India, probably even more so than many parts of Africa.", "time": 1672142997, "resto": 53002585, "id": "qk6ddtlV"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 53021015, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:05:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "... &quot;no pussy, no work&quot; is that what you just said to me...? correct?? ... &quot;no taxes&quot; as well? ...give me a moment...", "filename": "image_2022-12-26_140424707", "ext": ".png", "w": 682, "h": 529, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 193, "tim": 1672074305380632, "time": 1672074305, "md5": "o1UzWWlLxR95SlrWduIG3w==", "fsize": 247152, "resto": 0, "id": "EULni9oo", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "no-pussy-no-work-is-that-what-you-just-said-to-me", "replies": 30, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 25}, {"no": 53021090, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:12:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021015</a><br>kek", "time": 1672074760, "resto": 53021015, "id": "3Y4+6m4r"}, {"no": 53021305, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:38:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021015</a><br>That&#039;s right Ramshits, and I got jelly in my pockets so don&#039;t think for a nanosecond I&#039;m getting a job anytime soon.", "filename": "ant_neets", "ext": ".png", "w": 866, "h": 635, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1672076299698870, "time": 1672076299, "md5": "YrKCau/o6A3pa3OHndCkZw==", "fsize": 186104, "resto": 53021015, "id": "JgcWx9Br"}, {"no": 53021359, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:47:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021305</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;destroys your house with a catastrophic flood of piss </span><br>Nothin personnel", "time": 1672076834, "resto": 53021015, "id": "fmDJNmYb"}, {"no": 53021541, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:08:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021015</a><br>hahahaha someone needs to get past the call filtering and do this", "time": 1672078117, "resto": 53021015, "id": "EAveVtyD"}, {"no": 53021565, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:11:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021541</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he thinks live youtube shows are live</span>", "time": 1672078276, "resto": 53021015, "id": "1YCL+Bhe"}, {"no": 53021587, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:13:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021565</a><br>nigger what? he does his show on satellite radio<br><br>is this some sort of weird gaslighting psyop or are you legitimately retarded", "filename": "9f9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672078410322186, "time": 1672078410, "md5": "krHcRu/ihshxdm4JrpTIYQ==", "fsize": 3776, "resto": 53021015, "id": "EAveVtyD"}, {"no": 53021596, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:14:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021587</a><br>Sorry let me reiterate <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he thinks the call in feature of live shows is live</span>", "time": 1672078498, "resto": 53021015, "id": "1YCL+Bhe"}, {"no": 53021656, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:22:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021596</a><br>again is this some sort of weird psyop? there are jobs for phone screening", "time": 1672078921, "resto": 53021015, "id": "EAveVtyD"}, {"no": 53021691, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:24:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021359</a><br>kek nice one", "time": 1672079065, "resto": 53021015, "id": "f3qP3qqL"}, {"no": 53021761, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:33:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021656</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this nigga things reality tv is real</span>", "time": 1672079627, "resto": 53021015, "id": "Qj0//pKn"}, {"no": 53021771, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53021656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53021656</a><br>Yeah, but they still have a broadcast delay.

Speed and efficiency. GRT uses subgraphs which in turn requires constant connections between indexers and nodes and connections of data. This requires resync of the nodes and reindexing of the data. Just imagine refreshing all the time. This takes a lot of time. PRQ has already done this and has the data waiting for you in a data pool.<br><br>2. Reliability. PRQ is \u201cmostly\u201d centralized. GRT and subgraphs fall prey to one of their verifiers moving to a more lucrative sub graph. What happens then? Well the integrity of the data is lost even for only a short period of time. This is also why the main argument against chainlink is why would they need link if they can build their own centralized oracle? In the case for PRQ there is already a centralized solution ready for you RIGHT NOW. <br><br>3. Customizability. Data lakes are superior to subgraphs because they do everything of the same but also allow either PARSIQ or yourselves to create you customized pools of data specific to anyway you want it. This makes the job of developers working in projects 10x easier. Again, request response time is not always consistent with nodes \u2014 any Web3 developer would confirm that because nodes tend to drop from time to time they are neither the easiest nor the most reliable source of data. This is not to suggest that nodes are unimportant! Rather, it is only to point out that, when looking at the case at hand (i.e., ease for both back-end and front-end development), they are not the top choice.<br><br>THERE IS NO NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED DATA EXTRACTION WHEN THE DATA IS ALREADY COMING FROM DECENTRALIZED BLOCKS!!! The decentralization is only necessary in proving the data hasn\u2019t been tampered with.

It&#039;s centralized. Centralization is faster and easier than decentralization.<br>2. It evolves more rapidly. PRQ&#039;s team has already moved on to a completely new project, while GRT&#039;s team is still working its first project.<br>3. Small and scrappy. GRT has a team of dozens if not hundreds of people, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. PRQ has a small team and very little money, so it knows how to fight for its survival and relevance with limited resources.<br>4. Legality. PRQ&#039;s business confidently operates in full compliance with the law of the United Kingdom. GRT indexes the data of sanctioned smart contracts, its DAOs are incorporated in tax havens, and some of its validators run in countries of questionable diplomatic standing. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t want anyone to control it, and this is wrong.<br>5. Affordability. GRT makes its users pay fees for its services. PRQ just asks that its users hold the token for services, and sell it when they&#039;re done.<br>6. Focus. PRQ&#039;s small team is focused on lots of different projects at once. GRT is focused on one project, and it doesn&#039;t even lend NFTs.<br>7. For the common man. PRQ has lots of small customers. GRT is used by amoral global entities like Goldman Sachs and the WEF.<br>8. Economics. GRT holders have to stake to earn a worthwhile cut of fees, and risk volatility with their investments. PRQ is a real business that gets paid directly for its services without a need for frivolous nonsense like profit sharing or value accrual.<br>9. Marketing. PRQ isn&#039;t afraid to talk about price action and predictions on official outlets. GRT aggressively discourages it in all their official communities and communications.<br>10. Specialization. PRQ was built by engineers. GRT has to hire engineers, cryptographers, data scientists, financial analysts, designers, and devrels to help build their product, and that&#039;s expensive.", "time": 1671871962, "resto": 52993237, "id": "FC9F7UB+"}, {"no": 53001084, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:41:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52999004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52999004</a><br>How can you say that 99% of the tokens are released when the circulating supply is 170 million and the total is like 300 million?", "time": 1671874878, "resto": 52993237, "id": "IohuMduE"}, {"no": 53001170, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:12:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000769</a><br>Yeah don&#039;t trust that guy on that kind of info, he claimed GRT could not go below 10c, which is why he&#039;s now shilling PRQ lmao", "time": 1671876747, "resto": 52993237, "id": "jLJNQvLI"}, {"no": 53001198, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p53000940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53000940</a><br>Who&#039;s meant to fall for this bait?", "time": 1671877210, "resto": 52993237, "id": "YmuIbZEV"}, {"no": 53001212, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:24:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>Should we buy their new token when it&#039;s released?", "time": 1671877487, "resto": 52993237, "id": "ftj8mLGM"}, {"no": 53001228, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:28:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p52993237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;52993237</a><br>999999 other shitcoin scams claimed this retarded shit (surely your pajeet coin partnered with aws) and of course not even the most established cryptos are used in any of that.", "time": 1671877736, "resto": 52993237, "id": "5jmbcW24"}, {"no": 53001269, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:38:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "because they don&#039;t plan to use their Reserve which is locked atm.

Why does he only mention that, I wonder? And how many times has he been wrong again?

And, well, look at it now. Strangely enough, after it inevitably dumped below that price, he pivoted into shilling PRQ instead and shitting on GRT. I wonder why? My guess is that he only wants you to pump his bags to get his 2x~10x, which is actually feasible by /biz/ on such a low mcap/liq coin in the short to medium term, at which point he&#039;ll just dump on you and move onto another coin.

As long as you live in the general region of where your company runs it doesn&#039;t matter where you live, until your truck needs repairs/servicing anyways. You can read more on trucker report.
