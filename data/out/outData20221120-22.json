Generally, the only obstacle to stealth camping successfully is figuring out where to leave your car. Some parks allow overnight parking so they&#039;ll only bust you if they see you crawling out of your sleeping bag in the morning. Other parks will give a warning/ticket to any car parked overnight unless you&#039;re displaying a permit for backcountry camping. In my park, you&#039;d probably have a 50/50 chance of getting a warning or a ticket if you were busted doing this.<br>The obvious solution is to leave your car in a National Forest lot, or in town (many parks have free shuttles from town into the park).<br>Once on the trail, you just have to avoid backcountry rangers who will ask you for your camping permit. Honestly your odds of encountering one of these guys is very low, but all the same it&#039;s best to minimize your time on trail, or have an alibi ready.<br>Wherever you camp, make sure it&#039;s well off the trail. Check your map to make sure.

He is white, or black-and-white, or black, with the black mouth and under-lip of his race. He is a sharp, intelligent, quaint companion, and has the &quot;homing&quot; faculty of a pigeon.

These are essential qualities in a dog whose owner frequently hunts truffles at night - in the shrubberies of mansions protected by keepers and watchmen, who regard him with suspicion. In order to distinguish a black dog on these occasions, the hunter furnishes his animal with a white shirt, and occasionally also hunts him in a line.<br><br>These dogs are rather longer on the leg than the true poodle, but have exquisite noses, and hunt close to the ground. On the scent of a truffle (especially in the morning or evening, when it gives out most smell), they show all the keenness of a spaniel, working their short-cropped tails, and feathering along the surface of the ground for from twenty to fifty yards. Arrived at the spot where the fungus lies buried, some two or three inches beneath the surface, they dig like a terrier at a rat&#039;s hole, and the best of them, if let alone, will disinter the fungus and carry it to his master. It is not usual, however, to allow the dog to exhaust himself in this way, and the owner forks up the truffle and gives the dog his usual reward, a piece of bread or cheese; for this he looks, from long habit, with the keen glance of a Spanish gipsy.", "filename": "957af7f17f9936428f86487c151b004e", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1066, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668761442838864, "time": 1668761442, "md5": "aIcrRpEFgG1j22nRk3RSAw==", "fsize": 163483, "resto": 2496525}, {"no": 2497774, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)10:15:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497256</a><br>Has some Jagdterrier in him", "time": 1668784505, "resto": 2496525}, {"no": 2498597, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)22:29:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497657</a><br>Put a collar on him, I&#039;ve adopted bush mutts before and it&#039;s always worth having a collar on them, just in case.
