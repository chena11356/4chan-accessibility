Also any criticisms or better options should be talked about here. <br><br>Ill first go by stating the things no anon should ever cheap out on.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;boots</span><br>you should aim for boots over 200$ price range eventually, but if you are just getting started buy military surplus boots. But If you can avoid do not buy the recent desert tan army boots that run 20$. They have very thick soles and no ankle support , its a good way to give yourself a sprang ankle, they are also not very breathable or water proof. But I used them for a year so they are workable but do have a week or 2 brake in period.<br><br>Next is backpacks I see many on here choose a military surplus backpack, My experience with a US military molle 2 rucksack is that its usable at best but too heavy. Military sacrifices price and quality material for an indestructible pack that an idiot can&#039;t destroy. You are better off with a used frame backpack or internal backpack. <br><br>I have found that most milltary backpacks are around 65-120$ a used backpacking bag is around 20$ on shopgoodwill.com. I hear you say that you don&#039;t want to stand out in the woods , I would say their are plenty of waterproof rain flys for your bag that come in non-IRreflective camo for 45$ or a Chinese rain fly for 10$ on amazon, which are better than what ever camo you were thinking about buying any how. A good capacity is 65 liters, this is considered 3 day bag but if your smart you can fit rations for a full week in it. 55 liters is fine but the limit for fitting a sleeping bag and not limiting the gear you might want to take. Finally you need to have a waist support for your backpack as well as a frame , this should go without saying a duffel bag is a pain to hull around 5 miles.", "filename": "secondmistake", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669760788941772, "time": 1669760788, "md5": "JEXrHsTMneulq/XreKGk9g==", "fsize": 755994, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "beginner-gear-general-poor-fag-edition", "replies": 49, "images": 11, "omitted_posts": 44, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 2507236, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)10:04:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2507218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2507218</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$50 for an ALICE pack</span><br>Not worth it.

Long time no see! <br><br>I need your help. <br><br>I decided that 4chan would be the best place for me to ask because you&#039;re all so Chadly and charming and personable. Kind of. <br><br>Anyway I recently joined a local hiking group on Meetup.com with the hopes of making some irl friends and maybe a gf that I can go do stuff with so I&#039;m not so alone all the time. I normally don&#039;t bother hiking locally much because it&#039;s all basic bitch shit compared to the east and west and overseas and pretty much anywhere really. I would be more willing to if I had someone to talk to besides myself. Normally it&#039;s rather boring and basic like I said earlier. <br><br>I consider myself to be an expert level hiker with extensive experience including solo backpacking trips, a weeklong portage in the Boundary Waters, and some high altitude mountaineering including several Colorado 14ers and guided high altitude expeditions. On the downside, my social skills aren&#039;t the very best in the world. I&#039;m shy. When I do talk, people find me a little off-putting and weird I guess. I can tell by their reactions sometimes. I have a little better luck talking to people in the outdoors because of common interests and that is why I consider Meetup.com type meetups to be my best chance to find friendship and maybe love. <br><br>So I want to make some friends but am afraid of looking like a total cringelord and driving everyone away from the group. Based on the information above what are my chances of success? Also post your own group hike experiences if you have them.

I have about 300 acres of private land to work with. There isn\u2019t much elevation. It\u2019s pretty flat. I was going to use the Ozark 11 person tent in pic related to sleep in. I was going to get a large tarp from Harbor freight to string up over the top of this in some trees for extra cover. It\u2019s really just so I can have a porch like area to cook on a camp stove, but I think it would come in handy if there\u2019s any heavy rain. Taking recommendations for a camp stove around $100. It does have to be light as I won\u2019t be backpacking with it. Just sleeping there on weekends I go hunt. I\u2019m tired of driving the 30 minutes to go hunt in the mornings. And I\u2019ll only be leaving this up for a few months. For sleep, I was going to get a Coleman camp cot. Other stuff I\u2019ll bring, old pots and pans, a storage truck, a cooler and a small gas generator (it\u2019s a 1400 watt predator from harbor freight). I\u2019m just looking to get some insight on whether this is a good idea. If I had more money I\u2019d get a nicer 4 season tent, but I\u2019ve camped out here in winter in my two person wenzel 3 season tent and was actually a little warm in a winter sleeping bag.

Cost maybe 20-50 cents a dose here. Worms are going to slow their growth and if you are buying weaned store lambs from elsewhere you may have a timeframe you want to finish them in to take your profit, this also means in effect a weight gain target, not to mention worms affect on digestion is also going to leave them with dags for you to deal with. It&#039;s quite common here in NZ to round up lambs monthly and give them a drench to leave them with minimal worm burden but yeah it&#039;s also going to depend on the level of parasites present on the farm and the level of resilience bred into the stock how much good it is going to do, some breeders may run a program where they won&#039;t drench and simply cull those who can&#039;t handle themselves.. Another thing to watch is parasites which develop resistance to the chemicals in some cases and which can be moved from farm to farm inside the animals if they have not been drenched just a few days prior to movement or drench and quarantined on arrival .t finish about 2000 lambs a year when I want to (sheep are a pain in my ass and sometimes run less and more cattle instead)", "time": 1670449085, "resto": 2503555}, {"no": 2506450, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)16:42:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504242</a><br>Yeah save yourself the work and pass it on to the poor bastard on the handpiece right my guy.

More, living bacteria has been found in rock hundreds of feet below the seabed of the bottom of the ocean and sealife has been found under parts of the Antarctic ice sheets and unique bacteria has been found in isolated antarctic ice lakes.", "time": 1670288849, "resto": 2503556}, {"no": 2505819, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)20:46:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505803</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;writes a short story </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I still read it and have zero regrets </span><br>have a (you), James Cameron", "filename": "xSully_Main_Endeavor_Field.jpg,qitok=k1INKxih.pagespeed.ic.aj0CtjKuZ5", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1670291203873014, "time": 1670291203, "md5": "fRHWffsRkX21OzHl6j5HOw==", "fsize": 76396, "resto": 2503556}, {"no": 2506109, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)15:50:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2503740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503740</a><br>That&#039;s not a crustacean you retard", "time": 1670359837, "resto": 2503556}, {"no": 2506382, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)13:40:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2506109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2506109</a><br>I guarantee you there are crabs", "time": 1670438406, "resto": 2503556}, {"no": 2506446, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)16:22:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2506382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2506382</a>", "filename": "Leo", "ext": ".png", "w": 680, "h": 680, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670448172131722, "time": 1670448172, "md5": "15KnT4iJqRHh1AyFAmoFQw==", "fsize": 562133, "resto": 2503556}], "last_modified": 1670448172}, {"no": 2506000, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)06:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "America /out/ guide", "com": "going to the US some time next year<br>couldn&#039;t care less about the shithole cities so i plan to hit every site of natural beauty i can in my time there<br>what are the must do /out/ings?<br>seen and heard amazing things about the national parks, are they all worth a visit or can some be avoided?<br>any places worth going that aren&#039;t classified as national parks?<br>i am experienced and not adverse to mountain climbing and multi day hikes<br>thanks lads", "filename": "Jeff-Krause-800x480", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 480, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1670326096845894, "time": 1670326096, "md5": "CCZLpw+LfnkdWZnjj89URg==", "fsize": 150650, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "america-out-guide", "replies": 8, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 2506013, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)07:59:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2506000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2506000</a><br>What time of year?
