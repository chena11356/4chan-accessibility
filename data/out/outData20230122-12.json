There are fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and reefs and shit to explore, and studying oceanic biomes can be useful, even profitable.

First of all, though, I&#039;d take both of them out of their pots and make sure the roots are still healthy. The yellowing leaves on the Dracaena don&#039;t sound good, but that could be because it&#039;s getting way too little, or way too much water. The soil looks dry in the picture, but it doesn&#039;t look like the pots have a drainage hole, so the soil at the bottom could still be pretty wet, especially if you&#039;re watering them rather frequently. I&#039;ve found that the desert type Dracaena need really well-draining soil, as in pretty much just rocks and little to nothing else, to not die in cultivation.<br>Also, red leaves on an Operculicarya are normal if it gets a lot of UV light.

It would be a waste of time and energy for me to baton because the size wood I need is always available.<br>Anyway, it is 5 degrees F outside, snow is covering the yard, I have a nice fire going in my wood stove. The power and all utilities are on. I have a nice cup of coffee and the sun is about to come up this morning. I am truly blessed here in my Appalachian refuge and wish the best for all of you all wherever you may be.", "time": 1671968356, "resto": 2506652}, {"no": 2514802, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:55:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2514790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2514790</a><br>echoing this post.<br>i want to know where you anons who think you need to baton wood live. the only time i&#039;ve ever actually needed to baton wood is in the deep winter when standing deadwood is my only option for a fire and i didn&#039;t bring proper tools to process it. usually in that sort of weather and area i&#039;m preparing to not need a fire in the first place anyways. its a useful skill to know but the actual use cases for it are incredibly narrow unless you&#039;re just doing it for the sake of the entertainment value and rush you get from doing the thing having-a-dad-replacement bushcrafterbob3489274 on youtube taught you how to do. <br>a lot of the more serious backpackers i know have never batonned wood before. handy skill to know. just not a skill you ever actually even really need.", "time": 1671969319, "resto": 2506652}, {"no": 2515799, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)10:58:14", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "vagace", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1229, "h": 1326, "tn_w": 115, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672156694569090, "time": 1672156694, "md5": "qpY9ZpdhWJ+aHM7UJIOGtA==", "fsize": 204106, "resto": 2506652}, {"no": 2517373, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)11:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2514566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2514566</a><br><br>Condor make some pretty good stuff.

Umbrellas are very situationally dependent. Sometimes they\u2019re absolutely the best option, and sometimes there are better options out there. If there\u2019s a lot of wind driven rain (and I mean a lot, not just a slight breeze in a light drizzle), you might be better off with a jacket. If the trail is really over grown (basically bushwhacking; a little overgrowth won\u2019t hurt anything), then your umbrella may get snagged too often.<br><br>Where they work well is light to moderate rain. Just as a rain jacket is paired with pants, an umbrella can do the same. They also pair well with a very light jacket, such as a water resistant running jacket. That combo provides heavy protection from rain via the umbrella while the jacket keeps any blowback from soaking you, and it\u2019s still more breathable than most options. A lot of thruhikers are using this combo now. It\u2019s pretty versatile; if it\u2019s not raining too hard you leave the jacket off and use just the umbrella (unlike just a rain jacket, where it\u2019s all or nothing). <br><br>Breathability is a huge umbrella advantage. It\u2019s why it\u2019s the absolute best rain protection in hot environments during rainy summers. In the South, rain showers spring up out of nowhere, and dissipate just as quickly. They\u2019re so scattered that raining while the sun is out is fairly common.

I just talked to myself at a normal volume and he kept walking away.<br>On the other hand, I was with a group of 3 and we were walking along another tundra hillside. We saw a black bear below us. We immediately began yelling and making noise to scare it away. This time, the thing developed a keen interest in us. It stayed in the valley for the entire day.<br>That showed me that bears respond badly to perceived challenges, just like people. You should only start making noise/freaking out once the bear shows interest in you.

Anyway, I was hiking, desperately looking for flat ground in order to set it up and had luckily found a nice little clearing off the trail and past the treeline. By the time I had that gay tent up, it was dark so I went back to my bag to rummage for my headlamp. While I was in my bag, I started hearing this metallic banging noise, kind of like someone hitting a homerun with an aluminum bat. I was spooked because I am absolutely certain I was no where near any sort of private property. I kind of just shrugged it off as another camper set up not too far off, not usual but not impossible. Well the noise started getting closer and louder and the closer and louder it got, the more adrenaline that started to pump into my veins. Of course the noise was now in the immediate vicinity so I cut my headlamp on and aimed it towards the source. On both sides of the tree was the silhouette of a massive creature, extremely wide and tall. I fucking SHIT myself. I froze and couldnt breathe. The silhouette urked around the tree and into the light. It was a bloodied US Senator John Fetterman bashing his forehead into every tree he passed. He muttered good morning and then something about fracking and then continued on into the treeline as if I wasn&#039;t just standing three feet away from him. <br><br>Absolutely terrifying experience, I don&#039;t hike without a gun now.", "time": 1668023773, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494078, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)16:04:45", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1638258050725", "ext": ".png", "w": 1376, "h": 3784, "tn_w": 45, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668027885243189, "time": 1668027885, "md5": "z0f6+6kGqJxoTylMhfYeHw==", "fsize": 1689554, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494328, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)05:39:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;go in a woods with decathlon gear</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;night outside home is cold, wet and dark</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also I can&#039;t sleep</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hear spooky noise, like something whipping against tent</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;open eyes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;big honking eyes stare at me, giant cold, wet nose touching minr</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s my dog cause I&#039;m camping in backyard</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sleep with dog, all is well now</span><br><br>The spooky noise was the tail being wagged against the tent", "time": 1668076767, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494334, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)05:53:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494078</a><br>Spoopy.", "time": 1668077592, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494348, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)07:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2493450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493450</a><br><a href=\"#p2493530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493530</a><br>I went back and zoomed in.

The feeling grew until it hit hard. I felt like I was being watched, hunted. The mist didnt help, but it was weird. Im not used to feeling like that, especially in such a local area. I kept going until I reached the bridge. I considered crossing and heading to the fishing pond to sit like I sometimes do, but I couldnt shake that prickling down my back and the fear, so I turned up the path I was on when I saw the beast, a week or so later, and headed on up and out of the park. The feeling died off as I passed the old building I was planning to explore for the challenge, and had all but faded by the time I reached the old visitor centre only a hundred or so metres further.

I was walking back from town a couple of years back and crossing the park - really just a field with a river on one side and some play equipment - behind my house when I noticed a triangle of blueish white lights in the sky, just hovering there. Focusing on them I noted that there was a dark triangle shape between the lights, with the lights at the corner. Abruptly the craft accelerated away on a curve. It accelerated way too fast to have been anything modern, and way too fluidly. It also made no noise, and it was a quiet night so I would have heard something if it had engines of our current tech spec.<br><br>Been thinking about any other spooky encounters ive had whilst at work, but theres not much I can recall.

Along the back theres a river, and upstream a weir that ran into a pool on the far side of the canal bridge. We used to go bathing up there, and it was fine when you were with people, but it felt wrong, not in the naughty way but in the creepy &quot;something is not right here&quot; when alone. There could be people on the other side of the bridge and it would still feel off, but it really became scary when there was noone around. I did dismiss it initially as just nerves, maybe some ancestral fear of still bodies of water which were opaque, as primordial predators could lurk in them. Anyway at one point I found a kayak that had been washed down by the floods, and my class and I played about with it up there. Nothing really happened with other people, as I said, and we used to paddle around the pool (it wasnt deep, you could wade through it. 4 - 5 feet at the most I would say)<br>A couple of times I went up there on my own with the kayak. Now, we had all swam in the pool, and it was empty. There where NO underwater objects or protrusions. Shit, I waded through it. But when you were up there in the pool in the kayak, alone, you would hear noises, as though underwater twigs or fingernails were scraping on the hull. It was really creepy, and I used to get nervous about even paddling with my hands (we didnt have a paddle).<br>To one side - the lower in the picture - there is a cut away in the concrete basin for some vents or drains of some kind, and that always made me really nervous, even a little fearful. I pushed myself to wade to it once, and look at it, but I couldnt bring myself to step into it, even though it was relatively shallow compared to the rest of the pool.<br>If it was just me I might have dismissed it, but it wasnt. A few classmates also mentioned that the pool was really creepy when alone, and that they had also heard the scraping too.<br>Pic related, its the pool.", "filename": "Myerscough", "ext": ".png", "w": 1113, "h": 643, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1668466492572965, "time": 1668466492, "md5": "/pAHTlT1DBXATEkngA8MNA==", "fsize": 1813238, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2496792, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)20:42:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2496339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2496339</a><br>Very fucking spooky.

Fortunately no arrests were made, few days later one good guy, I was kinda friends with him, came to work as usual and died suddenly during dinner break, then few days later couple of other guys from my team robbed our team lead at knifepoint.

Hammocks and tarp campers are cut from the same cloth so to speak, the thing that people get hung up on is that there&#039;s many ways of doing everything and people constantly fiddle with their set ups. A big advantage of a tent when starting out is that it only goes up one way. When you&#039;re just starting out it might not be the worst idea simply because at the end of the day you can just select a site and do things the same way each time. A hammock or tarp&#039;s flexibility is also a challenge as you get kind of option overloaded. If you&#039;re still a beginner it may be better to just go with a decent tent and get dialed in on all the other things insofar as gear and planning, then complicate the shelter arrangement.

ENO and most Amazon hammocks are too short for most actual men. <br><br>Make a structural ridge line. It\u2019s a rope with two permanent loops on either end. Make it 83% the length of your hammock (about 110\u201d if you have an 11\u2019 hammock). This ensures that you\u2019re always hanging at 30\u00b0 no matter what your suspension is doing. They\u2019re pretty cheap if you want to just buy one, but it\u2019s super easy to make.<br><br>Hang the foot end higher than the head end. This will prevent you from having the sensation that you\u2019re constantly sliding down whenever you readjust. Play around with it; I like mine about a foot higher.<br><br>Lie on an angle.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out. My house looks like any other 1960&#039;s Australian fibro cottage but I take a working holiday every couple of years to Taree as a cattle drover and stay in pic-related.<br><br>I want to talk about how hard it is to be green, but it really isn&#039;t.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck.

Much better than trying to stomp through snow for several miles. The pic I posted had snow ranging from heel height to above knee height which will drain you quickly without any snowshoes/skis. Skis are also nice obviously, but I find snowshoes to be easier to deal with in this terrain. The ones I have are 30&quot; snowshoes, metal frame and deep spikes, rated at a weight up to about 125kg/275lbs ish depending on snow conditions. Most people will do fine with a 25&quot;, but thats up to your total weigth. Obviously it&#039;s a bit weird to use if you&#039;ve never used snowshoes before, as you may have to get used to a slightly wider walking stance depending on the snowshoes, but I&#039;ve used much wider ones before that I&#039;ve ran in, so these slimmer ones were a luxury to me.<br>I&#039;d recommend making sure you get the right weight rating; you + your pack + other stuff youre carrying. Heel lift is also a plus if you think you&#039;ll need it. And personally I prefer slim and long, vs short and wide. Of course make sure theyll fit you nicely, this isnt usually an issue for most people as theyll usually adjust to most feet(EU38-47). Just make sure to double check.

Flakes tend to hold onto moisture extremely well. Even if they feel dry to the touch, they\u2019re probably still way more moist than any other ribbon cut tobacco you own. The drying time is necessary before packing. Virginia flakes also expand quite a lot once they get hot, meaning a loose pack is essential. If you pack it using the three pack method like a ribbon cut, it may be fine before you light it, but as soon as it warms up it\u2019s going to expand so much that no oxygen will be able to reach the tobacco, making the ember go out extremely quickly. And because it expands, tamping regularly will compact the tobacco even more, which will make it unsmokable, so you\u2019ll always want to go for a relight first when smoking a flake, and only tamp when absolutely necessary.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

It was possible to play in many ways (play with softair rifles, or dig trenches, or build treehouses, or shelters) that you simply didn&#039;t have the space for at home. The biggest draw was the feeling of adventure. We&#039;d climb under the electric fence where sheep were held and pet them (sometimes they&#039;d let us sometimes they&#039;d attack us), then again under it back into the forest, we&#039;d sometimes &quot;steal&quot; honey from some beeskeeper (he knew, but he also knew we wouldn&#039;t take much, so he let it happen), we&#039;d search for treasure, go in places that were forbidden (a old mine and a forest bunker were favorites) and sometimes we&#039;d go looking for animals.

While keeping the bottle upside down works well in and around freezing temps, it is not up to the task when it gets much colder. If you are carrying a bottle you can put it in a long and roomy sock, split the upper part of the sock and tie it around your neck, keeping it hanging on chest level beneath your wind stopper/shell layer and on the outside of your wool liner. This is so effective that it can after a long ruck yield lukewarm water, and while you are walking or skiing you can refill the bottle in increments with snow or ice without fear of it freezing allowing you to use less fuel per day. Now bladder systems are also feasible in the winter time, however it is more strenuous to keep warm. Optimally if you can the water bladder should be carried underneath your wind stopper or shell layer, with the tube being routed through the sleeves of your jacket, this will keep it warm and it will never freeze, but it will severely fuck with your ability to wear a backpack. This is the most secure way to carry a water bladder in truly cold weather, i only do this when i use my pulk sled instead of a backpack. Now if you don&#039;t have access to a sled, or the terrain/snow cover isn&#039;t suitable for one you can also carry water bladders within the backpack, but then it is vital to blow air through the tube after you drink, as the tube is most at risk of freezing while the bladder, if carried against the back of the backpack will most likely not freeze. So be very disciplined with blowing the water back into the bladder each time you take a sip. If you slip up and it freezes you can detach the hose and let it hang down your pants which will fix the issue after some time.", "time": 1674301644, "resto": 2527921}, {"no": 2528340, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:56:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2527921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2527921</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In boy scouts the they would always say &quot;be careful turning ice and snow into water, it can use up to much energy if you take it in cold&quot;</span><br>melting snow/ice takes a lot more energy than heating water<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What tips and tricks are used by /out/ to get and keep water below freezing?</span><br>I make tea and drink that, I get water either by melting and boiling snow or from springs", "time": 1674302206, "resto": 2527921}, {"no": 2528341, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:58:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2528339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2528339</a><br>I forgot to add, normal bladder systems can be carried on your chest if you are carrying a backpack, but this will also get in the way of comfort to a degree.

Beneath the surface is a mycelium system that spawns the fruiting bodies in an area that consistently produces mushrooms. I assume the best way to proliferate a desired fruiting body is to first proliferate mycelium growth (maybe by spreading nutrient substrate around the area), or to spread spores over the desired area during ideal weather conditions and over an ideal substrate in ideal locations to promote growth (ie under a damp log or on moist sheltered leaf litter during a cool rainy season, dependent on species).

Blackberry tickets are now the dominate form of ground vegetation. Pretty sure I can see the top of the cliff, if I can just make it through all of these blackberries. Finally get to the top only to find out there&#039;s an eight foot tall chainlink fence topped with barbed wire. Also a sign about a huge fine for being on the wrong side of the fence. Stand there trying to decide what to do when some Karens walk past on the other side of the fence. Pretty sure they&#039;re going to call the police, so I find a section of the fence where the barbed wire has been cut and climb over it there. Haven&#039;t climbed a chainlink fence in decades but I make it over. My shoes are filled with bits of blackberry thicket but I can&#039;t stop now, the police might be showing up any second.

I was looking at the Connor specifically as a consideration for a day pack, as I&#039;m not a big fan of top loading bucket style packs in general. I was mostly curious about them because the few people who actually have experience with them seem to rave about the comfort of their harness.

She was very young and starving, so I&#039;ve started feeding her and give her treats when she kills mice. Now, during the day she often wanders around with my chickens, and they share both cat and chicken food. She has always been very skittish, and is afraid when approached by more than two chickens at a time. She has recently started wandering into my chicken coop during the days, likely eating chicken food and drinking their water. <br><br>Tonight, she managed to hide in the coop during headcount and was closed inside. I was wondering if this is something I should let happen or if I should try to make her get out. She&#039;s been fine so far, and is curled up sleeping on the other side of the coop, and the chickens are all in their standard places except one which has chosen to sleep in the outside area of their house. For reference, they are all total free range chickens and they have a small enclosed coop to nest in with a covered fenced in 5&#039; x 3&#039; outside area where they have extra bedding, food, and water. She has never attacked, hissed at, or swatted any of the chickens but I&#039;m worried when they all stir in the morning and she is antsy to get out they may end up fighting. I have six hens and one rooster, the rooster is more skittish than any of the hens and generally runs away from the cat, so I don&#039;t think he would peck her or anything, but the hens can get very snappy. <br><br>Anyone have any experience or advice for this?", "filename": "chiknecn", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1674100978120175, "time": 1674100978, "md5": "joAD5ifCEQNx/OqK7iQ/iQ==", "fsize": 55251, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cat-in-the-coop", "replies": 32, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 20}, {"no": 2527250, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)23:06:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2527248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2527248</a><br>kill the cat", "time": 1674101218, "resto": 2527248}, {"no": 2527251, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)23:10:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2527250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2527250</a><br>The cat kills mice and keeps other cats and raccoons away from the yard, so I would rather not", "time": 1674101426, "resto": 2527248}, {"no": 2527255, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)23:18:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2527248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2527248</a><br>I&#039;d kill it, honestly.

Cold soak oats with powder milk, peanut butter and breakfast bars, granola, dried fruit are my usual go-tos as I don&#039;t like to make anything more than coffee in the morning, would rather pack up and be ready to move sooner or eat on the trail.<br>Lunch: Same as above, although I don&#039;t always eat big. Its a little easier to snack during the hike and keep energy up rather than eat a big meal and try to walk. Again, mostly no cook options. Peanut butter, dried fruit, hard cheese, meat. If the weather is cool your options expand.<br>Dinner: I prefer to boil water, pour it into my cookpot and be ready in 10-15min. Cooking on pocket stoves mostly sucks as much as I&#039;ve tried. I try to limit it to heating water, oil, and maybe meat before it goes into something else. It&#039;s usually more sausage or other meat added to knorr sides, instant mashed potatoes, brown rice mixed with dehydrated veggies. I try to get the bulk of my protein in and mostly just stay up on calorie intake. I carry a container of olive oil for calories and to keep pasta/potatoes from being congealed messes. I do try to bring some spices to change stuff up. Spam singles do well. I don&#039;t like to bring a lot of canned stuff but for shorter duration trips I do like canned fish since you get protein, often some kind of oil base, and a sauce or spices all in one.<br><br>As far as a cooking if you want to deal with it there&#039;s almost nothing you can&#039;t do in the woods. If it&#039;s one pot at home it&#039;s one pot in the woods, just limited to what you feel like doing. Don&#039;t be afraid to pre-cut or mix stuff and get creative with repackaging.

Not because mean temperatures were lower but because the yearly cycle presented a greater diversity of environments and required much more foresight. Between \u2018summer\u2019 and \u2018winter,\u2019 the differences are much greater in the temperate and arctic zones than in the tropics.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This point is elaborated upon by Hoffecker (2002, p. 135). Among early modern humans, tools and weapons were more complex at arctic latitudes than at tropical latitudes. \u201cTechnological complexity in colder environments seems to reflect the need for greater foraging efficiency in settings where many resources are available only for limited periods of time.\u201d Arctic humans coped with resource fluctuations and high mobility requirements by planning ahead and by developing untended devices (e.g., traps and snares) and means of food storage.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In addition, these increased cognitive demands fell on both men and women. Paternal and maternal investment were much more equal than in the tropics, where women provided for their families year-round with less male assistance (Kelly, 1995, pp. 268-269; Martin, 1974, pp. 16-18). Indeed, because men were the main food providers beyond the tropical zone, women could care for their families by developing a new range of tasks: food processing (e.g., butchery and carcass transport); shelter building; garment making; leather working; transport of material goods; etc. (Waguespack, 2005).

If you spend some time customizing the experience, you get the game tailored for you. 8.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Forest</span><br>Surviving is very basic. Construction is not very complex and enemy AI is bad. Good fun for the first 20 hours, but then it gets pretty stale as a survival game and turns into a monster fighting RPG. 6/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Project Zomboid</span><br>Artstyle and UI is very oldschool, but there is a deep and rich gameplay. On singleplayer, after you build your base the game basically ends. The fun is in multiplayer, but then it becomes a sort of grindy base battle royale(Rust/DayZ). Great game for urban survival. 9/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Green Hell</span><br>Probably the best survival game, but has a small non-procedural map(About 30hrs of gameplay). 9.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7 days to die</span><br>Another deep and rich gameplay, but the some skills makes it feels more &quot;gamey&quot; than a real survival. Blood moon hordes and radioactive zombies are too much fantasy for me. 8/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rain World</span><br>Not a human survival game, but a very good one. The wild monsters give insane fear goosebumps, and it actually feels like a real survival experience. 9.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Valheim</span><br>Way more of a Crafting RPG than a survival. Modded Minecraft is better. 7.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Long Dark</span><br>I refunded this game. Game feels extremely linear due to story mode and gameplay just feels unnecessary punishing, intead of just difficult. 2/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This War of Mine</span><br>Good game, but only played 3 times since base gameplay is not very replayable. DLCs are decent, but they are story driven instead of gameplay driven. 7.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dont Starve Together</span><br>Insane way of interpretating seasons. You start in summer collecting resources, prepared things during autumn, try to survive the cold winter with low food, then you have wet rainy spring. Then it is summer again, but this time with harsh desert-like sun and new wild creatures. Solid survival, but then it turns into an exploration RPG. 9/10", "time": 1673682294, "resto": 2499608}, {"no": 2524817, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)03:38:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524806</a><br>No one who likes the long dark does it because of story mode, that one&#039;s only there to draw normalfags", "time": 1673685513, "resto": 2499608}, {"no": 2524826, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:00:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2499608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2499608</a><br>Whenever I play games now, I focus on taking screenshots of scenery just like I do irl.

It should have a few things: <br>* a structure you can intutitively understand: Some are ordered by family, some by habitat, some by leaf type. As long as it makes sense to you and you can look something up quickly it&#039;s good. If you can&#039;t, it&#039;s bad. Stay away from alphabetical ones. <br>* Good pictures: You should have pictures that show the relevant parts of the plant in such a way that you can reliably feel confident the picture is the actual plant you are looking at. If the pictures are ass, so is the book. Don&#039;t buy it.<br>* A mention of uses for any given plant: This can be medicinal, or culinary, or historical. Personal preference, but it should mention how to use them<br>* Poison lookalikes: Any plant in this guide should have a section that states what other plants look like the one you are looking for, how to tell them apart and if the lookalikes are poisonous or not. If this information is missing, do not get the book. <br>* Good formfactor: Also personal preference. Smaller is better to carry, but means either less information or worse organization. Bigger means nicer pictures and more info, for more weight and bulk. It should at the very least fit into a backpack, at best into a pocket.<br>* Seasonal calendar: Bonus if there&#039;s a calendar showing what&#039;s in season each month<br><br>Then just go outside and start foraging. I read the book when I got it once, but forgot 95% of the info instantly. Then when outside I try to identify plants and think of how to use them. You will grow your knowledge slowly.

I do all sorts of mechanic work and sometimes I find that I forgot a tool or my toolbox is far away so it\u2019s handy to have in your pocket, the job requires screwdrivers and pliers so I used them all the time, and the little folding knife is handy to have just for cutting packages and stuff open, it\u2019s not a serious knife but is perfectly fine for \u201cedc\u201d, and maybe the file here and there, other than that there aren\u2019t many other features of the multitool that I have found useful, and desu I\u2019m not sure what some of them are. I used one of them to punch a new hole in my belt since I lost a few pounds.<br><br>None of the tools on the multitool are perfect replacements for an actual tool, they are just good enough and will work in a pinch, if you find yourself in situations already where you think it would be nice to have, get one, if you don\u2019t run into situations where it could be used, don\u2019t by one. They aren\u2019t for everybody, simple as that.<br><br>They are good for having in a woods since a lot of equipment might require a flathead to take apart like something on your gun or a battery in some sort of light, and it\u2019s a hell of alot lighter than carrying a bunch of screwdrivers.

For example, if you got a pair of old German Bundeswehr boots with the PVC outsoles, you can simply have them repaired for less than $30 if you buy the soles and glue yourself. Old European military surplus are good choices, but try and get them quickly due to the money laundering operation in Ukraine.", "time": 1672731646, "resto": 2518398}, {"no": 2519509, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)03:28:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Because as much as it pains boomers on /out/ synthetic materials are more comfortable, lighter, have better water resistance, can be just as durable and offer added protection against abrasion. <br>And the problem with boots is always the soles that falls apart far earlier than the upper so it&#039;s a non issue and leads us to the question of why don&#039;t we see stitchdown synthetic boots.", "filename": "CHOw2cqXR8_naglev_unico_hiker_hiking-boots_1_original", "ext": ".png", "w": 1162, "h": 1162, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672734488218436, "time": 1672734488, "md5": "SeIOxxru9ErtASOBBdUp+w==", "fsize": 2880673, "resto": 2518398}, {"no": 2519515, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)03:44:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2519509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2519509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why don&#039;t we see stitchdown synthetic boots</span><br>Synthetic boots for any but tropical climates need goretex to be waterproof and breathable.

I do love the smell of spray paint but I imagine petrol would be a lot better as a repellant but waaaay more dangerous if you smoked.

It would be very similar to a tenkara pole, except that it would not be fixed-line: the tip would be an open aperture into the rod blanks, and the fishing line would run through the entire internal length of the pole, guided by several internal eyelets, including a very small one at the rod tip.

Long for everything else. I have caught countless 3-4lb bass on the 7ft with zero issues at all, crappie rods have a softer tip so you can fish light jigs, but enough backbone for crappie(which obviously get bigger than other panfish.) It&#039;s just a good versatile blank with a comfortable long foregrip. I&#039;ve mostly been throwing small hardbaits on it last year and it&#039;s extremely good for that. Once a fish gets hooked they don&#039;t get off because the rod absorbs everything. Only downside is the guides aren&#039;t really made for braid, but I never use braid for light line fishing anyways. Trilene XL 6lb is ridiculously strong yet still limp. Also, the first guide is very small compared to other rods so it&#039;s only really meant to be used with a smaller reel like a 1000/2000 size. I&#039;d pick a Daiwa Regal, Legalis, or Exceler in 1000 size for that, whichever is on sale. If you wanted a more expensive rod you could get a TFO trout/panfish but I haven&#039;t personally used one of those yet. The TFO professional PRO S 702-1 Light power is probably an even better rod for versatility because it&#039;s a bit stiffer, but it only comes in 7ft and it&#039;s an ounce heavier than it needs to be.", "filename": "big_crap1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2042, "h": 3629, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673198346363711, "time": 1673198346, "md5": "syvwdKwGSiDA1q9ptn5sqA==", "fsize": 3768577, "resto": 2522398}, {"no": 2522502, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)12:24:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2522423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2522423</a><br>I don&#039;t want to discourage you but I&#039;m wondering why this basic idea hasn&#039;t taken the fishing world by storm.

Heck, when they did a carp spawning exclusion barrier at one of my local Muskie lakes (to prevent the carp from spawning in spring flood ditches and force them to spawn where the bluegills can Holocaust their nests), within a few years, not only had the size of a \u201cgood\u201d perch fall by a couple inches, but the Largemouth fishery was decimated by lack of recruitment, because the muskies ate all the pounder bass to replace the carp, and the crappie fishery took a hit.

I replaced with shorter stronger hooks, and even changed out to more durable split rings. I\u2019m glad I did too, because I got into some larger ones later. This was last fall. It\u2019s funny you mention repainting. I have dabbled with paints, but I wanted a way to do something on the water, so I started playing around with sharpies. I had an all white top water spook, and it didn\u2019t really get a lot of looks, so I grabbed a plain black sharpie and drew a pattern on it and immediately caught a 3lb bass. I have these brown lures I got for like $0.75 in a clearance, so I bought a colored sharpie set and played around a bit recently. This is the result, and an example of the original side by side. I haven\u2019t really had an opportunity to try it, since I tend to fish differently in the winter. I was trying out a lot of colors, so this pattern is a bit\u2026busy.

I&#039;ve tried sharpies before in black and red but never considered using more colors or painting a whole lure with it. I paint mini&#039;s for another hobby so it felt more normal to want to paint the lure body with an airbrush at my hobby desk - but sharpies have good coverage and come in neat colors like gold and silver. I might try an experiment of my own.<br>Tell us how yours works out in the spring it does look good I must say. <br>Changing the split rings can be really important. I&#039;m going to order some tear shaped split rings in hopes that this will address a problem that I now sometimes encounter with the Rapala BX Swimmer. It should have come with a split ring the size that is on the rapala xrap 12cm but instead comes with a split ring the size of an XR10cm. Making the switch creates a situation where the hook and split ring kind of fold over on the themselves and get jammed up. Hoping to be able to fix that. <br>I love clearance lures but the sad reality is that, one by one several good local tackle stores with physical locations near my closed and now it&#039;s just bass pro shops about a 45min drive away which has a really shitty discount bin. Sail which is an hour away in the other direction which has a decent discount bin but I would basically spend a few bucks on gas just to get there so its not worth it just to regularly peruse a discount bin.<br>The sail location closer to me was close enough to look regularly and a couple of times I picked up cheap lures that turned out to be good. Now I guess I could start stopping at dollarama locations more regularly but I find them to be very sporadic on fishing lures. I bought a lunkerhunt pencil popper there a few months back.<br>But the last time I bought lures I bought them from tacklewarehouse online during a big discount black Friday sale. Overall I was a bit disappointed that Canadian customers really get stiffed in a number of ways ordering from the US - but I won&#039;t rant about that just now.", "filename": "1666136734408967", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673839230617328, "time": 1673839230, "md5": "/AI2Kj4wdMx00vhMcu+7uw==", "fsize": 439338, "resto": 2522398}, {"no": 2525758, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)22:53:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525747</a><br>That really sucks about the fishing purchasing situation bro. Tackle shops struggle here but get enough business to keep going. The best ever clearance I have found was at Walmart ironically. Got a bunch of Rapalas for like $4 one time. But there was a time that they were doing a refurb, and the guy who was pricing out stuff was awesome. I\u2019d bring him something to look at, and he would be like, \u201cYeah, $0.25.\u201d and mark it with a sticker. I got an Ugly Stick ML combo for $7.50, and filled a cart with lures for like $40, including the rod combo.<br><br>I have been a fan of Skid\u2019s flies and got a few recently, so I broke out my decades old Mitchell tuna can fly combo, and finally got my fly line delivered and spooled it this afternoon. I was just too young when I first got it, and I think it was too complex to work out on my own. I didn\u2019t really have anyone around to show me the ropes of fly fishing, so that\u2019s going to be my main focus for a while. I hope to share a post with some Skid fish soon. I will definitely try fishing my sharpie special soon enough. I\u2019ve also done a couple of spoons with the sharpie, so I\u2019ll give them a try as well. One was a red white smaller spoon that I made blue violet for visibility in deeper water, and the other was a really tarnished large gold spoon that I did metallic silver and gold with metallic red and blue accents. I tried polishing it, but the gold was a plating and it sanded off. It\u2019s a salt spoon, so it will be a while before I can give it a try. I\u2019ll post a pic when I get home.

Seemed interesting to me but I mostly fish from the bank so gotta consider that lures need to be rising up in the water column as I retrieve them towards the bank.<br>Been fishing the ripstop along dock pilings too and that did produce a small bass this summer on the clown color we&#039;ll see how that goes.<br>Ripstop is a lot more like the action I would want on a spoon when I fish spoon just below the surface in the mornings of the summer - a lot more darting than an Xrap - we&#039;ll see what happens this summer.<br>I was hoping it would be a bait to use for fall pike but fall pike are too big.
