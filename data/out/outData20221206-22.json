Ive decided on traveling the world starting in europe and ending in asia trough hitchiking and couch surfing mostly. Along the way i am planning on doing alot of hiking. I am quite a begginer in hiking/trekking, and I started to look into the gear i will need. I want quality items that will serve their purpouse in the long run. I wanted to see if you guys have any good lists with loadouts for long, few-month treks that show items needed for long trips, as well as recommendations for good internal frame backpacks with big capacity (50+ liters), ideally not too flashy and coloured (i like a military-type vibe to my gear, lots of black and green), as well as general tips and experiences from people who have done similar things", "filename": "how-to-pack-a-backpack", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 590, "h": 400, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 169, "tim": 1670173596173641, "time": 1670173596, "md5": "q/0/JKBPVdQZ6qLn/cRq3A==", "fsize": 118701, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "loadout-and-gear", "replies": 40, "images": 6, "omitted_posts": 35, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 2505976, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)03:26:15", "name": "Dan Becker", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505919</a><br>Try to get the base weight down to 5-6lbs<br><a href=\"#p2505943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505943</a><br>Don&#039;t be such a brute then.", "time": 1670315175, "resto": 2505224}, {"no": 2506055, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)11:10:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505237</a><br>kek", "time": 1670343019, "resto": 2505224}, {"no": 2506201, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:29:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505669</a><br>Post photos nigga.<br><br><a href=\"#p2505224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505224</a><br>Don&#039;t carry lots of useless shit anon, there&#039;s nothing more annoying that carrying a cumbersome, heavy pack around. <br>After being working abroad I had a layover in Paris and wandering around the city with a 40L backpack and 15kg on the back made it far less enjoyable than it could have been. <br>It&#039;s one thing to carry a backpack in the woods where you can throw it wherever and whenever you please, in the cities and on off public transportation it&#039;s far more unpleasant.", "time": 1670376557, "resto": 2505224}, {"no": 2506204, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:42:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505919</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;40lbs is trailrunning weight for me (25-30miles/day).</span><br>doubt<br><br><a href=\"#p2505915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505915</a><br>you&#039;re saying that to a guy to spent 2year traveling asia, I think the dude knows what he needs, unless <a href=\"#p2505868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505868</a> isn&#039;t <a href=\"#p2505669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505669</a>", "time": 1670377347, "resto": 2505224}, {"no": 2506216, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:44:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "For me, it&#039;s a star chart and a compass.", "time": 1670381045, "resto": 2505224}], "last_modified": 1670381045}, {"no": 2492621, "now": "11/06/22(Sun)12:12:28", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/Out/ings With a Pipe Thread", "com": "Multipurpose Tool Edition<br><br>Feel free to post tobaccos (no weed allowed), pipes, collections, pics of favorite combos for going /out/, pics of what you&#039;re doing with your pipe and any questions you might have.<br><br>Want to get into smoking pipes without spending too much cash?<br>Get a corncob pipe and a pouch of either Captain Black or Half and Half tobacco, available at most drugstores.<br>What you&#039;ll need: pipe, tobacco, lighter or matches, pipe cleaners, and either a regular old nail or a pipe tool (combination tamper, scoop, and small pick).<br>All of these together should run you less than $25, still.

For example: getting a conditional use permit for a dwelling on F2 land requires at least 18 months of paperwork and waiting around while some 25 y/o nitwit planner looks for reasons to deny your build, meanwhile construction loans typically have a 1 year conversion timeline. wife and i lucked out and found a property that already had the CUP on it, otherwise there was no way we could have swung the land purchase and rolled it into our construction loan. <br><br>it&#039;s such a fucky situation, one that a lot of the naive 20 somethings here completely fail to understand. then again if it were as simple as rolling an RV onto a plot of land and going for it, there wouldn&#039;t be any countryside left.

Both methods are dependent on local weather and light conditions, because they are done outside of a controlled environment. Large colonies also take a long time to grow and cover a large area, there are many examples in both the eastern and western US of colonies that are hundreds to thousands of acres in size and they are estimated to have taken hundreds to thousands of years to attain that much area.

A good capacity is 65 liters, this is considered 3 day bag but if your smart you can fit rations for a full week in it. 55 liters is fine but the limit for fitting a sleeping bag and not limiting the gear you might want to take.
