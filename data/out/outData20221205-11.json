Ball lightning striking the peaks above me. My pack was lined in a contractor bag. My rain layer wet out in a matter of minutes. Started shaking so violently I couldn\u2019t walk a straight line anymore. I told myself I\u2019d stop as soon as I found a spot to set the tent out. Found a patch of somewhat level ground and managed to set my tent up in the rain while shaking violently with blue fingers. Climbed inside, stripped everything off, climbed into my dry 20 degree quilt. Shook violently and contemplated death for about an hour and half while reading an ebook on my phone. It stopped raining so I put my dry clothes on and walked another 5 miles. Now I always carry an emergency blanket and preemptively take shelter to avoid rain if possible.

But If you can avoid do not buy the recent desert tan army boots that run 20$.

You are better off with a used frame backpack or internal backpack. <br><br>I have found that most milltary backpacks are around 65-120$ a used backpacking bag is around 20$ on shopgoodwill.com. I hear you say that you don&#039;t want to stand out in the woods , I would say their are plenty of waterproof rain flys for your bag that come in non-IRreflective camo for 45$ or a Chinese rain fly for 10$ on amazon, which are better than what ever camo you were thinking about buying any how. A good capacity is 65 liters, this is considered 3 day bag but if your smart you can fit rations for a full week in it. 55 liters is fine but the limit for fitting a sleeping bag and not limiting the gear you might want to take.

You can definitely learn on older models, sure the design might not be as light or efficient as a modern ski, but things used to be built to last, ya know? They don&#039;t have to be a perfect fit either. Sizing charts are pushed by retailers trying to sell everyone a new pair of skis every year. For a beginner skier I&#039;d say 160-190cm is a good ballpark. As for the boots and bindings...here&#039;s a tip...get a couple of these and kill 2 birds with one stone. The only reason you even need special &quot;ski boots&quot; is to transfer forces to the skis. Every day hiking boots will do the same job with sufficient clamping force, 2-3 hose clamps per boot will do the job just fine (just make sure your boots are water resistant).", "filename": "363c56ee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1183, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669784964294487, "time": 1669784964, "md5": "3ljNVjFrM19yx30CrjBLHg==", "fsize": 79170, "resto": 2500139}, {"no": 2503693, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)18:15:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2503439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503439</a><br>You have got to be fucking trolling.<br>Fuck it, I don&#039;t care, I&#039;ll take the bait for OP&#039;s sake.<br>Sure, old skis are alright.<br>But do NOT use hose clamps to afix hiking boots to skis.
