He had food, water and shelter and was safe for the night. He had parked his vehicle on Elk Summit Road about five miles from his location and was not familiar with the area, but told dispatch that he could make it to Walton Lake if that was a better rescue spot.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On Nov. 16, 2022, Idaho County Sergeant Keith Olsen and Idaho County Deputy Stan Denham responded at first light. Idaho County Dispatch advised Conti to head to the Walton Lakes Trailhead, which was about half a mile from his location, and gave him coordinates to where he could be picked up by the deputies.

Wool fibers also absorb sweat but they breathe better and keep their thermal properties when damp.<br><br>To quote the Norwegian Armed Forces winter clothing literature:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On the negative side, cotton is a fibre that easily absorbs moisture and requires</span><br>impregnation in order to withstand the damp. Cotton absorbs and accumulates<br>moisture, which results in its insulating properties being lost even with a small<br>degree of damp. When a cotton garment is wet it becomes heavy and takes a<br>relatively long time to dry.<br><br>Merino is so popular because the fibers are smooth enough to be comfortable in itch-prone areas. I&#039;ve heard alpaca wool has ever smoother fibers but have no experience with it and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s common.<br><br>So try merino wool as your directly-against-the-skin base layer.

Go to any pawn shop in my city (North Queensland, Australia) and they&#039;ll throw reels at you and beg that you buy them for rarely more than $50. You can haggle them and they&#039;ll always accept the deal because everyone and their dog has an average of 4 reels bought new, kicking around in their shed.<br><br>People buy new reels for &quot;reliability&quot; then hardly use them, then try to sell them and realise nobody else wants their filthy used real for the same reasons of reliability and because they&#039;re convinced they need a dozen ball bearings and the ability to reel submerged in a volcano with an adjustable dicksucker.<br><br>The average BCF customer will use Afterpay to buy a $400 reel and use it about 12-20 times before they leave it for 3 years, get addicted to meth or divorced, then pawn it for 50 bucks which the pawn shop will try to sell for $200. I then pop in, look right past it and pick up a daiwa baitcaster, manufactured before I was born, for $35 to harass barramundi and eels with. <br><br>10 years later, and after another 30 lifetime uses, that $400 reel will be back in the pawn shop again and I&#039;ll buy it for $60, give it a clean, spool fresh braid onto it and larp as Jeremy Wade like the jolly fucker I am.<br><br>That pawn shop had two of those old baitcasters, so I&#039;m considering going back to buy the second one so I have a spare for every part for the reel, all in all it&#039;ll cost me about $70 for a reel and a spare.

Just set an hour everyday shooting at targets, with no danger of hitting property or any living things. Eventually you can work on angles to get big ranges.

Hex nuts are a fine alternative but tend to curve midair. Small stones are fine for target practice. Do not underestimate the lethality of slingshots, especially with heavy bands.<br>Pana darts are interesting for small game hunting. There\u2019s also specialized slingshots to fire arrows. These offer several disadvantages over bows that I frankly wouldn\u2019t want in the woods but the portability is hard to knock.<br>Finally for self defense I\u2019ve seen pepper balls, these are intended for paintball guns and deliver two sources of pain compliance.

Operculicarya decaryi is dry deciduous, so if you stop watering, it will/should lose all of its leaves until spring. First of all, though, I&#039;d take both of them out of their pots and make sure the roots are still healthy. The yellowing leaves on the Dracaena don&#039;t sound good, but that could be because it&#039;s getting way too little, or way too much water. The soil looks dry in the picture, but it doesn&#039;t look like the pots have a drainage hole, so the soil at the bottom could still be pretty wet, especially if you&#039;re watering them rather frequently. I&#039;ve found that the desert type Dracaena need really well-draining soil, as in pretty much just rocks and little to nothing else, to not die in cultivation.<br>Also, red leaves on an Operculicarya are normal if it gets a lot of UV light. Put it on your window sill and they&#039;ll turn green. O. decaryi will do fine in a peaty soil mix.<br><br>In short, I think there&#039;s nothing wrong with your O. decaryi, but the D. cinnabari could be in trouble. If you don&#039;t want to get addicted to alien desert plants, don&#039;t look up other plants that grow on Madagascar and Socotra respectively.<br><br>You can find more info on these plants and other succulents on Llifle.

It&#039;s a lot less work on our part and we don&#039;t carry the burden of the breeding stock.<br><br>Because of this we have a 1.5 acre forest pasture rich in acorns for the pigs to live on. They shop up when they&#039;re young and easily handled. Already cut and weaned. We purchase pig feed from a local feed mill that has very reasonable prices and sources somewhat locally. Pigs handle the feed well and grow quickly. We only usually need to deworm them once during this process. As the weather is mild they generally don&#039;t need much housing. They destroy anything you give them anyways, so their run in always looks like shit.<br><br>We keep 2 for our family and sell the other 3+ which pays for all 5+ pigs every year. Essentially we &#039;eat for free&#039;. We sell half shares of pork to friends and locals who buy into all the buzzwordy meat stuff. This is why they go to a butcher, because there&#039;s some regulations there on how meat sales and preparation are handled. I send my two along as well because our butcher does a much much better job than I do and the pork sales cover it 100%, so why not.<br><br>People want to eat meme breeds so Berkshires are very popular, but hybrids are generally more vigorous and less likely to fail to thrive. Berkshire crosses is what we generally handle here. <br><br>In a small operation, this is the most cost effective and easiest method by far. Every year we look into buying a male and two females to start our own breeding program. Planning on keeping 5+ piglets and selling the rest, but the cost of everything skyrockets and piglet sales alone won&#039;t cover all the costs, so the operation starts operating at a loss and my goal is always to break even on food.", "time": 1670589428, "resto": 2500534}, {"no": 2509615, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)04:47:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2506633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2506633</a><br>Just to bump the tread and provide some more info.<br>I just learned about the foreign income not being taxed in Panama.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out.

Anyway, I was hiking, desperately looking for flat ground in order to set it up and had luckily found a nice little clearing off the trail and past the treeline. By the time I had that gay tent up, it was dark so I went back to my bag to rummage for my headlamp. While I was in my bag, I started hearing this metallic banging noise, kind of like someone hitting a homerun with an aluminum bat. I was spooked because I am absolutely certain I was no where near any sort of private property. I kind of just shrugged it off as another camper set up not too far off, not usual but not impossible. Well the noise started getting closer and louder and the closer and louder it got, the more adrenaline that started to pump into my veins. Of course the noise was now in the immediate vicinity so I cut my headlamp on and aimed it towards the source. On both sides of the tree was the silhouette of a massive creature, extremely wide and tall. I fucking SHIT myself. I froze and couldnt breathe. The silhouette urked around the tree and into the light. It was a bloodied US Senator John Fetterman bashing his forehead into every tree he passed. He muttered good morning and then something about fracking and then continued on into the treeline as if I wasn&#039;t just standing three feet away from him. <br><br>Absolutely terrifying experience, I don&#039;t hike without a gun now.", "time": 1668023773, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494078, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)16:04:45", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1638258050725", "ext": ".png", "w": 1376, "h": 3784, "tn_w": 45, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668027885243189, "time": 1668027885, "md5": "z0f6+6kGqJxoTylMhfYeHw==", "fsize": 1689554, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494328, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)05:39:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;go in a woods with decathlon gear</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;night outside home is cold, wet and dark</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also I can&#039;t sleep</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hear spooky noise, like something whipping against tent</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;open eyes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;big honking eyes stare at me, giant cold, wet nose touching minr</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s my dog cause I&#039;m camping in backyard</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sleep with dog, all is well now</span><br><br>The spooky noise was the tail being wagged against the tent", "time": 1668076767, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494334, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)05:53:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494078</a><br>Spoopy.", "time": 1668077592, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494348, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)07:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2493450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493450</a><br><a href=\"#p2493530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493530</a><br>I went back and zoomed in.

I walk a lot at night in the summer as its too hot for my Northern blood to still enough to sleep. I was walking through what I roughly worked out was its territory (more of that in a sec) and something big began to snarl and bark at me from uphill. I dont think this was it though, it didnt sound as big. Probably a fox, although it kept on at me until I left the area.<br>As to the territory, I figured it out, ironically, earlier the year I encountered it. I was walking through there and suddenly started feeling really afraid. This is really unusual for me as im pretty confident and I know the area like the back of my hand, plus the dark doesnt scare me.<br>Anyway, I had been feeling oddly nervy as I approached the area, but I didnt understand why. The feeling grew until it hit hard. I felt like I was being watched, hunted. The mist didnt help, but it was weird. Im not used to feeling like that, especially in such a local area. I kept going until I reached the bridge. I considered crossing and heading to the fishing pond to sit like I sometimes do, but I couldnt shake that prickling down my back and the fear, so I turned up the path I was on when I saw the beast, a week or so later, and headed on up and out of the park. The feeling died off as I passed the old building I was planning to explore for the challenge, and had all but faded by the time I reached the old visitor centre only a hundred or so metres further. Based on this I had a rough estimation of the Northern most extent of its range. I also thought I saw 2 red eyes in the mist across the vale, but that was probably my imagination.<br>On a side note I saw a UFO nearby last year.", "time": 1668380822, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2496009, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)21:44:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2495912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2495912</a><br>Thanks for responding.

I was walking back from town a couple of years back and crossing the park - really just a field with a river on one side and some play equipment - behind my house when I noticed a triangle of blueish white lights in the sky, just hovering there. Focusing on them I noted that there was a dark triangle shape between the lights, with the lights at the corner. Abruptly the craft accelerated away on a curve.

Along the back theres a river, and upstream a weir that ran into a pool on the far side of the canal bridge. We used to go bathing up there, and it was fine when you were with people, but it felt wrong, not in the naughty way but in the creepy &quot;something is not right here&quot; when alone. There could be people on the other side of the bridge and it would still feel off, but it really became scary when there was noone around. I did dismiss it initially as just nerves, maybe some ancestral fear of still bodies of water which were opaque, as primordial predators could lurk in them. Anyway at one point I found a kayak that had been washed down by the floods, and my class and I played about with it up there. Nothing really happened with other people, as I said, and we used to paddle around the pool (it wasnt deep, you could wade through it. 4 - 5 feet at the most I would say)<br>A couple of times I went up there on my own with the kayak. Now, we had all swam in the pool, and it was empty. There where NO underwater objects or protrusions. Shit, I waded through it. But when you were up there in the pool in the kayak, alone, you would hear noises, as though underwater twigs or fingernails were scraping on the hull. It was really creepy, and I used to get nervous about even paddling with my hands (we didnt have a paddle).<br>To one side - the lower in the picture - there is a cut away in the concrete basin for some vents or drains of some kind, and that always made me really nervous, even a little fearful. I pushed myself to wade to it once, and look at it, but I couldnt bring myself to step into it, even though it was relatively shallow compared to the rest of the pool.<br>If it was just me I might have dismissed it, but it wasnt. A few classmates also mentioned that the pool was really creepy when alone, and that they had also heard the scraping too.<br>Pic related, its the pool.", "filename": "Myerscough", "ext": ".png", "w": 1113, "h": 643, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1668466492572965, "time": 1668466492, "md5": "/pAHTlT1DBXATEkngA8MNA==", "fsize": 1813238, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2496792, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)20:42:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2496339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2496339</a><br>Very fucking spooky.

Fortunately no arrests were made, few days later one good guy, I was kinda friends with him, came to work as usual and died suddenly during dinner break, then few days later couple of other guys from my team robbed our team lead at knifepoint.

Both methods are dependent on local weather and light conditions, because they are done outside of a controlled environment.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

In general kiting seems to be more oriented towards boosting and big air. Winging is more oriented towards catching waves and riding swell. As a novice foiler, the advantage of a wing vs a kite is that when you fall (you WILL fall a lot) it is much easier to retrieve a wing and get it flying again which in turn means you will lose less upwind progress. <br><br>Budget is generally $4,000-6000+. You can spend less. Hood River area should have a very active secondary market and community.<br><br>Foil &amp; mast: Axis 1150. Get the best and call it a day.<br>Board: lots of options. If winging, start with the biggest board you can; emphasis on length and width over short compact volume. Balancing in heavy chop is the hardest thing to do until you are good enough to get up and on foil very fast, and the Hood gets very heavy chop. If you decide to learn with a stand-up paddleboard or similar, you will want something with a skeg or center-fin; a normal 3-fin rear thruster configuration will not cut it. There are options for retrofitting a center fin to any board.<br><br>Wings: the 5m single-wing quiver is a meme. Especially as a beginner you&#039;ll want to be out in light air, and 5m won&#039;t cut it. 6.5m is the sweet spot imo but ymmv. It&#039;s worth keeping in mind that wings are a little bit disposable - they wear out eventually and a lot of novices seem to put a foil blade through their canopy at least once. Rather than getting the hottest wing out there I would suggest starting with whatever is on sale; slingshot wings are popular with my locals and often seem to be priced reasonably. If you are shelling out for the latest and greatest, the strike cwc is the best wing that I have personally handled.

It should have a few things: <br>* a structure you can intutitively understand: Some are ordered by family, some by habitat, some by leaf type. As long as it makes sense to you and you can look something up quickly it&#039;s good. If you can&#039;t, it&#039;s bad. Stay away from alphabetical ones. <br>* Good pictures: You should have pictures that show the relevant parts of the plant in such a way that you can reliably feel confident the picture is the actual plant you are looking at. If the pictures are ass, so is the book. Don&#039;t buy it.<br>* A mention of uses for any given plant: This can be medicinal, or culinary, or historical. Personal preference, but it should mention how to use them<br>* Poison lookalikes: Any plant in this guide should have a section that states what other plants look like the one you are looking for, how to tell them apart and if the lookalikes are poisonous or not. If this information is missing, do not get the book. <br>* Good formfactor: Also personal preference. Smaller is better to carry, but means either less information or worse organization. Bigger means nicer pictures and more info, for more weight and bulk. It should at the very least fit into a backpack, at best into a pocket.<br>* Seasonal calendar: Bonus if there&#039;s a calendar showing what&#039;s in season each month<br><br>Then just go outside and start foraging. I read the book when I got it once, but forgot 95% of the info instantly. Then when outside I try to identify plants and think of how to use them. You will grow your knowledge slowly.

Some freedom, and that includes the freedom to fuck up, is needed for kids to become adults. But some risk is also unneeded. Getting hurt playing in the woods and either fixing it with friends together or going back home injured is formative, hitting the rusted WW2 artillery shell with a stone to see what&#039;s inside may have ended badly.<br>I still remember the very first time I went somewhere alone:<br>I was very young and my parents allowed me to get bread from the bakery alone on a sunday. It involved walking down 3 streets, crossing a small intersection, going into the store, ordering, paying and going back. I couldn&#039;t do math yet, so I had no idea how much I had paid or gotten back, but I remember how proud I was when I got back home. Years later I found out I never was alone - my father had followed me with a camera to see if I would cross the intersection carefully, avoid any traffic and be alright on my own. Once he knew I was fine, he knew I could be trusted to leave the house alone from there on. <br>I think the way they did it was best: First a pilot run, where they kept me safe but I could feel like I was alone. Then once that went well, they let me do my thing. That way they could trust I was fine on my own and I could be free of parental control.<br>Your main goal is avoiding the shit that can result in death or severe injury, for the rest, it&#039;s better if they find out themselves. <br>We had plenty a injury from homemade fireworks, fighting with sticks, etc. Kids learn surprisingly quickly to take care of each other. <br>Either way, don&#039;t stress about it too much anon, you sound like a great parent.

Everyone cites the same study claiming 97% bear spray effectiveness without actually reading it. The incidents in that study mostly consisted of juvenile black bears poking around garbage and leaving once sprayed. Every encounter like that was deemed a &quot;successful use of bear spray&quot; but that&#039;s not the kind of situation where someone would use a gun to defend themselves from a bear. Only THREE incidents in the study involved actual bear charges. In the first incident the bear stopped charging when sprayed. In the second incident the bear went through the spray and injured the person before running off. In the third incident the bear severely mauled the person and wasn&#039;t at all deterred by the spray. Based on that tiny sample bear spray has a 1/3 chance of making a charging bear decide to leave without hurting you.

Does it make sense to try that as a single dude or loneliness would be crippling?</span><br>Backpacking in general or the Pan-American drive specifically?<br>The former I&#039;d say go for it, the latter probably not. <br>My longest backpacking trip was 10 months going from London to Indonesia back when I was 17/18, and while it wasn&#039;t entirely solo (my gf came out to meet me in Venice and Malaysia+Indonesia, and a couple of mates joined me in E Europe) I was on my own for at least 7 months of the trip. That is, I was alone in that I hadn&#039;t made plans to travel with anyone before I started. In many areas it&#039;s extremely easy to meet people along the way and we&#039;d often end up travelling together for a while, longest was about a month with one of the girls I met in India and then we reunited for a couple of weeks in Cambodia+Laos. Sometimes this was an intentional effort on my part (I wanted to rent a houseboat in India but couldn&#039;t afford to do so on my own so I approached random people until I had a group), sometimes it was just by chance (some of the trails in Nepal are pretty busy and you&#039;ll often find yourself eating/sleeping at the same guesthouses as everyone else who walks at a vaguely similar pace). Stay in hostels, make an effort to talk to people and you&#039;ll be fine.

I am aiming typically for 3000kcal+ in a typical hiking day In that regard I do:<br>Breakfast: Mix of complex carbs and fat. A little protein is desirable. Cold soak oats with powder milk, peanut butter and breakfast bars, granola, dried fruit are my usual go-tos as I don&#039;t like to make anything more than coffee in the morning, would rather pack up and be ready to move sooner or eat on the trail.<br>Lunch: Same as above, although I don&#039;t always eat big. Its a little easier to snack during the hike and keep energy up rather than eat a big meal and try to walk. Again, mostly no cook options. Peanut butter, dried fruit, hard cheese, meat. If the weather is cool your options expand.<br>Dinner: I prefer to boil water, pour it into my cookpot and be ready in 10-15min. Cooking on pocket stoves mostly sucks as much as I&#039;ve tried. I try to limit it to heating water, oil, and maybe meat before it goes into something else. It&#039;s usually more sausage or other meat added to knorr sides, instant mashed potatoes, brown rice mixed with dehydrated veggies. I try to get the bulk of my protein in and mostly just stay up on calorie intake. I carry a container of olive oil for calories and to keep pasta/potatoes from being congealed messes. I do try to bring some spices to change stuff up. Spam singles do well. I don&#039;t like to bring a lot of canned stuff but for shorter duration trips I do like canned fish since you get protein, often some kind of oil base, and a sauce or spices all in one.<br><br>As far as a cooking if you want to deal with it there&#039;s almost nothing you can&#039;t do in the woods. If it&#039;s one pot at home it&#039;s one pot in the woods, just limited to what you feel like doing. Don&#039;t be afraid to pre-cut or mix stuff and get creative with repackaging.

I like Kamik. Probably won&#039;t last lifespan of rubber, but rubber you will have to have upkeep with and can cost 5-10x the price of these. Can easily get several years of good use out of TPR.

EVA is a foam that is very cheap to produce. External weather does not effect the material so it does a good job during shit weather. It is also going to make the lightest weight boot. You can find some for around 2 lbs to about 3 lbs of version that run with a different compound sole. Both TPR and EVA work best with a liner bootie/sock that you remove at the end of the day to dry out because you will generate condensation/sweat inside the boot. Some will even have a waffle pattern in the sole to collect water that will not transpire through the insole to your foot. A lot of these liners I end up removing and use a felt one from Steger mukluks instead as I try to avoid the all synthetic variants. I can use the felt liner during fairly high temperatures.</span><br>Two cons of EVA:<br>Can puncture. I have a lot of blackberries and while they can poke holes through the material, something like a nail could break entirely through. This can be negated by getting a different sole under the EVA that Torvi/Nordman offers.<br>like crocs, leaving outside in the sun or throwing in the dryer will shrink the material.<br>Suffice, TPR and EVA are my two favorites as I can buy both for $40-$80 for a pair of boots that will last a few years for my conditions.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PU: shares similarities to EVA. Boot weight tends to be closer to 3 pounds. Also a foam. I have not seen as many companies use PU (polyurethane) boots with liners, so the design is often not wide enough to handle one thus I tend to use EVA.</span>", "filename": "1652671603136", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672178297082726, "time": 1672178297, "md5": "abI5wmO4IKtkYXRaD0yQoA==", "fsize": 2764131, "resto": 2515729}, {"no": 2515946, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)17:13:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2515932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2515932</a><br>cons of PU are that it is not as durable as a rubber/eva specifically for an outsole. I have PU outsole boots and never had an issue albeit I don&#039;t go around stepping on nails. Sievi also has a version with a steel plate under foot to stop something like that.<br>Also polyurethane needs to be used regularly or it will be subject to hydrolysis where it will break down if not used once a week to once a month. I see so many people that buy PU boots for that 3 times a year it drizzles outside only to find the foam crumbling because they haven&#039;t worn it in 12 months to years.<br>PU also costs around $100. While I prefer polyurethane for leather boot soles/midsoles, EVA is better implemented for boots from what I have seen.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neoprene lined boots.</span><br>Not my favorite, but seems to be the most popular. First area where things can get expensive going into $150+ dollars. The neoprene generally isn&#039;t removable and generally a part of the boot&#039;s exterior; therefore, the first part of the boot you see torn time and time again is the neoprene at the calf. One thing these boots do better than others is: 1) give an all in one solution (insulation, durable sole, grip, cushion) and 2) give a little more support around the ankle since most rubber boots give zero. It isn&#039;t a ton, but more noticeable in my experience. With some rubber boots it feels like you need to visit krogers and buy ankle braces to have any leg support which some rubber boots are wide enough to allow many layers of liners, socks, braces, insoles, etc..<br>I see a lot of quality control issues with rubber splitting. Not sure why exactly. I saw one guy say they use clay in the rubber. No rubber boot is 100% rubber and rubber does need to be treated. People don&#039;t understand that urine and shit left on will wear the rubber down and cause it to crack, but I think a lot of these options use much less rubber than competition.

His work, and that of fellow USGS scientists, convinced authorities to close Mount St. Helens to the public before the 1980 eruption. They maintained the closure despite heavy pressure to re-open the area; their work saved thousands of lives.&quot;<br><br>Pic: &quot;The last picture ever taken of Johnston, 13 hours before his death at the eruption site.&quot; He looks like an angel.

I can&#039;t tell you if its &quot;worth it&quot; since our values are different. <br><br>I&#039;ve worked as a core logging geologist for a mid level active mining company in North Ontario. Pay was really good, started at about $70k CAD. Benefits as well. Worked 7-3 M-F and lived 10 minutes from where I worked, so work life balance was fine. The culture was very corporate with an HR department. Hard to advance but secure once you do. The work was super boring though which is why I left. <br><br>Currently I&#039;m working as a field geologist for a junior exploration company. Pay is a bit less. No benefits. On contract for $400/day as a junior geologist, senior can get $600. Typically schedule is 20 days on 10 off during the season. Days usually end up being about 10 hours. Really sucks, can&#039;t keep a schedule, or play sports or take lessons or have climbing partners when you are gone 2/3rds of the time. Difficult on relationships. The work is hard but fun. Hard days are shitty but the nice days are amazing. Flying around in a helicopter almost everyday, but it gets old quickly and how safe you feel really depends on the pilot you get. Being in a junior company things are a lot more relaxed and also more wild. When shit needs to get done you do it, no filing or chain of command or delegating. Everyone is really in it together, success feels shared between everyone in the company. Have to do a lot more than geology work though. Making helipads, tearing down camps, moving equipment, making berms with bobcats, etc. Pretty much outside every day, you get a lot of outdoors experience condensed into a short time, saw a lot of bald eagles, black bears, grizzly, moose. In Nevada I saw prong horns and a black tailed jackrabbit. <br><br>There are tons of roles, and the roles are different depending on the type of company you work for. Exploration is different than mining, and both are different than academia<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;acicular pyrite</span>", "filename": "20211103_143221", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672346203239390, "time": 1672346203, "md5": "SYvWMf+4Ttjea3WTwxhnQA==", "fsize": 3589617, "resto": 2516412}, {"no": 2516950, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)17:34:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2516871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2516871</a><br>Also was almost bit by a rattlesnake twice in Nevada.

Mt Rainier has more technical topographic prominence than K2, and because of the way topographic prominence is calculated Everest&#039;s actual vertical relief is actually much lower than its technical prominence (highest peak in the world calculated from MASL automatically becomes the most prominent even if it is 1k miles from the sea and has only 3k m of actual vertical relief, it also disregards the geodesic measure from the center of the Earth). <br><br>Similarly, Mont Blancs&#039; technical topographic key col is in Russia over 1000 miles away because of how technical topographic prominence is calculated (garbage system IMHO), and disregarding only Mt Blanc under this system the Rockies beat the Alps in every objective measure including prominence (by 400m) and vertical relief.", "time": 1671377229, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2511561, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)10:37:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2509337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2509337</a><br>Based illiterate", "time": 1671377840, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2511816, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)23:23:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "still like the east better after all these stock photos", "time": 1671423816, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2511823, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)23:32:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497237</a><br>I like the Rockies personally.<br>Live in the cascades and hate the wet, overcast weather and impossibly thick vegetation. <br>What good are views if you can only see leaves 10 feet away", "filename": "5F89439D-C0E5-4246-85DC-888D266F2164", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 1816, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 56, "tim": 1671424340900019, "time": 1671424340, "md5": "XlCZK5qLnUnkscxi4yAOqA==", "fsize": 2341768, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2512083, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:18:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2511816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2511816</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all these stock photos</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;desperate cope</span><br><a href=\"#p2503359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503359</a><br><a href=\"#p2503385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503385</a><br><a href=\"#p2503391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503391</a><br><a href=\"#p2503434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503434</a><br><a href=\"#p2503765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503765</a><br><a href=\"#p2503773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503773</a><br><a href=\"#p2504044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504044</a><br><br>None of these are stock photos-", "time": 1671473934, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2513996, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)18:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512083</a><br>ope-<br>east coast larpers outed again", "time": 1671837664, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2514028, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)19:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Take me home", "time": 1671841680, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2514185, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:41:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2503348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503348</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no houses</span><br>Good, some places should remain relatively untouched by humans", "time": 1671864080, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2514292, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)08:03:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2514185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2514185</a><br>the entire east was clear-cut logged with the exception of a few acres and those were at least surveyed initially, nothing is really untouched", "time": 1671886984, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2514847, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)08:53:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494637</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;new</span>", "filename": "FC080CD1-6FBB-492F-B380-9CCF1D51FE2F", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 453, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671976426159279, "time": 1671976426, "md5": "S2G00nZpcpOu+D8XVajyjQ==", "fsize": 51880, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2514972, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)13:58:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2514847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2514847</a><br>well, my vote is for eastern superiority", "time": 1671994731, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2516537, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:27:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494596</a><br>based opinion op", "time": 1672273645, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2516544, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:38:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494596</a><br>But those aren&#039;t mountains.", "time": 1672274319, "resto": 2494596}, {"no": 2516545, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:39:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494597</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we&#039;re full</span><br>No shit lmao.

I kind of find the Rocky Mountains sorta lazy, but able to do a lot with what little they have. The best peaks are the ones with a sly, subtle amount of rocky snow-line terrain, with miles and miles of rolling and steep hills. When its the right particular season like October or June (On a wet year), everything can seem like its own unique expirience from a mountain perspective. The somewhat-low prominence on even the biggest of 14ers makes Colorado a unique place to explore because of ease of access. In the Pacific Northwest, Mt. Rainer is the more impressive looking of mountains, yet it is absolutely not for any beginner. Colorado is more approachable, but not in that meh category that are the East Coast Vermont and NH mountains (Maine, I&#039;ll get to you later. Just wait a minute). I find that the best trips thusly are the ones taken on a whim and completely unplanned. I used to do this, as the mountains posed enough of a challenge for a day trip but not enough to need a game plan. Save Capitol Peak, of course and the Maroon Bells. But almost everything here that looks cool can be traveled to if you are at least somewhat active.

Amazing really. For all practical purposes anon here is pretty much spot on but some of the things about clay being negatively charged and sticky isn\u2019t always true. And then the part about sand just kind of trails off into the aether. Fascinating. There are two main categories of clay, fat clay and lean clay. Fat clays are like anon described, sticky and hard when dried. Lean clays however aren\u2019t very sticky more like finer silt. It\u2019s an important distinction to make because fat clays will swell with moisture and form mud cracks and preferred pathways for water infiltration, not so good for green bois. If you\u2019re certain the soil isn\u2019t poop you can run a bit on your teeth to help determine grain size. Clays feel smooth, silts are slightly gritty, and sand is very gritty, obviously.<br><br>\u201cGood\u201d soil depends on what you want to do with it. Obviously we\u2019re discussing in reference to growing plants but some plants need different soil types. Tomatoes like acidic free draining soils, carrots should be in sandy nutrient deficient soils to prevent the development of multiple taproots. Most things do well in what is termed \u2018loam\u2019 on the USDA soil maps. Loam is basically what you get when you follow <a href=\"#p2516204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2516204</a> \u2018s recommendations. You should check the pH and also how well the soil drains water before you attempt to make any amendments. Amend the soil towards better drainage and neutral to slightly acidic pH. Organic content is good for raising acidity and adding nutrients for garden soils I really don\u2019t think you can have too much organic content.<br><br>Be careful making soil amendments especially when you\u2019re starting out with a clay heavy soil.

Within &quot;agency&quot; you have (sometimes) municipal, state, or fed (NPS, BLM, USFS, etc.). Contractors just post their shit on indeed or facebook pages in local forested areas (i.e., La Grande, OR; Entiat, WA; Missoula, MT). State usually does the same but you can find them by searching &lt;state&gt; D(n)RC. As for feds, your only option is usajobs.gov. There&#039;s loads of info on how to build a resume for this online -- it&#039;s very robotic, and calling into specific stations / crews you&#039;re interested in working with helps a lot. It&#039;s slave labor but naturally the fed can&#039;t figure out their hiring processes. With no experience, you can still get on at GS1-2, maybe 3 if you&#039;ve worked literally any manual labor job. GS 4-5 usually requires fire experience/certs which you can get from &quot;fire schools&quot; which as far as I know only exist in Arizona and California (could be wrong) but their are openings across the country. Most are in the west, of course. And CalFire, despite being the meme of wildland firefighting, is the best bang for your buck in terms of pay/bennies/experience.<br>Your very first cert is as a FFT2, which enables you to work on a Type 2 crew or engine. Some hotshot crews take 2-3 FFT2s but it&#039;s difficult to get so you&#039;ll likely spend at least one season doing bitch work with no H pay. The quicker you can get additional certs (FFT1, ICT5, FAL1/2, etc.) the faster you can advance. It&#039;s a lot of politics though.<br>And again, it&#039;s literally slave labor. You have little to no guaranteed pay/hours. You have no guarantee of advancing certs. However, if you hate it, you can leverage the experience into anything.
