He said it sounded &quot;like a locomotive.&quot; So, what the fuck was that? I do not believe that he was lying. He had absolutely no reason to lie about something like that and it&#039;s only hurt his career and public image overall. I think he was telling the truth. So, what could that have been? It had to be a very large animal to sound &quot;like a locomotive&quot; as it crashed through the forest. What&#039;s big enough to do that in Alaska? A bear and a moose.

The frame, roll cage, and everything else structural are some sort of metal alloy. Overspifying and mostly accurate: the crystal content of a material determines its strength and plasticity--the more % crystal usually the stronger a material is but it also is more brittle. An extreme comparison would be a pure iron rod and a pure diamond rod--the diamond will shatter under strain while the iron rod will bend...although it will take much more strain to shatter the diamond than bend the iron. In carbon fiber the crystal content is the graphite, which is hexagonally bonded carbon layered in a polymer. The other important factor is cyclic fatigue stresses. Over time carbon fiber will develop mocrocracking because it cracks instead of bends where metal this is much less prevent. The end result is carbon fiber can fail completely under a strain (especially in cold where the crystals cool and become more brittle) where metals will bend and distort but not fail.<br>Thanks for listening to my TED talk.", "time": 1669908429, "resto": 2499937}], "last_modified": 1669908429}, {"no": 2503889, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)09:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "New to kayaking, what do I need", "com": "Just got a kayak for fishing lakes come spring.

A good capacity is 65 liters, this is considered 3 day bag but if your smart you can fit rations for a full week in it. 55 liters is fine but the limit for fitting a sleeping bag and not limiting the gear you might want to take.

Meat? Dairy? Wool? You need to consider these things.<br><br>Because you are a noob at this I would highly suggest running sheep first as goats can be hard to run if you are not experienced. I would suggest running a meat breed (this is a breed of sheep that is bred for meat). What you want to do is go on something like Marketplace, Gumtree, or a livestock selling site and buy weaned lambs, make sure not to buy an uncastrated male. his primary role is to breed, weaning is a process where the lambs are drenched, immunized, castrated, de tailed and dehorned, basically they become ready to farm. Once you do that buy some containers for water and set up some (one or two) simple shelters (star picquets and corrugated iron will do it). You can rather let them graze your land, strip graze (this is done with a mobile electric fence. You set up the sheep in a strip of your land, fencing them in with the electric fence, basically making them eat a section of grass while the rest of the sections regrow) or you can feed them pellets. You will also need to drench your sheep too, drench is medicine that is inserted orally with a drench gun (I&#039;ll attach a pic) this will need to be done once every month or so. I&#039;m going to guess you are from Texas, you will want to get a sheep dog to look after the sheep, these dogs are usually expensive but worth it, DO NOT TRAIN THE DOG YOURSELF, where I&#039;m from we usually use blue heelers or kelpies, also important to mention that these dogs should never treat these animals like pets, they are working dogs. Also buying a 223 and popping some pests would help too, where I&#039;m from there&#039;s a nationwide gun club that helps farmers by sending out hunters to remove pests, maybe the NRA does something like this???

You can definitely learn on older models, sure the design might not be as light or efficient as a modern ski, but things used to be built to last, ya know? They don&#039;t have to be a perfect fit either. Sizing charts are pushed by retailers trying to sell everyone a new pair of skis every year. For a beginner skier I&#039;d say 160-190cm is a good ballpark. As for the boots and bindings...here&#039;s a tip...get a couple of these and kill 2 birds with one stone. The only reason you even need special &quot;ski boots&quot; is to transfer forces to the skis. Every day hiking boots will do the same job with sufficient clamping force, 2-3 hose clamps per boot will do the job just fine (just make sure your boots are water resistant).", "filename": "363c56ee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1183, "h": 1198, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669784964294487, "time": 1669784964, "md5": "3ljNVjFrM19yx30CrjBLHg==", "fsize": 79170, "resto": 2500139}, {"no": 2503693, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)18:15:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2503439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503439</a><br>You have got to be fucking trolling.<br>Fuck it, I don&#039;t care, I&#039;ll take the bait for OP&#039;s sake.<br>Sure, old skis are alright.<br>But do NOT use hose clamps to afix hiking boots to skis.
