That is, I was alone in that I hadn&#039;t made plans to travel with anyone before I started. In many areas it&#039;s extremely easy to meet people along the way and we&#039;d often end up travelling together for a while, longest was about a month with one of the girls I met in India and then we reunited for a couple of weeks in Cambodia+Laos. Sometimes this was an intentional effort on my part (I wanted to rent a houseboat in India but couldn&#039;t afford to do so on my own so I approached random people until I had a group), sometimes it was just by chance (some of the trails in Nepal are pretty busy and you&#039;ll often find yourself eating/sleeping at the same guesthouses as everyone else who walks at a vaguely similar pace). Stay in hostels, make an effort to talk to people and you&#039;ll be fine. That&#039;s assuming you&#039;re travelling through appropriately touristic areas of course, there&#039;s a fairly well-trod backpacker trail through certain parts of India, Nepal and SE Asia where you&#039;ll find a lot of solo backpackers all looking for company but if you step away from that trail then it can be much quieter and potentially lonelier. It&#039;s not just about the amount of tourists but the type, some places are busy but busybwith tourists rather than travellers. <br><br>A long driving trip like the one I did with my wife would potentially be much lonelier as you&#039;d have fewer opportunities to meet people. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any life changing experiences during your journey?</span><br>Nah.", "time": 1671597655, "resto": 2512455}, {"no": 2512858, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:28:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512747</a><br><a href=\"#p2512541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512541</a><br>Good read.

Many friends will be lost, and you&#039;ll likely gravitate into different social circles.<br>It depends how long you go, but if its years then its going to totally change the way you see the world and your home culture (reverse culture shock is an acquired taste and the cherry on top at the end IMO).<br><br>Especially if its not Europe you&#039;re going to, which can just be an extended party with baguettes.<br>I would extremely highly recommend NOT doing Europe for this.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out. My house looks like any other 1960&#039;s Australian fibro cottage but I take a working holiday every couple of years to Taree as a cattle drover and stay in pic-related.<br><br>I want to talk about how hard it is to be green, but it really isn&#039;t.

Anything that isn&#039;t used by the hunting camp is either sold at market or (especially in remote parts of the World) donated to the local community. This acts as a significant disincentive to meat poaching. The fact that legal, regulated hunting can be a powerful conservation tool is not up for debate. Anyone who would deny this fact is either ignorant, or an animal rights nutter who is ideologically opposed to any utilization of animals by people. Even the WWF recognizes the utility of hunting as a conservation tool.<br>https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/<wbr>downloads/wwf_policy_and_considerat<wbr>ions_re_trophy_hunting__july_2016_.<wbr>pdf<br>https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_<wbr>focus/wildlife_practice/species_new<wbr>s/wwf_and_trophy_hunting/", "filename": "How Wildlife is Thriving thanks to guns and hunting", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 6136, "tn_w": 18, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671962657350479, "time": 1671962657, "md5": "D4AClCoQHLADwGd3Qf7MrQ==", "fsize": 1387520, "resto": 2513957}, {"no": 2514857, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:16:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2514769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2514769</a><br>the ways hunters &quot;help&quot; conservation are unintentional and if they could save the money instead they would do it<br><br>I don&#039;t have a problem with hunting, but it&#039;s because I&#039;m not gay, I&#039;m not gonna argue they&#039;re heckin wholesome", "time": 1671977775, "resto": 2513957}, {"no": 2514877, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)10:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2514857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2514857</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the ways hunters &quot;help&quot; conservation are unintentional </span><br>Full of shit.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck. I\u2019m currently clearing a bunch of land for a terrace to grow some vegetables and friut trees. I might just buy 5 small pigs and let them run around in there and fatten them up.

I like Kamik. Probably won&#039;t last lifespan of rubber, but rubber you will have to have upkeep with and can cost 5-10x the price of these. Can easily get several years of good use out of TPR. One of the two best values.

EVA is a foam that is very cheap to produce. External weather does not effect the material so it does a good job during shit weather. It is also going to make the lightest weight boot. You can find some for around 2 lbs to about 3 lbs of version that run with a different compound sole. Both TPR and EVA work best with a liner bootie/sock that you remove at the end of the day to dry out because you will generate condensation/sweat inside the boot. Some will even have a waffle pattern in the sole to collect water that will not transpire through the insole to your foot. A lot of these liners I end up removing and use a felt one from Steger mukluks instead as I try to avoid the all synthetic variants. I can use the felt liner during fairly high temperatures.</span><br>Two cons of EVA:<br>Can puncture. I have a lot of blackberries and while they can poke holes through the material, something like a nail could break entirely through. This can be negated by getting a different sole under the EVA that Torvi/Nordman offers.<br>like crocs, leaving outside in the sun or throwing in the dryer will shrink the material.<br>Suffice, TPR and EVA are my two favorites as I can buy both for $40-$80 for a pair of boots that will last a few years for my conditions.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PU: shares similarities to EVA. Boot weight tends to be closer to 3 pounds. Also a foam. I have not seen as many companies use PU (polyurethane) boots with liners, so the design is often not wide enough to handle one thus I tend to use EVA.</span>", "filename": "1652671603136", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672178297082726, "time": 1672178297, "md5": "abI5wmO4IKtkYXRaD0yQoA==", "fsize": 2764131, "resto": 2515729}, {"no": 2515946, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)17:13:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2515932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2515932</a><br>cons of PU are that it is not as durable as a rubber/eva specifically for an outsole. I have PU outsole boots and never had an issue albeit I don&#039;t go around stepping on nails. Sievi also has a version with a steel plate under foot to stop something like that.<br>Also polyurethane needs to be used regularly or it will be subject to hydrolysis where it will break down if not used once a week to once a month. I see so many people that buy PU boots for that 3 times a year it drizzles outside only to find the foam crumbling because they haven&#039;t worn it in 12 months to years.<br>PU also costs around $100. While I prefer polyurethane for leather boot soles/midsoles, EVA is better implemented for boots from what I have seen.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neoprene lined boots.</span><br>Not my favorite, but seems to be the most popular. First area where things can get expensive going into $150+ dollars. The neoprene generally isn&#039;t removable and generally a part of the boot&#039;s exterior; therefore, the first part of the boot you see torn time and time again is the neoprene at the calf. One thing these boots do better than others is: 1) give an all in one solution (insulation, durable sole, grip, cushion) and 2) give a little more support around the ankle since most rubber boots give zero. It isn&#039;t a ton, but more noticeable in my experience. With some rubber boots it feels like you need to visit krogers and buy ankle braces to have any leg support which some rubber boots are wide enough to allow many layers of liners, socks, braces, insoles, etc..<br>I see a lot of quality control issues with rubber splitting. Not sure why exactly. I saw one guy say they use clay in the rubber. No rubber boot is 100% rubber and rubber does need to be treated. People don&#039;t understand that urine and shit left on will wear the rubber down and cause it to crack, but I think a lot of these options use much less rubber than competition.

Could be a, &quot;not made like it used to be thing&quot;. I have seen a lot of complaints from La Chameaux (french company, but made in morroco). Don&#039;t know a lot about Gumleaf but they are made in Europe, and then Aigle i&#039;ve heard good thing sfrom (also French).<br>If i&#039;m using a work boot for the wild or farm it&#039;s the second to last boot i&#039;d use just because i&#039;d prefer something lighter with more cushion, that is cheaper, and that I don&#039;t have to give a shit about.

Drop a sail or reef the main (essentially just pulling the sail down a bit to decrease surface area). No wind? Use the engine and cruise around. <br><br>Be prepared to spend a chunk of cash yearly after your purchase, especially if you keep it on the water as marine fees can get pricey, but a small/mid-sized Catalina is no where near as maintenance heavy as people in this thread are saying it is.

Nice trips. Good sign.<br><br>Sailing, just the act of using the wind to move not open water crossings, is very achievable and extremely fun. But there is a lot to learn about maritime rules and the sea itself; you can get most of what you need from a few books, YouTube videos, and a lot of practice. Owning a sail boat will require that you learn a lot of other skills as well in order to keep costs down. Maintenance costs trend upward with boat size. <br>I\u2019m only a novice sailor who learned how to sail from a retired merchant marine on Saipan in exchange for beer. Technically I\u2019m qualified to steer a small boat by myself in ideal conditions (less than 20 knots of wind during daylight).<br>But <a href=\"#p2505328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505328</a> is good advice. However when you do tack you have to watch out for the boom arm. As your boat turns and the bow crosses the wind direction, the boom will swing across the deck as the main sail catches the wind that\u2019s now coming from the other side. Watch a video of how to tack safely. It is not uncommon for the boom to take inexperienced sailors overboard in a tack.<br>In a jibe, the boom arm moves even faster. <br>The most skillful part of sailing is getting in and out of the slip, so just use an outboard motor for that when starting out. <br>Sailboats are not that expensive to run see <a href=\"#p2505331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505331</a>.

Featherwt, lightwt and caldorado most breathable and light models. Burlier versions = no breathe. Mediocre moisture transfer but blocks wind. Same never-wets-out membrane outer, inside dries quick if overwhelmed. Very durable and light, some reports of delamination after 1 year (not experienced after 3 myself). SHIT hood design, gross colours, reports of declining seam quality. Cheap on sale and very sparse stock as this material never took off (maybe because its ugly and shiny). My favourite, 8/10 put it through the wringer!!<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;froggs toggs ultralite</span><br>Basically a rubber mac. Enough moisture transfer to dry inside overnight, these fit so poorly that mechanical venting happens by default. Not good for warmth, shit neck closure on hood (add velcro or snaps), shreds and pinholes easily. $20/\u00a325 for a jacket (and useless pants/troos) that NEVER wets out, weighs 180g and mogs things 5x price.

is the second biggest determiner or weight, and the primary determiner of the size the bag packs to. the higher the number, the higher quality the down inside is, thus less of it is needed for the same warmth level.<br>- the &#039;total fill weight&#039; is what determines how warm how the bag actually is. its the measure of how much down is actually in it.<br>- a quick look at the above 3 is the best way to compare similar bags to each other to see which one you&#039;re getting the best deal on.<br>- goose down and duck down are more or less the same other than what fill powers they&#039;re generally sold at.<br>- temp ratings are usually a mixed bag of if they&#039;re accurate or not. big brands tend to over-rate their bags and cottage brands tend to be accurate or under-rate. <br>- EN ratings are *usually* actually pretty accurate. keep in mind EN rating is tested wearing thermals. <br>- very expensive and very cheap bags are just as warm as each other. the difference is packed size and weight and how clammy they are.<br>- consider a quilt &gt; sleeping bag if you&#039;re getting a 30/40 degree bag for warm temps. their only downside is that they can be drafty which obv doesn&#039;t matter on those bags.", "time": 1671488323, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512192, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:09:39", "name": "opinions?", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512155</a><br>i want the def4 bc i can use it even in very cold weather, which is likely in the alps, that are the only nature close to where i live, and also in hot climate just by using it as a blanket <br><br>am i wrong?", "time": 1671491379, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512193, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:10:40", "name": "opinions?", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512155</a><br>idk the used bags i found dont inspire me, while other used gear is plentyful, bags seem to not be", "time": 1671491440, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512198, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:17:29", "name": "opinions?", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512169</a><br>so is the defence4 good?<br>for my needs it seems the best one but im not an expert on sleeping bags", "time": 1671491849, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512200, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:25:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "note: i&#039;m using burger temp ratings<br><a href=\"#p2512192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512192</a><br>i would say you probably won&#039;t be able to use a 15 degree bag unzipped when its warm. there&#039;s no one sleeping bag that does all weather, you&#039;ll need another bag. warm temp bags are cheap so don&#039;t sweat it when buying a bag for the alps.<br><a href=\"#p2512198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512198</a><br>the defense 4 is 4lbs and it looks like its comfort rated to 15* burger units. you can spend 1.5-2x more and get a bag just as warm thats around the 2lb range. i think it would be worth it to. i know of bags in the burger market that go on sale for the same price as the defense 4 in the 1lb 12oz range with the same temp ratings. <br>i would say your best bet if you&#039;re not in a big rush, is wait for something higher end to go on sale. if we lived in the same part of the world i could get more specific. dunno euro outfitters.", "time": 1671492317, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512201, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:26:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "seems like from what i can find online -5c/0c rated bags like that one will be fine in the alps for the summer, you might need a warmer bag for colder months there. ask around locally or ask some locals on plebbit.", "time": 1671492404, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512206, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:31:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "synthetic fill bags like that in general are going to be bulky as fuck is the big thing. a down filled bag will pack a lot smaller, and its not very humid there so you should be fine keeping it dry. the lower of temp rating bag you need, the more and more worth it it becomes to invest in high fill power down IMO.", "time": 1671492680, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512207, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:34:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "oh cool, a streetwear thread<br>I thought those were just on /fa/", "time": 1671492857, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512208, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:35:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512200</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;warm temp bags are cheap so don&#039;t sweat it</span><br>Ba-dum-tss and checked", "time": 1671492943, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512240, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:45:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512150</a><br>Alright, ponchoanon, one buy, under $75, shell layer, what&#039;s your go-to?", "time": 1671497157, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512243, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:50:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512162</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;as long as i can get a sentence from the owner and cared for it.</span><br>Whats your ideal answer here?", "time": 1671497436, "resto": 2511261}, {"no": 2512319, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:55:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2512240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512240</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;poncho</span><br>don&#039;t be a cheap bitch and buy a packa because its the only poncho that isn&#039;t inherently flawed by design on the market.<br>http://www.thepacka.com/contact-us.<wbr>html<br>marginally more expensive than your budget for hand made, unique, very well thought out &amp;

Beneath the surface is a mycelium system that spawns the fruiting bodies in an area that consistently produces mushrooms. I assume the best way to proliferate a desired fruiting body is to first proliferate mycelium growth (maybe by spreading nutrient substrate around the area), or to spread spores over the desired area during ideal weather conditions and over an ideal substrate in ideal locations to promote growth (ie under a damp log or on moist sheltered leaf litter during a cool rainy season, dependent on species). Both methods are dependent on local weather and light conditions, because they are done outside of a controlled environment. Large colonies also take a long time to grow and cover a large area, there are many examples in both the eastern and western US of colonies that are hundreds to thousands of acres in size and they are estimated to have taken hundreds to thousands of years to attain that much area.

Anyway, I was hiking, desperately looking for flat ground in order to set it up and had luckily found a nice little clearing off the trail and past the treeline. By the time I had that gay tent up, it was dark so I went back to my bag to rummage for my headlamp. While I was in my bag, I started hearing this metallic banging noise, kind of like someone hitting a homerun with an aluminum bat. I was spooked because I am absolutely certain I was no where near any sort of private property. I kind of just shrugged it off as another camper set up not too far off, not usual but not impossible. Well the noise started getting closer and louder and the closer and louder it got, the more adrenaline that started to pump into my veins. Of course the noise was now in the immediate vicinity so I cut my headlamp on and aimed it towards the source. On both sides of the tree was the silhouette of a massive creature, extremely wide and tall. I fucking SHIT myself. I froze and couldnt breathe. The silhouette urked around the tree and into the light. It was a bloodied US Senator John Fetterman bashing his forehead into every tree he passed. He muttered good morning and then something about fracking and then continued on into the treeline as if I wasn&#039;t just standing three feet away from him. <br><br>Absolutely terrifying experience, I don&#039;t hike without a gun now.", "time": 1668023773, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494078, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)16:04:45", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1638258050725", "ext": ".png", "w": 1376, "h": 3784, "tn_w": 45, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668027885243189, "time": 1668027885, "md5": "z0f6+6kGqJxoTylMhfYeHw==", "fsize": 1689554, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494328, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)05:39:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;go in a woods with decathlon gear</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;night outside home is cold, wet and dark</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also I can&#039;t sleep</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hear spooky noise, like something whipping against tent</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;open eyes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;big honking eyes stare at me, giant cold, wet nose touching minr</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s my dog cause I&#039;m camping in backyard</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sleep with dog, all is well now</span><br><br>The spooky noise was the tail being wagged against the tent", "time": 1668076767, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494334, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)05:53:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494078</a><br>Spoopy.", "time": 1668077592, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2494348, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)07:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2493450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493450</a><br><a href=\"#p2493530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493530</a><br>I went back and zoomed in.

I walk a lot at night in the summer as its too hot for my Northern blood to still enough to sleep. I was walking through what I roughly worked out was its territory (more of that in a sec) and something big began to snarl and bark at me from uphill. I dont think this was it though, it didnt sound as big. Probably a fox, although it kept on at me until I left the area.<br>As to the territory, I figured it out, ironically, earlier the year I encountered it. I was walking through there and suddenly started feeling really afraid. This is really unusual for me as im pretty confident and I know the area like the back of my hand, plus the dark doesnt scare me.<br>Anyway, I had been feeling oddly nervy as I approached the area, but I didnt understand why. The feeling grew until it hit hard. I felt like I was being watched, hunted. The mist didnt help, but it was weird. Im not used to feeling like that, especially in such a local area. I kept going until I reached the bridge. I considered crossing and heading to the fishing pond to sit like I sometimes do, but I couldnt shake that prickling down my back and the fear, so I turned up the path I was on when I saw the beast, a week or so later, and headed on up and out of the park. The feeling died off as I passed the old building I was planning to explore for the challenge, and had all but faded by the time I reached the old visitor centre only a hundred or so metres further. Based on this I had a rough estimation of the Northern most extent of its range. I also thought I saw 2 red eyes in the mist across the vale, but that was probably my imagination.<br>On a side note I saw a UFO nearby last year.", "time": 1668380822, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2496009, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)21:44:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2495912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2495912</a><br>Thanks for responding.

I was walking back from town a couple of years back and crossing the park - really just a field with a river on one side and some play equipment - behind my house when I noticed a triangle of blueish white lights in the sky, just hovering there. Focusing on them I noted that there was a dark triangle shape between the lights, with the lights at the corner. Abruptly the craft accelerated away on a curve. It accelerated way too fast to have been anything modern, and way too fluidly.

Along the back theres a river, and upstream a weir that ran into a pool on the far side of the canal bridge. We used to go bathing up there, and it was fine when you were with people, but it felt wrong, not in the naughty way but in the creepy &quot;something is not right here&quot; when alone. There could be people on the other side of the bridge and it would still feel off, but it really became scary when there was noone around. I did dismiss it initially as just nerves, maybe some ancestral fear of still bodies of water which were opaque, as primordial predators could lurk in them. Anyway at one point I found a kayak that had been washed down by the floods, and my class and I played about with it up there. Nothing really happened with other people, as I said, and we used to paddle around the pool (it wasnt deep, you could wade through it. 4 - 5 feet at the most I would say)<br>A couple of times I went up there on my own with the kayak. Now, we had all swam in the pool, and it was empty. There where NO underwater objects or protrusions. Shit, I waded through it. But when you were up there in the pool in the kayak, alone, you would hear noises, as though underwater twigs or fingernails were scraping on the hull. It was really creepy, and I used to get nervous about even paddling with my hands (we didnt have a paddle).<br>To one side - the lower in the picture - there is a cut away in the concrete basin for some vents or drains of some kind, and that always made me really nervous, even a little fearful. I pushed myself to wade to it once, and look at it, but I couldnt bring myself to step into it, even though it was relatively shallow compared to the rest of the pool.<br>If it was just me I might have dismissed it, but it wasnt. A few classmates also mentioned that the pool was really creepy when alone, and that they had also heard the scraping too.<br>Pic related, its the pool.", "filename": "Myerscough", "ext": ".png", "w": 1113, "h": 643, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1668466492572965, "time": 1668466492, "md5": "/pAHTlT1DBXATEkngA8MNA==", "fsize": 1813238, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2496792, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)20:42:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2496339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2496339</a><br>Very fucking spooky.

Fortunately no arrests were made, few days later one good guy, I was kinda friends with him, came to work as usual and died suddenly during dinner break, then few days later couple of other guys from my team robbed our team lead at knifepoint.

I don&#039;t really have much of an opinion on Bigfoot, but I will say that I did find Les Stroud account interesting. He said that he heard hooping and whooping noises akin to those of a chimpanzee that were coming from just out of sight, beyond the tree line, and that when he reached for his camera, whatever it was went crashing through the woods in retreat. He said it sounded &quot;like a locomotive.&quot; So, what the fuck was that? I do not believe that he was lying. He had absolutely no reason to lie about something like that and it&#039;s only hurt his career and public image overall. I think he was telling the truth. So, what could that have been? It had to be a very large animal to sound &quot;like a locomotive&quot; as it crashed through the forest. What&#039;s big enough to do that in Alaska? A bear and a moose. That&#039;s about it really, and neither one of those makes ape-like whooping and hooping noises. This one little anecdote all by itself is fairly compelling to me because, as I said, I simply do not believe that he&#039;s lying.

I kept monitoring the /k/ thread whilst it was being worked on and found it interesting enough to keep hanging out after it was released. I had a go at designing my own one for a group of friends which was a painless enough experience I figured I would have a go at making one to sell.

So you create the design send it to them along with requests for production (number of, embroidered/woven, type of backing etc), they tell you if any changes need to be made. Then, once all confirmed, in a week or two you get a parcel full of patches.<br><br>There are a couple of exceptions. 19kenny84, who makes very small batches by hand and Twilry who has a website connected to a machine but that&#039;s been gone a while now. You can find sellers on Etsy who will do one offs for you, they seem to be generally in Eastern Europe.

In national parks and other areas where bears are protected from</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hunting, you will not have firearms, so your brain and bear spray will be your</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most effective bear deterrents.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you have bear spray or another deterrent, or are armed, you can try to</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chase away a food-seeking or curious grizzly. Use noisemakers such as non-</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;injurious explosive shells (see page 139) or loud boat horns (see page 123),</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shout, rev engines, or bang pots. Keep making loud noises until the bear leaves</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;or becomes aggressive. If it continues to approach or charges, keep up the noise</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but be ready with bear spray, which is the deterrent of choice in this situation, or</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an appropriate firearm (see pages 242\u201348).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I decided to evaluate the effectiveness of pepper spray for myself. As part</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;of my database on bear\u2013human interactions we began collecting detailed case-</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;incident records of field situations in Canada and the United States in which</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people used pepper spray as a bear deterrent. Andrew Higgins and I collected</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unbiased records of sixty-six situations that occurred between 1984 and 1994</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where people used pepper spray to try to deter the advance of an aggressive</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;or curious bear.23 The results are somewhat complex\u2014but so are bear\u2013human</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;interactions. In 94 percent (fifteen out of sixteen) of the close-range encounters</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;with aggressive grizzly bears, pepper spray appeared to stop the behavior that</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the bear was displaying immediately prior to being sprayed.

While we do not know how these encounters would</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have ended in the absence of spray, the use of spray appears to have prevented</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;injury in most, but not all, of these encounters.

It is not the bear but the person who feels threatened. I have stressed that this is a very rare situation, but clearly one in which a firearm could save your life. Bear spray may temporarily stop the approaches of a potentially predaceous bear, but you may run out of spray before the bear leaves.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A firearm is also useful when a very aggressive bear shows up around camp and cannot be persuaded to leave. Such bears normally have a history of feeding on people\u2019s food or garbage, and may have to be killed. Of course, if an aggressive bear actually attacks you or a companion, a firearm may be a life-saver\u2014or it may cause a wounded bear to intensify its attack. The risk of shooting a companion who is being mauled must also be considered. Finally, a firearm might be useful if you suddenly encounter a grizzly bear, especially a female with cubs, and you are charged by the grizzly. If you have a firearm, you may choose to shoot a charging grizzly bear\u2014but remember that a wounded grizzly is almost always highly dangerous, and may try to attack the person who has wounded it. Since black bears seldom charge at and contact people in incidents preceded by sudden surprise, the discussion that follows primarily concerns the grizzly.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For protection against a suddenly encountered and charging grizzly, many people will be safer without any firearms, despite the legality of carrying them in most non-park and remote areas. I think that for some people, carrying a firearm tends to turn off the alertness to signs of bears and to situations in which bear danger might develop. With the perceived security of a firearm, people become bolder, which can be bad for several reasons. If you are expert with firearms under \u201ccombat\u201d conditions, you are more likely to provoke grizzlies, and hence, to have to use your expert ability. In this case the unnecessary killing of a grizzly bear may occur.</span>", "time": 1671927123, "resto": 2511592}, {"no": 2514605, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:14:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://dokumen.pub/qdownload/bear-<wbr>attacks-their-causes-and-avoidance-<wbr>3e-edition-9781493029419-9781493034<wbr>574-149302941x-149303457x.html<br>here&#039;s a pdf of the book<br>this book is basically required reading for anyone who lives near bears. best literature on the subject. far more useful advice than the shit on here.<br>i&#039;m not the only anon recommending it <a href=\"#p2512725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2512725</a> <a href=\"#p2511764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2511764</a> for good reason.", "filename": "1658014105085", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 315, "h": 472, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671927246397278, "time": 1671927246, "md5": "G1uxJwr7GmDvkHTusvAZUw==", "fsize": 36875, "resto": 2511592}, {"no": 2515365, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:23:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2511592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2511592</a><br>I lived and worked in remote areas of SE Alaska.

I just turned around and ran the other way when I saw him. Didn&#039;t feel threatened at all. First time seeing a grizzly bear up close is pretty scary, like seeing a shark in the ocean. The reality is that like sharks, bears don&#039;t really care about or want to eat us.

The Northville-Placid Trail goes 100+ miles through the heart of the Adirondacks.

Generally not too crowded except in popular spots like Watkins Glen and Robert Treman State Park. The map below shows camping spots, lean-to shelters, public lands, easements, closures, &quot;branch&quot; trails, and roadwalking sections (which you probably would want to minimize). <br>https://fingerlakestrail.org/plan-h<wbr>ikes-finger-lakes-trail/interactive<wbr>-trail-map-segmented/<br><br>CalTopo and Natural Atlas show public lands, campsites, trails, and other places of interest in NYS and elsewhere.

You just have to camp 150 feet (half a football field) away from any road or trail. There are also primitive campsites marked with a yellow disc where you can camp for free with no reservations needed. <br><br>May falls in the middle of &quot;mud season&quot; and is also prime season for ticks. Plan accordingly. I would recommend spraying your pants, backpack, and camping gear with permethrin.

There\u2019s also usually hardly any tobacco in a cigarette, meaning you taste burning paper and low grade Burley. However, Burley is a type of pipe tobacco, but it\u2019s usually the highest grade Burley. Burley used in a pipe tobacco blend will typically have notes of cocoa, nuts, and sometimes brown sugar. But there are many other different types of tobacco used in pipe blends; you can have Virginias (Lemon Virginia, Red Virginia, Stoved Virginias, etc.), which often have a fruity, citrusy, earthy, grassy, and tea-like flavor. You can have Perique which is only grown in Louisiana bayous and cured in logs and has a very spicy and plum-like flavor. You can have Dark Fired Kentucky which is a type of Burley that is cured over burning wood, giving it a kind of smoked BBQ and herbal flavor. You can have Oriental (Yenidje, Izmir, Bosma, Drama, Smyrna, Samsun, Xanthi, Katerini, etc.) which comes from the Northeast Mediterranean and the Levant, and usually has an herbal, incense-like, and spicy, very fragrant flavor and aroma. You also have Latakia, which is the most important component in \u201cEnglish\u201d blends and is a type of Oriental that is fire cured using aromatic woods from the Middle East, giving it a sweet, smoky, and incense-y flavor and aroma. It used to come from Syria (Latakia, Syria) up until the Syrian civil war, so now it comes from Cyprus while still using the same techniques as Syrian Latakia. In general, all of those types of tobacco have very strong flavors, which is really the point of pipe smoking, as opposed to the low grade Burley in cigs that tastes like burning cardboard. They don\u2019t use flavorful tobacco in cigarettes because people smoke them for the nicotine, not the flavor. There was a point in time last century when luxury cigarettes did contain Oriental tobaccos, but that stopped when cigarette companies realized smokers were more concerned about nicotine than flavor.", "time": 1668909560, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498637, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)23:58:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve smoked Orlik golden Sliced for years, havnt smoked in like, a year, because for me, its for bars or a treat<br><br>I promised myself i will have a smoke for the first snowfall of the year", "time": 1668920327, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498672, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)02:04:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2498525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2498525</a><br>haha thanks, yeah I knew about it keeping the bugs away but I didn&#039;t know if there was any protections beyond that in the lore.", "time": 1668927868, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498699, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)03:43:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Been out of the smoking game for a while but now that I&#039;m back into it I&#039;ve gone through everything I had cellared. <br><br>What newish tobaccos should I try? <br><br>so far it sounds like Plum Pudding is a must try but what else is out there that is a go to?

I was having problems with flakes before because they would constantly go out and taste like ash. Then I started packing it really loose, and it improved so much. Come to find out, most people already loosely pack rubbed out flake. So if you have problems with flakes going out or not tasting great, pack them super loose. Gravity fill it, lightly push it down just to the halfway point, gravity fill again, and use the fleshy part of your thumb to make sure everything is in the bowl, BUT DON\u2019T PUSH DOWN. Do a char light, use the weight of the tamper to even out the charred tobacco without putting any pressure, do another light and tamp it the same way, but you\u2019re not done yet. After tamping it a 2nd time, the tobacco should be down to the 3/4 mark of the bowl. Do your true light and it should be good to go. Packing it looser means the bowl won\u2019t be filled, but because flake tobacco, even when rubbed out, burns slower and expands, you\u2019ll still get a good 40 minutes in a regular sized bowl.

A pipe tobacco company like Cornell &amp; Diehl would go under if they all of a sudden stopped selling half of their tobacco to put away for aging. I also think that there is a bit of a supply chain issue. Leaves like Latakia and other orientals are becoming increasingly harder to get due to conflicts in the Middle East. The last of the Syrian Latakia was used up. Also, in the case of whiskey, aging in barrels has always been a thing. A lot of distilleries didn\u2019t start selling product until they already had a supply of aged whiskey to sell. By doing that, it ensured they would always have a supply of aged product. Aging pipe tobacco hasn\u2019t really been a thing among pipe smokers until the past few decades or so, so companies never really made an effort to keep a supply of aged tobacco. Dunhill is the only brand I know of that made an effort to experiment with aging in the past, but they eventually ran out of their supply of aged tobacco due to high demand in the 60s and 70s. A lot have people have asked pipe tobacco companies to start aging their tobacco, but their response is basically the same as what I said; if they were to hold a decent amount of tobacco for aging for even a year, they\u2019d most likely go under due to the financial loss they would take, so they\u2019re forced to release what little aged tobacco they have as limited edition blends.", "time": 1671759725, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2513605, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)03:00:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2513493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2513493</a><br>I would also argue that unlike whiskey, which your average person would struggle to store properly for aging, tobacco is pretty compact and fairly easy to store for extended periods of time, making factory aging somewhat unnecessary.", "time": 1671782414, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2513693, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)08:20:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2513493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2513493</a><br>Thanks for taking the time to enlighten me anon.
