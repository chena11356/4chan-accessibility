Along the back theres a river, and upstream a weir that ran into a pool on the far side of the canal bridge. We used to go bathing up there, and it was fine when you were with people, but it felt wrong, not in the naughty way but in the creepy &quot;something is not right here&quot; when alone. There could be people on the other side of the bridge and it would still feel off, but it really became scary when there was noone around. I did dismiss it initially as just nerves, maybe some ancestral fear of still bodies of water which were opaque, as primordial predators could lurk in them. Anyway at one point I found a kayak that had been washed down by the floods, and my class and I played about with it up there. Nothing really happened with other people, as I said, and we used to paddle around the pool (it wasnt deep, you could wade through it. 4 - 5 feet at the most I would say)<br>A couple of times I went up there on my own with the kayak. Now, we had all swam in the pool, and it was empty. There where NO underwater objects or protrusions. Shit, I waded through it. But when you were up there in the pool in the kayak, alone, you would hear noises, as though underwater twigs or fingernails were scraping on the hull. It was really creepy, and I used to get nervous about even paddling with my hands (we didnt have a paddle).<br>To one side - the lower in the picture - there is a cut away in the concrete basin for some vents or drains of some kind, and that always made me really nervous, even a little fearful. I pushed myself to wade to it once, and look at it, but I couldnt bring myself to step into it, even though it was relatively shallow compared to the rest of the pool.<br>If it was just me I might have dismissed it, but it wasnt. A few classmates also mentioned that the pool was really creepy when alone, and that they had also heard the scraping too.<br>Pic related, its the pool.", "filename": "Myerscough", "ext": ".png", "w": 1113, "h": 643, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1668466492572965, "time": 1668466492, "md5": "/pAHTlT1DBXATEkngA8MNA==", "fsize": 1813238, "resto": 2493450}], "last_modified": 1668466492}, {"no": 2483706, "now": "10/20/22(Thu)03:46:18", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/hgm/", "com": "Henlo frens... looks like its time for new homegrow man bread<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;show me ur meddys edition</span><br>also ask for tips and show off ur harvests and stuff c:", "filename": "20221015_135443", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3024, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1666251978013409, "time": 1666251978, "md5": "sX8SHfTa7+YNLAUDT/Mubw==", "fsize": 2163917, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hgm", "replies": 225, "images": 52, "omitted_posts": 220, "omitted_images": 50, "last_replies": [{"no": 2496199, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)12:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2496164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2496164</a><br>You will not survive the winter.

Not greentext.<br><br>I have a favorite campground and particular campsite that I go to every fall. It&#039;s a large park with 1 modern campground towards the front and 3 rustic campgrounds elsewhere.<br>It has personal history. This campground was where I went as a small child. My earliest outdoor memories are here. Later there were father/son camping trips with my friends when we were teenagers. In my 20&#039;s we continued it amongst ourselves. Sure there were stupid 20-something shenanigans but it was mostly chill. We would always have our trip the last weekend in October. Now in my mid-30s, we still have these trips, although the locations change from year to year. People have come and gone but it&#039;s still at least 4 of the core 6 friends. If we don&#039;t go to this particular campground for the annual trip, I make a personal solo trip.<br>My favorite campsite is a 2.5 mile drive from the park entrance and located in the central campground. Its split into 4 loops. 2 on one side of a field, 2 oth the other. Located on a spring fed lake, it&#039;s peaceful and serine. No motors, gas or electric. At night I enjoy sitting by the fire, listening to the world series in the radio while the coyotes and owls make their night time noises.<br>In the past (dating back to my teenage years) Wednesday and Thursday night, you&#039;d be the only one out there. Maybe a handful of other campers on the weekend but thats it.<br>But now, especially the last 5yrs, has gotten disheartening.<br>When I arrived this past Wednesday I was the only one in either loop on my side of the field. There were some hardside campers setup in the other loops across the field.

It throws size 2 clousers better than my SA amplitude mpx which is a half-size heavy. I opted for the higher sink rate because in theory the streamer stops sinking when you start stripping so you can still fish it higher in the water column if desired but can also get it to the bottom quickly. In retrospect I might&#039;ve opted for a slightly slower sink rate so you can fish the streamer more slowly (not having to strip quickly to keep it at the same height in the water) but I think it is good for reaction strikes.", "time": 1668168968, "resto": 2489914}, {"no": 2494755, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)08:39:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494721</a><br>You backpack in with full chest waders?<br>Sounds heavy even if they are stocking foot", "time": 1668173966, "resto": 2489914}, {"no": 2494806, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)11:42:45", "name": "Kevin Van Dam", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;NEW!!!!</span><br><a href=\"/out/thread/2494804#p2494804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494804</a><br><a href=\"/out/thread/2494804#p2494804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494804</a><br><a href=\"/out/thread/2494804#p2494804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494804</a><br><a href=\"/out/thread/2494804#p2494804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494804</a>", "filename": "F11B4498-F413-44F7-94F3-D4CCD3BC79F3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1241, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668184965783455, "time": 1668184965, "md5": "/RpSdxuIgEDgfCKYytDm5A==", "fsize": 267740, "resto": 2489914, "trip": "!ZNBx60Gj/k"}, {"no": 2494809, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)11:45:06", "name": "Kevin Van Dam", "com": "<a href=\"#p2494563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494563</a><br><a href=\"#p2494536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2494536</a><br>Suggestion noted.<br><br>We tried furfags fishin and even Skid\u2019s creepy drawing and started getting b&amp; for posting furry stuff outside of the pedo boards.<br><br>Chick in bikini catches eyes in the catalog", "time": 1668185106, "resto": 2489914, "trip": "!ZNBx60Gj/k"}], "last_modified": 1668428788}, {"no": 2486623, "now": "10/25/22(Tue)04:24:28", "name": "Danny (aka Duffers)", "sub": "brit/out/ - Spooky Edition", "com": "You are going Spooky camping anon, right?", "filename": "shutterstock_1831835803-scaled", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2560, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 156, "tim": 1666686268985117, "time": 1666686268, "md5": "cKdPI2x1+D5wUO6/hNj48A==", "fsize": 1208715, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "britout-spooky-edition", "replies": 75, "images": 23, "omitted_posts": 70, "omitted_images": 21, "last_replies": [{"no": 2494362, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)09:14:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2493369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493369</a><br>What am I looking at??", "time": 1668089682, "resto": 2486623}, {"no": 2494440, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)14:38:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2494102</span>", "filename": "1511576521917", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 684, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668109129926905, "time": 1668109129, "md5": "j0fHGQvmicant4L5Umcz2Q==", "fsize": 41407, "resto": 2486623}, {"no": 2494731, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)07:03:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2493955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2493955</a><br>gimi", "filename": "1648101330510", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 910, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1668168189504813, "time": 1668168189, "md5": "raQzaYo+ElilWA9BYGCI2A==", "fsize": 186419, "resto": 2486623}, {"no": 2496205, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)12:16:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2487973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2487973</a><br>see<br><a href=\"#p2489399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2489399</a>", "time": 1668446179, "resto": 2486623}, {"no": 2496226, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)12:55:08", "name": "sage", "com": "<a href=\"#p2496205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2496205</a><br>No (s)need for that, bumping a dying thread. <br><br>&quot;sage dis nigga&quot;", "time": 1668448508, "resto": 2486623}], "last_modified": 1668515119}, {"no": 2493905, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)05:21:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "When is the best time to harvest cubensis mushrooms?
