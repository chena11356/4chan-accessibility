Also any criticisms or better options should be talked about here. <br><br>Ill first go by stating the things no anon should ever cheap out on.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;boots</span><br>you should aim for boots over 200$ price range eventually, but if you are just getting started buy military surplus boots. But If you can avoid do not buy the recent desert tan army boots that run 20$. They have very thick soles and no ankle support , its a good way to give yourself a sprang ankle, they are also not very breathable or water proof. But I used them for a year so they are workable but do have a week or 2 brake in period.<br><br>Next is backpacks I see many on here choose a military surplus backpack, My experience with a US military molle 2 rucksack is that its usable at best but too heavy. Military sacrifices price and quality material for an indestructible pack that an idiot can&#039;t destroy. You are better off with a used frame backpack or internal backpack. <br><br>I have found that most milltary backpacks are around 65-120$ a used backpacking bag is around 20$ on shopgoodwill.com. I hear you say that you don&#039;t want to stand out in the woods , I would say their are plenty of waterproof rain flys for your bag that come in non-IRreflective camo for 45$ or a Chinese rain fly for 10$ on amazon, which are better than what ever camo you were thinking about buying any how. A good capacity is 65 liters, this is considered 3 day bag but if your smart you can fit rations for a full week in it. 55 liters is fine but the limit for fitting a sleeping bag and not limiting the gear you might want to take. Finally you need to have a waist support for your backpack as well as a frame , this should go without saying a duffel bag is a pain to hull around 5 miles.", "filename": "secondmistake", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669760788941772, "time": 1669760788, "md5": "JEXrHsTMneulq/XreKGk9g==", "fsize": 755994, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "beginner-gear-general-poor-fag-edition", "replies": 41, "images": 9, "omitted_posts": 36, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 2504807, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)15:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "REI 2 person tent is great value for ~$120.

So you definitely want to do it the other way around for the most pleasant and scenic route (beautiful views when walking in the Gr\u00e5sj\u00f8en direction to Trollheimshytta from Gjevilvasshytta as starting point) They&#039;ve also added (to my distaste) a bridge over the first major river there so if there&#039;s a lot of water when you go you will save yourself from that by walking over the bridge. From there you can either go through the valley which leads to J\u00f8ldalshytta which is a very simple hike, or take the more challenging one up the mountain, which in return gives you way better views. The last part of the trip from J\u00f8ldalshytta to Gjevilvasshytta is unknown to me, but from what I&#039;ve gathered it&#039;s a reasonably simple hike, with bridges over the two main rivers there. The cabins are own by Den Norske Turistforening (DNT) so you will find out everything you need to know about the cabins from them. I never use cabins (except when I was on norways tallest mountain) so idk much about them. Have eaten a kanelbolle at gjevilvasshytta though, good shit. During the main season for hiking in Norway there&#039;s a lot of people doing trekanten, but the cabins are only open for a limited time during the summer, so you can&#039;t really get a trip alone unless you head out during autumn. It costs 70kr to drive in to the valley using some app, and it costs to park by Gjevilvasshytta.
