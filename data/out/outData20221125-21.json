I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out. My house looks like any other 1960&#039;s Australian fibro cottage but I take a working holiday every couple of years to Taree as a cattle drover and stay in pic-related.<br><br>I want to talk about how hard it is to be green, but it really isn&#039;t.
