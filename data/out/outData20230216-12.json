That&#039;s the thing that I get hung up on.</span><br>Glad you&#039;re interested. I too had the very same thought when I got my first tenkara pole, thinking at the time that it would be a very light and portable but worse fly rod. The unique advantages are subtle and sort of sneak up on you.<br><br>The number one and most initially subtle advantage (but that quickly becomes obvious once you start casting) is that the fly line never touches the water. Only the fly and a bit of tippet do. This is why a tenkara pole can get away with a much shorter leader. No reel fly rod can achieve a more delicate presentation.<br><br>Sensitivity. The pole and line are extremely light. You can feel nibbles and hits much more readily, and feel the fight a lot more too.<br><br>Inherent tightlining and near-effortless dead drifting. Without dozens of yards of line to manage, tightlining and dead drifting are fairly easy. Along with this, it&#039;s easy to impart subtle motion to your fly. The ripples I can achieve look hilariously realistic and often lead directly to strikes. Finally, it&#039;s also easy to maintain tension during the fight.<br><br>You can cast a tenkara line over fast-moving current into a pool or rill beyond thay current, and simply &quot;bypass/bridge over&quot; it, since the rod and line make a big V. With a reel fly rod, that current will grab your line when it hits the water and fuck off with it, as I&#039;m sure you know.<br><br>With tenkara, pick up and lay down casting is much easier and faster, and it&#039;s much easier to be accurate with PUALD as well. You can even create the illusion of a hatch or swarm by creating many light insect touchdowns over an area, sort of like chumming the water.", "filename": "ee4c30b4235f4e4cd2e32321afa059ad", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1676344916871785, "time": 1676344916, "md5": "it6AASGKu7Mc5IeigNhSLw==", "fsize": 96625, "resto": 2536933, "trip": "!6DkrFbyQmc"}, {"no": 2538747, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:22:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2538746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2538746</a><br>God you are such a faggot", "time": 1676344973, "resto": 2536933}, {"no": 2538751, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:32:05", "name": "Cane Pole Merchant", "com": "<a href=\"#p2538746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2538746</a><br>Now all this being said, if you need a lot of range, a deep-sinking presentation, and/or are doing a lot of stripping, you are better off with a reel fly rod.

Part 1/2<br><br>Anons general prepping roadmap<br><br>The most likely problem you&#039;re face is financial hardship. Dave Ramsey is a dick but his general plan is good. First get your income up, you should be making well over the median in your area. If you&#039;re not you need a new job. Avoid consumer debt, save a 3-6 month emergency fund or 20,000 in cash, whatever is higher. Payoff all debt but your house, then start savings at minimum 30% of your income into investments. Also save a down payment and buy a house on a 15 year fixed rate if you plan to stay in the same area. You should be 100% debt free including owned property before retirement. 30% is enough to get you to retirement in 25 years from the start date.<br><br>The next most likely problem you&#039;ll have is health related. Get in shape. Join a gym of if money is tight start doing something you enjoy even if its just walking and some pushups. Join a club sport in your area. Do something to lose the weight and get healthy.<br><br>Address basic needs, thats food, water, water purification, shelter and heat for 3 days with no outside help like power and water.<br><br>You should already own weather appropriate clothes and some blankets. If not get some real winter gear, a tent, and a sleeping bag.<br>0. Self defense pistol. Get a 9mm glock and 4 mags, order 1000 rounds of ammo because you need to practice. 1200 dollars total.<br>1. First aid kit, adventure medical is good.<br>2. Water purifier, katadyn, MSR and berkey are nice brands. Get a hiking filter life straws are one time use bullshit.<br>4.

Duct tape, tarps, cordage, plywood and 3 inch deck screws with an electric drill solves a lot of shitty situations like a broken window from a storm.<br>9.

Spending all the money you save on another old car or motorbike to fix up is fun. Because I have a really big backyard I got into archery a couple of years ago and built a proper range and made other archery friends. Also laying in a hammock while drinking a beer and reading a book on Saturday mornings is underrated. Buy a telescope and stare at the stars. Buy a second-hand mirrorless camera and an adapter for the telescopes&#039; eyepiece and automate that shit with Aliexpress parts and SpaceEngine. Working on an animal farm gives you free access to dung and scrap metal so build an enormous vegetable patch and grow the shit out of shit.

Much better than trying to stomp through snow for several miles. The pic I posted had snow ranging from heel height to above knee height which will drain you quickly without any snowshoes/skis. Skis are also nice obviously, but I find snowshoes to be easier to deal with in this terrain. The ones I have are 30&quot; snowshoes, metal frame and deep spikes, rated at a weight up to about 125kg/275lbs ish depending on snow conditions. Most people will do fine with a 25&quot;, but thats up to your total weigth. Obviously it&#039;s a bit weird to use if you&#039;ve never used snowshoes before, as you may have to get used to a slightly wider walking stance depending on the snowshoes, but I&#039;ve used much wider ones before that I&#039;ve ran in, so these slimmer ones were a luxury to me.<br>I&#039;d recommend making sure you get the right weight rating; you + your pack + other stuff youre carrying. Heel lift is also a plus if you think you&#039;ll need it. And personally I prefer slim and long, vs short and wide. Of course make sure theyll fit you nicely, this isnt usually an issue for most people as theyll usually adjust to most feet(EU38-47). Just make sure to double check.

I have never had a &quot;bad trip&quot;, I have however been witness to one. I was camping with some friends and it was his first time taking them, he was alright for the first hour or so but then he went full retard. He started walking around quickly while loudly saying buzzwords that came to mind, it was almost impossible to communicate with him, he tripped on the canoe and fell into it, then stood up and just yelled &quot;FUCK&quot; and walked away. He was clearly distressed and we did our best to babysit him for the rest of the day. He came out of it eventually and he was fine but he doesn&#039;t remember a good part of the experience and describes what he does remember as being in the cockpit of a plane on autopilot. He&#039;s always been a bit neurotic and he did try to &quot;fight it&quot; as opposed to letting the drug wash over him like I recommended.<br><br>My theory is that it&#039;s all about being in control of your mental state. I&#039;m a very calm person, I don&#039;t get anxious or angry easily, and I&#039;ve never had an experience like that. <br>The factors that go into that vary, but being around people you trust, having previous experience, reminding yourself that you&#039;re in an altered state and knowing that it will end in a few hours are all important. The experience is overstimulating by nature, and if you panic the fear you feel is just as enhanced as all your other sensations. I don&#039;t think It&#039;s for everyone, but used responsibly and with the right mindset I&#039;ve found it to be a consistently interesting experience.<br><br>Over the past couple of months my friend has been asking me about trying mushrooms again, saying it was scary but he wants to do it again, so we&#039;ll se how that goes.", "filename": "1674556529492041", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676404523835130, "time": 1676404523, "md5": "W9c+14oRhf2FW1/GPpO7hw==", "fsize": 120021, "resto": 2511990}, {"no": 2539039, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)15:41:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2539028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2539028</a><br>Based shroooomer", "filename": "1673127080015367", "ext": ".png", "w": 360, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676407273277476, "time": 1676407273, "md5": "UGEvwZ4hpMbjB2uWnKLgkw==", "fsize": 7737, "resto": 2511990}, {"no": 2539559, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)20:07:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2519932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2519932</a><br>I do not understand the whole dancing while words cross the screen bullshit<br>How did people get hooked on this tictokery garbage ?", "filename": "1675138459243092", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 842, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676509625744533, "time": 1676509625, "md5": "pyMcqQlxh5XMXqYK4Z8BTg==", "fsize": 105237, "resto": 2511990}, {"no": 2539697, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:39:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2539559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2539559</a><br>There are way more idiotic TikTok trends than that one.", "time": 1676529573, "resto": 2511990}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2538955, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)11:54:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Next month I will be in Portland, Oregon area for a week, and then I will be heading north to Seattle, and then Vancouver Canada.<br>I am looking for quick 2 hour hiking spots, camp sites, good national forest to visits around those areas, twisty roads, offroading, quite places to relax and be away from everything.

On an intellectual level, I comprehend wanting to summit a peak &quot;because it&#039;s there,&quot; even though most been already been summited by many others in previous decades. I realize that charting a new route to climb, achieving something a little better or faster than most, or just reaching personal goals can provide motivation.<br><br>It&#039;s just that tall mountains aren&#039;t the only things that are &quot;out there.&quot; There are a lot of other things &quot;out there&quot; and, in my view, most of those things seem much more interesting than going up and down various large, lifeless rocks featuring only smaller chunks of themselves, ice, and snowpack.<br><br>Take SCUBA, for example. There are fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and reefs and shit to explore, and studying oceanic biomes can be useful, even profitable. If mountaineers were chipping out fossils then that might be slightly interesting, but that would probably ruin the precious routes used by mountaineers to go up big rock and down again.<br><br>In some ways this argument can apply to most /out/ activities to some extent. For example, non-fishermen believe fishing is boring and that all you do is sit motionless holding a pole, which isn&#039;t true at all in practice. At least with fishing, though, you might see a turtle, you&#039;ll spot some interesting birds, there are trees, you&#039;ll get to talk to other fishermen, you might get lucky and find a nice lost lure, you can have fun paddling a boat around... mountaineering is just rocks, snow, and the company only of other mountaineers.<br><br>I do respect it, because of the expertise and skill needed.

I haven&#039;t ever told anyone but my family this story but here goes.<br><br>A decade ago while solo hiking in snow for the first time (blue mountains australia) I fucked up stepped into a pile of snow which I thought was solid and slipped down a slope ending up in an ice stream in full gear, maybe a 40lb pack on. I went in head first straight under. The stream was only 3 foot wide but it was a 3 foot drop to actually get into it. I didn&#039;t even know it was there and only slid 20m to get into it, it was hidden by its snow capped edges. I quickly threw my body around and when my feet couldn&#039;t touch the bottom I started to panic. It was moving fast and I was immediately carried away, it felt like I was in that stream for 2 minutes but I think it was only 10 seconds. Some how I managed to drop my pack and kick up off something back onto the edge and dragged myself back up. After I got out I tore all of my clothes off to my underwear, which took all of my energy<br>and ran for the road which was about 1km away and I was very lucky that there were cars there with people pulled over having snow ball fights with their children. So I came bolting over in my underwear and the people had seen what happened to me got me in their car and wedged me between two adult men in the backseat. I remember sitting there and I felt so pleasant and at peace with everything, kind of zoning in and out of the pleasant feelings, then back into the reality that I was almost naked between two men who were rubbing my body and sandwiching me.

They don&#039;t really bite much. <br><br>Huntsmans are total bro&#039;s, never been bitten by one. They prefer to not get rolled on &amp; squished so you&#039;re usually fine but sometimes the little ones enjoy a little spelunk. Luckily we automatically swallow while asleep. <br><br>I&#039;ve been in north Queensland 27 years &amp; been barefoot for maybe 25 of them total. Never been bitten, though have had encounters with snakes. Just stomp around loudly so they can hear your nuts swing &amp; they will flee in the wake of your eminence. If you get bitten, pop a squat, keep a hold of the snake &amp; you&#039;ll be fine. Just so they know what antidote to use instantly. <br><br>As far as crocodiles go just stay clear of murky water &amp; have a small distraction animal with you like a dog.

Fill the pipe with tobacco, pack it down halfway, top it off, pack it down to 3/4, top it off again, pack gently and enjoy. Smoke slower than you think you need to, the tobacco tastes best when it is burning cool. Tamp and re-light as needed.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck. I\u2019m currently clearing a bunch of land for a terrace to grow some vegetables and friut trees. I might just buy 5 small pigs and let them run around in there and fatten them up.

Take a quarter acre and grow corn to feed the pig.

Depending on the type of land, you might need to clear space to make it useful. You&#039;ll also need to clear brush and other fuels to prevent fire.

Start learning about how to care for them, how to fence them in, and related topics like how to manage grazing without destroying your land.

Personally, I have a full time job as a software developer, so I can&#039;t afford to spend hours every day manually weeding and dragging around hoses. We have taken some ideas from commercial operations and we use woven ground cover cloth and drip tape in our gardens. We&#039;re still using organic fertilizers, but it gets injected into the drip system. I also make several yards of compost every year. We also got a tractor, which saves shit tons of time every year. My point is, start thinking about the style of gardening you want to do, and build the skills to support that. Also, learn some basic construction techniques.

Come up with a plan of what you intend on growing, how long it takes to germinate an estimate of when it will be to harvest. And strategize your planning around that. While you can&#039;t plant summer plants in spring, you can absolutely plant spring plants throughout the entire growing season ( I plant lettuce, arugula, carrots, kale, etc) all season long. With proper care, variety selection optimized for summer you can have lettuce and whatever the entire season. In order to do this you have to practice succession planting (planting a crop succesively every week or two to have continual harvest) You also need space to do this and an ability to crop rotate (when this plants coming out I have a new plant taking it&#039;s place.) Most summer crops happen to be fruiting plants (tomato, zucchini, etc) that are plant and done till they die from disease or the cold. So what I do is dedicate entire beds to my summer plants and work my spring/fall specific plants around that. I have two rows dedicated to trellising plants (tomatoes, cucumbers, pole beans) i intercrop determinate tomatoes with my climbing beans and bush beans with my climbing tomatoes and cucumbers. I have a row for peppers which I can intercop things like lettuce or radishes, whatever you want that doesn&#039;t take up to many nutrients. My garden is 8 30inch rows 45 feet long atm and when you map out an entire planting strategy my summer beds automatically rotate themselves to spring planting beds by next grow season. Draw diagrams of your garden space, figure out what you&#039;re planting and the harvest time and ask yourself if I want a continual harvest of something like carrots or lettuce what do I need to do to achieve that, where can I plant them, where can I plant my next row of them, etc. It requires very thoughtful planting but it&#039;s not hard to figure out the optimal strategy for your alotment", "time": 1675371155, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533771, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)20:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533523</a><br>you&#039;re gonna have to manually pollenate when the time comes, they won&#039;t successfully wind-pollenate with that few plants at that distance", "time": 1675389572, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533797, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:06:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533771</a><br>I thought that manual pollenate thing was only when you have different kind of corn(i saw a video where a guys uses paper bags to make the polkenate thing)", "time": 1675393570, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533814, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:56:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I want to do a landrace of squash, do I need to try to pollinate it a certain way or just let it go natural and collect the seeds from the best specimens?

Considering taking that elsewhere and turning it into a blog-like thread so that it stays longer and increases the likelihood of either someone learning from it or giving advice without the need to repost. <br><br>Background: family has been growing vegetables since forever, most of them would start out as seeds in a moist towel while the world outside would still be covered in snow - and I&#039;ve been around to partake in the process, but none of these plants were of citrus variety, so there&#039;s plenty of unknowns. Besides, they&#039;d always end up being replanted into the ground removing some potential issues from the equation.<br>What little experience I have with citrus, all comes from these lemons and I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s been going without a hitch either. That said, here&#039;s some thoughts:<br>\u2014Citrus are best grown from cuttings (at least lemons are) but it&#039;s definitely possible to grow something out of a seed too, otherwise there wouldn&#039;t be any so keep at it.<br>\u2014Seeds are whimsical, in general. Healthier plump-looking ones from mature-looking fruit have the highest chance of sprouting into something decent but to give an example of how it has worked out for some of the seed-grown saplings that I had had, out of 10 or so, only 6-7 properly sprouted, then 1 or 2 perished after barely having surfaced, which left me with 5, of which 2 were very ill-looking. Half a year later one of them just withered away, the other still clings on despite not having advanced in its development since like July. All of them shared nearly identical conditions, though some had slightly different soil mixes or pots. Your bottom left (red pot) looks kind of like the one that died on me.<br>\u2014Looks like citrus seem to prefer potasium-rich soil. Compare your soil&#039;s composition (written on the bag) with citrus-specific one. Probably too early for that but there&#039;s special fertilizer you have to feed them too. <br>cont", "time": 1675952404, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2536635, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)09:21:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2536598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2536598</a><br><a href=\"#p2536634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2536634</a><br>\u2014I think heating mat did help mine when they were placed on the windowsill, though the bottom parts of pots felt too warm for my liking and I had to raise them a bit. Currently moved them a bit further away from the windows and am supplementing them with electric lights instead.<br>\u2014Depending on your latitude, days may be too short, may want to invest in a grow lamp (or just a regular lamp and a bright e27 led bulb, preferably with a specific spectrum recommended for plants)<br>\u2014Generally just watering the top layer of soil isn&#039;t enough, you want to make sure the soil is soaked all the way through. I&#039;d water them gently, until water starts leaking through the bottom holes, once every 3-5 days. Think I used to do it more often when pots were smaller. The soil has to dry out between the waterings to prevent potential rot or those stupid mold flies, but drying out too much is also bad.<br>\u2014Probably not your case but just leaving it here for future reference: looks can be deceptive, if you carefully dig your finger a few cms into the soil and it&#039;s dry even though you&#039;ve just watered the pot that means you have the same problem that I did where some parts of the soil have compacted and won&#039;t let water through so it always drains down one side. You can notice it if pouring even a tiny amount of water results in it leaking out from the bottom. Usually happens after you haven&#039;t watered the plant in too long. In my case I carefully dug around a small depth breaking down any lumps I could feel and trying not to damage roots, then mixed the perturbed soil with some fresh one, pressed it down a bit and watered it a few times repeatedly then emptied the saucer.<br><br>Also if one were to perish I&#039;d probably not reuse that soil, maybe it&#039;s gone bad. Better get some fresh one, preferably for citrus. Soil needs to have bacteria in it, they&#039;re not immortal, so old dry soils need to be mixed with fresh lively ones.<br>Probably forgot or missed something but oh well.", "time": 1675952472, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2536654, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)09:57:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2536610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2536610</a><br>I got three months plus of freezing weather.

Some states administer online training courses, others require an in person class. I would suggest going through your education course, then picking specific game animals to hunt. I would personally start with squirrel and rabbit, as they&#039;re small game yet have traits akin to larger game animals. Squirrels are very very tough, hard to process as a beginner, and their hides make an excellent challenge to tan and craft with. Rabbits are the opposite, you have to be as careful as possible on thin skinned rabbits. I&#039;m based (kek) out of Missouri, where our small game seasons end on the 15th. We&#039;re currently late season, so the animal movement has been slowing down quite a lot. But learn your target game&#039;s psychological needs, reproductive habits, shelter types, calls, hours, etc. Squirrels are active in the morning and the sunset, while rabbits are also primarily nocturnal or operate within the morning or sunset. Squirrels nest in dreys or in holes in trees, while rabbits bed in thicket or crevices. Can do an improvised squirrel call using nothing but 2 US quarter dollars to imitate the sound of a nut, or can buy a critter call that sounds like them. I would suggest trying to hunt with an air rifle or slingshot first as it maximizes opportunity due to noise, but really any hunting weapon will work. .177 air rifles are an excellent beginner&#039;s shooter, I&#039;d look into Gamo air rifles. Lead ammo is your best bet as these do not kill by penetration, but by blunt force trauma. You will most definitely have penetration, but if you have a super fast round pierce a squirrel and exit out the other end, you may instead just maim the poor fella. As of late I have taken a liking to slingshot hunting as well, using 7/16&quot; steel rounds. Ultimately for both, what kills small game is accuracy. You&#039;re going for headshots only. Hitting vitals may guarantee a kill, but(cont)", "time": 1676090351, "resto": 2532097}, {"no": 2537464, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)23:44:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2537461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2537461</a><br>These small animals are FAST and they may very quickly run to a shelter in which you cannot retrieve them. I would suggest setting a specific distance goal, such as 5 or 10 yards, and practicing on your desired weapon. For squirrels, their head is extremely tiny and moves a lot. You want to be able to shoot a ping pong ball at least 7 out of 10 times on average. You owe that to the game animals you&#039;re killing, as well as to the community. Legislation on air rifles and slingshots is steeped in dumb misinformation, the last thing we as hunters want is to continue that trend. I would practice this daily until you&#039;re capable of these feats, and then prepare yourself for your hunt! Camo is not a requirement, but it certainly helps a lot. I have found that solid greens work quite well too, but camo seems to yield the least amount of unsuccessful stalks. Scent control is also not a requirement, to me personally it feels like you&#039;re going all out if you&#039;re genuinely using it for small game hunting. Animals usually know you&#039;re there, but just being aware of the wind direction tends to aid in making yourself invisible. Something I haven&#039;t found mentioned many places either is that squirrels often seem to not react too much while eating, which to me(I&#039;m not an expert on animal psychology) seems rather counter intuitive... For them. For us, it usually gives a unique opportunity to eliminate them as humanely as possible. I have yet to observe this behaviour in rabbits, but they&#039;re usually either standing still or sprinting fast anyways.

I&#039;ll add a couple of things. First, expect to get grossed out and frustrated when cleaning game. Use a really sharp knife and know how to resharpen it. Kill a squirrel or rabbit and haul ass home to clean it; it&#039;s better to learn how to clean one animal at a time so you don&#039;t have to worry about spoilage. Eventually you&#039;ll learn the tricks of cleaning fast. Don&#039;t expect everything to taste as mild as chicken or beef. Most game has a wild flavor, and some (like antelope) can turn your stomach if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing. You&#039;ll be surprised at how good some small game tastes - squirrel and rabbit in particular. So, try to keep the animal cool if you&#039;re not going to clean it in the field, use the appropriate tools to clean it (game shears are a thing), and know that the animal will look a lot better once it&#039;s cooked, even if it&#039;s a whole squirrel skewered on a stick and roasted over a fire. <br><br>As far as useful things to take hunting, just take what you&#039;d normally do for a walk in the woods or fields, plus maybe an old cotton pillowcase to put the game in before it goes into your daypack.

Umbrellas are very situationally dependent. Sometimes they\u2019re absolutely the best option, and sometimes there are better options out there. If there\u2019s a lot of wind driven rain (and I mean a lot, not just a slight breeze in a light drizzle), you might be better off with a jacket. If the trail is really over grown (basically bushwhacking; a little overgrowth won\u2019t hurt anything), then your umbrella may get snagged too often.<br><br>Where they work well is light to moderate rain. Just as a rain jacket is paired with pants, an umbrella can do the same. They also pair well with a very light jacket, such as a water resistant running jacket. That combo provides heavy protection from rain via the umbrella while the jacket keeps any blowback from soaking you, and it\u2019s still more breathable than most options. A lot of thruhikers are using this combo now. It\u2019s pretty versatile; if it\u2019s not raining too hard you leave the jacket off and use just the umbrella (unlike just a rain jacket, where it\u2019s all or nothing). <br><br>Breathability is a huge umbrella advantage. It\u2019s why it\u2019s the absolute best rain protection in hot environments during rainy summers. In the South, rain showers spring up out of nowhere, and dissipate just as quickly. They\u2019re so scattered that raining while the sun is out is fairly common.

If you&#039;re bowhunting in late August every minute counts and you&#039;ll need to get the meat on ice within an hour. This will most likely mean taking a knife, game bags, and a way to transport it to a cooler full of ice. The game bags allow the meat to cool without you worrying about flies laying eggs in it.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high.

From there get that shit planeted, rent the place out for shooters to enjoy, get gun loisence and safe and you now have land, a few overpriced guns, cheap cars(no tax to own) and access to a place so unpopulated that it makes siberia look full.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

Really thoguh my first thing would be doing everything you can to start getting allies and assistance for getting place to place. Bushcraft is great but feildcraft is more the utility. Always worth looking more into that. The thing with scalable skills is whatever you are doing is very clean and deliberately focused on getting family safe. We did previously speak about making sure kids know what to do when or if seperation occurs a while back.<br>SKills are eternal but one bad rock can put you out so the thing now is to make sure that the wife mirrors a lot of the things you&#039;re prioritising. Mostly that comes from doing what you are doing. No need to change anything and you know your situation better than anyone here does. <br>So what I would say given what you&#039;ve said is this.<br>Try to make freinds who are able to cover for you, or build stronger relations with people who are more likely to be useful should you have to make a call.<br>Have someone you can send to your home if you get a leg injury.<br>Vehicle storing away from home as a final bug out stash might be viable if you can. I didn&#039;t see much about car kit or mainanance. But it&#039;s always worth securing your peacetime ride. <br>Do you have any specific conditions that will cause you to pack up and go? Does your wife and immediate associates know the drill? Have you drilled with them a lot?<br><br>To me it sounds like you&#039;ve squared away everything you need to. Skilling up and saving while waiting, doing what you can where you are with what you have until you can alter the outcome or optimise your present place. This is great stuff. I think you&#039;ve taken exceedinly well thought out and considered steps. <br>My final word is start making allies. Hard. Start building a social base to really count on. They can help practice skills. Hell if you can start a civil group and see if you can&#039;t bring in others. But vet them.

It&#039;s as simple as an A frame and a good water container for long term. But frankly people are so generous on the road that I never had much actual adversity that I didn&#039;t go out of my way to find. Especially when it came to bad weather, mostly heat related, I&#039;d go read a lot. Eat some cheap end of day meals. Go to work the next day, showering at places that let me, rest stops in two cases and beachside in most of the urban zones.

Picking some gravel out is good for growing plants, but turning your whole yard would probably destroy the few microbes currently living in the soil. Most desert crops are adapted to rocky soil anyways.<br>I&#039;m not sure how dry your place is, but compost will be beneficial. I figure till shallowly to remove the biggest rocks and weed seeds before applying compost, ideally from a local material like dry grass or mesquite bark. In the compost you can plant some beneficial native/naturalized plants. Especially ones that attract insects - pollinators, burrowers, etc. Even consider a wood pile or shallow-rimmed clay pot full of water, to foster critters visiting your spot. You want to let the bugs and plants do the work of aerating/sieving the soil, because they foster a while microbial community and leave nutrients in the soil via their droppings.<br>IDK how much time you have tho. If you&#039;re only renting for a year, you may consider just a shallow till, compost, and crops surrounded by the beneficial natives/wildflowers.

The plant life between the farm and the body of water does help to mitigate soluble nutrients running off to some extent, but it also works to stabilize the banks of the stream against soil erosion. Soil erosion in stream banks is caused by stormwater flows(which of course are so bad because we have so much land in cultivation and cultivated land has very poor stormwater buffering capacity, like a parking lot basically) and results in damage to both ecosystems and important infrastructure like reservoirs and energy production dams. The sediments that wash away from a streambank wash down stream and settle out and coat the bottom, which is typically gravel.. Lots of fish and insects spawn in gravel and this inhibits reproduction. The sediments also wash down and fill in reservoirs for drinking water and dams and limits storage capacity meaning the reservoir has to be dredged.

I just talked to myself at a normal volume and he kept walking away.<br>On the other hand, I was with a group of 3 and we were walking along another tundra hillside. We saw a black bear below us. We immediately began yelling and making noise to scare it away. This time, the thing developed a keen interest in us. It stayed in the valley for the entire day.<br>That showed me that bears respond badly to perceived challenges, just like people. You should only start making noise/freaking out once the bear shows interest in you.

Maybe this is only where their ranges overlap, but my theory is that blacks get picked on constantly by the big guys. So they are more aggressive towards weaker bears and people in turn.

I wasn&#039;t even in the hyper-hipster libtard areas like Seattle, I was inland, right by Idaho. I think part of it just has to do with the local environment. Southern Ontario is crowded, highly industrial (aka ugly in lots of parts), very car-dependent (with bad road infrastructure), sub-par access to natural areas. Washington has insane access to a huge variety of great outdoors stuff as long as you aren&#039;t in the central area (even so, its like 1.5-2hr to pristine mountains), less crowded, nicer neighborhood (not as much of the expansive cheap suburbs we have here). <br><br>I think about moving every week.
