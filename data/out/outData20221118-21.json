He is white, or black-and-white, or black, with the black mouth and under-lip of his race. He is a sharp, intelligent, quaint companion, and has the &quot;homing&quot; faculty of a pigeon.

These are essential qualities in a dog whose owner frequently hunts truffles at night - in the shrubberies of mansions protected by keepers and watchmen, who regard him with suspicion. In order to distinguish a black dog on these occasions, the hunter furnishes his animal with a white shirt, and occasionally also hunts him in a line.<br><br>These dogs are rather longer on the leg than the true poodle, but have exquisite noses, and hunt close to the ground. On the scent of a truffle (especially in the morning or evening, when it gives out most smell), they show all the keenness of a spaniel, working their short-cropped tails, and feathering along the surface of the ground for from twenty to fifty yards. Arrived at the spot where the fungus lies buried, some two or three inches beneath the surface, they dig like a terrier at a rat&#039;s hole, and the best of them, if let alone, will disinter the fungus and carry it to his master. It is not usual, however, to allow the dog to exhaust himself in this way, and the owner forks up the truffle and gives the dog his usual reward, a piece of bread or cheese; for this he looks, from long habit, with the keen glance of a Spanish gipsy.", "filename": "957af7f17f9936428f86487c151b004e", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1066, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668761442838864, "time": 1668761442, "md5": "aIcrRpEFgG1j22nRk3RSAw==", "fsize": 163483, "resto": 2496525}, {"no": 2497774, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)10:15:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497256</a><br>Has some Jagdterrier in him", "time": 1668784505, "resto": 2496525}], "last_modified": 1668784505}, {"no": 2497575, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)20:39:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s your favorite Gucci brand?", "filename": "the-best-camping-outfits-for-men-and-women", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668735546546481, "time": 1668735546, "md5": "viXe49wyOII0EuFihtrsyQ==", "fsize": 127871, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-your-favorite-gucci-brand", "replies": 8, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 2497627, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)22:42:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497623</a><br>Funny, it makes me feel less white.", "filename": "1667525307777145", "ext": ".png", "w": 656, "h": 522, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1668742961111451, "time": 1668742961, "md5": "tNtvCjBemBazK99LB0lqww==", "fsize": 39367, "resto": 2497575}, {"no": 2497748, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)09:03:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497575</a><br>Kuhl, Mountain Hwwardwear, Arc&#039;Teryx", "time": 1668780186, "resto": 2497575}, {"no": 2497765, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)09:50:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "American. <br><br>Mammut is my shit.", "time": 1668783012, "resto": 2497575}, {"no": 2497772, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)10:10:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i have never held any loyalty to any brand. whoever makes the best [article of clothing] or [piece of gear] at the best price is who i am going to buy, every time. <br>my fleeces are generic, my dri-down jackets are from a local cottage brand from my city, my pants are usually kuhls or pre-nerf pranas, my shorts are from an ultimate frisbee company, my wool is from patagonia and icebreaker, my bison and alpaca wool gear are from local cottage manufacturers, my softshells are black diamond, my hardshells are columbia, my hat is from alibaba, my pack was custom, my tent was bought used from a local cottage manufacturer, ETC.", "time": 1668784208, "resto": 2497575}, {"no": 2497773, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)10:10:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497575</a><br>Montbell is the only company that didnt have the niggerfaggot flag up during the riots.", "time": 1668784218, "resto": 2497575}], "last_modified": 1668784218}, {"no": 2496987, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)09:14:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;grew up in rural Australian town</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;always outside as a kid, barefeet &amp; shorts, no insect spray</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;never get bitten by a tick even once</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;move away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;move back as an adult</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2021, bitten by first tick working on a farm</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2022, bitten by 2 ticks despite not working an outdoor job, hospitalized once for spotted fever</span><br>it&#039;s over, fuck this world", "filename": "429EE521B60523FBD0F994D8FA910D049B1B231F", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668608068479754, "time": 1668608068, "md5": "SBusCqz4tD13nLvdx0f6nQ==", "fsize": 6879, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "grew-up-in-rural-australian-town", "replies": 11, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 2497037, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)11:16:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497034</a><br>Kentucky chuds stay winning let&#039;s go northerners gtfo", "time": 1668615382, "resto": 2496987}, {"no": 2497055, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)12:07:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497034</a><br>That map is horribly out of date.

Not greentext.<br><br>I have a favorite campground and particular campsite that I go to every fall. It&#039;s a large park with 1 modern campground towards the front and 3 rustic campgrounds elsewhere.<br>It has personal history. This campground was where I went as a small child. My earliest outdoor memories are here. Later there were father/son camping trips with my friends when we were teenagers. In my 20&#039;s we continued it amongst ourselves. Sure there were stupid 20-something shenanigans but it was mostly chill. We would always have our trip the last weekend in October. Now in my mid-30s, we still have these trips, although the locations change from year to year. People have come and gone but it&#039;s still at least 4 of the core 6 friends. If we don&#039;t go to this particular campground for the annual trip, I make a personal solo trip.<br>My favorite campsite is a 2.5 mile drive from the park entrance and located in the central campground. Its split into 4 loops. 2 on one side of a field, 2 oth the other. Located on a spring fed lake, it&#039;s peaceful and serine. No motors, gas or electric. At night I enjoy sitting by the fire, listening to the world series in the radio while the coyotes and owls make their night time noises.<br>In the past (dating back to my teenage years) Wednesday and Thursday night, you&#039;d be the only one out there. Maybe a handful of other campers on the weekend but thats it.<br>But now, especially the last 5yrs, has gotten disheartening.<br>When I arrived this past Wednesday I was the only one in either loop on my side of the field. There were some hardside campers setup in the other loops across the field.
