So like dandelions, Docks, ECT.<br>Anyways my advice to learn foraging is to not even try to do foraging for at least a few months. Rather buy several plant books about the specific biome you&#039;re in in Texas, (desert, forest, plains) and then just try to identify any plants you can cross-referencing between the different books and the internet, with no regard for if the plant is useful. Just try to memorize the subtle differences between any plants you see often.<br>Eventually you will just come to know what certain plants are definitively, and some of those plants will be the edible ones, then you can safely forage those.<br>Also sorry if I seemed condescending Im this post.

They are the same knife with slight variations in handle shape and blade length, pick the one whose shape you like the most. They make amazing knives for the money, not sure if there&#039;s any overhead if you&#039;re in the USA but in Europe these go for 120-130 bucks. The steel they use is Sleipnir which is a substantially improved D2, it&#039;s tool steel and not stainless so you will have to do a little maintenance with oil to avoid rust but it&#039;s tough as shit. The knives are a beefy full tang with a sharpened pommel for lighting firesteels. They can handle batoning and everything else. The grip on mine is phenomenal because of the way it&#039;s machined, and they use either wood or materials like micarta or g10. I&#039;ve got one in micarta and another in g10 they&#039;re both amazing. I think the wood they use is &quot;stabilized&quot; which I guess means some kind of polymerising treatment. They&#039;re the best knives I&#039;ve ever handled. Super comfortable, balance, perfect fit &amp; finish, great leather shealths or kydex on the beefier knives.<br>You can probably get &quot;better&quot; but it&#039;s on a whole different price point and IMO you don&#039;t need more than that.

Software as a subscription service is pretty shitty on its face, but apps like AllTrails want me to pay repeatedly for something I can get for free.

It\u2019s more the principal of the matter than the actual price. Many of these apps (AllTrails, Avenza, Gaia, and the lesser known Paper Maps) used to support this function for free. None of them do anymore. <br><br>The best alternative I\u2019ve found is Topo Nomad. It has easy access to USGS maps through the app, and allows for custom uploads. The free version allows for 5 or 6 maps to be downloaded at once. For a one time $10 fee you get a \u201c100 year subscription\u201d and you can store as many as you want. So basically it\u2019s a $10 app. It also has the typical features your expect like tracking and drop pins. <br><br>So what does AllTrails have that I\u2019m missing out on?

it&#039;s substrate, a clear shot of the top and side view of it, and a clear shot of the gills/pores/stipe/stem or otherwise the entire undercarriage of the mushroom. every detail of the encounter helps, where, when, what was the weather, etc. <br>If you want people who do this for a living to give their guess on ID&#039;s, take all of the above and make quality observations on Mushroomobserver. <br><br>This science needs as much redundant ID and loacation data as possible, any observation has value and is a meaningful contribution that takes a few more seconds than just taking a picture of the pretty thing you saw in the woods. <br><br>Previous image capped<br><a href=\"/out/thread/2479659#p2479659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2479659</a>", "filename":

Anyway, I was hiking, desperately looking for flat ground in order to set it up and had luckily found a nice little clearing off the trail and past the treeline. By the time I had that gay tent up, it was dark so I went back to my bag to rummage for my headlamp. While I was in my bag, I started hearing this metallic banging noise, kind of like someone hitting a homerun with an aluminum bat. I was spooked because I am absolutely certain I was no where near any sort of private property. I kind of just shrugged it off as another camper set up not too far off, not usual but not impossible. Well the noise started getting closer and louder and the closer and louder it got, the more adrenaline that started to pump into my veins. Of course the noise was now in the immediate vicinity so I cut my headlamp on and aimed it towards the source. On both sides of the tree was the silhouette of a massive creature, extremely wide and tall. I fucking SHIT myself. I froze and couldnt breathe. The silhouette urked around the tree and into the light. It was a bloodied US Senator John Fetterman bashing his forehead into every tree he passed.

I walk a lot at night in the summer as its too hot for my Northern blood to still enough to sleep. I was walking through what I roughly worked out was its territory (more of that in a sec) and something big began to snarl and bark at me from uphill.

The feeling grew until it hit hard. I felt like I was being watched, hunted. The mist didnt help, but it was weird. Im not used to feeling like that, especially in such a local area. I kept going until I reached the bridge. I considered crossing and heading to the fishing pond to sit like I sometimes do, but I couldnt shake that prickling down my back and the fear, so I turned up the path I was on when I saw the beast, a week or so later, and headed on up and out of the park. The feeling died off as I passed the old building I was planning to explore for the challenge, and had all but faded by the time I reached the old visitor centre only a hundred or so metres further.

Along the back theres a river, and upstream a weir that ran into a pool on the far side of the canal bridge. We used to go bathing up there, and it was fine when you were with people, but it felt wrong, not in the naughty way but in the creepy &quot;something is not right here&quot; when alone. There could be people on the other side of the bridge and it would still feel off, but it really became scary when there was noone around. I did dismiss it initially as just nerves, maybe some ancestral fear of still bodies of water which were opaque, as primordial predators could lurk in them. Anyway at one point I found a kayak that had been washed down by the floods, and my class and I played about with it up there. Nothing really happened with other people, as I said, and we used to paddle around the pool (it wasnt deep, you could wade through it. 4 - 5 feet at the most I would say)<br>A couple of times I went up there on my own with the kayak. Now, we had all swam in the pool, and it was empty. There where NO underwater objects or protrusions. Shit, I waded through it. But when you were up there in the pool in the kayak, alone, you would hear noises, as though underwater twigs or fingernails were scraping on the hull. It was really creepy, and I used to get nervous about even paddling with my hands (we didnt have a paddle).<br>To one side - the lower in the picture - there is a cut away in the concrete basin for some vents or drains of some kind, and that always made me really nervous, even a little fearful. I pushed myself to wade to it once, and look at it, but I couldnt bring myself to step into it, even though it was relatively shallow compared to the rest of the pool.<br>If it was just me I might have dismissed it, but it wasnt.

He said that he heard hooping and whooping noises akin to those of a chimpanzee that were coming from just out of sight, beyond the tree line, and that when he reached for his camera, whatever it was went crashing through the woods in retreat. He said it sounded &quot;like a locomotive.&quot; So, what the fuck was that? I do not believe that he was lying. He had absolutely no reason to lie about something like that and it&#039;s only hurt his career and public image overall. I think he was telling the truth. So, what could that have been? It had to be a very large animal to sound &quot;like a locomotive&quot; as it crashed through the forest. What&#039;s big enough to do that in Alaska? A bear and a moose. That&#039;s about it really, and neither one of those makes ape-like whooping and hooping noises. This one little anecdote all by itself is fairly compelling to me because, as I said, I simply do not believe that he&#039;s lying.

If you can&#039;t do a 30 minute continuous session without getting tired, you&#039;re not strong enough to properly control your bow even on your first shot.<br><br>Second of all, being able to hit a flat, stationary target with a marked bulls-eye consistently from 7-10 yards while standing with perfect form and posture has very little bearing on whether or not you&#039;ll be able to hit a dear in the wild. You need practice with 3d targets and you need to do dynamic training, such as shooting from different positions/angles, with objects in the way, changing distance etc. At the very least you need to have consistent groupings at 20 meters, not just 10. Because you&#039;re far more likely to get a clean shot from 20 meters than from 10. Anything much more than 20 meters and you&#039;re probably better off to just not take the shot even if you&#039;re an amazing archer because the chance that you&#039;ll just injure the deer is too high.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The hunting itself is the tricky part</span><br>yes, this is true. once you become a good archer, becoming a good hunter is still a huge hurdle. you have to become a better hunter than a rifle or compound bow hunter simply because you need to get closer to the target.<br><br>As for OP: Learn how to hunt squirrel with your longbow. A squirrel is a much harder target to hit, but they&#039;re a lot more frequent and give you good practice. It&#039;s kind of like training with weighted clothes.

There\u2019s also usually hardly any tobacco in a cigarette, meaning you taste burning paper and low grade Burley. However, Burley is a type of pipe tobacco, but it\u2019s usually the highest grade Burley. Burley used in a pipe tobacco blend will typically have notes of cocoa, nuts, and sometimes brown sugar. But there are many other different types of tobacco used in pipe blends; you can have Virginias (Lemon Virginia, Red Virginia, Stoved Virginias, etc.), which often have a fruity, citrusy, earthy, grassy, and tea-like flavor. You can have Perique which is only grown in Louisiana bayous and cured in logs and has a very spicy and plum-like flavor. You can have Dark Fired Kentucky which is a type of Burley that is cured over burning wood, giving it a kind of smoked BBQ and herbal flavor. You can have Oriental (Yenidje, Izmir, Bosma, Drama, Smyrna, Samsun, Xanthi, Katerini, etc.) which comes from the Northeast Mediterranean and the Levant, and usually has an herbal, incense-like, and spicy, very fragrant flavor and aroma. You also have Latakia, which is the most important component in \u201cEnglish\u201d blends and is a type of Oriental that is fire cured using aromatic woods from the Middle East, giving it a sweet, smoky, and incense-y flavor and aroma. It used to come from Syria (Latakia, Syria) up until the Syrian civil war, so now it comes from Cyprus while still using the same techniques as Syrian Latakia. In general, all of those types of tobacco have very strong flavors, which is really the point of pipe smoking, as opposed to the low grade Burley in cigs that tastes like burning cardboard. They don\u2019t use flavorful tobacco in cigarettes because people smoke them for the nicotine, not the flavor. There was a point in time last century when luxury cigarettes did contain Oriental tobaccos, but that stopped when cigarette companies realized smokers were more concerned about nicotine than flavor.", "time": 1668909560, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498637, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)23:58:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve smoked Orlik golden Sliced for years, havnt smoked in like, a year, because for me, its for bars or a treat<br><br>I promised myself i will have a smoke for the first snowfall of the year", "time": 1668920327, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498672, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)02:04:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2498525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2498525</a><br>haha thanks, yeah I knew about it keeping the bugs away but I didn&#039;t know if there was any protections beyond that in the lore.", "time": 1668927868, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498699, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)03:43:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Been out of the smoking game for a while but now that I&#039;m back into it I&#039;ve gone through everything I had cellared. <br><br>What newish tobaccos should I try? <br><br>so far it sounds like Plum Pudding is a must try but what else is out there that is a go to?

I was having problems with flakes before because they would constantly go out and taste like ash. Then I started packing it really loose, and it improved so much. Come to find out, most people already loosely pack rubbed out flake. So if you have problems with flakes going out or not tasting great, pack them super loose. Gravity fill it, lightly push it down just to the halfway point, gravity fill again, and use the fleshy part of your thumb to make sure everything is in the bowl, BUT DON\u2019T PUSH DOWN. Do a char light, use the weight of the tamper to even out the charred tobacco without putting any pressure, do another light and tamp it the same way, but you\u2019re not done yet. After tamping it a 2nd time, the tobacco should be down to the 3/4 mark of the bowl. Do your true light and it should be good to go. Packing it looser means the bowl won\u2019t be filled, but because flake tobacco, even when rubbed out, burns slower and expands, you\u2019ll still get a good 40 minutes in a regular sized bowl.

It lasted for a little over two years (hard to say really), and had just over 120 members. We were going in two trips per month, so it was pretty active. <br><br>The demographics of the people who join those groups don\u2019t exactly line up with the people of /out/. It was mostly women over 30 and men over 50. Many of them are severely lacking in experience. Eventually you get to know the group members, but at first it\u2019s awkward. You\u2019re spending days with strangers, from sun up till sundown. <br><br>Groups are a completely different dynamic than solo hikes. You always move slower in a group; someone is lagging, maybe hurt, people stop for the bathroom at different times, some need more breaks, some are slow starters in the morning\u2026 it\u2019s just how it is. They also feel compelled to talk; it\u2019s human nature to engage when you\u2019re next to someone for that long. Also finding a spot large enough to accommodate everyone can be a pain or sometimes straight up impossible. Oh, and everyone wants to vote on stuff, and democracy is a sham (\u201cyeah we should keep going to find a better spot and not stay at this perfectly adequate one. What? No I think the sun will be up longer than 30 minutes and we\u2019re sure to find an even batter campsite just over that next hill/around that next turn. Let\u2019s vote in it.\u201d).<br><br> It can have some perks, like multiple cars and people who know more than you (inb4 \u201cno one knows more than me\u201d). <br><br>Oddly enough I never really clicked with anyone in the group. I\u2019m a pretty social person, so I had fun on the group hikes, but I never kept in touch with any of them. And after dozens of group hikes I can safely say I prefer going alone rather than with casual acquaintances. <br><br>Thanks for reading my blog.

I kept monitoring the /k/ thread whilst it was being worked on and found it interesting enough to keep hanging out after it was released. I had a go at designing my own one for a group of friends which was a painless enough experience I figured I would have a go at making one to sell.

So you create the design send it to them along with requests for production (number of, embroidered/woven, type of backing etc), they tell you if any changes need to be made. Then, once all confirmed, in a week or two you get a parcel full of patches.<br><br>There are a couple of exceptions. 19kenny84, who makes very small batches by hand and Twilry who has a website connected to a machine but that&#039;s been gone a while now. You can find sellers on Etsy who will do one offs for you, they seem to be generally in Eastern Europe.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out.

So you definitely want to do it the other way around for the most pleasant and scenic route (beautiful views when walking in the Gr\u00e5sj\u00f8en direction to Trollheimshytta from Gjevilvasshytta as starting point) They&#039;ve also added (to my distaste) a bridge over the first major river there so if there&#039;s a lot of water when you go you will save yourself from that by walking over the bridge. From there you can either go through the valley which leads to J\u00f8ldalshytta which is a very simple hike, or take the more challenging one up the mountain, which in return gives you way better views. The last part of the trip from J\u00f8ldalshytta to Gjevilvasshytta is unknown to me, but from what I&#039;ve gathered it&#039;s a reasonably simple hike, with bridges over the two main rivers there. The cabins are own by Den Norske Turistforening (DNT) so you will find out everything you need to know about the cabins from them. I never use cabins (except when I was on norways tallest mountain) so idk much about them. Have eaten a kanelbolle at gjevilvasshytta though, good shit.

The frame, roll cage, and everything else structural are some sort of metal alloy. Overspifying and mostly accurate: the crystal content of a material determines its strength and plasticity--the more % crystal usually the stronger a material is but it also is more brittle. An extreme comparison would be a pure iron rod and a pure diamond rod--the diamond will shatter under strain while the iron rod will bend...although it will take much more strain to shatter the diamond than bend the iron. In carbon fiber the crystal content is the graphite, which is hexagonally bonded carbon layered in a polymer. The other important factor is cyclic fatigue stresses. Over time carbon fiber will develop mocrocracking because it cracks instead of bends where metal this is much less prevent. The end result is carbon fiber can fail completely under a strain (especially in cold where the crystals cool and become more brittle) where metals will bend and distort but not fail.<br>Thanks for listening to my TED talk.", "time": 1669908429, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504055, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)18:51:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2503287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503287</a><br>lol you tried so hard to sound smart only for <a href=\"#p2503296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503296</a> to btfo you", "time": 1669938716, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504070, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)19:23:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504055</a><br>lol<br>lamo<br>the cope is palpable <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go to needlesport</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seach ice axe</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ice tools come up</span><br>lamo<br>continue lying. it&#039;s pretty pathetic to have to tell bold faced lies to troll but<br>go on. you clearly need the practice, kid", "filename": "Screenshot_20221201-192225_Google", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669940634124112, "time": 1669940634, "md5": "8iBoslnADGWWeXiC+4waPg==", "fsize": 353024, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504448, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)18:34:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504070</a><br>Calm down Mr. Ego, I\u2019m not even the guy you were talking to earlier", "time": 1670024066, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504519, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)23:29:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2499937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2499937</a><br>Trust fund kid thing is true but its also like the titanium tent stoves. <br>Just some stamped titanium sheet with some rolled pieces and a few pieces of hard ware store hardware. <br><br>Material and labor are nothing on this thing BUT they only sale a limmited number so that limmited number have to cover all the overhead. <br><br>But more so if you are buying a 1lb tent stove you likely have the money so shell out.", "time": 1670041747, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504657, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)10:29:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504448</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was completely wrong and being an idiot but you&#039;re the badguy for calling me on it</span><br>lol, reddlt isn&#039;t sending their best.

I have about 300 acres of private land to work with. There isn\u2019t much elevation. It\u2019s pretty flat. I was going to use the Ozark 11 person tent in pic related to sleep in. I was going to get a large tarp from Harbor freight to string up over the top of this in some trees for extra cover.

It does have to be light as I won\u2019t be backpacking with it. Just sleeping there on weekends I go hunt. I\u2019m tired of driving the 30 minutes to go hunt in the mornings. And I\u2019ll only be leaving this up for a few months. For sleep, I was going to get a Coleman camp cot. Other stuff I\u2019ll bring, old pots and pans, a storage truck, a cooler and a small gas generator (it\u2019s a 1400 watt predator from harbor freight).

Unless you&#039;re really close to it or working on the specific antenna when it&#039;s still lit up, there&#039;s not much of an exposure hazard. Those duty-cycle too, they&#039;re only on when someone&#039;s using the talk path, so overall exposure is reduced because of the time factor.<br>Dishes or directional antennas focus that energy in one direction; while they usually have less power into them, all that power is directed one way. Don&#039;t stand or work in front of those.<br>Broadcast transmitters are the scary ones. Lots of power, 100% duty cycle, and they&#039;re usually in bands that the body absorbs easily. <br>The tower in &gt;picrel is AM broadcast, the tower structure is the antenna and it&#039;s electrically hot. Knocked power down while we were on it, less for exposure and more to minimize the risk of RF burns in case of accidental contact with the grounded cables I was installing. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9U<wbr>O9tn4MpI<br>On top of that tower was a 10-element FM broadcast array with about 50kW out of it. <br>When I climbed up to set an anchor the day before the install, knowing the two of us were only going to be up there for a short time, we didn&#039;t mess with the FM power levels. My alarm got real alarmy up there because of that exposure. The next day during the install, I coordinated with station engineer to ramp down power on that transmitter to acceptable levels while I was working ~15ft below that array.<br><br>Part of my pre-climb safety assessment includes RF exposure considerations.", "filename": "i-psWCcQG-L", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 445, "h": 599, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669842963410882, "time": 1669842963, "md5": "j8ap0YIaRCJfDW2Y9zM2Yg==", "fsize": 53407, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2505581, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:32:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bumping this thread.", "time": 1670243579, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2505949, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)00:43:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Here&#039;s some of my pics from a few months ago", "filename": "0422221558_HDR", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4160, "h": 3120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670305423684428, "time": 1670305423, "md5": "Qxn9tFWY4EX0HJz2WLna7w==", "fsize": 3941935, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2505950, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)00:45:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505949</a>", "filename": "0422221605_HDR", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4160, "h": 3120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670305518373073, "time": 1670305518, "md5": "pahhLDTrJqKQNK/Bgl8eRg==", "fsize": 4458218, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2505951, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)00:47:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505950</a><br>elevator on the 4th floor of an abandoned school", "filename": "0422221632b_HDR", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4160, "h": 3120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670305664635241, "time": 1670305664, "md5": "YqLbFN8OxAEH2JQhAn8pdg==", "fsize": 4128866, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2505952, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)00:49:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505951</a> <br>the green boards on the windows gave this room really cool lighting", "filename": "0422221639a_HDR", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4160, "h": 3120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670305764075656, "time": 1670305764, "md5": "BgGWeWuqUBTyyVhugbKwlA==", "fsize": 3912758, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2505954, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)00:52:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505952</a><br>it was a pretty cool building to walk around in for a bit. got stopped by a cop on the way out, but he basically just told me to be careful", "filename": "0422221633_HDR", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4160, "h": 3120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670305977223702, "time": 1670305977, "md5": "nAmJ1sulVDuqAedK6RgrKw==", "fsize": 4468484, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2506416, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)14:47:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2500195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2500195</a><br>hello, very nice.", "filename": "DSCF0012", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670442478770902, "time": 1670442478, "md5": "IgCSWZmjMrUfvQjIe44Y0w==", "fsize": 336735, "resto": 2500195}, {"no": 2506432, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)15:30:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2505950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505950</a><br>Did you go up on those stairs or did you find another way up?

Yes, it&#039;s possible, but it would be very inefficient (in a colloquial sense, hydropower is actually very efficient going over 70%). Your idea is similar to what is known as &quot;run-of-the-river&quot; hydropower, where wheels are placed in rivers, often with small dams. The amount of power generated by the water is defined by the formula: P = \u03c1*G*h*g, where \u03c1 is the density of water (about 1000 kg/m^3), G is the volumetric flow rate (m^3/s), h is the head (how far the water actually falls, in meters), g is gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and P is in watts. <br>Let&#039;s say you want to charge your phone, which requires about 5W. I&#039;m going to make the generous assumption that you built this system with a head of about 8 meters (a little over a 2 story house). That would mean a value for G(volumetric flow rate) of about 0.000065 m^3/s is required, or about 1 gallon per minute (lots of estimations being made). Neglecting generator efficiency, you would be able to charge your phone if you manage to get a gallon of water per minute through your gutters. <br>This is an incredibly idealized scenario. In the video linked by someone else in the thread, the guy planned for a 2 watt system, but only ended up getting about 0.25 watts. You need to take into account actual head (in the drawing you posted, the head for each generator would be the distance from the gutter to the first wheel), generator efficiency, losses from storage (assuming you want to capture all of the energy and store it into batteries for later use), and frictional losses. <br>There are lithium batteries used to store energy with a capacity of 1200Wh, or 4.3 million joules. For the guy in the video, if the rain was generating 0.25 W like in his demo, he would be able to store 900 joules in an hour of rainfall. It would take 4800 hours of rainfall to charge that lithium battery. <br>You&#039;d have to build many of these systems in parallel to capture a significant amount of energy.", "time": 1670838151,

You are better off with a used frame backpack or internal backpack. <br><br>I have found that most milltary backpacks are around 65-120$ a used backpacking bag is around 20$ on shopgoodwill.com. I hear you say that you don&#039;t want to stand out in the woods , I would say their are plenty of waterproof rain flys for your bag that come in non-IRreflective camo for 45$ or a Chinese rain fly for 10$ on amazon, which are better than what ever camo you were thinking about buying any how. A good capacity is 65 liters, this is considered 3 day bag but if your smart you can fit rations for a full week in it. 55 liters is fine but the limit for fitting a sleeping bag and not limiting the gear you might want to take.

Finally put it on the water earlier this year and have been sailing as much as I could ever since, teaching myself all that I can along the way! <br>Sailing is a lot like shooting a gun or going for a run - anybody can do it, but it takes practice to do it well. <br>Money is a factor, that much is true, but it\u2019s all relative. I got my boat for 4k off Craigslist - great sailing condition but the inside upholstery was/is in a rough condition. Other people were offering a lot more for it but the guy I bought it from accepted my offer early on and stuck with it. I\u2019m glad he did! I did have problems with the outboard motor though and couldn\u2019t fix it, then it popped off the mount and into the water so I replaced it with an electric engine and battery. My ePropulsion setup cost more than the boat but it\u2019s reliable as shit and zero maintenance. My Cat22 came with a trailer and let me tell you what - it\u2019s a good thing to have if you\u2019re moving / need to move the boat for hurricane evac or something, but unless it\u2019s a small Hobie Cat or sailing dinghy, trailering a sailboat sucks. It\u2019s all the pain of normally trailering a boat plus the long setup of the mast and rigging.

I love sailing, it\u2019s my favorite hobby, and considering it costs $150 to charter a sailboat for an hour down here, I break even if I take my boat out for only 2hr a month. My only issue with being on the water is that my boat is on a river with a strong current only a few miles from the ocean, so depending on the tide and where my boat is moored, I have to wait for favorable conditions or get trapped in the marina. Additionally, when I do go sailing in zero/light winds, it means I\u2019m fighting the current hard either going out or coming in at which point I\u2019m just motoring. You\u2019ll have more freedom from the elements on lakes, and more open water access on oceans, but it\u2019s great being really in tune with nature. My gf gets bored on the water but there are few things better than cruising under sail with just the wind, no engine, and joining the dolphins, fish, and birds as you all live your life /out/doors.<br>Overall I highly recommend sailing, 10/10. I need to learn to tighten my rigging a bit and need more practice with the jib and properly using the mainsail, but it\u2019s all good - there aren\u2019t any mistakes, just lessons!

Found a patch of somewhat level ground and managed to set my tent up in the rain while shaking violently with blue fingers. Climbed inside, stripped everything off, climbed into my dry 20 degree quilt. Shook violently and contemplated death for about an hour and half while reading an ebook on my phone.
