My general advice is that in winter you should be prepared for temps up to 10C lower simply because clear skies, wind, etc. can drop temps very rapidly once it&#039;s below freezing.<br><br>Sleeping in layers does work. You want to make sure that you are not compressing your sleeping bag as compressed insulation does not do it&#039;s job. More head covering, gloves, sleep in your jacket. All works. As a last resort, survival bivys or blankets do work. However you want to be sure they are needed as they don&#039;t breath at all and sweating in the cold is not something you want.<br><br>In addition make sure you select campsites when possible to avoid wind, or use your shelter to block it. Avoid low spots where cold air sinks. Use your foam sleeping pad, sit pad, etc to avoid spending time touching cold ground. Eat and stay hydrated so that you warm up and keep blood flowing. You can also use a hot water bottle, like just under boiling water in a nalagene to pre-warm your sleeping bag and then keep it by your feet.

If you think you have a layering system or a bag that can handle a given temp I definitely advise testing that out in a back yard or on an overnighter where you can bail to a car/shelter if needed. Number are good and all but everyone sleeps a little differently. You want to be comfy and warm so you got to figure out what works for you. To this end, I also recommend that you see if you can get a thermometer with a remote probe or at least one that can record the highs and lows. I use a ThermoPro TP60 that I got for 20 bucks and it reports temps and humidity. Very useful for my planning knowledge to say with confidence what the temps were, how wet or dry it was, how much better inside the tarp it is and how well I slept. A little journaling will tell you a lot and then you can use that to make informed decisions about which parts of your gear are working and which could be changed or used differently. <br>For example, on one testing trip it was expected to be just under freezing, but the temps dropped with clear skies and ended up being about 16F.

It&#039;s more realistic than the other stuff on the list, you&#039;re not going to be building a fucking fort in the middle of the woods. You&#039;ll be scavenging abandoned houses for moldy food, avoiding predators, and boiling snow for water. I got bored of this game pretty quickly because the gameplay loop is very basic, so I don&#039;t know if it gets more interesting the longer you survive or something. There&#039;s also 0 crafting outside of repairing your clothes and none of the &quot;exploration&quot; feels meaningful (sort of like real life). You&#039;ll expend a ton of calories &quot;exploring&quot; just to find a jar of moldy peanut butter and a bottle of soda in a broken down car.<br><br>Valheim is technically survival but you can&#039;t starve to death and the only real danger comes from the monsters in the woods. Food just increases your HP/Stamina so you can take more hits or do more building before needing to rest, and even then the &quot;resting&quot; is just standing still for a second or two. Gameplay loop here is pretty solid, you have a solid goal you&#039;re aiming towards but you can get sidetracked by autistically building houses in the woods forever. As you advance through a biome, your equipment gets better and you can explore more biomes. The world is HUGE, but you&#039;ll quickly learn that there&#039;s nothing &quot;special&quot; and the world is pretty empty, each new biome is just 2-3 enemy types and 1-2 new crafting materials to make 1 new set of armor and 1 of each weapon type. If you&#039;re not looking to explore though, it&#039;s definitely a &quot;comfy&quot; game to pretend you&#039;re homesteading. You can tame and breed animals for meat and leather, grow your own crops, build your own little village/home. Sometimes I lose entire days to this game just building a cabin in the mountains.", "time": 1668701533, "resto": 2497383}, {"no": 2497428, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)12:49:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2497395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2497395</a><br>This", "time": 1668707374, "resto": 2497383}], "last_modified": 1668707374}, {"no": 2492125, "now": "11/05/22(Sat)14:59:13", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/patch/ thread", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Winter Edition</span><br>Post yer patches, discuss yer patches, design yer patches.", "filename": "snow-embroidered-ptatch", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 656, "h": 652, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 248, "tim": 1667674753949808, "time": 1667674753, "md5": "Gc5UMDRYrBLaHazLbyXXlA==", "fsize": 77613, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "patch-thread", "replies": 42, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 37, "omitted_images": 11, "last_replies": [{"no": 2496990, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)09:22:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2492125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2492125</a><br>Question for the manufacturers: How did you get into patch making?

Nothing too crazy happened, this doesn&#039;t end with me getting arrested or raped by the rape dwarves, but I feel like it&#039;s interesting enough to share.<br>I chose a really long hike that loosely followed a train line so at any time a bailout point wouldn&#039;t be *too* far away and so that I could go for as long as I could.

Not greentext.<br><br>I have a favorite campground and particular campsite that I go to every fall. It&#039;s a large park with 1 modern campground towards the front and 3 rustic campgrounds elsewhere.<br>It has personal history. This campground was where I went as a small child. My earliest outdoor memories are here. Later there were father/son camping trips with my friends when we were teenagers. In my 20&#039;s we continued it amongst ourselves. Sure there were stupid 20-something shenanigans but it was mostly chill. We would always have our trip the last weekend in October. Now in my mid-30s, we still have these trips, although the locations change from year to year. People have come and gone but it&#039;s still at least 4 of the core 6 friends. If we don&#039;t go to this particular campground for the annual trip, I make a personal solo trip.<br>My favorite campsite is a 2.5 mile drive from the park entrance and located in the central campground. Its split into 4 loops. 2 on one side of a field, 2 oth the other. Located on a spring fed lake, it&#039;s peaceful and serine. No motors, gas or electric. At night I enjoy sitting by the fire, listening to the world series in the radio while the coyotes and owls make their night time noises.<br>In the past (dating back to my teenage years) Wednesday and Thursday night, you&#039;d be the only one out there. Maybe a handful of other campers on the weekend but thats it.<br>But now, especially the last 5yrs, has gotten disheartening.<br>When I arrived this past Wednesday I was the only one in either loop on my side of the field. There were some hardside campers setup in the other loops across the field.
