Featherwt, lightwt and caldorado most breathable and light models. Burlier versions = no breathe. Mediocre moisture transfer but blocks wind. Same never-wets-out membrane outer, inside dries quick if overwhelmed. Very durable and light, some reports of delamination after 1 year (not experienced after 3 myself).

My favourite, 8/10 put it through the wringer!!<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;froggs toggs ultralite</span><br>Basically a rubber mac. Enough moisture transfer to dry inside overnight, these fit so poorly that mechanical venting happens by default. Not good for warmth, shit neck closure on hood (add velcro or snaps), shreds and pinholes easily. $20/\u00a325 for a jacket (and useless pants/troos) that NEVER wets out, weighs 180g and mogs things 5x price.

is the second biggest determiner or weight, and the primary determiner of the size the bag packs to. the higher the number, the higher quality the down inside is, thus less of it is needed for the same warmth level.<br>- the &#039;total fill weight&#039; is what determines how warm how the bag actually is. its the measure of how much down is actually in it.<br>- a quick look at the above 3 is the best way to compare similar bags to each other to see which one you&#039;re getting the best deal on.<br>- goose down and duck down are more or less the same other than what fill powers they&#039;re generally sold at.<br>- temp ratings are usually a mixed bag of if they&#039;re accurate or not. big brands tend to over-rate their bags and cottage brands tend to be accurate or under-rate. <br>- EN ratings are *usually* actually pretty accurate. keep in mind EN rating is tested wearing thermals. <br>- very expensive and very cheap bags are just as warm as each other. the difference is packed size and weight and how clammy they are.<br>- consider a quilt &gt;

None of them do anymore. <br><br>The best alternative I\u2019ve found is Topo Nomad. It has easy access to USGS maps through the app, and allows for custom uploads. The free version allows for 5 or 6 maps to be downloaded at once. For a one time $10 fee you get a \u201c100 year subscription\u201d and you can store as many as you want.

There\u2019s also usually hardly any tobacco in a cigarette, meaning you taste burning paper and low grade Burley. However, Burley is a type of pipe tobacco, but it\u2019s usually the highest grade Burley. Burley used in a pipe tobacco blend will typically have notes of cocoa, nuts, and sometimes brown sugar. But there are many other different types of tobacco used in pipe blends; you can have Virginias (Lemon Virginia, Red Virginia, Stoved Virginias, etc.), which often have a fruity, citrusy, earthy, grassy, and tea-like flavor. You can have Perique which is only grown in Louisiana bayous and cured in logs and has a very spicy and plum-like flavor. You can have Dark Fired Kentucky which is a type of Burley that is cured over burning wood, giving it a kind of smoked BBQ and herbal flavor. You can have Oriental (Yenidje, Izmir, Bosma, Drama, Smyrna, Samsun, Xanthi, Katerini, etc.) which comes from the Northeast Mediterranean and the Levant, and usually has an herbal, incense-like, and spicy, very fragrant flavor and aroma. You also have Latakia, which is the most important component in \u201cEnglish\u201d blends and is a type of Oriental that is fire cured using aromatic woods from the Middle East, giving it a sweet, smoky, and incense-y flavor and aroma. It used to come from Syria (Latakia, Syria) up until the Syrian civil war, so now it comes from Cyprus while still using the same techniques as Syrian Latakia. In general, all of those types of tobacco have very strong flavors, which is really the point of pipe smoking, as opposed to the low grade Burley in cigs that tastes like burning cardboard. They don\u2019t use flavorful tobacco in cigarettes because people smoke them for the nicotine, not the flavor. There was a point in time last century when luxury cigarettes did contain Oriental tobaccos, but that stopped when cigarette companies realized smokers were more concerned about nicotine than flavor.", "time": 1668909560, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498637, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)23:58:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve smoked Orlik golden Sliced for years, havnt smoked in like, a year, because for me, its for bars or a treat<br><br>I promised myself i will have a smoke for the first snowfall of the year", "time": 1668920327, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498672, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)02:04:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2498525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2498525</a><br>haha thanks, yeah I knew about it keeping the bugs away but I didn&#039;t know if there was any protections beyond that in the lore.", "time": 1668927868, "resto": 2492621}, {"no": 2498699, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)03:43:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Been out of the smoking game for a while but now that I&#039;m back into it I&#039;ve gone through everything I had cellared. <br><br>What newish tobaccos should I try? <br><br>so far it sounds like Plum Pudding is a must try but what else is out there that is a go to?

Come to find out, most people already loosely pack rubbed out flake. So if you have problems with flakes going out or not tasting great, pack them super loose. Gravity fill it, lightly push it down just to the halfway point, gravity fill again, and use the fleshy part of your thumb to make sure everything is in the bowl, BUT DON\u2019T PUSH DOWN. Do a char light, use the weight of the tamper to even out the charred tobacco without putting any pressure, do another light and tamp it the same way, but you\u2019re not done yet. After tamping it a 2nd time, the tobacco should be down to the 3/4 mark of the bowl. Do your true light and it should be good to go.

He said that he heard hooping and whooping noises akin to those of a chimpanzee that were coming from just out of sight, beyond the tree line, and that when he reached for his camera, whatever it was went crashing through the woods in retreat. He said it sounded &quot;like a locomotive.&quot; So, what the fuck was that? I do not believe that he was lying. He had absolutely no reason to lie about something like that and it&#039;s only hurt his career and public image overall. I think he was telling the truth. So, what could that have been? It had to be a very large animal to sound &quot;like a locomotive&quot; as it crashed through the forest. What&#039;s big enough to do that in Alaska? A bear and a moose. That&#039;s about it really, and neither one of those makes ape-like whooping and hooping noises.

Anyway, I was hiking, desperately looking for flat ground in order to set it up and had luckily found a nice little clearing off the trail and past the treeline. By the time I had that gay tent up, it was dark so I went back to my bag to rummage for my headlamp. While I was in my bag, I started hearing this metallic banging noise, kind of like someone hitting a homerun with an aluminum bat. I was spooked because I am absolutely certain I was no where near any sort of private property. I kind of just shrugged it off as another camper set up not too far off, not usual but not impossible. Well the noise started getting closer and louder and the closer and louder it got, the more adrenaline that started to pump into my veins. Of course the noise was now in the immediate vicinity so I cut my headlamp on and aimed it towards the source. On both sides of the tree was the silhouette of a massive creature, extremely wide and tall. I fucking SHIT myself. I froze and couldnt breathe.

I walk a lot at night in the summer as its too hot for my Northern blood to still enough to sleep. I was walking through what I roughly worked out was its territory (more of that in a sec) and something big began to snarl and bark at me from uphill. I dont think this was it though, it didnt sound as big. Probably a fox, although it kept on at me until I left the area.<br>As to the territory, I figured it out, ironically, earlier the year I encountered it. I was walking through there and suddenly started feeling really afraid. This is really unusual for me as im pretty confident and I know the area like the back of my hand, plus the dark doesnt scare me.<br>Anyway, I had been feeling oddly nervy as I approached the area, but I didnt understand why. The feeling grew until it hit hard. I felt like I was being watched, hunted. The mist didnt help, but it was weird. Im not used to feeling like that, especially in such a local area. I kept going until I reached the bridge. I considered crossing and heading to the fishing pond to sit like I sometimes do, but I couldnt shake that prickling down my back and the fear, so I turned up the path I was on when I saw the beast, a week or so later, and headed on up and out of the park. The feeling died off as I passed the old building I was planning to explore for the challenge, and had all but faded by the time I reached the old visitor centre only a hundred or so metres further. Based on this I had a rough estimation of the Northern most extent of its range. I also thought I saw 2 red eyes in the mist across the vale, but that was probably my imagination.<br>On a side note I saw a UFO nearby last year.", "time": 1668380822, "resto": 2493450}, {"no": 2496009, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)21:44:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2495912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2495912</a><br>Thanks for responding.

It accelerated way too fast to have been anything modern, and way too fluidly.

Along the back theres a river, and upstream a weir that ran into a pool on the far side of the canal bridge. We used to go bathing up there, and it was fine when you were with people, but it felt wrong, not in the naughty way but in the creepy &quot;something is not right here&quot; when alone. There could be people on the other side of the bridge and it would still feel off, but it really became scary when there was noone around. I did dismiss it initially as just nerves, maybe some ancestral fear of still bodies of water which were opaque, as primordial predators could lurk in them. Anyway at one point I found a kayak that had been washed down by the floods, and my class and I played about with it up there. Nothing really happened with other people, as I said, and we used to paddle around the pool (it wasnt deep, you could wade through it. 4 - 5 feet at the most I would say)<br>A couple of times I went up there on my own with the kayak. Now, we had all swam in the pool, and it was empty. There where NO underwater objects or protrusions. Shit, I waded through it. But when you were up there in the pool in the kayak, alone, you would hear noises, as though underwater twigs or fingernails were scraping on the hull. It was really creepy, and I used to get nervous about even paddling with my hands (we didnt have a paddle).<br>To one side - the lower in the picture - there is a cut away in the concrete basin for some vents or drains of some kind, and that always made me really nervous, even a little fearful. I pushed myself to wade to it once, and look at it, but I couldnt bring myself to step into it, even though it was relatively shallow compared to the rest of the pool.<br>If it was just me I might have dismissed it, but it wasnt.

Fortunately no arrests were made, few days later one good guy, I was kinda friends with him, came to work as usual and died suddenly during dinner break, then few days later couple of other guys from my team robbed our team lead at knifepoint.

Just set an hour everyday shooting at targets, with no danger of hitting property or any living things. Eventually you can work on angles to get big ranges. Learn to shoot off center so shots do not ricochet back to you. Some shooters can throw a can in the air and juggle it with a few shots.<br>Steel bearings are your best ammo. Hex nuts are a fine alternative but tend to curve midair. Small stones are fine for target practice. Do not underestimate the lethality of slingshots, especially with heavy bands.<br>Pana darts are interesting for small game hunting. There\u2019s also specialized slingshots to fire arrows. These offer several disadvantages over bows that I frankly wouldn\u2019t want in the woods but the portability is hard to knock.<br>Finally for self defense I\u2019ve seen pepper balls, these are intended for paintball guns and deliver two sources of pain compliance.

They are the same knife with slight variations in handle shape and blade length, pick the one whose shape you like the most. They make amazing knives for the money, not sure if there&#039;s any overhead if you&#039;re in the USA but in Europe these go for 120-130 bucks. The steel they use is Sleipnir which is a substantially improved D2, it&#039;s tool steel and not stainless so you will have to do a little maintenance with oil to avoid rust but it&#039;s tough as shit. The knives are a beefy full tang with a sharpened pommel for lighting firesteels. They can handle batoning and everything else. The grip on mine is phenomenal because of the way it&#039;s machined, and they use either wood or materials like micarta or g10. I&#039;ve got one in micarta and another in g10 they&#039;re both amazing. I think the wood they use is &quot;stabilized&quot; which I guess means some kind of polymerising treatment. They&#039;re the best knives I&#039;ve ever handled.

They&#039;re well-made, easy-to-use, and cheap. There are lots of different options, but I like their Kansbol, Classic 2, 2000, Garberg. <br><br>Another great choice is to buy a Casstr\u00f6m no.10 blade blank and fit the handle scales yourself, and even making a sheath yourself. You can do it for half the price of the pre-made ones, and it&#039;s one of my most-used knives. <br><br><br>If you&#039;re wanting to buy a knife that can both be used alongside a folding saw and hatchet, AND be able to be the only tool you carry for processing firewood, then you&#039;re going to need to buy a larger, full-tang knife. I think that the Ka-Bar Becker BK7 is a good choice for this. They&#039;re easy-to-sharpen because they&#039;re made out of 1095, and they work pretty well. They can be used for chopping (especially if you put a lanyard on it and hold it by the end), and for smaller stuff. <br><br>But I think the best knives for the money are from Varusteleka- particularly their Jakarripuukko and their Terava Skrama knives. They&#039;re fantastic. The Skrama is a great all-around camp knife, and their puukkos are great even if it&#039;s the only knife you carry.

So you create the design send it to them along with requests for production (number of, embroidered/woven, type of backing etc), they tell you if any changes need to be made.

Does it make sense to try that as a single dude or loneliness would be crippling?</span><br>Backpacking in general or the Pan-American drive specifically?<br>The former I&#039;d say go for it, the latter probably not. <br>My longest backpacking trip was 10 months going from London to Indonesia back when I was 17/18, and while it wasn&#039;t entirely solo (my gf came out to meet me in Venice and Malaysia+Indonesia, and a couple of mates joined me in E Europe) I was on my own for at least 7 months of the trip. That is, I was alone in that I hadn&#039;t made plans to travel with anyone before I started. In many areas it&#039;s extremely easy to meet people along the way and we&#039;d often end up travelling together for a while, longest was about a month with one of the girls I met in India and then we reunited for a couple of weeks in Cambodia+Laos. Sometimes this was an intentional effort on my part (I wanted to rent a houseboat in India but couldn&#039;t afford to do so on my own so I approached random people until I had a group), sometimes it was just by chance (some of the trails in Nepal are pretty busy and you&#039;ll often find yourself eating/sleeping at the same guesthouses as everyone else who walks at a vaguely similar pace). Stay in hostels, make an effort to talk to people and you&#039;ll be fine. That&#039;s assuming you&#039;re travelling through appropriately touristic areas of course, there&#039;s a fairly well-trod backpacker trail through certain parts of India, Nepal and SE Asia where you&#039;ll find a lot of solo backpackers all looking for company but if you step away from that trail then it can be much quieter and potentially lonelier. It&#039;s not just about the amount of tourists but the type, some places are busy but busybwith tourists rather than travellers. <br><br>A long driving trip like the one I did with my wife would potentially be much lonelier as you&#039;d have fewer opportunities to meet people. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any life changing experiences during your journey?</span><br>Nah.", "time": 1671597655, "resto": 2512455}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2511069, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)10:16:21", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "jungle boots", "com": "Hello everyone. <br>I will do a 10-day jungle expedition next year.

But there is a lot to learn about maritime rules and the sea itself; you can get most of what you need from a few books, YouTube videos, and a lot of practice. Owning a sail boat will require that you learn a lot of other skills as well in order to keep costs down.

However when you do tack you have to watch out for the boom arm. As your boat turns and the bow crosses the wind direction, the boom will swing across the deck as the main sail catches the wind that\u2019s now coming from the other side. Watch a video of how to tack safely. It is not uncommon for the boom to take inexperienced sailors overboard in a tack.<br>In a jibe, the boom arm moves even faster. <br>The most skillful part of sailing is getting in and out of the slip, so just use an outboard motor for that when starting out. <br>Sailboats are not that expensive to run see <a href=\"#p2505331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2505331</a>.

So you definitely want to do it the other way around for the most pleasant and scenic route (beautiful views when walking in the Gr\u00e5sj\u00f8en direction to Trollheimshytta from Gjevilvasshytta as starting point) They&#039;ve also added (to my distaste) a bridge over the first major river there so if there&#039;s a lot of water when you go you will save yourself from that by walking over the bridge. From there you can either go through the valley which leads to J\u00f8ldalshytta which is a very simple hike, or take the more challenging one up the mountain, which in return gives you way better views. The last part of the trip from J\u00f8ldalshytta to Gjevilvasshytta is unknown to me, but from what I&#039;ve gathered it&#039;s a reasonably simple hike, with bridges over the two main rivers there. The cabins are own by Den Norske Turistforening (DNT) so you will find out everything you need to know about the cabins from them. I never use cabins (except when I was on norways tallest mountain) so idk much about them. Have eaten a kanelbolle at gjevilvasshytta though, good shit. During the main season for hiking in Norway there&#039;s a lot of people doing trekanten, but the cabins are only open for a limited time during the summer, so you can&#039;t really get a trip alone unless you head out during autumn.

Based on the satellite photos I expected that side the be better for seeing them from afar, since I had my binocular with me. However there were none around, at any moment.

Then again that was just some of the stuff avaiIable and I spoke with a Norwegian about that who had joined a hunting club.

And practically the entire state is private property owned by ornery farmers who are well within their legal right to shoot you for trespassing and they WILL do it. Granted, all my time in Iowa was spent doing surveys for scummy pipeline companies using a weird unknown law that let me onto their land, so my presence wasn&#039;t exactly appreciated. Still, unless you&#039;re fantastic friends and a local, there really isn&#039;t anywhere to go except your own property. Wanna snowmobile or hunt? Pay the landowners or you don&#039;t. Fishing?

They also feel compelled to talk; it\u2019s human nature to engage when you\u2019re next to someone for that long. Also finding a spot large enough to accommodate everyone can be a pain or sometimes straight up impossible. Oh, and everyone wants to vote on stuff, and democracy is a sham (\u201cyeah we should keep going to find a better spot and not stay at this perfectly adequate one. What? No I think the sun will be up longer than 30 minutes and we\u2019re sure to find an even batter campsite just over that next hill/around that next turn. Let\u2019s vote in it.\u201d).<br><br> It can have some perks, like multiple cars and people who know more than you (inb4 \u201cno one knows more than me\u201d). <br><br>Oddly enough I never really clicked with anyone in the group. I\u2019m a pretty social person, so I had fun on the group hikes, but I never kept in touch with any of them. And after dozens of group hikes I can safely say I prefer going alone rather than with casual acquaintances. <br><br>Thanks for reading my blog.

Males are only found within the group when they\u2019re adolescents or when breeding. Pigs have a heat cycle like dogs rather than a breeding season like deer. The sounder is led by a matriarch, who isn\u2019t always the biggest, or the oldest, or the strongest. Some researchers think they might be chosen by intelligence, but no one really knows. Plus, how would the dumber pigs know the leader is intelligent? Sounds like hog wash to me. The males get run out of the group (which is called a sounder, but you knew that, or figured it out by now) when they reach adulthood, and are generally solo, but will team up with other males, forming friendships and small groups of their own. Of course these are wild animals so competition for food and territory may come into play between males, so the male sounders are often much smaller. <br><br>This has been Pig Chat.

The frame, roll cage, and everything else structural are some sort of metal alloy. Overspifying and mostly accurate: the crystal content of a material determines its strength and plasticity--the more % crystal usually the stronger a material is but it also is more brittle. An extreme comparison would be a pure iron rod and a pure diamond rod--the diamond will shatter under strain while the iron rod will bend...although it will take much more strain to shatter the diamond than bend the iron. In carbon fiber the crystal content is the graphite, which is hexagonally bonded carbon layered in a polymer. The other important factor is cyclic fatigue stresses. Over time carbon fiber will develop mocrocracking because it cracks instead of bends where metal this is much less prevent. The end result is carbon fiber can fail completely under a strain (especially in cold where the crystals cool and become more brittle) where metals will bend and distort but not fail.<br>Thanks for listening to my TED talk.", "time": 1669908429, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504055, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)18:51:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2503287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503287</a><br>lol you tried so hard to sound smart only for <a href=\"#p2503296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503296</a> to btfo you", "time": 1669938716, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504070, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)19:23:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504055</a><br>lol<br>lamo<br>the cope is palpable <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go to needlesport</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seach ice axe</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ice tools come up</span><br>lamo<br>continue lying. it&#039;s pretty pathetic to have to tell bold faced lies to troll but<br>go on. you clearly need the practice, kid", "filename": "Screenshot_20221201-192225_Google", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669940634124112, "time": 1669940634, "md5": "8iBoslnADGWWeXiC+4waPg==", "fsize": 353024, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504448, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)18:34:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504070</a><br>Calm down Mr. Ego, I\u2019m not even the guy you were talking to earlier", "time": 1670024066, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504519, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)23:29:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2499937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2499937</a><br>Trust fund kid thing is true but its also like the titanium tent stoves. <br>Just some stamped titanium sheet with some rolled pieces and a few pieces of hard ware store hardware. <br><br>Material and labor are nothing on this thing BUT they only sale a limmited number so that limmited number have to cover all the overhead. <br><br>But more so if you are buying a 1lb tent stove you likely have the money so shell out.", "time": 1670041747, "resto": 2499937}, {"no": 2504657, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)10:29:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504448</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was completely wrong and being an idiot but you&#039;re the badguy for calling me on it</span><br>lol, reddlt isn&#039;t sending their best.

Also it&#039;s worth noting that down becomes useless when it gets wet, and it also tears and burns easily.

Beneath the surface is a mycelium system that spawns the fruiting bodies in an area that consistently produces mushrooms. I assume the best way to proliferate a desired fruiting body is to first proliferate mycelium growth (maybe by spreading nutrient substrate around the area), or to spread spores over the desired area during ideal weather conditions and over an ideal substrate in ideal locations to promote growth (ie under a damp log or on moist sheltered leaf litter during a cool rainy season, dependent on species). Both methods are dependent on local weather and light conditions, because they are done outside of a controlled environment. Large colonies also take a long time to grow and cover a large area, there are many examples in both the eastern and western US of colonies that are hundreds to thousands of acres in size and they are estimated to have taken hundreds to thousands of years to attain that much area.

I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out.

The life cycle and prevalence of deer ticks are strongly influenced by temperature.5,6 For example, deer ticks are mostly active when temperatures are above 45\u02daF, and they thrive in areas with at least 85-percent humidity. Thus, warming temperatures associated with climate change are projected to increase the range of suitable tick habitat and are, therefore, one of multiple factors driving the observed spread of Lyme disease.7 Because tick activity depends on temperatures being above a certain minimum, shorter winters could also extend the period when ticks are active each year, increasing the time that humans could be exposed to Lyme disease.</span><br><br>https://www.usgs.gov/programs/clima<wbr>te-adaptation-science-centers/news/<wbr>winter-ticks-moose-and-climate-chan<wbr>ge<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Specifically, concerns have increased about the abundance of winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus), a widespread parasite associated with moose that increases in abundance with shorter winters and longer growing seasons.

I suspect that&#039;s what keeps the squirrel and rabbits in check. Turkeys at least have a chance because they can fly away. I used to see a lot more squirrels and rabbits decades ago, but I&#039;m not sure what happened since then to make the population so much smaller. I can go a few towns over and find many more squirrels, but they aren&#039;t as widespread in my immediate area. Lots of possums though.<br><a href=\"#p2506740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2506740</a><br>I&#039;m just not sure what&#039;s so hard to believe for you? Like I said, maybe you don&#039;t live in an area with many turkeys, but they honestly aren&#039;t that easily spooked here. I was close enough to throw a rock and hit it if I wanted to.
