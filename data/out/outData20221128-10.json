Both come very sharp from the factory. The scissors are great too. The bit holder uses standard bits rather than Leathermans proprietary design, which is a plus too. I think Americans can get some other form of Wave clone at Walmart. The left tool is the Nextool Flagship. This was my first multitool and it has a great pair of scissors.
