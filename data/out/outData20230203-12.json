Come up with a plan of what you intend on growing, how long it takes to germinate an estimate of when it will be to harvest. And strategize your planning around that. While you can&#039;t plant summer plants in spring, you can absolutely plant spring plants throughout the entire growing season ( I plant lettuce, arugula, carrots, kale, etc) all season long. With proper care, variety selection optimized for summer you can have lettuce and whatever the entire season. In order to do this you have to practice succession planting (planting a crop succesively every week or two to have continual harvest) You also need space to do this and an ability to crop rotate (when this plants coming out I have a new plant taking it&#039;s place.) Most summer crops happen to be fruiting plants (tomato, zucchini, etc) that are plant and done till they die from disease or the cold. So what I do is dedicate entire beds to my summer plants and work my spring/fall specific plants around that. I have two rows dedicated to trellising plants (tomatoes, cucumbers, pole beans) i intercrop determinate tomatoes with my climbing beans and bush beans with my climbing tomatoes and cucumbers. I have a row for peppers which I can intercop things like lettuce or radishes, whatever you want that doesn&#039;t take up to many nutrients. My garden is 8 30inch rows 45 feet long atm and when you map out an entire planting strategy my summer beds automatically rotate themselves to spring planting beds by next grow season. Draw diagrams of your garden space, figure out what you&#039;re planting and the harvest time and ask yourself if I want a continual harvest of something like carrots or lettuce what do I need to do to achieve that, where can I plant them, where can I plant my next row of them, etc. It requires very thoughtful planting but it&#039;s not hard to figure out the optimal strategy for your alotment", "time": 1675371155, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533771, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)20:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533523</a><br>you&#039;re gonna have to manually pollenate when the time comes, they won&#039;t successfully wind-pollenate with that few plants at that distance", "time": 1675389572, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533797, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:06:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533771</a><br>I thought that manual pollenate thing was only when you have different kind of corn(i saw a video where a guys uses paper bags to make the polkenate thing)", "time": 1675393570, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533814, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:56:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I want to do a landrace of squash, do I need to try to pollinate it a certain way or just let it go natural and collect the seeds from the best specimens?

Much better than trying to stomp through snow for several miles. The pic I posted had snow ranging from heel height to above knee height which will drain you quickly without any snowshoes/skis. Skis are also nice obviously, but I find snowshoes to be easier to deal with in this terrain. The ones I have are 30&quot; snowshoes, metal frame and deep spikes, rated at a weight up to about 125kg/275lbs ish depending on snow conditions. Most people will do fine with a 25&quot;, but thats up to your total weigth. Obviously it&#039;s a bit weird to use if you&#039;ve never used snowshoes before, as you may have to get used to a slightly wider walking stance depending on the snowshoes, but I&#039;ve used much wider ones before that I&#039;ve ran in, so these slimmer ones were a luxury to me.<br>I&#039;d recommend making sure you get the right weight rating; you + your pack + other stuff youre carrying. Heel lift is also a plus if you think you&#039;ll need it. And personally I prefer slim and long, vs short and wide. Of course make sure theyll fit you nicely, this isnt usually an issue for most people as theyll usually adjust to most feet(EU38-47). Just make sure to double check.

Protein is the obvious one but there&#039;s others. Dietary B12 only comes from meat but you can easily supplement with vitamins. Iron from plants is less bioavailable but can also be supplemented. Other than that, the usual trail mix of seeds and nuts is really helpful for getting enough protein and essential fatty acids. The big divide in this category is Omega 6 vs Omega 3 fatty acids. Most give O6 (peanuts, sunflower seeds, hazlenuts, etc), while only a few give O3 (ground flax seeds, hemp hearts, chia seeds). For me a tablespoon or so of hemp for O3 plus a good assortment of the O6 varieties seems to do the trick. Another thing to keep in mind is that a lot have people have decided that grains = bad, but as a veggie you&#039;ll likely get most of your calories, protein, and water soluble vitamins from them. So choose ones with more concentrated nutrients and eat a variety of them (wheat is king, oats and potatoes are good, rice is poverty tier). One last tip, it&#039;s really easy to go overboard on vegetables that are heavy in oil-soluble vitamins, like carrots and spinach, because they tend to be cheap and versatile. The problem is that oil-soluble nutrients build up in your system and can become toxic at high enough levels. So don&#039;t just eat a ton of carrots for your vegetables, moderation is key. If you have any questions about what&#039;s the best bang for the buck, I highly recommend the site https://nutritiondata.self.com/. It pulls the data from the Standard Reference USDA nutrition database, which is by far the most complete, detailed, and well-sourced nutrition reference I&#039;ve ever found.", "time": 1674639780, "resto": 2530314}, {"no": 2530326, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:53:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Another thing I forgot to mention: there are three Omega 3 fatty acids: ALA, EPA, and DHA. The most important (essential) is the one I mentioned that comes from seeds (ALA). But the two others only come from fish, although they&#039;re less important (conditionally essential) but still great to add to your diet. For a vegetarian, the only realistic source of this is krill-based Omega 3 supplements. These often also include the seed based ALA as well, so you don&#039;t have to worry about taking flax or hemp hearts with you.

The outdoors will bring more cold to your boot than your foot can in heating it up and vice versa for summer.<br>Plastic/rubber/polyurethane/nitrile<wbr>/leather are bad at this. Translation: when you are fighting the winter war, most your boot outsoles will get cold very fast and that will radiate to your foot.<br>Wool is a material that does not work this way, hence why it is a great insulator.

Think the white bunny boot the us military uses or the mickey mouse boot.

By this metric, you can easily bring a spare boot liner, remove the old one, wipe down the inside of the boot, insert new boot liner and have a dry boot in short order.

Great in theory, but in my experience the lacing needs more work because once you have 2 layers of socks in your 1-2 size upsized m77s, the lacing is wonky. The lower laces don&#039;t hold down well once you move up the lace chain and your foot starts to slide around. If you tighten too much at the instep too you cut circulation off to your lower foot and then what&#039;s the point of wearing all those socks?<br>There are a ton of blood vessels right at the top of the foot above the arch that the smallest amount of circulation cut off and your foot starts to freeze.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s a 4/5 effort, especially for being an almost 50 year old design. the leather is 2/5, the lacing 3/5, the foot width is 4/5 but needs to be wider for winter.

It was possible to play in many ways (play with softair rifles, or dig trenches, or build treehouses, or shelters) that you simply didn&#039;t have the space for at home. The biggest draw was the feeling of adventure. We&#039;d climb under the electric fence where sheep were held and pet them (sometimes they&#039;d let us sometimes they&#039;d attack us), then again under it back into the forest, we&#039;d sometimes &quot;steal&quot; honey from some beeskeeper (he knew, but he also knew we wouldn&#039;t take much, so he let it happen), we&#039;d search for treasure, go in places that were forbidden (a old mine and a forest bunker were favorites) and sometimes we&#039;d go looking for animals.

Some freedom, and that includes the freedom to fuck up, is needed for kids to become adults. But some risk is also unneeded.

I just talked to myself at a normal volume and he kept walking away.<br>On the other hand, I was with a group of 3 and we were walking along another tundra hillside. We saw a black bear below us. We immediately began yelling and making noise to scare it away. This time, the thing developed a keen interest in us. It stayed in the valley for the entire day.<br>That showed me that bears respond badly to perceived challenges, just like people. You should only start making noise/freaking out once the bear shows interest in you.

Maybe this is only where their ranges overlap, but my theory is that blacks get picked on constantly by the big guys. So they are more aggressive towards weaker bears and people in turn.

Have one group form a horizontal line each 200+ feet apart and have them walk at least a half mile towards another line of shooters. Wear orange, obviously.

Umbrellas are very situationally dependent. Sometimes they\u2019re absolutely the best option, and sometimes there are better options out there. If there\u2019s a lot of wind driven rain (and I mean a lot, not just a slight breeze in a light drizzle), you might be better off with a jacket. If the trail is really over grown (basically bushwhacking; a little overgrowth won\u2019t hurt anything), then your umbrella may get snagged too often.<br><br>Where they work well is light to moderate rain. Just as a rain jacket is paired with pants, an umbrella can do the same. They also pair well with a very light jacket, such as a water resistant running jacket. That combo provides heavy protection from rain via the umbrella while the jacket keeps any blowback from soaking you, and it\u2019s still more breathable than most options. A lot of thruhikers are using this combo now. It\u2019s pretty versatile; if it\u2019s not raining too hard you leave the jacket off and use just the umbrella (unlike just a rain jacket, where it\u2019s all or nothing). <br><br>Breathability is a huge umbrella advantage. It\u2019s why it\u2019s the absolute best rain protection in hot environments during rainy summers. In the South, rain showers spring up out of nowhere, and dissipate just as quickly.

Beneath the surface is a mycelium system that spawns the fruiting bodies in an area that consistently produces mushrooms. I assume the best way to proliferate a desired fruiting body is to first proliferate mycelium growth (maybe by spreading nutrient substrate around the area), or to spread spores over the desired area during ideal weather conditions and over an ideal substrate in ideal locations to promote growth (ie under a damp log or on moist sheltered leaf litter during a cool rainy season, dependent on species). Both methods are dependent on local weather and light conditions, because they are done outside of a controlled environment. Large colonies also take a long time to grow and cover a large area, there are many examples in both the eastern and western US of colonies that are hundreds to thousands of acres in size and they are estimated to have taken hundreds to thousands of years to attain that much area.

Personally I strain it by dumping the pot in my kitchen sink with just the little drain strainer since its easier and less mess but you can use a strainer if you want I guess. I&#039;ve seen people secure a window screen over a tote or a strainer inside a bucket, but to me that&#039;s just another thing to clean and another way for bird seed to get everywhere. And some ppl say you gotta wait ~30 mins for the water to strain. But since its only flash prepped and not fully hydrated you don&#039;t need to wait, just start loading it in the bag after like 3 minutes of letting the water drain.

Now I have the quarters taped to the rocker and run that bitch at 19-19.5psi, the rocker only shaking occasionally during the cycle.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck. I\u2019m currently clearing a bunch of land for a terrace to grow some vegetables and friut trees. I might just buy 5 small pigs and let them run around in there and fatten them up.

On your last 2 acres, build your structures and use it for plants that you yourself will consume. Parta that you dont eat can be used to feed poultry or pigs. If I were you, I would buy a piglet every year and raise it for slaughter. You can let it supplement off pine cones or acorns and such in your woods. Take a quarter acre and grow corn to feed the pig. Take another quarter acre and put a pond on it, this is really important because you can periodically excavate the bottom layer of the muck and combine it with compost juice. The water in your pond can also temporarily fertilize your garden or your cow\u2019s pasture. Try and srock your pond with fish that are able to attract and kill and eat insects. Attracting Insects for food should be your pond\u2019s top priority, since insects cone from outside your property, and are thus an infinite source of food.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out.

Sounds sad, but I don&#039;t get many replies here and that made my day. I forgot to mention a few really important problems with the house earlier: the dismal internet situation in rural australia. Satellite is the only option and I pay $70 a month for the fastest and largest plan available (250gb in air quotes) which is only 60gb &quot;on peak&quot; and the other 150 when they feel like it at 1.5mbps max. Petrol and diesel are at least 70c a liter dearer than the nearest &quot;town&quot;, and you can forget about buying fresh produce from the local &quot;supermarket&quot; when they feel like opening. Sorry for so many quotes. But real shit for anyone who&#039;s into it: Living in the middle of nowhere off the grid is rad, but be prepared to spend a whole day doing simple chores like grocery shopping or visiting a doctor/pharmacy etc. Expect to replace your tires more often and do way more car maintenance.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

Hell no. Can it charge your phone in 5 minutes of cranking enough to make emergency phonecall? Definitely.

Hostel option I mentioned is a good workaround from being completely homeless. Work is usually easy and involves sitting around a lot.

Just don&#039;t make it obvious you&#039;re a bum, most hostels don&#039;t want anything to do with that sort as they&#039;re largely scumbags and retards. You get a place to stay without needing contracts, deposits or any other nonsense. In UK you can definitely use a letter from hostel manager as proof of address... or just have something shipped to you, like a SIM card. You get access to kitchen so you can save what you got by actually being able to eat decent, home cooked meals, plus you always got a table and a chair. You don&#039;t need any workarounds for showers, etc. There&#039;s typically a storage lockers in dormitories, so you can lock your essentials up.

Flakes tend to hold onto moisture extremely well. Even if they feel dry to the touch, they\u2019re probably still way more moist than any other ribbon cut tobacco you own. The drying time is necessary before packing. Virginia flakes also expand quite a lot once they get hot, meaning a loose pack is essential. If you pack it using the three pack method like a ribbon cut, it may be fine before you light it, but as soon as it warms up it\u2019s going to expand so much that no oxygen will be able to reach the tobacco, making the ember go out extremely quickly. And because it expands, tamping regularly will compact the tobacco even more, which will make it unsmokable, so you\u2019ll always want to go for a relight first when smoking a flake, and only tamp when absolutely necessary.

I went in head first straight under. The stream was only 3 foot wide but it was a 3 foot drop to actually get into it. I didn&#039;t even know it was there and only slid 20m to get into it, it was hidden by its snow capped edges. I quickly threw my body around and when my feet couldn&#039;t touch the bottom I started to panic. It was moving fast and I was immediately carried away, it felt like I was in that stream for 2 minutes but I think it was only 10 seconds. Some how I managed to drop my pack and kick up off something back onto the edge and dragged myself back up. After I got out I tore all of my clothes off to my underwear, which took all of my energy<br>and ran for the road which was about 1km away and I was very lucky that there were cars there with people pulled over having snow ball fights with their children. So I came bolting over in my underwear and the people had seen what happened to me got me in their car and wedged me between two adult men in the backseat. I remember sitting there and I felt so pleasant and at peace with everything, kind of zoning in and out of the pleasant feelings, then back into the reality that I was almost naked between two men who were rubbing my body and sandwiching me.

Can&#039;t remember what it&#039;s called, but your brain is getting overloaded with hyper-stimulus from normal stimuli. It&#039;s related to ADHD/OCD/the rest of it and exists on a spectrum, ie. you can be very hyper-sensitive or you can be mildly hyper-sensitive under certain conditions.<br><br>The bad thing is you can&#039;t cure it. The good thing is you can easily treat the primary symptom (everything feels so itchy/bright/noisy/etc, but so much more than &quot;makes sense&quot; when you think about the lights or the sounds in isolation, and yet it&#039;s impossible to ignore): When you get up in the morning, gently rub your body all over with something mildly abrasive like a sponge or a soft brush and use a medium or stiff brush on your hair. Your nails will work but it helps to use a tool of some kind. You&#039;ll eventually feel oddly relaxed, like you got out of the bath. Your hyper-stimulus symptoms will be lessened for the rest of the day. Just don&#039;t overdo it, because you can go too far and irritate the skin/other obvious outcomes.<br><br>This tip does not help people who do not have hyper-sensitivity issues. If you&#039;re just a wimp then it cannot help. The cure for being a wimp is to progressively toughen up by increasing challenges, just like with building strength or endurance. Your mind is a muscle and can be trained and manipulated like any other part of the body. It might help to know that the majority of physiological changes (e.g. RBC count, cold sensitivity, depressant dependency, etc) will noticeably improve after 2-4 weeks of training.

Avoid Osprey cringe and old ass milsurp.(pre 90s unless you want to try a heavy alice pack for fun) Get cheap decathelon or REI&#039;s deals on a sale. You want something that you can ft water bottles in the side, that has a good hip belt. <br><br>3<br>Sleeping bag.<br>The more you spend on this the warmer and lighter you can get it. You can try for a normal synthetic fill. Maybe Snugpack would be a cheap option that has plenty of non expensive options in a temperature range that matches your area. Always get the warmest you can.<br><br>For shelter get a tarp. It&#039;s cheap and cheap aluminium pegs are great. With some cord you can figure out the ins and outs of using a 3x3 tarp to stay sheltered almost anywhere. If you chose to get a hammock you can keep using it for a fly.<br><br>Boots, bag, sleeping and shelter covered now you can start on skill specific equipment. <br>Get a plain flat backed knife. Full tang if you have money for a good one, or a mora if you are cheap and want a beater that works. This will be your learning toolset.<br><br>With that decided, you should have considered where you will go, what kind of conditions for weather you will be facing. The temperature. The use of fire.", "time": 1675246024, "resto": 2529825}, {"no": 2533165, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)05:14:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2529825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2529825</a><br>Next thing is food. Try not to pack cans. They are heavy adn will be annoying. For the first night you can always take fresh food. Don&#039;t worry about freeze dried or shelf stable unless you are doing long hikes or a couple of nights. That&#039;s on you, decide if you just want to do overnight or just get used to walking with your gear. You should wear boots a while to get them broken in, pack your bag and do some long walks with it packed. Condition yourself. It helps. <br><br>The thing to do next is to get a habit of reading. Find some outdoors lit and make a point of digesting it. Every skill that you have will rely on practice, but practice is always enhanced by reading. It will help you get an idea of what is considered normal or conventional knowladge. <br>For you I would reccomend The DK Survival Guide AKA The Royal Marines Survival Handbook in some nations. It is one of the best composed and illustrated books on all the basics that I&#039;ve ever seen. Nothing in that book that you should not know. It&#039;s all sensible. So try that out. <br>There is a difference between homesteading, thru hiking (annoying faggot magnet) and the slow arduous habit of learning how to hunt or do expeditionary trails with no suppourt. Whatever you chose to do, get a group. Make freinds. Find others who will show you how to shoot and go out of your way to learn something every day.", "filename": "9780241437483", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1754, "h": 2486, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675246448113620, "time": 1675246448, "md5": "ScKjFyeLTRxHhSaEui0G2g==", "fsize": 2720471, "resto": 2529825}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2528878, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)13:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/out/ YouTube channels or other time sinks.", "com": "Any cool/interesting YouTube channels or other ways to go down rabbit holes.

While keeping the bottle upside down works well in and around freezing temps, it is not up to the task when it gets much colder. If you are carrying a bottle you can put it in a long and roomy sock, split the upper part of the sock and tie it around your neck, keeping it hanging on chest level beneath your wind stopper/shell layer and on the outside of your wool liner. This is so effective that it can after a long ruck yield lukewarm water, and while you are walking or skiing you can refill the bottle in increments with snow or ice without fear of it freezing allowing you to use less fuel per day. Now bladder systems are also feasible in the winter time, however it is more strenuous to keep warm. Optimally if you can the water bladder should be carried underneath your wind stopper or shell layer, with the tube being routed through the sleeves of your jacket, this will keep it warm and it will never freeze, but it will severely fuck with your ability to wear a backpack. This is the most secure way to carry a water bladder in truly cold weather, i only do this when i use my pulk sled instead of a backpack. Now if you don&#039;t have access to a sled, or the terrain/snow cover isn&#039;t suitable for one you can also carry water bladders within the backpack, but then it is vital to blow air through the tube after you drink, as the tube is most at risk of freezing while the bladder, if carried against the back of the backpack will most likely not freeze.
