Flakes tend to hold onto moisture extremely well. Even if they feel dry to the touch, they\u2019re probably still way more moist than any other ribbon cut tobacco you own. The drying time is necessary before packing. Virginia flakes also expand quite a lot once they get hot, meaning a loose pack is essential. If you pack it using the three pack method like a ribbon cut, it may be fine before you light it, but as soon as it warms up it\u2019s going to expand so much that no oxygen will be able to reach the tobacco, making the ember go out extremely quickly. And because it expands, tamping regularly will compact the tobacco even more, which will make it unsmokable, so you\u2019ll always want to go for a relight first when smoking a flake, and only tamp when absolutely necessary.

Can&#039;t remember what it&#039;s called, but your brain is getting overloaded with hyper-stimulus from normal stimuli. It&#039;s related to ADHD/OCD/the rest of it and exists on a spectrum, ie. you can be very hyper-sensitive or you can be mildly hyper-sensitive under certain conditions.<br><br>The bad thing is you can&#039;t cure it. The good thing is you can easily treat the primary symptom (everything feels so itchy/bright/noisy/etc, but so much more than &quot;makes sense&quot; when you think about the lights or the sounds in isolation, and yet it&#039;s impossible to ignore): When you get up in the morning, gently rub your body all over with something mildly abrasive like a sponge or a soft brush and use a medium or stiff brush on your hair. Your nails will work but it helps to use a tool of some kind. You&#039;ll eventually feel oddly relaxed, like you got out of the bath. Your hyper-stimulus symptoms will be lessened for the rest of the day. Just don&#039;t overdo it, because you can go too far and irritate the skin/other obvious outcomes.<br><br>This tip does not help people who do not have hyper-sensitivity issues. If you&#039;re just a wimp then it cannot help. The cure for being a wimp is to progressively toughen up by increasing challenges, just like with building strength or endurance. Your mind is a muscle and can be trained and manipulated like any other part of the body. It might help to know that the majority of physiological changes (e.g. RBC count, cold sensitivity, depressant dependency, etc) will noticeably improve after 2-4 weeks of training.

It&#039;s that it also markets itself as being of some importance that puts it beyond mere consumption and into a necessity that can&#039;t be criticized the way funko pops are. Your guns, ammo and gear are not just toys for putting holes in paper, they&#039;re your assurance for when the collapse happens or when you need to fight big brother when the day comes. Your purity spiralling over meat is not just like yuppie foodie snobbery, it&#039;s a matter of you being poisoned or not. etc. etc. Like I mentioned earlier, leftist media has no interest in covering this kind of consumption, but there exists the alternative media spaces where conservatives are allowed that push these products, but in the clever form of marketing mentioned above. The youtube prepper/off the grid/ homesteader space is a media space with tons of channels that have millions of views and subscribers that market a lifestyle that lead to the consumption of these products. And make no mistake, that whole scene is a forced top down trend that was purposely curated to appeal to right wing consumers. It is disguised better so people like those here can allow themselves to believe that they aren&#039;t consuming the way those urbanite leftists do.<br>pt.2<br>continued below.", "time": 1675120799, "resto": 2524218}, {"no": 2532648, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)18:32:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2532643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2532643</a><br>The other issue is attitudes and awareness about one&#039;s own consumption. Liberals will consume, but they will view it as something to enjoy and not take too seriously. Right wingers however, falling for the marketing trick of framing their consumption choices as serious pragmatic necessities for their life, will take a much more righteous and resolute stance over their consumption of said product. This is why leftists are more willing to give up or change what they consume when they are told that there is a greater societal goal in mind that would require modifying their consumption habits. Whereas rightwingers view their right to consume said product as a higher good than anything else, and will view any change as an attack on their most cherished right, that to consume what they want. As you can see right wingers are inherently more consumer minded because they have no higher societal ideals except freedom to consume. Leftists actually do put some things higher than what they like to buy. That is why you see such stubborn tantrums over electric cars replacing their ICEs, or bristle at the suggestion of not eating steak every day.

I&#039;ve seen people secure a window screen over a tote or a strainer inside a bucket, but to me that&#039;s just another thing to clean and another way for bird seed to get everywhere. And some ppl say you gotta wait ~30 mins for the water to strain. But since its only flash prepped and not fully hydrated you don&#039;t need to wait, just start loading it in the bag after like 3 minutes of letting the water drain.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck. I\u2019m currently clearing a bunch of land for a terrace to grow some vegetables and friut trees. I might just buy 5 small pigs and let them run around in there and fatten them up.

On your last 2 acres, build your structures and use it for plants that you yourself will consume. Parta that you dont eat can be used to feed poultry or pigs. If I were you, I would buy a piglet every year and raise it for slaughter. You can let it supplement off pine cones or acorns and such in your woods. Take a quarter acre and grow corn to feed the pig. Take another quarter acre and put a pond on it, this is really important because you can periodically excavate the bottom layer of the muck and combine it with compost juice. The water in your pond can also temporarily fertilize your garden or your cow\u2019s pasture. Try and srock your pond with fish that are able to attract and kill and eat insects. Attracting Insects for food should be your pond\u2019s top priority, since insects cone from outside your property, and are thus an infinite source of food.

While keeping the bottle upside down works well in and around freezing temps, it is not up to the task when it gets much colder. If you are carrying a bottle you can put it in a long and roomy sock, split the upper part of the sock and tie it around your neck, keeping it hanging on chest level beneath your wind stopper/shell layer and on the outside of your wool liner. This is so effective that it can after a long ruck yield lukewarm water, and while you are walking or skiing you can refill the bottle in increments with snow or ice without fear of it freezing allowing you to use less fuel per day. Now bladder systems are also feasible in the winter time, however it is more strenuous to keep warm. Optimally if you can the water bladder should be carried underneath your wind stopper or shell layer, with the tube being routed through the sleeves of your jacket, this will keep it warm and it will never freeze, but it will severely fuck with your ability to wear a backpack. This is the most secure way to carry a water bladder in truly cold weather, i only do this when i use my pulk sled instead of a backpack. Now if you don&#039;t have access to a sled, or the terrain/snow cover isn&#039;t suitable for one you can also carry water bladders within the backpack, but then it is vital to blow air through the tube after you drink, as the tube is most at risk of freezing while the bladder, if carried against the back of the backpack will most likely not freeze. So be very disciplined with blowing the water back into the bladder each time you take a sip. If you slip up and it freezes you can detach the hose and let it hang down your pants which will fix the issue after some time.", "time": 1674301644, "resto": 2527921}, {"no": 2528340, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:56:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2527921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2527921</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In boy scouts the they would always say &quot;be careful turning ice and snow into water, it can use up to much energy if you take it in cold&quot;</span><br>melting snow/ice takes a lot more energy than heating water<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What tips and tricks are used by /out/ to get and keep water below freezing?</span><br>I make tea and drink that, I get water either by melting and boiling snow or from springs", "time": 1674302206, "resto": 2527921}, {"no": 2528341, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:58:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2528339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2528339</a><br>I forgot to add, normal bladder systems can be carried on your chest if you are carrying a backpack, but this will also get in the way of comfort to a degree.

I have a larger pot and liquid fuel stove but just haven&#039;t gotten many days where that&#039;s actually been needed. The biggest change to behavior is therefore just being more cognizant of water sources that run consistently in colder, drier weather. A lot of small mountain streams completely freeze out so I am more prone to mapping out year round sources and carrying extra water. I can expand capacity using the dirty water bag to about 4L total.

But you\u2019re not gonna see orgies in the open or whatever some people think happens there. Just some goofy hippies with their instruments, trinkets, and life stories.

Hostel option I mentioned is a good workaround from being completely homeless. Work is usually easy and involves sitting around a lot. There&#039;s loads of opportunities to get laid if you&#039;re decent looking and can LARP as some cool traveller guy. Just don&#039;t make it obvious you&#039;re a bum, most hostels don&#039;t want anything to do with that sort as they&#039;re largely scumbags and retards. You get a place to stay without needing contracts, deposits or any other nonsense. In UK you can definitely use a letter from hostel manager as proof of address... or just have something shipped to you, like a SIM card. You get access to kitchen so you can save what you got by actually being able to eat decent, home cooked meals, plus you always got a table and a chair. You don&#039;t need any workarounds for showers, etc. There&#039;s typically a storage lockers in dormitories, so you can lock your essentials up. In two years working for three different hostels I saw something being stolen twice, one time the thief being caught within 15 mins. Other time someone jacked a pair of useless headphones, which I guess was plain bad luck. Don&#039;t look seedy. Have a good relationships with other staff and whoever runs the place. <br><br>Being full on homeless in UK is fucking retarded and lame.

He knew I was there but absolutely did not care. I just talked to myself at a normal volume and he kept walking away.<br>On the other hand, I was with a group of 3 and we were walking along another tundra hillside. We saw a black bear below us. We immediately began yelling and making noise to scare it away. This time, the thing developed a keen interest in us. It stayed in the valley for the entire day.<br>That showed me that bears respond badly to perceived challenges, just like people. You should only start making noise/freaking out once the bear shows interest in you.

Generally that\u2019s done to be on the leeward side of a hill, or further from a water source, or in a less-traveled area. In a micro sense, there are fewer worries about rocks, sticks, vegetation, or roots. A slight angle to the ground doesn\u2019t matter. Puddles aren\u2019t a major concern.

A single walled tent is set up one way. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;utility</span><br>A hammock tarp is fairly large, providing much more useable space if there\u2019s rain. It\u2019s only a slight advantage, as most decent tents already have enough space under the vestibule. A hammock also doubles as a chair, but it\u2019s not like you can just plop it down wherever (but it\u2019s still a place to sit).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not stuck in a dog house while it\u2019s raining</span><br>Self explanatory.

Umbrellas are very situationally dependent. Sometimes they\u2019re absolutely the best option, and sometimes there are better options out there. If there\u2019s a lot of wind driven rain (and I mean a lot, not just a slight breeze in a light drizzle), you might be better off with a jacket. If the trail is really over grown (basically bushwhacking; a little overgrowth won\u2019t hurt anything), then your umbrella may get snagged too often.<br><br>Where they work well is light to moderate rain. Just as a rain jacket is paired with pants, an umbrella can do the same. They also pair well with a very light jacket, such as a water resistant running jacket. That combo provides heavy protection from rain via the umbrella while the jacket keeps any blowback from soaking you, and it\u2019s still more breathable than most options. A lot of thruhikers are using this combo now. It\u2019s pretty versatile; if it\u2019s not raining too hard you leave the jacket off and use just the umbrella (unlike just a rain jacket, where it\u2019s all or nothing). <br><br>Breathability is a huge umbrella advantage. It\u2019s why it\u2019s the absolute best rain protection in hot environments during rainy summers. In the South, rain showers spring up out of nowhere, and dissipate just as quickly. They\u2019re so scattered that raining while the sun is out is fairly common.

There are fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and reefs and shit to explore, and studying oceanic biomes can be useful, even profitable.

For example, non-fishermen believe fishing is boring and that all you do is sit motionless holding a pole, which isn&#039;t true at all in practice. At least with fishing, though, you might see a turtle, you&#039;ll spot some interesting birds, there are trees, you&#039;ll get to talk to other fishermen, you might get lucky and find a nice lost lure, you can have fun paddling a boat around... mountaineering is just rocks, snow, and the company only of other mountaineers.<br><br>I do respect it, because of the expertise and skill needed.

I haven&#039;t ever told anyone but my family this story but here goes.<br><br>A decade ago while solo hiking in snow for the first time (blue mountains australia) I fucked up stepped into a pile of snow which I thought was solid and slipped down a slope ending up in an ice stream in full gear, maybe a 40lb pack on. I went in head first straight under. The stream was only 3 foot wide but it was a 3 foot drop to actually get into it. I didn&#039;t even know it was there and only slid 20m to get into it, it was hidden by its snow capped edges. I quickly threw my body around and when my feet couldn&#039;t touch the bottom I started to panic. It was moving fast and I was immediately carried away, it felt like I was in that stream for 2 minutes but I think it was only 10 seconds. Some how I managed to drop my pack and kick up off something back onto the edge and dragged myself back up. After I got out I tore all of my clothes off to my underwear, which took all of my energy<br>and ran for the road which was about 1km away and I was very lucky that there were cars there with people pulled over having snow ball fights with their children.

I wasn&#039;t even in the hyper-hipster libtard areas like Seattle, I was inland, right by Idaho. I think part of it just has to do with the local environment. Southern Ontario is crowded, highly industrial (aka ugly in lots of parts), very car-dependent (with bad road infrastructure), sub-par access to natural areas. Washington has insane access to a huge variety of great outdoors stuff as long as you aren&#039;t in the central area (even so, its like 1.5-2hr to pristine mountains), less crowded, nicer neighborhood (not as much of the expansive cheap suburbs we have here). <br><br>I think about moving every week.

I was definitely trying too hard and not using the momentum of the rod tip to propel the lure. I\u2019m used to slinging lures after all. I switched over to a 1/32 oz jig head with a skirt for the time being, and have been catching really well though. I\u2019ve gotten lots of bream, little largemouth bass, and one yellow bass.

What I actually said is that I own and use almost every type of rod and pole imaginable, including cane poles; and that in some situations, a cane pole (or a literal stick) is the best tool for the job. In other situations, I&#039;ll use a fly rod, a tenkara rod, a spinning rod, a baitcaster, a microfishing rod, a catfishing rod, etc.<br><br>What I was responding to at the time was the assertion (perhaps yours, since you&#039;ve chosen to perpetuate a false account of the conversation) that cane poles are for children or beginners, but are otherwise wholly inferior to spinning rods and baitcasters. From this I infer that you&#039;ve only ever fished developed, maintained, popular waters, and have never been out in the backcountry casting in heavy brush, where every single one of your spinning rods and baitcasters would be instantly tangled. A cane pole is also best suited to dapping (a superior technique in tiny ponds and rivulets), regardless of surrounding cover. Tenkara and Western fly rods are actually terrible for dapping.<br><br>Since you&#039;re either clinically stupid or simply a liar, here is a long list of things that cane poles aren&#039;t good for:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trolling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ice fishing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;surf fishing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;catfishing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;offshore fishing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fishing wide areas of large streams</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;basically anything that requires distance, depth, and/or cranking something quickly</span><br><br>My beef as always is with people who think fishing is all about good-looking spinning and baitcasting rods (with color-coordinated line to match the finish, no doubt), really impressive casts, shiny clacking lures, and big bass dumped into an artificial lake with adjoining parking lot, when in reality this is a tiny sliver of the whole fishing experience.

Operculicarya decaryi is dry deciduous, so if you stop watering, it will/should lose all of its leaves until spring. First of all, though, I&#039;d take both of them out of their pots and make sure the roots are still healthy. The yellowing leaves on the Dracaena don&#039;t sound good, but that could be because it&#039;s getting way too little, or way too much water. The soil looks dry in the picture, but it doesn&#039;t look like the pots have a drainage hole, so the soil at the bottom could still be pretty wet, especially if you&#039;re watering them rather frequently. I&#039;ve found that the desert type Dracaena need really well-draining soil, as in pretty much just rocks and little to nothing else, to not die in cultivation.<br>Also, red leaves on an Operculicarya are normal if it gets a lot of UV light. Put it on your window sill and they&#039;ll turn green. O. decaryi will do fine in a peaty soil mix.<br><br>In short, I think there&#039;s nothing wrong with your O. decaryi, but the D. cinnabari could be in trouble.

Some seeds you can file with a nail file or sandpaper. Some seeds you can give a warm water bath overnight. Some seeds need an acid bath. I like to just get a 10x20&quot; spill tray fill it with 6 cells filled with potting-mix. I make little pits in each cell to the depth of whatever the seed needs. Sow the seeds. Then I either put them in the garage to get cold for the winter or under grow lights. I keep the soil moist by under-watering. I keep a fan nearby to keep airflow to keep seedlings from dampening off, get blasted by fungus, and to help strengthen them in general. If the particular type of seed needs to be really warm to germinate I put them somewhere that gets direct sunlight or I put them on a heating pad for a while.

Much better than trying to stomp through snow for several miles. The pic I posted had snow ranging from heel height to above knee height which will drain you quickly without any snowshoes/skis. Skis are also nice obviously, but I find snowshoes to be easier to deal with in this terrain. The ones I have are 30&quot; snowshoes, metal frame and deep spikes, rated at a weight up to about 125kg/275lbs ish depending on snow conditions. Most people will do fine with a 25&quot;, but thats up to your total weigth. Obviously it&#039;s a bit weird to use if you&#039;ve never used snowshoes before, as you may have to get used to a slightly wider walking stance depending on the snowshoes, but I&#039;ve used much wider ones before that I&#039;ve ran in, so these slimmer ones were a luxury to me.<br>I&#039;d recommend making sure you get the right weight rating; you + your pack + other stuff youre carrying. Heel lift is also a plus if you think you&#039;ll need it. And personally I prefer slim and long, vs short and wide. Of course make sure theyll fit you nicely, this isnt usually an issue for most people as theyll usually adjust to most feet(EU38-47). Just make sure to double check.

ENO and most Amazon hammocks are too short for most actual men. <br><br>Make a structural ridge line. It\u2019s a rope with two permanent loops on either end. Make it 83% the length of your hammock (about 110\u201d if you have an 11\u2019 hammock). This ensures that you\u2019re always hanging at 30\u00b0 no matter what your suspension is doing. They\u2019re pretty cheap if you want to just buy one, but it\u2019s super easy to make.<br><br>Hang the foot end higher than the head end. This will prevent you from having the sensation that you\u2019re constantly sliding down whenever you readjust. Play around with it; I like mine about a foot higher.<br><br>Lie on an angle.

Most give O6 (peanuts, sunflower seeds, hazlenuts, etc), while only a few give O3 (ground flax seeds, hemp hearts, chia seeds). For me a tablespoon or so of hemp for O3 plus a good assortment of the O6 varieties seems to do the trick. Another thing to keep in mind is that a lot have people have decided that grains = bad, but as a veggie you&#039;ll likely get most of your calories, protein, and water soluble vitamins from them. So choose ones with more concentrated nutrients and eat a variety of them (wheat is king, oats and potatoes are good, rice is poverty tier). One last tip, it&#039;s really easy to go overboard on vegetables that are heavy in oil-soluble vitamins, like carrots and spinach, because they tend to be cheap and versatile. The problem is that oil-soluble nutrients build up in your system and can become toxic at high enough levels. So don&#039;t just eat a ton of carrots for your vegetables, moderation is key. If you have any questions about what&#039;s the best bang for the buck, I highly recommend the site https://nutritiondata.self.com/. It pulls the data from the Standard Reference USDA nutrition database, which is by far the most complete, detailed, and well-sourced nutrition reference I&#039;ve ever found.", "time": 1674639780, "resto": 2530314}, {"no": 2530326, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:53:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Another thing I forgot to mention: there are three Omega 3 fatty acids: ALA, EPA, and DHA. The most important (essential) is the one I mentioned that comes from seeds (ALA). But the two others only come from fish, although they&#039;re less important (conditionally essential) but still great to add to your diet. For a vegetarian, the only realistic source of this is krill-based Omega 3 supplements. These often also include the seed based ALA as well, so you don&#039;t have to worry about taking flax or hemp hearts with you.

If you spend some time customizing the experience, you get the game tailored for you. 8.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Forest</span><br>Surviving is very basic. Construction is not very complex and enemy AI is bad. Good fun for the first 20 hours, but then it gets pretty stale as a survival game and turns into a monster fighting RPG. 6/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Project Zomboid</span><br>Artstyle and UI is very oldschool, but there is a deep and rich gameplay. On singleplayer, after you build your base the game basically ends. The fun is in multiplayer, but then it becomes a sort of grindy base battle royale(Rust/DayZ). Great game for urban survival. 9/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Green Hell</span><br>Probably the best survival game, but has a small non-procedural map(About 30hrs of gameplay). 9.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7 days to die</span><br>Another deep and rich gameplay, but the some skills makes it feels more &quot;gamey&quot; than a real survival. Blood moon hordes and radioactive zombies are too much fantasy for me. 8/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rain World</span><br>Not a human survival game, but a very good one. The wild monsters give insane fear goosebumps, and it actually feels like a real survival experience. 9.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Valheim</span><br>Way more of a Crafting RPG than a survival. Modded Minecraft is better. 7.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Long Dark</span><br>I refunded this game. Game feels extremely linear due to story mode and gameplay just feels unnecessary punishing, intead of just difficult. 2/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This War of Mine</span><br>Good game, but only played 3 times since base gameplay is not very replayable. DLCs are decent, but they are story driven instead of gameplay driven. 7.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dont Starve Together</span><br>Insane way of interpretating seasons. You start in summer collecting resources, prepared things during autumn, try to survive the cold winter with low food, then you have wet rainy spring. Then it is summer again, but this time with harsh desert-like sun and new wild creatures. Solid survival, but then it turns into an exploration RPG. 9/10", "time": 1673682294, "resto": 2499608}, {"no": 2524817, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)03:38:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524806</a><br>No one who likes the long dark does it because of story mode, that one&#039;s only there to draw normalfags", "time": 1673685513, "resto": 2499608}, {"no": 2524826, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:00:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2499608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2499608</a><br>Whenever I play games now, I focus on taking screenshots of scenery just like I do irl.
