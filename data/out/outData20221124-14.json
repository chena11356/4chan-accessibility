In addition the Meetup hikes are usually pretty moderate/lame and very far so it isn\u2019t very worth it for me. <br><br>I was thinking of doing skiing or snowboarding classes but I basically already know how to do both and it\u2019s a ginormous rip off it seems, plus the only 2 ski places within 1.5 hrs of me are very poorly managed and it seems dumb to pay so much for a ski pass even let alone lessons.<br><br>I also wanted to do rock climbing but the good gym is a 25 min drive, and they have weird fucking rules for the lessons I\u2019m actually interested in so I have to wait a year to take them. <br><br>The closer by gym is much shittier and they only have extremely basic beginner lessons, which is stuff I already know how to do so I have no real way of improving or meeting anyone, and I don\u2019t even have a climbing buddy. Like yeah I can learn through watching Youtube videos but it gets lonely after a while. <br><br>There is a festival 3 hrs away sometime in January for a niche sport im interested in but that seems like a long shot anyway and they might not have lessons at the festival.", "filename": "0FE2DAB6-23F8-47D3-A9AC-63EDAE1D4BEF", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 267, "h": 188, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 176, "tim": 1668029612005554, "time": 1668029612, "md5": "ccfeyeIM/Zg4NLKSZuxGHQ==", "fsize": 8365, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-to-meet-outdoorsy-people-no-one-to-socialize", "replies": 93, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 88, "omitted_images": 7, "last_replies": [{"no": 2499523, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)22:43:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why do all the replies keep getting saged", "time": 1669088600, "resto": 2494105}, {"no": 2499529, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)22:55:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2499523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2499523</a><br>a janny probably didn&#039;t like the thread.", "time": 1669089358, "resto": 2494105}, {"no": 2500273, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)15:49:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2499523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2499523</a><br>autosage is usually triggered by a no-no word in the OP, e.g. saying &quot;tranny&quot; on a /v/ thread OP", "time": 1669236579, "resto": 2494105}, {"no": 2500360, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)19:17:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2500273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2500273</a><br>So the janitors can&#039;t actually moderate and clean the board, but they set a script to autosage a legitimate question thread?", "time": 1669249031, "resto": 2494105}, {"no": 2500412, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)20:52:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2500360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2500360</a><br>well it seems that this thread isnt actually autosaged seeing as we are bumping it right now. autosage is pretty ineffective for slow moving boards like /out/ anyways.", "time": 1669254770, "resto": 2494105}], "last_modified": 1669254770}, {"no": 2497812, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)12:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Picture thread", "com": "Just share /out/ pictures.<br>Here\u2019s the view while I was packing a mule deer out last weekend.
