I couldn&#039;t do math yet, so I had no idea how much I had paid or gotten back, but I remember how proud I was when I got back home. Years later I found out I never was alone - my father had followed me with a camera to see if I would cross the intersection carefully, avoid any traffic and be alright on my own. Once he knew I was fine, he knew I could be trusted to leave the house alone from there on. <br>I think the way they did it was best: First a pilot run, where they kept me safe but I could feel like I was alone. Then once that went well, they let me do my thing. That way they could trust I was fine on my own and I could be free of parental control.<br>Your main goal is avoiding the shit that can result in death or severe injury, for the rest, it&#039;s better if they find out themselves. <br>We had plenty a injury from homemade fireworks, fighting with sticks, etc. Kids learn surprisingly quickly to take care of each other. <br>Either way, don&#039;t stress about it too much anon, you sound like a great parent. Listen to your inner fears, then rationalize how probable they are. If they are unlikely, allow your kids freedom. If it&#039;s reasonable, air on the side of caution.

Umbrellas are very situationally dependent. Sometimes they\u2019re absolutely the best option, and sometimes there are better options out there. If there\u2019s a lot of wind driven rain (and I mean a lot, not just a slight breeze in a light drizzle), you might be better off with a jacket. If the trail is really over grown (basically bushwhacking; a little overgrowth won\u2019t hurt anything), then your umbrella may get snagged too often.<br><br>Where they work well is light to moderate rain. Just as a rain jacket is paired with pants, an umbrella can do the same. They also pair well with a very light jacket, such as a water resistant running jacket. That combo provides heavy protection from rain via the umbrella while the jacket keeps any blowback from soaking you, and it\u2019s still more breathable than most options. A lot of thruhikers are using this combo now. It\u2019s pretty versatile; if it\u2019s not raining too hard you leave the jacket off and use just the umbrella (unlike just a rain jacket, where it\u2019s all or nothing). <br><br>Breathability is a huge umbrella advantage. It\u2019s why it\u2019s the absolute best rain protection in hot environments during rainy summers. In the South, rain showers spring up out of nowhere, and dissipate just as quickly.

The tropics are not the frostline the tundra is not the swamp and the city is not for straight people. <br><br>Do not buy things. Take a long time to figure out what you need to learn first. You can approach this two ways. Watch youtube cringe, get bad advice here (my favourite) and finally you can try to connect with eople who do stuff outdoors. <br>Here&#039;s what I think is important to cover.<br><br>1<br>Get a good pair of boots that fit a nice pair of socks. No matter what you do you will always be able to use them, even if you don&#039;t wind up being outdoors oriented. Try on a bunch and make sure they are just a little bit bigger than usual and fit your foot type.<br><br>2<br>Next you want a bag. No less than 45 litres, no more than 65. Avoid Osprey cringe and old ass milsurp.(pre 90s unless you want to try a heavy alice pack for fun) Get cheap decathelon or REI&#039;s deals on a sale. You want something that you can ft water bottles in the side, that has a good hip belt. <br><br>3<br>Sleeping bag.<br>The more you spend on this the warmer and lighter you can get it. You can try for a normal synthetic fill. Maybe Snugpack would be a cheap option that has plenty of non expensive options in a temperature range that matches your area. Always get the warmest you can.<br><br>For shelter get a tarp. It&#039;s cheap and cheap aluminium pegs are great. With some cord you can figure out the ins and outs of using a 3x3 tarp to stay sheltered almost anywhere. If you chose to get a hammock you can keep using it for a fly.<br><br>Boots, bag, sleeping and shelter covered now you can start on skill specific equipment. <br>Get a plain flat backed knife. Full tang if you have money for a good one, or a mora if you are cheap and want a beater that works. This will be your learning toolset.<br><br>With that decided, you should have considered where you will go, what kind of conditions for weather you will be facing. The temperature. The use of fire.", "time": 1675246024, "resto": 2529825}, {"no": 2533165, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)05:14:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2529825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2529825</a><br>Next thing is food. Try not to pack cans. They are heavy adn will be annoying. For the first night you can always take fresh food. Don&#039;t worry about freeze dried or shelf stable unless you are doing long hikes or a couple of nights. That&#039;s on you, decide if you just want to do overnight or just get used to walking with your gear. You should wear boots a while to get them broken in, pack your bag and do some long walks with it packed. Condition yourself. It helps. <br><br>The thing to do next is to get a habit of reading. Find some outdoors lit and make a point of digesting it. Every skill that you have will rely on practice, but practice is always enhanced by reading. It will help you get an idea of what is considered normal or conventional knowladge. <br>For you I would reccomend The DK Survival Guide AKA The Royal Marines Survival Handbook in some nations. It is one of the best composed and illustrated books on all the basics that I&#039;ve ever seen. Nothing in that book that you should not know. It&#039;s all sensible.

Hostel option I mentioned is a good workaround from being completely homeless. Work is usually easy and involves sitting around a lot. There&#039;s loads of opportunities to get laid if you&#039;re decent looking and can LARP as some cool traveller guy. Just don&#039;t make it obvious you&#039;re a bum, most hostels don&#039;t want anything to do with that sort as they&#039;re largely scumbags and retards. You get a place to stay without needing contracts, deposits or any other nonsense. In UK you can definitely use a letter from hostel manager as proof of address... or just have something shipped to you, like a SIM card. You get access to kitchen so you can save what you got by actually being able to eat decent, home cooked meals, plus you always got a table and a chair. You don&#039;t need any workarounds for showers, etc. There&#039;s typically a storage lockers in dormitories, so you can lock your essentials up. In two years working for three different hostels I saw something being stolen twice, one time the thief being caught within 15 mins. Other time someone jacked a pair of useless headphones, which I guess was plain bad luck. Don&#039;t look seedy. Have a good relationships with other staff and whoever runs the place. <br><br>Being full on homeless in UK is fucking retarded and lame.

Explain you are in need of Long and short term work to sponsor an on foot expedition. Make it novel. You&#039;re not a bum- you are initnerant. Adventuring. It works. Makes you look deliberate not desperate. Remember that.<br><br>Next make sure you have shoes that look normal in normal ish clothing. Simple black or brown hikers that could pass for employment shoes. Not some super fancy goretex shit.

Socks, shirt and under wear are more important than full sets of clothes.<br><br>You now have a way to stay somewhere. This is time. Time must be spend looking for a job.

You&#039;ll wander around bewildered that finally happened to you and that you didn&#039;t think about ways to mitigate homelessness in the first place. If your parants kick you out I have to ask if you&#039;ve fucked around on them or not.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck. I\u2019m currently clearing a bunch of land for a terrace to grow some vegetables and friut trees. I might just buy 5 small pigs and let them run around in there and fatten them up.

Take a quarter acre and grow corn to feed the pig.

Come up with a plan of what you intend on growing, how long it takes to germinate an estimate of when it will be to harvest. And strategize your planning around that. While you can&#039;t plant summer plants in spring, you can absolutely plant spring plants throughout the entire growing season ( I plant lettuce, arugula, carrots, kale, etc) all season long. With proper care, variety selection optimized for summer you can have lettuce and whatever the entire season. In order to do this you have to practice succession planting (planting a crop succesively every week or two to have continual harvest) You also need space to do this and an ability to crop rotate (when this plants coming out I have a new plant taking it&#039;s place.) Most summer crops happen to be fruiting plants (tomato, zucchini, etc) that are plant and done till they die from disease or the cold. So what I do is dedicate entire beds to my summer plants and work my spring/fall specific plants around that. I have two rows dedicated to trellising plants (tomatoes, cucumbers, pole beans) i intercrop determinate tomatoes with my climbing beans and bush beans with my climbing tomatoes and cucumbers. I have a row for peppers which I can intercop things like lettuce or radishes, whatever you want that doesn&#039;t take up to many nutrients. My garden is 8 30inch rows 45 feet long atm and when you map out an entire planting strategy my summer beds automatically rotate themselves to spring planting beds by next grow season. Draw diagrams of your garden space, figure out what you&#039;re planting and the harvest time and ask yourself if I want a continual harvest of something like carrots or lettuce what do I need to do to achieve that, where can I plant them, where can I plant my next row of them, etc. It requires very thoughtful planting but it&#039;s not hard to figure out the optimal strategy for your alotment", "time": 1675371155, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533771, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)20:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533523</a><br>you&#039;re gonna have to manually pollenate when the time comes, they won&#039;t successfully wind-pollenate with that few plants at that distance", "time": 1675389572, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533797, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:06:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533771</a><br>I thought that manual pollenate thing was only when you have different kind of corn(i saw a video where a guys uses paper bags to make the polkenate thing)", "time": 1675393570, "resto": 2532559}, {"no": 2533814, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:56:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I want to do a landrace of squash, do I need to try to pollinate it a certain way or just let it go natural and collect the seeds from the best specimens?

We immediately began yelling and making noise to scare it away. This time, the thing developed a keen interest in us.

Much better than trying to stomp through snow for several miles. The pic I posted had snow ranging from heel height to above knee height which will drain you quickly without any snowshoes/skis. Skis are also nice obviously, but I find snowshoes to be easier to deal with in this terrain. The ones I have are 30&quot; snowshoes, metal frame and deep spikes, rated at a weight up to about 125kg/275lbs ish depending on snow conditions. Most people will do fine with a 25&quot;, but thats up to your total weigth. Obviously it&#039;s a bit weird to use if you&#039;ve never used snowshoes before, as you may have to get used to a slightly wider walking stance depending on the snowshoes, but I&#039;ve used much wider ones before that I&#039;ve ran in, so these slimmer ones were a luxury to me.<br>I&#039;d recommend making sure you get the right weight rating; you + your pack + other stuff youre carrying. Heel lift is also a plus if you think you&#039;ll need it. And personally I prefer slim and long, vs short and wide. Of course make sure theyll fit you nicely, this isnt usually an issue for most people as theyll usually adjust to most feet(EU38-47). Just make sure to double check.

My job sucks and makes me want to blow my brains out, but I&#039;m paid better than most people of my age with my educational background. Also gf has a job she likes here. So I&#039;m here for now, but I would move within the week if my gf quit her job or we broke up. <br><br>I strongly believe that some places are better than others. I think ontario is mid to low tier in terms of the US and Canada, and I was spoiled to grow up in the pacific northwest. As an aside, I think lots of people would agree with me, given that real estate prices in the pacific northwest are rising fast simply because so many people want to move there for good QOL.", "filename": "thinking pepe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674442390671007, "time": 1674442390, "md5": "UxDccof43EtxDqESa+iaUg==", "fsize": 7825, "resto": 2528855}, {"no": 2529163, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)21:54:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2529122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2529122</a><br>They are though.

Protein is the obvious one but there&#039;s others. Dietary B12 only comes from meat but you can easily supplement with vitamins. Iron from plants is less bioavailable but can also be supplemented. Other than that, the usual trail mix of seeds and nuts is really helpful for getting enough protein and essential fatty acids. The big divide in this category is Omega 6 vs Omega 3 fatty acids. Most give O6 (peanuts, sunflower seeds, hazlenuts, etc), while only a few give O3 (ground flax seeds, hemp hearts, chia seeds). For me a tablespoon or so of hemp for O3 plus a good assortment of the O6 varieties seems to do the trick. Another thing to keep in mind is that a lot have people have decided that grains = bad, but as a veggie you&#039;ll likely get most of your calories, protein, and water soluble vitamins from them. So choose ones with more concentrated nutrients and eat a variety of them (wheat is king, oats and potatoes are good, rice is poverty tier). One last tip, it&#039;s really easy to go overboard on vegetables that are heavy in oil-soluble vitamins, like carrots and spinach, because they tend to be cheap and versatile. The problem is that oil-soluble nutrients build up in your system and can become toxic at high enough levels. So don&#039;t just eat a ton of carrots for your vegetables, moderation is key. If you have any questions about what&#039;s the best bang for the buck, I highly recommend the site https://nutritiondata.self.com/. It pulls the data from the Standard Reference USDA nutrition database, which is by far the most complete, detailed, and well-sourced nutrition reference I&#039;ve ever found.", "time": 1674639780, "resto": 2530314}, {"no": 2530326, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:53:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Another thing I forgot to mention: there are three Omega 3 fatty acids: ALA, EPA, and DHA. The most important (essential) is the one I mentioned that comes from seeds (ALA).

For a vegetarian, the only realistic source of this is krill-based Omega 3 supplements. These often also include the seed based ALA as well, so you don&#039;t have to worry about taking flax or hemp hearts with you.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

Hell no. Can it charge your phone in 5 minutes of cranking enough to make emergency phonecall? Definitely.

Flakes tend to hold onto moisture extremely well. Even if they feel dry to the touch, they\u2019re probably still way more moist than any other ribbon cut tobacco you own. The drying time is necessary before packing. Virginia flakes also expand quite a lot once they get hot, meaning a loose pack is essential. If you pack it using the three pack method like a ribbon cut, it may be fine before you light it, but as soon as it warms up it\u2019s going to expand so much that no oxygen will be able to reach the tobacco, making the ember go out extremely quickly. And because it expands, tamping regularly will compact the tobacco even more, which will make it unsmokable, so you\u2019ll always want to go for a relight first when smoking a flake, and only tamp when absolutely necessary.

But you\u2019re not gonna see orgies in the open or whatever some people think happens there. Just some goofy hippies with their instruments, trinkets, and life stories.

Think the white bunny boot the us military uses or the mickey mouse boot.

Great in theory, but in my experience the lacing needs more work because once you have 2 layers of socks in your 1-2 size upsized m77s, the lacing is wonky. The lower laces don&#039;t hold down well once you move up the lace chain and your foot starts to slide around. If you tighten too much at the instep too you cut circulation off to your lower foot and then what&#039;s the point of wearing all those socks?<br>There are a ton of blood vessels right at the top of the foot above the arch that the smallest amount of circulation cut off and your foot starts to freeze.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s a 4/5 effort, especially for being an almost 50 year old design. the leather is 2/5, the lacing 3/5, the foot width is 4/5 but needs to be wider for winter. It&#039;s a design that should handle customization better between lacing up for summer and winter and there&#039;s just no way around it because it doesn&#039;t.</span><br>This is the problem and wall people face. If you want a good design engineered to succeed in bad conditions, chances are it will be fuck ugly. Think crocs, think birkenstock. Look at the stegler design above.

Rainier I saw chipmunks, grouse, pipits, marmots, squirrels, mountain goats - the mountains are very much alive. You are also actively and physically exploring, even if it&#039;s in a different way from how you would explore a forest or a reef. Strange ice formations, interesting rocks, alien and exciting escarpments, and of course the majesty of the mountain itself.

I haven&#039;t ever told anyone but my family this story but here goes.<br><br>A decade ago while solo hiking in snow for the first time (blue mountains australia) I fucked up stepped into a pile of snow which I thought was solid and slipped down a slope ending up in an ice stream in full gear, maybe a 40lb pack on. I went in head first straight under. The stream was only 3 foot wide but it was a 3 foot drop to actually get into it. I didn&#039;t even know it was there and only slid 20m to get into it, it was hidden by its snow capped edges. I quickly threw my body around and when my feet couldn&#039;t touch the bottom I started to panic. It was moving fast and I was immediately carried away, it felt like I was in that stream for 2 minutes but I think it was only 10 seconds. Some how I managed to drop my pack and kick up off something back onto the edge and dragged myself back up. After I got out I tore all of my clothes off to my underwear, which took all of my energy<br>and ran for the road which was about 1km away and I was very lucky that there were cars there with people pulled over having snow ball fights with their children. So I came bolting over in my underwear and the people had seen what happened to me got me in their car and wedged me between two adult men in the backseat. I remember sitting there and I felt so pleasant and at peace with everything, kind of zoning in and out of the pleasant feelings, then back into the reality that I was almost naked between two men who were rubbing my body and sandwiching me.

Australia. Many iterations. Walked a lot of states. Slept a lot of beaches, bummed a lot of rides. Made more money have having no rent while stopping for a couple of weeks doing picker trails. <br>Had sleeping bag, pad, hygrine gear, a good knife and passable working clothes that doubled as interview. Sandles for average wear, some non descrept shoes for work and stable standing. Most of the time I&#039;d wind up bored and drifting to the nearest town then to the library. Food was so cheap in general from not eating out at all that foraging was all suppliment. Seasonal and mostly required local knowladge so stayed away from a lot of it. Too much of the difficulty now is in the gaps between areas that people live. The thing is it&#039;s easy to settle down, use employment to get basic materials and make a small hide. It&#039;s as simple as an A frame and a good water container for long term. But frankly people are so generous on the road that I never had much actual adversity that I didn&#039;t go out of my way to find. Especially when it came to bad weather, mostly heat related, I&#039;d go read a lot. Eat some cheap end of day meals. Go to work the next day, showering at places that let me, rest stops in two cases and beachside in most of the urban zones. In the end keeping clothes clean wasn&#039;t even that hard as eventaully you hit civ and can launder. Working while wandering is key. Expenses eliminated you are reduced to <br>1 Make self clean and presentable<br>2 Sleep and wake up safely<br>3 Get money<br>4 Use spare time<br>5 Resist temptations to spend on stupid shit because no bills no thrills. <br>It&#039;s a great way to skill up if you have a nearby hobby. The money I saved from those 38 months became seed money fo later land ownership. As for wilderness, you need starup capital and specific gear in a place that no one checks much.

It was expensive but its very small and light, super worth it on long portages. I also know for a fact it works and would save my life.<br>Do you have experience regular camping or backpacking?", "filename": "A0A11A50-85D8-4441-89E3-A4F29D8098B7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675475331731074, "time": 1675475331, "md5": "u+IMdG1urVz3ED0as72o4g==", "fsize": 537382, "resto": 2530108}, {"no": 2534306, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:07:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533463</a><br>lots of portaging kind of &quot;requires&quot; a light canoe, and most of the big ones are very expensive. solo canoes are light though and you can avoid high prices that way. i don&#039;t know about in canada, but here in the US you can find older aluminum Grumman canoes all the time for like $400-700. most often it&#039;s the 15ft and 17ft models. they are not light, but a very good bang for your buck considering how durable and longlasting they are. a 15ft can be portaged if you pack lightly and are decently strong.", "time": 1675508876, "resto": 2530108}, {"no": 2534391, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)11:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2534207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2534207</a><br><a href=\"#p2534306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2534306</a><br><br>thanks anons. yeah i live in the gta but im broke and alone so ive had limited experiences. im used to carry cheap and heavy gear and i lift regularly so id settle for a heavy but cheap solo. problem is space to keep it (i live in a small apartment) so maybe id try renting one out or just wait to things improve.", "filename": "123 - Copy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675527089785073, "time": 1675527089, "md5": "QZv4YoT0vf9Jc8wKKDiQDQ==", "fsize": 1074377, "resto": 2530108}, {"no": 2534396, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)11:27:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2530108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2530108</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How can I find spots on a lake to camp at this upcoming summer?</span><br>You should look at a map of crown land and not just camp on other people&#039;s private property like a retard hobo.", "time": 1675528028, "resto": 2530108}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2533706, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)18:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Good bang for buck snowshoes", "com": "I am a beginner looking for a solid set of snowshoes for a decent price.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high. Keep your rain water at roof-gutter level instead of ground level to allow gravity to keep the water pressure up so you can at least shit and shower if the power goes out. My house looks like any other 1960&#039;s Australian fibro cottage but I take a working holiday every couple of years to Taree as a cattle drover and stay in pic-related.<br><br>I want to talk about how hard it is to be green, but it really isn&#039;t.

Beneath the surface is a mycelium system that spawns the fruiting bodies in an area that consistently produces mushrooms. I assume the best way to proliferate a desired fruiting body is to first proliferate mycelium growth (maybe by spreading nutrient substrate around the area), or to spread spores over the desired area during ideal weather conditions and over an ideal substrate in ideal locations to promote growth (ie under a damp log or on moist sheltered leaf litter during a cool rainy season, dependent on species). Both methods are dependent on local weather and light conditions, because they are done outside of a controlled environment. Large colonies also take a long time to grow and cover a large area, there are many examples in both the eastern and western US of colonies that are hundreds to thousands of acres in size and they are estimated to have taken hundreds to thousands of years to attain that much area.

And after that I just add half a quart of the flash prepped wbs to the top of the oat bags. PC for 3 \u00bd - 4 hours. And then done.<br><br>Some people say you have to do a hot shake in order to redistribute the moisture in the grains but I don&#039;t do that and haven&#039;t had any problems.

Personally I strain it by dumping the pot in my kitchen sink with just the little drain strainer since its easier and less mess but you can use a strainer if you want I guess. I&#039;ve seen people secure a window screen over a tote or a strainer inside a bucket, but to me that&#039;s just another thing to clean and another way for bird seed to get everywhere. And some ppl say you gotta wait ~30 mins for the water to strain. But since its only flash prepped and not fully hydrated you don&#039;t need to wait, just start loading it in the bag after like 3 minutes of letting the water drain. They&#039;ll finish hydrating fully during the PC cycle.

And this was without adding the quarters to the rocker. Then it would shake at 16.5 psi, indicating that the gauge is off by 1.5 psi. Now I have the quarters taped to the rocker and run that bitch at 19-19.5psi, the rocker only shaking occasionally during the cycle.

Cotton absorbs moisturize which results in the loss of any thermal properties. All of your sweat will adhere to your skin as dampness and make you colder. This can be lethal if all that dampness starts to freeze. Wool fibers also absorb sweat but they breathe better and keep their thermal properties when damp.<br><br>To quote the Norwegian Armed Forces winter clothing literature:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On the negative side, cotton is a fibre that easily absorbs moisture and requires</span><br>impregnation in order to withstand the damp. Cotton absorbs and accumulates<br>moisture, which results in its insulating properties being lost even with a small<br>degree of damp. When a cotton garment is wet it becomes heavy and takes a<br>relatively long time to dry.<br><br>Merino is so popular because the fibers are smooth enough to be comfortable in itch-prone areas.

Can&#039;t remember what it&#039;s called, but your brain is getting overloaded with hyper-stimulus from normal stimuli. It&#039;s related to ADHD/OCD/the rest of it and exists on a spectrum, ie. you can be very hyper-sensitive or you can be mildly hyper-sensitive under certain conditions.<br><br>The bad thing is you can&#039;t cure it. The good thing is you can easily treat the primary symptom (everything feels so itchy/bright/noisy/etc, but so much more than &quot;makes sense&quot; when you think about the lights or the sounds in isolation, and yet it&#039;s impossible to ignore): When you get up in the morning, gently rub your body all over with something mildly abrasive like a sponge or a soft brush and use a medium or stiff brush on your hair. Your nails will work but it helps to use a tool of some kind. You&#039;ll eventually feel oddly relaxed, like you got out of the bath. Your hyper-stimulus symptoms will be lessened for the rest of the day. Just don&#039;t overdo it, because you can go too far and irritate the skin/other obvious outcomes.<br><br>This tip does not help people who do not have hyper-sensitivity issues. If you&#039;re just a wimp then it cannot help. The cure for being a wimp is to progressively toughen up by increasing challenges, just like with building strength or endurance. Your mind is a muscle and can be trained and manipulated like any other part of the body. It might help to know that the majority of physiological changes (e.g. RBC count, cold sensitivity, depressant dependency, etc) will noticeably improve after 2-4 weeks of training.
