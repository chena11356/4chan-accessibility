It was possible to play in many ways (play with softair rifles, or dig trenches, or build treehouses, or shelters) that you simply didn&#039;t have the space for at home. The biggest draw was the feeling of adventure. We&#039;d climb under the electric fence where sheep were held and pet them (sometimes they&#039;d let us sometimes they&#039;d attack us), then again under it back into the forest, we&#039;d sometimes &quot;steal&quot; honey from some beeskeeper (he knew, but he also knew we wouldn&#039;t take much, so he let it happen), we&#039;d search for treasure, go in places that were forbidden (a old mine and a forest bunker were favorites) and sometimes we&#039;d go looking for animals.

Some freedom, and that includes the freedom to fuck up, is needed for kids to become adults. But some risk is also unneeded.

I bought a cheap single bedroom cottage in rural NE Victoria (australia) because it was close to a dairy farm I was managing that was already on septic and tank water. Everything works. I have a normal kitchen and office and can blare music and play video games like any other person. All my power tools are corded but the inverter has no trouble powering a pressure washer or angle grinder. A few solar panels and an inverter was all it took to take it completely off grid. Having the rain water tank at ground level is the biggest drain on my power though, every time I turn a tap there&#039;s a 50W jet pump that goes brrrr and draws the same power as a microwave running on high.

Operculicarya decaryi is dry deciduous, so if you stop watering, it will/should lose all of its leaves until spring. First of all, though, I&#039;d take both of them out of their pots and make sure the roots are still healthy. The yellowing leaves on the Dracaena don&#039;t sound good, but that could be because it&#039;s getting way too little, or way too much water. The soil looks dry in the picture, but it doesn&#039;t look like the pots have a drainage hole, so the soil at the bottom could still be pretty wet, especially if you&#039;re watering them rather frequently. I&#039;ve found that the desert type Dracaena need really well-draining soil, as in pretty much just rocks and little to nothing else, to not die in cultivation.<br>Also, red leaves on an Operculicarya are normal if it gets a lot of UV light. Put it on your window sill and they&#039;ll turn green. O. decaryi will do fine in a peaty soil mix.<br><br>In short, I think there&#039;s nothing wrong with your O. decaryi, but the D. cinnabari could be in trouble.

Flakes tend to hold onto moisture extremely well. Even if they feel dry to the touch, they\u2019re probably still way more moist than any other ribbon cut tobacco you own. The drying time is necessary before packing. Virginia flakes also expand quite a lot once they get hot, meaning a loose pack is essential. If you pack it using the three pack method like a ribbon cut, it may be fine before you light it, but as soon as it warms up it\u2019s going to expand so much that no oxygen will be able to reach the tobacco, making the ember go out extremely quickly. And because it expands, tamping regularly will compact the tobacco even more, which will make it unsmokable, so you\u2019ll always want to go for a relight first when smoking a flake, and only tamp when absolutely necessary.

Long for everything else. I have caught countless 3-4lb bass on the 7ft with zero issues at all, crappie rods have a softer tip so you can fish light jigs, but enough backbone for crappie(which obviously get bigger than other panfish.) It&#039;s just a good versatile blank with a comfortable long foregrip. I&#039;ve mostly been throwing small hardbaits on it last year and it&#039;s extremely good for that. Once a fish gets hooked they don&#039;t get off because the rod absorbs everything. Only downside is the guides aren&#039;t really made for braid, but I never use braid for light line fishing anyways. Trilene XL 6lb is ridiculously strong yet still limp. Also, the first guide is very small compared to other rods so it&#039;s only really meant to be used with a smaller reel like a 1000/2000 size. I&#039;d pick a Daiwa Regal, Legalis, or Exceler in 1000 size for that, whichever is on sale. If you wanted a more expensive rod you could get a TFO trout/panfish but I haven&#039;t personally used one of those yet. The TFO professional PRO S 702-1 Light power is probably an even better rod for versatility because it&#039;s a bit stiffer, but it only comes in 7ft and it&#039;s an ounce heavier than it needs to be.", "filename": "big_crap1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2042, "h": 3629, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673198346363711, "time": 1673198346, "md5": "syvwdKwGSiDA1q9ptn5sqA==", "fsize": 3768577, "resto": 2522398}, {"no": 2522502, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)12:24:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2522423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2522423</a><br>I don&#039;t want to discourage you but I&#039;m wondering why this basic idea hasn&#039;t taken the fishing world by storm.

Inflation is caused by boomers retiring on average q4 2022, when you retire you cash in your stocks/investments and move to t bills and cash because you cant afford a downturn. Boomers were the largest generation in history and all of them selling out at the same time, taking their money and removing it from the investments system is causing rates to go up. This is coupled with the fact that manufacturing is being reshored from china to here and latin America. We are experiencing the fastest reindustrialization in history, which is competing with your average joe for less investments dollars as companies take out loans to finance this, driving up rates more. But rates cant go above 6%, so the end is close, probably just one more year of rates. The other issue is that boomers retiring is causing there to be more jobs available than people to fill them as gen x was the smallest generation. Less people competing for more jobs means people can demand raises or just get a better paying job, making labor costs go up. But all of this is a good thing and with about 5 years of belt tightening, America will set itself up to dominate world markets for the rest of the century, with absolutely no one able to compete.

I worked on a pig farm for a year during the onset of covid (in which it was eventually shut down due to pig prices plummeting), so I can speak on a few things.<br><br>Sometimes you\u2019ll get a sow who after a 114-day gestation period births 16 piglets. Sounds great. But you have to consider some of the piglets die right away since they are worse than runts and can\u2019t survive a day. So you\u2019re down to 13. Then after detailing (literally cutting the tails off, otherwise piglets at 2 months will begin to bite the others, once there is blood, watch out!) you\u2019ll have to give them proper shots to ensure their survival till market weight. During all this, you better make sure you have farrowing cages, otherwise the sow might accidentally roll over a naive piglet or two while she positions sideways for milking, or even worse yet, she may indulge in infanticide which is common with pigs. It happens even with farrowing cages, but much less so than without them. There will also be piglets that randomly die of unknown causes, so that further complicates things if your looking to profit.<br><br>When it comes to breeding, unless you are running a decent operation, keeping a boar around will prove costly for the fees needed, but also the upkeep like shovelling his shit every day or two. Also a boar will lose potency if not bred constantly. One sow every 200 days or so ain\u2019t enough. I would probably just go for AI (artificial insemination) at that point. No boars, no rearing them. Just need fridge space. <br><br>Overall I think what you described (raising 5, selling 3 to \u201ceat free\u201d) is probably the best bang for your buck.

It should have a few things: <br>* a structure you can intutitively understand: Some are ordered by family, some by habitat, some by leaf type. As long as it makes sense to you and you can look something up quickly it&#039;s good. If you can&#039;t, it&#039;s bad. Stay away from alphabetical ones. <br>* Good pictures: You should have pictures that show the relevant parts of the plant in such a way that you can reliably feel confident the picture is the actual plant you are looking at. If the pictures are ass, so is the book. Don&#039;t buy it.<br>* A mention of uses for any given plant: This can be medicinal, or culinary, or historical. Personal preference, but it should mention how to use them<br>* Poison lookalikes: Any plant in this guide should have a section that states what other plants look like the one you are looking for, how to tell them apart and if the lookalikes are poisonous or not. If this information is missing, do not get the book. <br>* Good formfactor: Also personal preference. Smaller is better to carry, but means either less information or worse organization. Bigger means nicer pictures and more info, for more weight and bulk.

Much better than trying to stomp through snow for several miles. The pic I posted had snow ranging from heel height to above knee height which will drain you quickly without any snowshoes/skis. Skis are also nice obviously, but I find snowshoes to be easier to deal with in this terrain. The ones I have are 30&quot; snowshoes, metal frame and deep spikes, rated at a weight up to about 125kg/275lbs ish depending on snow conditions. Most people will do fine with a 25&quot;, but thats up to your total weigth. Obviously it&#039;s a bit weird to use if you&#039;ve never used snowshoes before, as you may have to get used to a slightly wider walking stance depending on the snowshoes, but I&#039;ve used much wider ones before that I&#039;ve ran in, so these slimmer ones were a luxury to me.<br>I&#039;d recommend making sure you get the right weight rating; you + your pack + other stuff youre carrying. Heel lift is also a plus if you think you&#039;ll need it. And personally I prefer slim and long, vs short and wide. Of course make sure theyll fit you nicely, this isnt usually an issue for most people as theyll usually adjust to most feet(EU38-47). Just make sure to double check.

In general kiting seems to be more oriented towards boosting and big air. Winging is more oriented towards catching waves and riding swell. As a novice foiler, the advantage of a wing vs a kite is that when you fall (you WILL fall a lot) it is much easier to retrieve a wing and get it flying again which in turn means you will lose less upwind progress. <br><br>Budget is generally $4,000-6000+. You can spend less. Hood River area should have a very active secondary market and community.<br><br>Foil &amp; mast: Axis 1150. Get the best and call it a day.<br>Board: lots of options. If winging, start with the biggest board you can; emphasis on length and width over short compact volume. Balancing in heavy chop is the hardest thing to do until you are good enough to get up and on foil very fast, and the Hood gets very heavy chop. If you decide to learn with a stand-up paddleboard or similar, you will want something with a skeg or center-fin; a normal 3-fin rear thruster configuration will not cut it. There are options for retrofitting a center fin to any board.<br><br>Wings: the 5m single-wing quiver is a meme. Especially as a beginner you&#039;ll want to be out in light air, and 5m won&#039;t cut it. 6.5m is the sweet spot imo but ymmv. It&#039;s worth keeping in mind that wings are a little bit disposable - they wear out eventually and a lot of novices seem to put a foil blade through their canopy at least once. Rather than getting the hottest wing out there I would suggest starting with whatever is on sale; slingshot wings are popular with my locals and often seem to be priced reasonably. If you are shelling out for the latest and greatest, the strike cwc is the best wing that I have personally handled. I&#039;ve been less impressed with duotone.", "time": 1672817665, "resto": 2520069}, {"no": 2521116, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)20:06:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2520147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2520147</a><br>Thanks anon.

Its desire to remain racially pure is a proof of the vitality and good health of a race. Pride in one&#039;s own race\u2014and that does not imply contempt for other races\u2014is also a normal and healthy sentiment.

They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilisation to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them.

I am aiming typically for 3000kcal+ in a typical hiking day In that regard I do:<br>Breakfast: Mix of complex carbs and fat. A little protein is desirable. Cold soak oats with powder milk, peanut butter and breakfast bars, granola, dried fruit are my usual go-tos as I don&#039;t like to make anything more than coffee in the morning, would rather pack up and be ready to move sooner or eat on the trail.<br>Lunch: Same as above, although I don&#039;t always eat big. Its a little easier to snack during the hike and keep energy up rather than eat a big meal and try to walk. Again, mostly no cook options. Peanut butter, dried fruit, hard cheese, meat. If the weather is cool your options expand.<br>Dinner: I prefer to boil water, pour it into my cookpot and be ready in 10-15min. Cooking on pocket stoves mostly sucks as much as I&#039;ve tried. I try to limit it to heating water, oil, and maybe meat before it goes into something else. It&#039;s usually more sausage or other meat added to knorr sides, instant mashed potatoes, brown rice mixed with dehydrated veggies. I try to get the bulk of my protein in and mostly just stay up on calorie intake. I carry a container of olive oil for calories and to keep pasta/potatoes from being congealed messes. I do try to bring some spices to change stuff up. Spam singles do well. I don&#039;t like to bring a lot of canned stuff but for shorter duration trips I do like canned fish since you get protein, often some kind of oil base, and a sauce or spices all in one.<br><br>As far as a cooking if you want to deal with it there&#039;s almost nothing you can&#039;t do in the woods. If it&#039;s one pot at home it&#039;s one pot in the woods, just limited to what you feel like doing. Don&#039;t be afraid to pre-cut or mix stuff and get creative with repackaging.

Years ago there was a big debate in r/Ultralight about the weight of an alcohol stove vs a BRS 3000. <br><br>Someone made a spreadsheet showing fuel consumption over 7 days, working from the required amount for that time period down to zero. For instance if an alcohol stove requires .5oz per day, the data started at 3.5oz on day 1, 3oz on day 2, and so on, until day 7 (0oz). The spreadsheet showed the BRS being lighter beyond 2 days or so. To the r/Ultralight crowed, this was 100% conclusive evidence, and anyone pointing out flaws was simply downvoted or shouted out of the conversation.<br><br>Obviously the data was totally flawed. The guy who made it failed to include the weight of an empty isobutane cylinder (he did include a container for alcohol though). But the main issue is real world application. With alcohol, you really do measure how much you\u2019ll need over a given hike. But with a canister, no one is emptying out fuel to take only the required amount and ending at zero fuel for the end of the trip. <br><br>So this weird, theoretical nonsense was taken as holy scripture simply because everyone agreed that it was correct. And it was passed around for years as evidence or proof. It was really kind of bizarre, seeing as how anyone with half a brain could see that the data was skewed, but no one listening. <br><br>Tarptent was another huge circle jerk.

Fell off his horse, forgot his magazine one day and, of course, had about 3k in matching kuiu camo gear. Lol, faggot. Later someone told me to check out this post on rokslide, it was a &#039;rate my gear for this hunt&#039; type of thing. It was my hunter pretrip explaining how he bought all this nrw shit, everything was so specific and thought out, yet when it came time to go on the hunt he was an absolute nigger. I work back there 4 months out of the year, Aug-Nov, only way in is a two day ride by horse or backcountry airstrip. No roads, no mechanized advantages i.e. wheels, bearings, etc. Im not a richfag so i wear old pendelton dress pants that are lightweight wool, some shitty tshirt, sweaters and i have one decent puffy, plus rubber rain gear.

If you spend some time customizing the experience, you get the game tailored for you. 8.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Forest</span><br>Surviving is very basic. Construction is not very complex and enemy AI is bad. Good fun for the first 20 hours, but then it gets pretty stale as a survival game and turns into a monster fighting RPG. 6/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Project Zomboid</span><br>Artstyle and UI is very oldschool, but there is a deep and rich gameplay. On singleplayer, after you build your base the game basically ends. The fun is in multiplayer, but then it becomes a sort of grindy base battle royale(Rust/DayZ). Great game for urban survival. 9/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Green Hell</span><br>Probably the best survival game, but has a small non-procedural map(About 30hrs of gameplay). 9.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7 days to die</span><br>Another deep and rich gameplay, but the some skills makes it feels more &quot;gamey&quot; than a real survival. Blood moon hordes and radioactive zombies are too much fantasy for me. 8/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rain World</span><br>Not a human survival game, but a very good one. The wild monsters give insane fear goosebumps, and it actually feels like a real survival experience. 9.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Valheim</span><br>Way more of a Crafting RPG than a survival. Modded Minecraft is better. 7.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Long Dark</span><br>I refunded this game. Game feels extremely linear due to story mode and gameplay just feels unnecessary punishing, intead of just difficult. 2/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This War of Mine</span><br>Good game, but only played 3 times since base gameplay is not very replayable. DLCs are decent, but they are story driven instead of gameplay driven. 7.5/10<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dont Starve Together</span><br>Insane way of interpretating seasons. You start in summer collecting resources, prepared things during autumn, try to survive the cold winter with low food, then you have wet rainy spring. Then it is summer again, but this time with harsh desert-like sun and new wild creatures. Solid survival, but then it turns into an exploration RPG. 9/10", "time": 1673682294, "resto": 2499608}, {"no": 2524817, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)03:38:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524806</a><br>No one who likes the long dark does it because of story mode, that one&#039;s only there to draw normalfags", "time": 1673685513, "resto": 2499608}, {"no": 2524826, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:00:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2499608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2499608</a><br>Whenever I play games now, I focus on taking screenshots of scenery just like I do irl.

His work, and that of fellow USGS scientists, convinced authorities to close Mount St. Helens to the public before the 1980 eruption. They maintained the closure despite heavy pressure to re-open the area; their work saved thousands of lives.&quot;<br><br>Pic: &quot;The last picture ever taken of Johnston, 13 hours before his death at the eruption site.&quot; He looks like an angel.

I can&#039;t tell you if its &quot;worth it&quot; since our values are different. <br><br>I&#039;ve worked as a core logging geologist for a mid level active mining company in North Ontario. Pay was really good, started at about $70k CAD. Benefits as well. Worked 7-3 M-F and lived 10 minutes from where I worked, so work life balance was fine. The culture was very corporate with an HR department. Hard to advance but secure once you do. The work was super boring though which is why I left. <br><br>Currently I&#039;m working as a field geologist for a junior exploration company. Pay is a bit less. No benefits. On contract for $400/day as a junior geologist, senior can get $600. Typically schedule is 20 days on 10 off during the season. Days usually end up being about 10 hours. Really sucks, can&#039;t keep a schedule, or play sports or take lessons or have climbing partners when you are gone 2/3rds of the time. Difficult on relationships. The work is hard but fun. Hard days are shitty but the nice days are amazing. Flying around in a helicopter almost everyday, but it gets old quickly and how safe you feel really depends on the pilot you get. Being in a junior company things are a lot more relaxed and also more wild. When shit needs to get done you do it, no filing or chain of command or delegating. Everyone is really in it together, success feels shared between everyone in the company. Have to do a lot more than geology work though. Making helipads, tearing down camps, moving equipment, making berms with bobcats, etc. Pretty much outside every day, you get a lot of outdoors experience condensed into a short time, saw a lot of bald eagles, black bears, grizzly, moose. In Nevada I saw prong horns and a black tailed jackrabbit. <br><br>There are tons of roles, and the roles are different depending on the type of company you work for. Exploration is different than mining, and both are different than academia<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;acicular pyrite</span>", "filename": "20211103_143221", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672346203239390, "time": 1672346203, "md5": "SYvWMf+4Ttjea3WTwxhnQA==", "fsize": 3589617, "resto": 2516412}, {"no": 2516950, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)17:34:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2516871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2516871</a><br>Also was almost bit by a rattlesnake twice in Nevada.

Anyway, I was hiking, desperately looking for flat ground in order to set it up and had luckily found a nice little clearing off the trail and past the treeline. By the time I had that gay tent up, it was dark so I went back to my bag to rummage for my headlamp. While I was in my bag, I started hearing this metallic banging noise, kind of like someone hitting a homerun with an aluminum bat. I was spooked because I am absolutely certain I was no where near any sort of private property. I kind of just shrugged it off as another camper set up not too far off, not usual but not impossible. Well the noise started getting closer and louder and the closer and louder it got, the more adrenaline that started to pump into my veins. Of course the noise was now in the immediate vicinity so I cut my headlamp on and aimed it towards the source. On both sides of the tree was the silhouette of a massive creature, extremely wide and tall. I fucking SHIT myself. I froze and couldnt breathe. The silhouette urked around the tree and into the light. It was a bloodied US Senator John Fetterman bashing his forehead into every tree he passed.

I walk a lot at night in the summer as its too hot for my Northern blood to still enough to sleep. I was walking through what I roughly worked out was its territory (more of that in a sec) and something big began to snarl and bark at me from uphill.

The feeling grew until it hit hard. I felt like I was being watched, hunted. The mist didnt help, but it was weird. Im not used to feeling like that, especially in such a local area. I kept going until I reached the bridge. I considered crossing and heading to the fishing pond to sit like I sometimes do, but I couldnt shake that prickling down my back and the fear, so I turned up the path I was on when I saw the beast, a week or so later, and headed on up and out of the park. The feeling died off as I passed the old building I was planning to explore for the challenge, and had all but faded by the time I reached the old visitor centre only a hundred or so metres further.

Along the back theres a river, and upstream a weir that ran into a pool on the far side of the canal bridge. We used to go bathing up there, and it was fine when you were with people, but it felt wrong, not in the naughty way but in the creepy &quot;something is not right here&quot; when alone. There could be people on the other side of the bridge and it would still feel off, but it really became scary when there was noone around. I did dismiss it initially as just nerves, maybe some ancestral fear of still bodies of water which were opaque, as primordial predators could lurk in them. Anyway at one point I found a kayak that had been washed down by the floods, and my class and I played about with it up there. Nothing really happened with other people, as I said, and we used to paddle around the pool (it wasnt deep, you could wade through it. 4 - 5 feet at the most I would say)<br>A couple of times I went up there on my own with the kayak. Now, we had all swam in the pool, and it was empty. There where NO underwater objects or protrusions. Shit, I waded through it. But when you were up there in the pool in the kayak, alone, you would hear noises, as though underwater twigs or fingernails were scraping on the hull. It was really creepy, and I used to get nervous about even paddling with my hands (we didnt have a paddle).<br>To one side - the lower in the picture - there is a cut away in the concrete basin for some vents or drains of some kind, and that always made me really nervous, even a little fearful. I pushed myself to wade to it once, and look at it, but I couldnt bring myself to step into it, even though it was relatively shallow compared to the rest of the pool.<br>If it was just me I might have dismissed it, but it wasnt.

Slept there for a month, even though i saw nobody around, the coughing, talking, footstep noises, were heard around every night, sometimes scarily close. Started construction job on the bridge that connects the island to the mainland, still slept in the forest, cooked on the fire, all nice. Soon cops came and said girl was found in the forest nearby, (close to where I slept) asked me few questions, have I seen teen girl with braces, etc., I got quite worried and moved on the opposite side of the river the same day and slept in a deep wet pit on a wooded slope, still felt more safe there away from crime scene, then the next day cops came again, checked docs, everything, brought some other creepy guys that looked like my former neighbours, cops were very rude to them, interrogated again, then on the next day my entire brigade was taken by bus to p.station, day off, we were all interrogated again, everyone was scared because they knew a common cops practice is to choose random guy and make him confess under pressure.

EVA is a foam that is very cheap to produce. External weather does not effect the material so it does a good job during shit weather. It is also going to make the lightest weight boot. You can find some for around 2 lbs to about 3 lbs of version that run with a different compound sole. Both TPR and EVA work best with a liner bootie/sock that you remove at the end of the day to dry out because you will generate condensation/sweat inside the boot. Some will even have a waffle pattern in the sole to collect water that will not transpire through the insole to your foot. A lot of these liners I end up removing and use a felt one from Steger mukluks instead as I try to avoid the all synthetic variants. I can use the felt liner during fairly high temperatures.</span><br>Two cons of EVA:<br>Can puncture. I have a lot of blackberries and while they can poke holes through the material, something like a nail could break entirely through. This can be negated by getting a different sole under the EVA that Torvi/Nordman offers.<br>like crocs, leaving outside in the sun or throwing in the dryer will shrink the material.<br>Suffice, TPR and EVA are my two favorites as I can buy both for $40-$80 for a pair of boots that will last a few years for my conditions.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PU: shares similarities to EVA. Boot weight tends to be closer to 3 pounds. Also a foam. I have not seen as many companies use PU (polyurethane) boots with liners, so the design is often not wide enough to handle one thus I tend to use EVA.</span>", "filename": "1652671603136", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672178297082726, "time": 1672178297, "md5": "abI5wmO4IKtkYXRaD0yQoA==", "fsize": 2764131, "resto": 2515729}, {"no": 2515946, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)17:13:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2515932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2515932</a><br>cons of PU are that it is not as durable as a rubber/eva specifically for an outsole. I have PU outsole boots and never had an issue albeit I don&#039;t go around stepping on nails. Sievi also has a version with a steel plate under foot to stop something like that.<br>Also polyurethane needs to be used regularly or it will be subject to hydrolysis where it will break down if not used once a week to once a month. I see so many people that buy PU boots for that 3 times a year it drizzles outside only to find the foam crumbling because they haven&#039;t worn it in 12 months to years.<br>PU also costs around $100. While I prefer polyurethane for leather boot soles/midsoles, EVA is better implemented for boots from what I have seen.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neoprene lined boots.</span><br>Not my favorite, but seems to be the most popular. First area where things can get expensive going into $150+ dollars. The neoprene generally isn&#039;t removable and generally a part of the boot&#039;s exterior; therefore, the first part of the boot you see torn time and time again is the neoprene at the calf. One thing these boots do better than others is: 1) give an all in one solution (insulation, durable sole, grip, cushion) and 2) give a little more support around the ankle since most rubber boots give zero. It isn&#039;t a ton, but more noticeable in my experience. With some rubber boots it feels like you need to visit krogers and buy ankle braces to have any leg support which some rubber boots are wide enough to allow many layers of liners, socks, braces, insoles, etc..<br>I see a lot of quality control issues with rubber splitting.

They weigh a ton (5 lbs) and are slippery, but are cheap and can last a very long time. A fairly easy solution to have since they combine some features of a rubber boot (waterproof) with lacing. Still a clunker. But something you can have lying around the door to slide on that will last for many many years.<br>Like I said though. People want this all in one solution for wet/cold and think they will find it in their leather boots with the same lacing, svelte looks, and ankle brace support of their leather combat boots, but I have yet to see many companies execute a good design.<br>There are shell boots like Lundhags Forest or Norwegian M77 that is one layer that dries fast. You can buy a liner from Steger and shove it in, but that is where a lot of problems are created because the boot is typically not designed for this level of customization. With an insole you typically go up 1/2-1 whole size. With a liner or 2 socks you are typically looking at 1-2 whole sizes up, and more like 2. At that point the boot tends to be too loose for its extremely high weight that it&#039;s a dumpster fire. To fix it, you have to tie the boot to such an extreme too that you end up cutting off circulation to your foot and have cold feet regardless. Added most outsole materials for these leather boots will reflect the temperature of their environment reflecting the cold radiation to your foot.<br>EVA is not this way. You would probably know if you have crocs since they run extremely warm hence needing all the ventilation.<br>I currently use Sievi for my all purpose just because scandinavian footwear tends to use a wider foot (their XL models). Their soft solid is still about 2.5 pounds. It uses a side zipper so I can slide by foot in if i&#039;m just taking a piss and it is loose enough to use a liner (size 43 using size 45 european).

Weigh&#039;s more, and retains cushion for far longer than eva but is prone to hydrolysis where it will break down accelerated by disuse. Still seen polyurethane boots last up to 10 years.

They get wet and stay wet, and take days to dry out. Same issue with goretex. With goretex, i&#039;ve seen the leather prematurely begin to rot because the &quot;breathable&quot; membrane isn&#039;t fast enough for water to go anywhere<br>3) nonremovable. Reason mentioned above with staying wet and taking much longer to dry overnight. But also because of that, the boot tends to only be good during winter or one time of year because it wasn&#039;t designed for a customizable fit like a shell boot would. Therefore it sits around for 9 months of the year waiting for hunting season or what have you.

It&#039;s luxury hardwearing wool is something akin to what they call it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what does it mean?</span><br>Luxury means it&#039;s some of the softest wool. How do you evaluate &#039;soft&#039; wool?<br>1) Virgin wool. Why? Because virgin wool is a longer strand of hair meaning it is less likely to poke you. Recycled wool uses shorter &#039;recycled&#039; hair lengths.<br>2) Microns. This translates to the circumference of the sheep hair. Merino is the thinnest wool hair at like 18ish microns. Rambouillet is a merino hybrid. They mixed the softest hair (merino) with the longest hair sheep (can&#039;t recall the name). It is like 19 or 20 microns, so not much different to merino. I believe rambouillet also grows a little easier in USA, whereas merino grows better in Australia/New Zealand but that could be BS; however, rambouillet is more of an american sheep.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conclusions</span><br>So, is it some of the softest you will find? Yes!<br>Is it the most durable for what it is? Absolutely!<br>Is it the most durable on Earth? Probably not considering there is sheep hair wool that is about twice as dense.<br>So you are buying hardcore luxury, and that is the tradeoff<br>However, I will say this - the wool industry is not what it used to be. It has had significant decline since at least the 1970s, if not earlier. Ralph has gone through the effort to make the best for that wool at weatherwool. 0 compromises. For the other sheep breeds out there, I cannot say there is a wool product that is made the best it can be for what it is. Filson no longer uses the quote, &quot;might as well have the best&quot;, albeit their plaid wool is still good.

And eating grass doesn&#039;t really help, we can&#039;t get much nutrients from it.<br><br>If you&#039;re really well off and concerned about this type of thing, focus on material preparations. Buy beans, rice and dry pasta and seal them in airtight food-grade 5 gallon buckets with something to remove the oxygen and moisture--ideally silica gel packets but hand warmers work if you don&#039;t have those. Food stored that way will keep for many years. Also, get vacuum packed heirloom seeds, and pick up some gardening skills.<br><br>I&#039;m curious by the way, what do you mean chinese feudalism?

Just set an hour everyday shooting at targets, with no danger of hitting property or any living things. Eventually you can work on angles to get big ranges. Learn to shoot off center so shots do not ricochet back to you. Some shooters can throw a can in the air and juggle it with a few shots.<br>Steel bearings are your best ammo. Hex nuts are a fine alternative but tend to curve midair. Small stones are fine for target practice. Do not underestimate the lethality of slingshots, especially with heavy bands.<br>Pana darts are interesting for small game hunting. There\u2019s also specialized slingshots to fire arrows. These offer several disadvantages over bows that I frankly wouldn\u2019t want in the woods but the portability is hard to knock.<br>Finally for self defense I\u2019ve seen pepper balls, these are intended for paintball guns and deliver two sources of pain compliance.
