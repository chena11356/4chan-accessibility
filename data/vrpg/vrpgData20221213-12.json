How can a magician cast a higher level spell when they don&#039;t even know a much more basic spell? This can also be seen in different schools of magic. Once you reach the level requirement, you can choose advanced illusion spells like Weird even if the only spells you have are evocation spells. It doesn&#039;t make any sense. It gets even stupider when you characters can learn spells like Greater Dispel Magic despite not learning the much more basic Dispel Magic. <br><br>What is the best magic system in fantasy rpgs?", "filename": "1666454811262743", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669458591441406, "time": 1669458591, "md5": "vey4Qi89ibRdTbP6ou0HgQ==", "fsize": 157867, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dnd-based-magic-systems-are-retarded-and-have", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 362, "images": 52, "omitted_posts": 357, "omitted_images": 51, "last_replies": [{"no": 2884962, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)18:58:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2884951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2884951</a><br>Nah you&#039;re clearly retarded and delusional.", "time": 1670889534, "resto": 2862871}, {"no": 2884964, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)18:59:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2884962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2884962</a><br>Calm down, anon, let&#039;s keep this civil. lest I sic my pet dragon on ye.", "time": 1670889594, "resto": 2862871}, {"no": 2885126, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)22:11:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2884609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2884609</a><br>It&#039;s dumber than that.<br>It&#039;s because <s>interracial.

In 2D you can literally exit most towns from the center in 5 seconds. In 3D you may be on the 4th floor of a building or castle with no balconies and it feels like busywork to treck down several floors just to exit so you can warp. If you had to revisit a long cave to find some treasure you missed or enemies to add to bestiary, it may take 30 secs to exit 2D dungeons but 5 to 10 mins in 3D. This is also the reason for in dungeon healing spots, as in 2D games you were always 20 secs or less, in walking time, away from a town when you left a dungeon.<br><br>I don&#039;t know why you want to make it harder to level up by requiring more exp or making metal enemies harder to find/kill.
