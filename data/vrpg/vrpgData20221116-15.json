Apparently CERO has gotten stricter. They also added content but it all seems unnecessary to me and seems to throw game balance off. Though maybe kinda neat if you&#039;re replaying the game instead of playing it for the first time.<br><br>I like the ps1 version more because I think the 3DS version streamlines too much. The first hours of DQ7 were famous for not having battles - you just walked around and talked to people on the starting island and solved puzzles. This was cut down to be shorter on 3DS. I like the original intro, but if that was the only thing they changed I could live with it. But I don&#039;t like the mechanical changes either. They reworked the job system to be simpler. Previously, you could learn hybrid skills by leveling one class, then another. But since there wasn&#039;t much of an indication of what lead to what, people would miss out on certain skills that were very useful. Instead now each job has it&#039;s own discrete set of skills, with certain jobs getting more skills than they did before. The job switching feels kinda pointless, with you relearning skills and spells you learned before.<br>You get a map for each dungeon automatically in the 3DS version when there was no map at all for the previous game. The dungeon floor plans aren&#039;t complex so if you do this and remove random battles (which they did on 3DS), there&#039;s no tension or challenge in a dungeon at all. The on-field encounters sometimes end up being unavoidable too, which somehow feels cheaper to me than random battles. <br><br>They also removed puzzles from multiple dungeons, not just the opening. They made it easier to find fragments, which is understandable, but overall the game just feels dumbed down.<br><br>The localization is much clearer now and the graphics are very nice though.

How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game? I didn&#039;t understand this until I properly played Daggerfall and gave it a chance rather than dismissing it as procedurally generated garbage like I had done before. For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has.

You can look up the &quot;experience curve&quot; for most games, or just plot out the experience points needed per level. The steeper it is, the longer you stay at that level assuming the experience gain is the same. If it&#039;s not, you want to then calculate something like XP per level over the amount of average XP gained from a battle/quest/item at that level. This curve helps you visualize how the game will &quot;flow&quot;.<br><br>If your curve steeply increases, then the progression will feel like it slows down a lot. If the curve steeply decreases, then the game will feel like it gets way easier to progress as time goes on. If it&#039;s flat, then the progress will feel like it is relatively static the whole game.<br><br>In my experience, the best &quot;progression&quot; is time-based, so take the previous curve I mentioned and then ask &quot;how much time on average does the player spend on each level?&quot; If you aren&#039;t seeing tangible progress every average play-session, then the game probably feels really slow. So usually, I&#039;d suggest making sure the player makes minor progress every ten minutes, and maybe makes &quot;major&quot; progress every half hour to an hour. Minor progress might be a level-up, getting a new piece of equipment, or simply reaching a new floor in a dungeon. Major progress might be getting a new major ability, completing a quest and getting multiple rewards, or finishing a dungeon.<br><br>You can always break away from the above, but it should be done so intentionally.
