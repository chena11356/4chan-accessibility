The difference is that fascism and nazism (that is more incoherent form of fascism really) are synthesis of liberal capitalism and socialist tenets.

In fascism capital, unions and the state work together through corporativist principles in service of the nation&#039;s future. So yes, they have the same roots. But no, fascism is opposed to socialism just as it is opposed to naked laizzes faire liberalism. Hence it being the third position in 20th century politics.

If you&#039;re on POTD, don&#039;t. It&#039;s not worth it for a first-timer. Here are a few low micro companions:<br><br>Eder - don&#039;t bother building him like a tank. Fighters are naturally tanky and are more useful if you build them towards damage. Give him two sabers, plate armor, and let him go to work. There is an armor called Sanguine Plate which you get from a quest in the Vailian Embassy - it is very useful for dual wielding characters. At level 13 he gets Charge which is terrific, but does require you to micro it to use it effectively.<br><br>Kana - Build him like a tank. Hatchet and shield for deflection bonuses, plate armor. Early game have him chant Soft Winds of Death constantly for minor AoE damage. At level 9 he can learn the Dragon Thrashed, Dragon Wailed chant. This is one of the best abilities in the game and you will have a massive power increase for Kana. Chant this and nothing else for the rest of the game (except for a certain dragon).<br><br>Sagani - having Itumaak means having another body, which is useful. Early game focus on pet abilities - I think they&#039;re called Resilient Companion and Vicious Companion. After that build her damage and keep her in the back.<br><br>Pallegina - Paladins get an ability at level 13 called Sacred Immolation. It rules. However, level 13 is pretty down the line. Paladins have useful passive bonuses but aren&#039;t really damage dealers until then. When you do get Sacred Immolation, the only micro you will have to do is activate it a the beginning of combat.<br><br>Zahua - You won&#039;t get this guy until you go White March, but you can go to WM fairly early. Plate armor, give him the Torment&#039;s Reach ability and no other abilities. Turn on his AI ability usage and he&#039;ll just spam this as long as he&#039;s gaining wounds.

I didn&#039;t get the true ending since I missed the dragon event and ignored using some of the other characters. Totori was similar and while I did look up ending requirements toward the end, I messed up by not using gino and marc for too long and didn&#039;t have time to get their events. Meruru was even easier, but that game forces ng+ anyways so you really have all the time you could ever need. Though thinking about how the game is set up, I do recall that it has stuff like building that take 30 days to construct and the main tasks that give you the next one a certain number of days after the previous one is complete, so while generous the time limit does stop you from sleeping months away for that kind of stuff.<br>All of that said, I do think the main thing the time limits bring to the game is that it made the devs make more time specific events, even if there aren&#039;t that many. Stuff like the end of year festival in rorona, the beach trip in rorona, or ayesha&#039;s contest.
