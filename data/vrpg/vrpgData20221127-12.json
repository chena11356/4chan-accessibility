I don&#039;t agree with that anon who says Grimrock is so good nobody is interested in making those games anymore. I think Grimrock did a much better job marketing itself though.<br>Pic related is definitely not perfect and it took some getting used to. The story you experience change a bit based on your actions. For example, recruiting the character that appears in the second slot here makes you miss one location but he&#039;s easily the most overpowered character you can recruit and it comes naturally to do so unlike some other characters. Some of his unique skills include dealing damage through armor, CHARMING an enemy and rendering your party invisible.I think he even got a heal (but can&#039;t wear armor or carry items. He is almost naked and that means no bags)<br>Other games I can think about that nobody&#039;s mentioned are the 7th Circle games (The 7th Circle - Eternal Nightmare and Inferno - Beyond the 7th Circle). I&#039;ve only played the first one so I can&#039;t talk about the other one.<br>It&#039;s basically a 1st person game. Combat is turn-based but depending on something you or the enemy might take more than one turn in a row. Reading the manual is rather essential. The game itself is a roguelite. Your characters are expected to die while acquiring resources that will empower your next characters. It has a weird story but I couldn&#039;t get past a glaring issue it has:Loading screens between EVERYTHING (combat, accessing menus, saving, loading, etc). Maybe it&#039;s poorly optimized or assets are just badly compressed.

Even on Insanity the Mass Effect games arent unreasonable, and the game forces you to bring Dr.Solus, a God Tier (with Tempast and Level 4 Incinerate) squadmate, who also coincidentally absolutely fucking eats Krogan and Vorcha for breakfast in combat... I wish I could have gunned down hundreds of those primitive Tuchanka niggers in that mission, Krogan are especially satisfying to kill since they have lifespans more than twice as long as Asari, and Tuchanka has a lore reputation for being the absolute most brutal planet in the known Milky Way Galaxy, no? So why are the 2 missions there like the easiest missions in ME2, shouldn&#039;t they be the like the 2 hardest missions given the planets lore reputation?<br><br>Tldr=Why the hell did Shepard say he killed 12 Krogan outside the hospital? Because I&#039;m pretty sure Shepard only killed 2 or 3 Krogan outside the hospital.

It gets even stupider when you characters can learn spells like Greater Dispel Magic despite not learning the much more basic Dispel Magic. <br><br>What is the best magic system in fantasy rpgs?", "filename": "1666454811262743", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669458591441406, "time": 1669458591, "md5": "vey4Qi89ibRdTbP6ou0HgQ==", "fsize": 157867, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dnd-based-magic-systems-are-retarded-and-have", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 90, "images": 15, "omitted_posts": 85, "omitted_images": 14, "last_replies": [{"no": 2864016, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)00:42:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2863998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2863998</a><br>You&#039;re retarded because I didn&#039;t imply that at all, considering I was responding to the quoted parts.<br>See also <a href=\"#p2863367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2863367</a> and <a href=\"#p2863428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2863428</a>", "time": 1669527777, "resto": 2862871}, {"no": 2864017, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)00:43:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2862947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2862947</a><br>Didn&#039;t know Ynorka did nude drawings", "time": 1669527780, "resto": 2862871}, {"no": 2864028, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)00:53:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2864016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2864016</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;goes on a long tard exposition about video games being &#039;do or die&#039; </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not realizing tabletops are exactly this </span><br>Party death is party death you fucking retard.", "time": 1669528419, "resto": 2862871}, {"no": 2864032, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)00:58:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2864028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2864028</a><br>retards that have never played a rpg have it in their head that dnd is some kind of hippie drum circle where everyone just vibes over a dungeon crawl. when i first played dnd in high school there were chucklefucks that thought it was exactly this and the DM ruthlessly killed them", "time": 1669528714, "resto": 2862871}, {"no": 2864091, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)02:23:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2863429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2863429</a><br>my god, I have never seen something this accurately describing tabletop", "filename": "uGG55Sw", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 533, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1669533781944782, "time": 1669533781, "md5": "nAAx5swi1jRZ96GjuTmJTw==", "fsize": 24594, "resto": 2862871}], "last_modified": 1669533781}]}, {"page": 7, "threads": [{"no": 2862962, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)06:53:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Tamriel...<br>Home...", "filename": "Tamriel_Map", "ext": ".png", "w": 1329, "h": 960, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 180, "tim": 1669463621730658, "time": 1669463621, "md5": "+5RD1uC07Ivs9Iojbo16Sg==", "fsize": 3052015, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "tamriel", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 11, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 2863640, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)19:21:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2863635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2863635</a><br>He&#039;s a bit busy...", "time": 1669508503, "resto": 2862962}, {"no": 2863715, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)20:42:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Imagine not acknowledging that Bethesda will never make another game worth playing for as long as they continue to exist.", "time": 1669513368, "resto": 2862962}, {"no": 2863741, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)21:03:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2862962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2862962</a><br>nice faggot version post-mw tamriel map. you wearing a skirt or something", "time": 1669514603, "resto": 2862962}, {"no": 2863793, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)21:44:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2863163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2863163</a><br>god I wish<br>instead you&#039;ll have autists arguing for 20 years as they post shitty screenshots about how well their project of porting skyrim is going<br>the only conversion mod like that which got made was Morroblivion", "time": 1669517043, "resto": 2862962}, {"no": 2864045, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)01:20:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2862969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2862969</a><br>TES VI will be a Chinese mobile game.", "time": 1669530057, "resto": 2862962}], "last_modified": 1669530057}, {"no": 2863077, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)09:30:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;have one of the most powerful and flexible AI frameworks in the industry</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;use for stupid shit like having NPCs eat food instead of enemy AI and encounter design</span><br><br>Seriously, this https://youtu.be/RiyKPkk-oeI?t=220 is what can be done on Skyrim&#039;s engine with JUST the Creation Kit.

It was awesome seeing FF7 cutscenes because the characters looked detailed and proportional. The cutscenes showed you a representation of what the characters you have been playing actually look like. FFX cutscenes were good because they still looked better than the regular in-game models. Once you get to PS3 and beyond where graphics have improved to the point where all the cutscenes practically look very similar to the in-game graphics, the cutscenes start to feel more intrusive.<br><br>Even with current gen games I am playing for the first time I find myself just waiting for the cutscenes to be over so I can get control of my character again. I tried Chrono Cross for the first time this past year and loved every cutscene, so it isn&#039;t that I grew out cutscenes. It&#039;s just that they are more spectacular on the older games because of the contrast with the dated graphics.<br><br>As for you wanting them to reach a decent middle ground, something will always need to be sacrificed. In the case of Ys VIII, better animations and cutscenes would probably have come at the cost of a shorter game, less moves, smaller world, etc. If the budget for the game was $5 million, with $1 million on graphics and $4 million on gameplay and coding, to get what you want they would have had to allocate $3 million to graphics and $2 million to gameplay and coding.

For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in.
