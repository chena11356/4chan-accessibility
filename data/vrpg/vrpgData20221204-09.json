For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in.

The difference is that fascism and nazism (that is more incoherent form of fascism really) are synthesis of liberal capitalism and socialist tenets. Instead of doing away with private ownership of capital like socialism, fascism tries to eliminate class conflict through meditation between labour and capital with the state being the middleman. In fascism capital, unions and the state work together through corporativist principles in service of the nation&#039;s future. So yes, they have the same roots. But no, fascism is opposed to socialism just as it is opposed to naked laizzes faire liberalism. Hence it being the third position in 20th century politics. You can always spot the retard who doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s talking about when he claims that fascism equals socialism or communism or he claims that fascism is just the end point of liberal capitalism like commies are wont to do.
