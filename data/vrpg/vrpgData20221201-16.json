The combat and character building are both above average by JRPG standards.<br><br>Asylum - A side game to the Sequel series, this one is lighter on dialogue and heavier on gameplay. Very open exploration. Also an H game though the H scenes are 100% optional.<br><br>JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: The 7th Stand User - A retelling of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders where you play as an OC who joins Jotaro et al. on their quest to defeat Dio. There are a ton of different ways events can play out depending on your character&#039;s personality, abilities, and choices. This has a ridiculous amount of postgame and NG+ content, including hidden boss battles against the villains of several other JoJo parts. Some of its weaker points include a shallow combat system and somewhat grindy design.<br><br>Fumika Fantasy - Semi-open world H JRPG focused on powerleveling. Unique combat system focused on resource management where many of your abilities don&#039;t use up your turn. NPCs are surprisingly reactive and there are a ton of hidden scenes and alternate outcomes to events, though most of that just leads to hidden hentai scenes with only a minority of those events having gameplay relevance. It has extensive NG+ features, but the real challenge comes from trying to beat the final boss on your first try without using NG+.<br><br>Touhou Wandering Souls - A collectathon/brawler/platformer. I have no idea why RPG Maker was used for this, but it&#039;s very long, good, and challenging. Lunatic difficulty is recommended for those who can handle it.<br><br>Takamakuran games - Namely MY]R, A New Game, and The Mercenary&#039;s Adventure.

If you just like numbers go up, there are a lot of incremental games out there.<br><br>Grinding as a word has bad reputation, but people generally still grind because base gameplay loop is good enough or just enjoyable, and reward for effort you put into figuring out the mechanics and making it work, getting all set up and making stuff the way you want - is all the sweeter after putting some grinding in.<br><br>Now you can get anything with simple repeating autobattle. Why play the game at all then? If &quot;number go up&quot; became entire goal while discrediting anything else, I&#039;ll find about same amount of enjoyment in any mobile dopamine game out there.

Take Morrowind for example, the world is empty, the game has nothing to do beyond walking and clicking continue on each wall of text. Yet i&#039;ve seen people tell me they made entire elaborated stories that they put into play through their minds and that&#039;s the reason Morrowind is such a good RPG<br><br>Like... what? The dude tellls me &quot;I made up this backstory for my Khajiit that his mother was killed by an orc so he hates orcs and now he kills all orcs on sight&quot; and i&#039;m like... dude you can&#039;t roleplay that in game, the game doesn&#039;t give you the tools, but no, he insisted &quot;dude i can approach an orc and kill it completly validating my headcanon&quot;. But that is BEYOND STUPID.<br><br>There are games that actually give you dialogue options to expand your backstory, Skyrim itself has several talks about your parents with Serana. But none of that is in Morrowind, so... why? Why would anyone go through the effort of making headcanons they can&#039;t actually play in RPGs that don&#039;t give them the tools to exercise said roleplaying?", "filename": "1636271563533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1669849721357126, "time": 1669849721, "md5": "eTs5wpPmyucWG/Qmvt/7Dg==", "fsize": 651076, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "do-people-actually-play-imagination-time-in-rpgs", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 20, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 15, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 2869185, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)22:14:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2868952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2868952</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you experience imagination in any capacity you must immediately stop what you&#039;re doing and turn it into something &quot;productive&quot;
