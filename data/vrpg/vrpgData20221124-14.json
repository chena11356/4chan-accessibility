Throw Dusk and Dawn into the mix and my team is basically walking ebola. The soundtrack is a solid 9/10, it&#039;s full metal and doesn&#039;t try to hide it. Many monster abilities are references to metal bands or songs that have inspired the soundtrack. (the stage Where Dead Ships Dwell is a reference to the In Flames album by the same name for example, the death goddess&#039;s ability is literally &quot;Avenged Sevenfold&quot; ect..) but some songs get very repetitive 200 floors in. Which I forgot to mention, the game has near infinite scaling. <br><br>Flaws with the game is some tactics or specs are a bit undettuned. Buffs and anything to do with buffs, is going to under-perform due to the amount of buff corruption and stripping late game. The lead dev cleared played SMT, and took measures to prevent buff abuse. Grovetender, while my favorite class, is slow, and centered around one creature who is very vulnerable on turn 0 and turn 1. <br><br>What is the game now? 10$?

Seriously, why do encumbrance mechanics even still exist? They can&#039;t be for realism because they&#039;re usually generous enough to let you carry way more than you ever could in reality, and they aren&#039;t there as a strategic constraint on the amount of resources you can carry because consumables are typically light and make up maybe 20% of the total weight at most. I like inventory limits in survival horror and some other genres but in any RPG where looting is a major component of the gameplay they need to go, unless maybe the game is really trying hard to be at least somewhat realistic.", "filename": "0003F5BE-B837-1316-B81A0C01AC1BF814", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 615, "h": 409, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1669036016123345, "time": 1669036016, "md5": "+7Nas6ODpslV1HRLuM30jQ==", "fsize": 48373, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "looting-in-warpigs", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 18, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 13, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 2859686, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)19:07:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2856695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2856695</a><br>Good.", "time": 1669248466, "resto": 2856695}, {"no": 2859909, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)22:40:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "BEHOLD, the solution to weight management in fantasy RPGs", "filename": "Prairie_schooner_(PSF)", "ext": ".png", "w": 3400, "h": 1520, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 55, "tim": 1669261211440752, "time": 1669261211, "md5": "HtKr/lM5ztV/W3d1EUn+wQ==", "fsize": 731030, "resto": 2856695, "spoiler": 1}, {"no": 2859919, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)23:02:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2856695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2856695</a><br>i guess dragon dogma is warpig now", "time": 1669262538, "resto": 2856695}, {"no": 2860032, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)01:52:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2859909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2859909</a>", "filename": "river crossing", "ext": ".gif", "w": 480, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1669272767993512, "time": 1669272767, "md5": "QYn1Jrja6c+VzNvMf6xrlw==", "fsize": 34038, "resto": 2856695, "spoiler": 1}, {"no": 2860048, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)02:22:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2856704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2856704</a><br>bullshit in crpg you fight a team of enemy adventurers or a full boss fight and they literally just have a full set of generic +x gear with one unique item like they&#039;re absolutely fucking destitute at level 15 somehow", "time": 1669274557, "resto": 2856695}], "last_modified": 1669274557}]}, {"page": 7, "threads": [{"no": 2852451, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)19:18:15", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Which tales of game should I buy?

STALKER is a weird case because it&#039;s limited by weight but displays things on a grid with infinite spaces. i never liked that because you still carry a lot of different items like artifacts, ammo types, and every duplicate weapon still appears in a new space instead of ak-74 (x3) or something. so all that combined with items having images and everything being in one category means your inventory can be so visually cluttered you have to scroll way down to find something even if you&#039;re way under the weight limit. i don&#039;t hate it, it&#039;s just a little weird. it probably comes down to the complexity of the game. like i was saying, lists can do small objects and an infinite variety of things but for an action game the grid being simpler and faster to look through is better.", "filename": "inventory", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668901114491947, "time": 1668901114, "md5": "KhpYq1KWY1NK+yoKyOZZFg==", "fsize": 1578160, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "grid-inventory-or-list-inventory", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 29, "images": 6, "omitted_posts": 24, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 2858255, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)16:26:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2857858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2857858</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when realistically it wouldn&#039;t be a factor</span><br>Have you never put things in your pockets or bags?", "time": 1669152373, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2858303, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)16:58:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2858252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2858252</a><br>it&#039;s actually a kilostone", "time": 1669154316, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2859495, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)16:28:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I prefer grid inventory simply because they are smaller.

Carth Onasi was always based, he was that guy you loved to hate sure, but he was based enough ton pilot the ship and shit. Kaiden declining the 3way is a glitch/plothole because Carth would not decline a fucking Bastilla or Missioon or especially a fucking Juuhani 3way with FemRevan!

And if not, how should I build my custom class? Redoran and the guild should be compatible, but am I going to be able to finish the Tong and Temple questlines in a satisfactory way? More concerned about the former than the latter; I know you can just show the guards the execution writs, and I&#039;ll definitely make use of that, but I wanna have a chance at assassinating at least some of the targets.

For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in.
