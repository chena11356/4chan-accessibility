How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game? I didn&#039;t understand this until I properly played Daggerfall and gave it a chance rather than dismissing it as procedurally generated garbage like I had done before. For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has.

The steeper it is, the longer you stay at that level assuming the experience gain is the same.
