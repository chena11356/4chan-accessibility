Why can&#039;t I buy the one yen bill from the bar owner for a reasonable price? Why can&#039;t I find a fake bill to give the collector?<br><br>And don&#039;t forget that Nocturne starts with an hour of cutscenes and story interactions while Deus Ex immediately hands the player control from the start of the game and never takes it away.

Too easy and just there to be in the way<br>- Only battles with any difficulty are forced solo battles which make the game even more barebones, and even those are scarce<br>- Feels like 1/3 of the &quot;bosses&quot; are forced losses where you randomly get one-shotted by volty<br>- Most of the 177 characters are unappealing peasants no one would ever want to play as, reducing the potential depth of the better ones (like Chrono Cross, but worse)<br>- To customize your party you have to do inane tasks wandering around town for the first 20 hours until you figure out how to get the one you want, if you even manage it. This is most of the game&#039;s &quot;gameplay&quot;<br>- The character you like may be level 5 when recruited 20 hours into the game, or be irredeemably bad in another way<br>- You can&#039;t even use the characters you like in most story battles or even any battles if you pick the wrong path, completely missing the point of having party customization<br>- Irredeemable bland dungeons with literal corridors that lead to nothing<br>- No escape rope or warp without running to a pig statue<br>- Stupid time system that meshes poorly with surprise story triggers<br>- Item limit with no storage except the jukebox<br><br>This doesn&#039;t even get into the story which is a dumpster fire in its own way. The only thing that&#039;s OK is the music, and even that has an asterisk, because it&#039;s never been more obvious that the programmer placed the music and not the composer.

You can look up the &quot;experience curve&quot; for most games, or just plot out the experience points needed per level. The steeper it is, the longer you stay at that level assuming the experience gain is the same. If it&#039;s not, you want to then calculate something like XP per level over the amount of average XP gained from a battle/quest/item at that level. This curve helps you visualize how the game will &quot;flow&quot;.<br><br>If your curve steeply increases, then the progression will feel like it slows down a lot.

So usually, I&#039;d suggest making sure the player makes minor progress every ten minutes, and maybe makes &quot;major&quot; progress every half hour to an hour.

You get a sense of scale and realism that no other RPG offers.<br><br>I remember Zaric saying that every region in Daggerfall felt unique to him. I thought this was nonsense. How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game? I didn&#039;t understand this until I properly played Daggerfall and gave it a chance rather than dismissing it as procedurally generated garbage like I had done before. For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has. A sense of immersion that you really are just an itinerant adventurer living in a fantasy world. Even though it&#039;s from 1996 it feels surprisingly modern in the amount of freedom it gives you.<br><br>Of course, the Unity version and shit ton of mods help a lot too.
