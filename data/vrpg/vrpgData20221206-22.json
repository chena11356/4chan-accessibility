You get a sense of scale and realism that no other RPG offers.<br><br>I remember Zaric saying that every region in Daggerfall felt unique to him. I thought this was nonsense. How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game? I didn&#039;t understand this until I properly played Daggerfall and gave it a chance rather than dismissing it as procedurally generated garbage like I had done before. For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has. A sense of immersion that you really are just an itinerant adventurer living in a fantasy world.

I need an objective that provides some strong motivation otherwise meaningless tasks like farming materials to upgrade shit become too repetitive and feel like a waste of time. For example sidequests on Dragon Age Inquisition or even Dragon`s Dogma are infinitely more meaningless than those on the Witcher 3 even though Dragon`s Dogma has arguably the superior gameplay. Or let`s take FF VII and VIIR. While combat is arguably more engaging on Remake the game itself is bastly inferior as it has the player using all those fantastic skills to complete meaningless tasks for nameless NPCs you just don`t care about. Furthermore those aren`t even sidequests, the player has to engage on those boring ass events until the story decides to progress on it`s own, which takes all agency away. Back in the day the player could choose to engage on these distractions but always had the option to perform the actions or advance to the locations that would push the story forward. Furthermore back in the day the game would engage the player from the go.

It makes sense that someone touched by darkness would lose their memory and sense of self. But it makes less sense that things transformed by darkness turn into something savage and aggressive. In theory you could apply the principle of darkness to zealots, racists, autistics, and erase what they think they know along with any reason to impose. This is where you have to do mental gymnastics to consider the principles of light: truth, understanding, and harmony. <br>So you can reason the forest wants to kill you because the corruption has removed &quot;harmony&quot;. For the sake of the game, we overlook the fact that everything is united against you. It&#039;s an illusion of harmony.

If you&#039;re on POTD, don&#039;t. It&#039;s not worth it for a first-timer. Here are a few low micro companions:<br><br>Eder - don&#039;t bother building him like a tank. Fighters are naturally tanky and are more useful if you build them towards damage. Give him two sabers, plate armor, and let him go to work. There is an armor called Sanguine Plate which you get from a quest in the Vailian Embassy - it is very useful for dual wielding characters. At level 13 he gets Charge which is terrific, but does require you to micro it to use it effectively.<br><br>Kana - Build him like a tank. Hatchet and shield for deflection bonuses, plate armor. Early game have him chant Soft Winds of Death constantly for minor AoE damage. At level 9 he can learn the Dragon Thrashed, Dragon Wailed chant. This is one of the best abilities in the game and you will have a massive power increase for Kana. Chant this and nothing else for the rest of the game (except for a certain dragon).<br><br>Sagani - having Itumaak means having another body, which is useful. Early game focus on pet abilities - I think they&#039;re called Resilient Companion and Vicious Companion. After that build her damage and keep her in the back.<br><br>Pallegina - Paladins get an ability at level 13 called Sacred Immolation. It rules. However, level 13 is pretty down the line. Paladins have useful passive bonuses but aren&#039;t really damage dealers until then. When you do get Sacred Immolation, the only micro you will have to do is activate it a the beginning of combat.<br><br>Zahua - You won&#039;t get this guy until you go White March, but you can go to WM fairly early. Plate armor, give him the Torment&#039;s Reach ability and no other abilities. Turn on his AI ability usage and he&#039;ll just spam this as long as he&#039;s gaining wounds.

I do have to say that the most powerful classes in the game are the ones who require the most micromanagement - but you can totally beat the game without them. I will say that Priests absolutely make the game easier - buffs such as Devotions of the Faithful are outstanding. Wizards are swiss army knives who become incredibly powerful at later levels - if you fill out Aloth&#039;s spell book he will be your most powerful party member. Druids are slightly lesser to Priest/Wizard, but have access to shapeshifting (awesome) and the line of Storm spells (also awesome). <br><br>The beginning of the game is the most difficult portion because you have little access to your best abilities.
