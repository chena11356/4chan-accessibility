After scouting out the area with our rogue in stealth it becomes apparent that there is quite a few enemies to deal with, so our wizard lays down grease and I position our fighter to intercept with AoO. Slimes drop down on our heads and assault the backline, but thanks to grease the fighter is able to double back and assist the cleric in peeling them off our wizard and bard, then handily returns to the hallway to cleave down the zombies. Pretty standard stuff so far.<br><br>Next we find a hidden room to the south thanks to our rogue&#039;s skills and are ambushed by ghouls. They jump us as soon as we enter the room so I have the cleric pop Turn Undead here, as we aren&#039;t properly positioned and getting paralyzed would be potentially devastating. This allows us to make quick work of the ghouls.

Back on the main floor we have a tiny room to the east, but we can&#039;t see inside because the door is closed. I have the cleric burst through the door as he is the tankiest and his movement is also the lowest, so he&#039;ll need all the help he can get to make use of the first turn while our enemies are flatflooted and deal with what&#039;s inside. We find an ogre. Ogres are quite dangerous at this point as their swings are virtually unavoidable and will kill us instantly, very bad news. First I bring in the wizard. He already used up his cast of grease and only has CC spells slotted that are far too weak to affect a brute of this size, so I position him in the corner to get a hit in with his sling. This is important to do first as ranged attacks recieve a -4 penalty if the target is engaged in melee. Next I position the rogue behind the ogre and get a sneak attack in, followed by the fighter and the cleric. The bard then finishes the turn by using fascinate, which the ogre immediately breaks, but this grants us a free turn. I move the bard all the way back up to the start of the turn order so he can go again immediately, this time casting grease and tripping the ogre. The rogue gets another sneak attack in, and our cleric and fighter get some good chunky hits in as well. The ogre gets up, but as he does all three of our melee get free attacks of opportunity in, finally putting him down for good and granting us enough experience to hit level 3 and ending this floor. This tiny floor in a beginner dungeon let us use all our party&#039;s unique abilities to navigate and survive it with some very simple but solid encounter design.<br><br>There really isn&#039;t a lot of RPGs that have this level of depth and interactivity. This is sort of what I wish the Pathfinder games were like as the tools to do this are there, but you&#039;re mostly just insta-gibbing stuff like its an IE game and other troika games certainly don&#039;t have good combat.

Apparently CERO has gotten stricter. They also added content but it all seems unnecessary to me and seems to throw game balance off. Though maybe kinda neat if you&#039;re replaying the game instead of playing it for the first time.<br><br>I like the ps1 version more because I think the 3DS version streamlines too much. The first hours of DQ7 were famous for not having battles - you just walked around and talked to people on the starting island and solved puzzles. This was cut down to be shorter on 3DS. I like the original intro, but if that was the only thing they changed I could live with it. But I don&#039;t like the mechanical changes either. They reworked the job system to be simpler. Previously, you could learn hybrid skills by leveling one class, then another. But since there wasn&#039;t much of an indication of what lead to what, people would miss out on certain skills that were very useful. Instead now each job has it&#039;s own discrete set of skills, with certain jobs getting more skills than they did before. The job switching feels kinda pointless, with you relearning skills and spells you learned before.<br>You get a map for each dungeon automatically in the 3DS version when there was no map at all for the previous game. The dungeon floor plans aren&#039;t complex so if you do this and remove random battles (which they did on 3DS), there&#039;s no tension or challenge in a dungeon at all. The on-field encounters sometimes end up being unavoidable too, which somehow feels cheaper to me than random battles. <br><br>They also removed puzzles from multiple dungeons, not just the opening. They made it easier to find fragments, which is understandable, but overall the game just feels dumbed down.<br><br>The localization is much clearer now and the graphics are very nice though.

You can look up the &quot;experience curve&quot; for most games, or just plot out the experience points needed per level. The steeper it is, the longer you stay at that level assuming the experience gain is the same. If it&#039;s not, you want to then calculate something like XP per level over the amount of average XP gained from a battle/quest/item at that level. This curve helps you visualize how the game will &quot;flow&quot;.<br><br>If your curve steeply increases, then the progression will feel like it slows down a lot. If the curve steeply decreases, then the game will feel like it gets way easier to progress as time goes on. If it&#039;s flat, then the progress will feel like it is relatively static the whole game.<br><br>In my experience, the best &quot;progression&quot; is time-based, so take the previous curve I mentioned and then ask &quot;how much time on average does the player spend on each level?&quot; If you aren&#039;t seeing tangible progress every average play-session, then the game probably feels really slow. So usually, I&#039;d suggest making sure the player makes minor progress every ten minutes, and maybe makes &quot;major&quot; progress every half hour to an hour.
