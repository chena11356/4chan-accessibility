When you get to Mars you are confronted by the Kingdom of Mars and are unable to communicate with them.<br>Some react with hostility, some with curiosity, and others with fear, but it can be hard to tell the difference because of the language barrier.<br>You can easily kill them with your umbrella because they are very weak of constitution compared to you, and you can make a beeline for their capital, kill their king, and proclaim yourself King of Mars. This can be done relatively easily, and by the end, Mars will be a colony of whatever nation you&#039;ve chosen as your origin.<br>The other main option is to figure out how to communicate with them which will eventually lead you into an existing narrative involving the kingdom&#039;s politics and domestic &amp; foreign issues.<br>More or less, one path is Robinson Crusoe and the other, Barsoom.<br>But the key bit is that the game wouldn&#039;t judge you for your choices. The morality of the game would be of the colonial era, and butchering a bunch of Martians would all be framed as a triumph of the human will in a new age of discovery.

I am now a ways in to Act 4. Revolution and just had to share again my pre-apoiler gueses, because I think I just solved the case in my head. For refrence, I just left the abbot&#039;s dinner table before predicting. <br><br>So, big reveal - Aedoc, after finding the burnt book, told me the key to all of this - a presance is watching Tassing, wanting to stop change. Thus, we get an implied motive. But... then comes the question: how did Baron threaten the present order? If anything, his death just destabilized the abbey and its not like his protestantism shit was that much of a threat. Well, we come back to my last post where I talked about the possible red herring - the book that could create a scandal... which just so happened to be stolen by Martin. Thus, I think this is what happened - baron gave out the slip that he was going to rock shit up with the book. The presance heard it, either by following us in the meadow or in the dining room - notes seemed to have all been left at night, thus I think the later is true (implicating someone with access to the abbey). Then, the presance used its collected knowladge to set up one of the suspects to kill the baron (so perhaps one of them did it after all?). Then, it ran towards the town via the aquaduct. <br><br>So, let&#039;s go to the current chapter. I feel that another red herring is coming - the peasant war. I think someone is about to get killed during 8PM. But who is threatening the way everything is? Well, one answer is either Otto or the Abbor for starting this conflict. But... knowing my Act I theory, I think its actually Otto for digging up the skull of Moritz. I think the skull, even if Otto only wants to use it to help peasants, would result in the shattering of whatever myth of the past Tassing has. Thus I think he will be killed, and the skull lost. Obviously, this would all break down as a theory if abbot dies, but I&#039;m taking the risk. <br><br>&lt;continued&gt;", "time": 1669395359, "resto": 2852805}, {"no": 2861986, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)12:10:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2861969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2861969</a><br>&lt;continued&gt;<br>As an asside, I think Volkbert gave a slip that Mathias could have been poisoned. Following this theory, I&#039;d guess because he knew about the scandalous book. <br><br>But anyway, I have a motive and a view of how the baron died, but who did it? Well, I have a theory as well. I suspect it could either be a) a random recluse monk/nun with a burnt face that manages to sneak around, or b) father Thomas using the celled sister as an attack dog. <br><br>Okay, so first of all, we know the presance crosses the field. Smokey said it, we saw it. We also heard from the millers son that a figure had come through the Roman ruin near the mill, I pressume its the dilapidated door looking thing. But... its on the city side, and the ghost ran away from the abbey. Thus it means that the presance had first emerged from, and then presumably returned to the Roman ruin that is on the town side. Now how is Thomas&#039;s church called? Yeah, the church of the lady of the labyrinth. Weird name, huh? I would guess the church would have a labyrinth beneath it. And what does the sister in the cell have? Her grave that she digs a bit every day. Note that we only see it from the side. Who knows what is inside? I would presume, perhaps a labyrinth entrance. One that could let her opperate undetected and ususpected. Meanwhile Thomas might be programing her with those &quot;visions&quot;. The only issue - that nun has a bad back, or at least Thomas said as much. <br><br>Well, that is my guess. Will see tomorrow.

A lot of suspension of disbelief. But if you allow yourself to be fooled, it is actually a very fun game.

You get a sense of scale and realism that no other RPG offers.<br><br>I remember Zaric saying that every region in Daggerfall felt unique to him. I thought this was nonsense. How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game? I didn&#039;t understand this until I properly played Daggerfall and gave it a chance rather than dismissing it as procedurally generated garbage like I had done before. For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has. A sense of immersion that you really are just an itinerant adventurer living in a fantasy world. Even though it&#039;s from 1996 it feels surprisingly modern in the amount of freedom it gives you.<br><br>Of course, the Unity version and shit ton of mods help a lot too.

I\u2019m a little bit shocked and saddened by the number of Riesz haters in the thread. Yes she wasn\u2019t my fav on the SFC, it was always Duran, Angela and Kevin for me. But I can confirm I have zero regrets about picking her over Kevin\u2019s melee abilities, and would do so again in a heartbeat. Her summon Hexas was just as powerful as Angel\u2019s best spell Ancient Curse (which is, again by far Angela\u2019s best spell and in a class of its own) and the debuff spells were extremely valuable in boss fights. I will stick to my lonely opinion that her character story is very good. Allow me to explain:<br><br>Riesz\u2019s story is simple, it could be explained in a brief sentence and the story will not sound particularly special to anybody. However it was extremely well written because it throws at the audience the most genuine feelings I have come across in a video game. The way Bill and Ben lied to Riesz\u2019s younger brother Elliot about what his dead mom said in order to get what they want, is vile. I felt a strong feeling of negative and disgusting energy just from sitting through this part. Lying to an innocent kid who wants to see his dead mom\u2026. Pic fucking related. How could you not be flushed in anger at such a disgusting act? If you think this writing is shit then you have not wrestled with the tensions and vengefulness that exists in Riesz\u2019s character. To top it off Riesz is obviously the more serious character, you can easily tell by the contrasting one liners she says after battles, as opposed to Angela\u2019s light hearted sayings. She faces the journey with the heaviest burden out of all 6 characters by far. Still, Riesz radiates as a good helpful soul, despite being extremely down in her luck. For fuck\u2019s sake Riesz\u2019s class 4 item is called the Kind sphere. Sorry but I won\u2019t let you say that Riesz\u2019s story is the worst.

That is fine. But if you start out level 1 with 6 str and 14 hp, that is a 50% improvement in both categories. Once you are around level 21 with 66 str and 154 hp, gaining that next level of +3 str and + 7 hp average is now only a 5% improvement. I know that most of the games have points where gains are increased temporarily but even then it is like +5 str and +11 hp. In Dragon Quest games leveling tends to not improve your character much the further you level outside of learning new spells.<br><br>A lot of Final Fantasy games scale better where by level 10 you are earning 20 hp per level and then by level 60 you are earning 100 to 150 per level. Strength tends to stay consistent in raw numbers when leveling up (usually +1 to 3), but 255 str may do 9999, with 205 str doing 7000. That is 3000 damage gained by 50 points.
