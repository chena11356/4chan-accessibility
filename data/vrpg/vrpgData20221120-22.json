Not that I&#039;m complaining :).<br>DE (Disco Elysium) has one of the deepest and well thought out gameplay in any game I&#039;ve ever played. It&#039;s cut through all the rooty tooty point and shooty &quot;gameplay&quot; (that other games waste their time on) and gets to the real meat of any game.... the story. I truly can&#039;t express how how shocked I was (well I can, I lived through the &quot;trump years&quot;) that there are people who don&#039;t like DE (Disco Elysium). It&#039;s probably just their preconceived notions on what a &quot;game&quot; has to be. These same people probably also have antiquated ideas about women, race, and religion as well.

Kaiden is essentially a clone of Carth Onasi, and Carth would never decline a 3way with Bastilla and FemRevan I assure you,. Carth Onasi was always based, he was that guy you loved to hate sure, but he was based enough ton pilot the ship and shit. Kaiden declining the 3way is a glitch/plothole because Carth would not decline a fucking Bastilla or Missioon or especially a fucking Juuhani 3way with FemRevan!

How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game?

For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has.

Deus Ex doesn&#039;t require any violence, allowing you to play the game at your own pace.<br><br>Deus Ex gives you freedom of choice, ranging from story choices to how you navigate levels. Nocturne gives you the former, but not the latter since you have to follow a predetermined path.<br><br>Expanding on this, Deus Ex also has multiple solutions to every problem, meaning that no two playthroughs are the same.

In order to obtain the pass you need so the guard at the gate will let you through, you need to get it from the collector. He&#039;ll give you it if you help him find a 1 Yen bill.

I&#039;m the fucking Demi-Fiend, so why can&#039;t I just beat the shit out of the gate guard or collector so I can get what I want? Why can&#039;t I buy the one yen bill from the bar owner for a reasonable price? Why can&#039;t I find a fake bill to give the collector?<br><br>And don&#039;t forget that Nocturne starts with an hour of cutscenes and story interactions while Deus Ex immediately hands the player control from the start of the game and never takes it away.

I was told it was supposed to be good, but I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve ever felt more insulted by a game.

Too easy and just there to be in the way<br>- Only battles with any difficulty are forced solo battles which make the game even more barebones, and even those are scarce<br>- Feels like 1/3 of the &quot;bosses&quot; are forced losses where you randomly get one-shotted by volty<br>- Most of the 177 characters are unappealing peasants no one would ever want to play as, reducing the potential depth of the better ones (like Chrono Cross, but worse)<br>- To customize your party you have to do inane tasks wandering around town for the first 20 hours until you figure out how to get the one you want, if you even manage it. This is most of the game&#039;s &quot;gameplay&quot;<br>- The character you like may be level 5 when recruited 20 hours into the game, or be irredeemably bad in another way<br>- You can&#039;t even use the characters you like in most story battles or even any battles if you pick the wrong path, completely missing the point of having party customization<br>- Irredeemable bland dungeons with literal corridors that lead to nothing<br>- No escape rope or warp without running to a pig statue<br>- Stupid time system that meshes poorly with surprise story triggers<br>- Item limit with no storage except the jukebox<br><br>This doesn&#039;t even get into the story which is a dumpster fire in its own way. The only thing that&#039;s OK is the music, and even that has an asterisk, because it&#039;s never been more obvious that the programmer placed the music and not the composer.

Just throwing ideas out, but if you want a civil war it might actually have been cool if the city had a dwarf/dark elf quarter, or if say some humans (the towns on the outskirts?) rebelled with you because they saw what happened to the dwarves.

The ending originally involved Shepard conversing with Harbinger and being given two choices: either destroy the Reapers &amp; let everyone find their own eventual solution to the dark energy threat, or surrender to the Reapers &amp; allow humanity to be harvested in exchange for letting the other galactic races survive, with the latter choice explaining how humans had the greatest genetic potential to produce extraordinarily powerful Reapers that could be capable of resolving the threat of unstable dark energy for the foreseeable future (which would&#039;ve revealed why the Reapers focused on exclusively processing a Human Reaper in ME2, as the deleted audio lines of Harbinger hinted at).<br>Now, Karpyshyn himself has neither denied nor supported this, stating another ending involving some &quot;Reaper Queen&quot; was in the works, but that was likely a secondary draft in the midst of the development hell ME3 went through before release.
