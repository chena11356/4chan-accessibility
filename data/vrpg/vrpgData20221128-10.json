No matter how much I try, it seems that all the DRPGs really on two types of battles: the ones where you mash attack until the enemy is dead without worrying about anything and the ones where you try to mash attack to win but the enemy completely destroys your whole party with just one attack. This second option usually becomes a RNG fest, because while the enemy always has this attack that wipes your party, it can use it on turn 1, turn 10 or never use it, so it all comes down to luck.<br>So, what you do to enjoy this?

A lot of suspension of disbelief. But if you allow yourself to be fooled, it is actually a very fun game. Even though every quest and city is procedurally generated, after you&#039;ve been playing for a while you kind of allow the illusion that every location is unique to grow on you. You get a sense of scale and realism that no other RPG offers.<br><br>I remember Zaric saying that every region in Daggerfall felt unique to him. I thought this was nonsense. How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game? I didn&#039;t understand this until I properly played Daggerfall and gave it a chance rather than dismissing it as procedurally generated garbage like I had done before. For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has. A sense of immersion that you really are just an itinerant adventurer living in a fantasy world. Even though it&#039;s from 1996 it feels surprisingly modern in the amount of freedom it gives you.<br><br>Of course, the Unity version and shit ton of mods help a lot too.

STALKER is a weird case because it&#039;s limited by weight but displays things on a grid with infinite spaces. i never liked that because you still carry a lot of different items like artifacts, ammo types, and every duplicate weapon still appears in a new space instead of ak-74 (x3) or something. so all that combined with items having images and everything being in one category means your inventory can be so visually cluttered you have to scroll way down to find something even if you&#039;re way under the weight limit. i don&#039;t hate it, it&#039;s just a little weird. it probably comes down to the complexity of the game. like i was saying, lists can do small objects and an infinite variety of things but for an action game the grid being simpler and faster to look through is better.", "filename": "inventory", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668901114491947, "time": 1668901114, "md5": "KhpYq1KWY1NK+yoKyOZZFg==", "fsize": 1578160, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "grid-inventory-or-list-inventory", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 32, "images": 6, "omitted_posts": 27, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 2859528, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)17:11:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2854782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2854782</a><br>Games with inventory were never RPGs", "time": 1669241471, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2860023, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)01:44:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2854782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2854782</a><br>Grid does a better job at showing me that I&#039;m clogging up my inventory with shit I should just drop", "time": 1669272241, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2862404, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)18:41:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2858252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2858252</a><br>Schrodinger&#039;s stone.", "time": 1669419676, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2862416, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)18:52:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2854782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2854782</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8x<wbr>z5Lcyn94<br>Attache cache", "time": 1669420352, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2864511, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)10:24:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2855307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2855307</a><br>based arcanum enjoyer", "time": 1669562678, "resto": 2854782}], "last_modified": 1669562678}, {"no": 2863956, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)23:39:48", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Elden ring: Holly fuck is this game depressing..", "com": "I never really played any from software games, tried DS few times but never got very far before switching to some other less &quot;dying fetish&quot; rpg. <br>When it comes to level design it&#039;s OK, nothing special but not bad either.

When you get to Mars you are confronted by the Kingdom of Mars and are unable to communicate with them.<br>Some react with hostility, some with curiosity, and others with fear, but it can be hard to tell the difference because of the language barrier.<br>You can easily kill them with your umbrella because they are very weak of constitution compared to you, and you can make a beeline for their capital, kill their king, and proclaim yourself King of Mars. This can be done relatively easily, and by the end, Mars will be a colony of whatever nation you&#039;ve chosen as your origin.<br>The other main option is to figure out how to communicate with them which will eventually lead you into an existing narrative involving the kingdom&#039;s politics and domestic &amp; foreign issues.<br>More or less, one path is Robinson Crusoe and the other, Barsoom.<br>But the key bit is that the game wouldn&#039;t judge you for your choices. The morality of the game would be of the colonial era, and butchering a bunch of Martians would all be framed as a triumph of the human will in a new age of discovery. There would be as much self-awareness here as there is in 20,000 Leagues when the crew of the Nautilus electrocutes a bunch of cannibals.<br>I&#039;d like the choices to be less binary of course.
