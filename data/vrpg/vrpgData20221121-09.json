And it&#039;s not just the calculations but the perks that make it unintuitive. A pure fighter for example, a build most people associate with high defenses, ironically benefits greatly from low resolve due to gaining mana from being crit. No one (besides a Troupadour) benefits less from Dex or suffers less from heavy armor than a berserker, as you&#039;ll often have your recovery time dramatically reduced or cut entirely, and you&#039;ll automatically attack back each time you get crit anyway.<br>And in the end the whole &quot;no terrible answer&quot; thing often just winds up meaning that the attributes don&#039;t do much, the devs even acknowledge the individual points doing next to no difference by the inspirations giving you 5 points at once. At 3 might you&#039;ll be doing -21% damage, at 18 you&#039;ll be doing +24%, that&#039;s 58% or so difference between maxing and dumping might, but when you factor in that everyone will always have an active might inspiration, it&#039;s really just a difference between 8 and 23 might, then it&#039;s only really 46% percent difference, and as you say it&#039;s additive damage, so the real difference will be even less. A player will hardly notice it. Death Blows raises your base weapon damage by 50%. Resolve and Perception are the big exceptions, seeing as their effectivity widely varies depending on whether you&#039;re crossing the right thresholds, but generally the attributes don&#039;t do much either way, and how significant they&#039;ll be for a build is often a bit counterintuitive.<br>Another fun example is the Forbidden Fist, you can easily inflict Enfeebled, an affliction which doubles the duration of an enemies negative status effects.

I mean why the fuck else would he decline such an Epic 3way with his co-workers? Kaiden is essentially a clone of Carth Onasi, and Carth would never decline a 3way with Bastilla and FemRevan I assure you,. Carth Onasi was always based, he was that guy you loved to hate sure, but he was based enough ton pilot the ship and shit. Kaiden declining the 3way is a glitch/plothole because Carth would not decline a fucking Bastilla or Missioon or especially a fucking Juuhani 3way with FemRevan!

STALKER is a weird case because it&#039;s limited by weight but displays things on a grid with infinite spaces. i never liked that because you still carry a lot of different items like artifacts, ammo types, and every duplicate weapon still appears in a new space instead of ak-74 (x3) or something. so all that combined with items having images and everything being in one category means your inventory can be so visually cluttered you have to scroll way down to find something even if you&#039;re way under the weight limit. i don&#039;t hate it, it&#039;s just a little weird. it probably comes down to the complexity of the game. like i was saying, lists can do small objects and an infinite variety of things but for an action game the grid being simpler and faster to look through is better.", "filename": "inventory", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668901114491947, "time": 1668901114, "md5": "KhpYq1KWY1NK+yoKyOZZFg==", "fsize": 1578160, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "grid-inventory-or-list-inventory", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 21, "images": 6, "omitted_posts": 16, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 2855326, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)05:24:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2855322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2855322</a><br>Consoles.", "time": 1668939864, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2855377, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)07:16:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2854782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2854782</a><br>Deus ex PS2 ver had better list", "time": 1668946588, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2855393, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)07:42:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2854782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2854782</a><br>Grid with infinite scroll.<br>Oh wait, OP did mention that<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;STALKER is a weird case because it&#039;s limited by weight but displays things on a grid with infinite spaces. i never liked that because you still carry a lot of different items like artifacts, ammo types, and every duplicate weapon still appears in a new space instead of ak-74 (x3) or something</span><br>I&#039;m pretty sure that STALKER does group multiples of a same item in a single stack.", "time": 1668948178, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2855761, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)14:56:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2854796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2854796</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Vegas has an amazing UI</span><br>you mean Fallout 3?", "time": 1668974198, "resto": 2854782}, {"no": 2855766, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)14:58:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2854782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2854782</a><br>There&#039;s no argument.

A lot of suspension of disbelief. But if you allow yourself to be fooled, it is actually a very fun game. Even though every quest and city is procedurally generated, after you&#039;ve been playing for a while you kind of allow the illusion that every location is unique to grow on you. You get a sense of scale and realism that no other RPG offers.<br><br>I remember Zaric saying that every region in Daggerfall felt unique to him. I thought this was nonsense. How could a region feel unique when it uses the exact same generation algorithm as every other generic region in the game? I didn&#039;t understand this until I properly played Daggerfall and gave it a chance rather than dismissing it as procedurally generated garbage like I had done before. For example, over time you remember certain town layouts, you find a city with all the right services that your character requires in the one place, or you grow fond of a city that you&#039;ve done a lot of quests in. And after a while of helping people out you see your reputation in a region has grown, it feels good that your actions in this world actually mean something.<br><br>Daggerfall definitely has something that no other RPG I&#039;ve played has. A sense of immersion that you really are just an itinerant adventurer living in a fantasy world. Even though it&#039;s from 1996 it feels surprisingly modern in the amount of freedom it gives you.<br><br>Of course, the Unity version and shit ton of mods help a lot too.

Deus Ex doesn&#039;t require any violence, allowing you to play the game at your own pace.<br><br>Deus Ex gives you freedom of choice, ranging from story choices to how you navigate levels. Nocturne gives you the former, but not the latter since you have to follow a predetermined path.<br><br>Expanding on this, Deus Ex also has multiple solutions to every problem, meaning that no two playthroughs are the same. Nocturne may allow for more freedom than most JRPGs (talking to demons), but it still has the potential to be as linear as it&#039;s contemporaries.<br><br>Let&#039;s look at obtaining the pass from the collector in the sewers just before the Matador fight for example. In order to obtain the pass you need so the guard at the gate will let you through, you need to get it from the collector. He&#039;ll give you it if you help him find a 1 Yen bill. Obtaining this bill requires you to break into the back room of a bar and steal it.<br><br>The problem with this is that this is the only method to get past the gate. I&#039;m the fucking Demi-Fiend, so why can&#039;t I just beat the shit out of the gate guard or collector so I can get what I want? Why can&#039;t I buy the one yen bill from the bar owner for a reasonable price?
