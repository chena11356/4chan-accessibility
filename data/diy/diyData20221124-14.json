You might as well just tell him to pick up the kazoo and convince himself it is the greatest sounding koto ever. <br><br>Beyond that, the bridges in this family of instrument are movable and moving them is part of how you tune them. Flat topped instruments require their bracing to be designed around the bridge placement and the braces create live and dead spots on the soundboard and areas with very different tonality, the string will drastically change sound and volume when its bridge is moved to setup for different pieces. Now you could design a bracing pattern which would work if you know what you are doing, but anon does not know what he is doing, you probably could just get away with a lattice bracing and have ok results but making that lattice will be a great deal of work, possibly more work than carving in the end. <br><br>And that does not even take into consideration of the physical, the pressure applied by the bridges of a koto and the eastern zithers are about as irritating as you could get for a flat top instrument, almost the entire length of the soundboard needs to be able to standup to the pressure of a bridge and be reasonably acoustically active. This is not so easy to accomplish with a flat top. <br><br><a href=\"#p2508845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2508845</a><br>A spoke shave like the Miller Falls #1 would probably be very handy and much quicker than files.

I have confirmed the safety valve works by removing it, holding a lighter to the bulb, and blowing through where the propane goes.

But that height is often too low for routing and handwork. Furniture maker Jeff Miller built a mini-bench that elevates workpieces to a more comfortable height.<br><br>Extraction woodworking benches are designed to place a workpiece at a height that\u2019s ideal for handplaning. But the perfect height for planing often is too low for other common bench tasks. For example, when routing, carving, cutting dovetails, or doing layout, I frequently have found myself bent over at an uncomfortable angle so that I could see clearly and work effectively. When performing these tasks, I like to have a workpiece positioned 6 in. to 10 in. above my waist level.<br><br>To bring a workpiece to my ideal height range, I made a small workbench that mounts quickly to my regular bench. When extra height is needed, the minibench effectively raises the work-surface to my comfort zone.
