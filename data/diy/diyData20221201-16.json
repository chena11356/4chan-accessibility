I used to drive Ryder trucks when my fleet truck was cooked and let me tell you, those gears were sooo fucking sloppy and they always had something leaking. If it&#039;s based off a platform with continuing support replacing drivetrain is a option though.<br><br>Personally if I was going to get a ex-fleet vehicle to live in, I&#039;d pick a school bus. Lots more space than 26ft box truck, has built in man doors. Very strong bodies, busses are designed to keep unbelted children safe when they get t-boned. Depending on district most places cycle busses out when they hit 300k or when they hit 20~ years of age, typically age first if it&#039;s inner city, those machines don&#039;t travel far. Ritzy private schools often cycle them out much quicker, not uncommon to see a 10y/o bus with 80-k on the clock up for auction. License is dead easy to get, if you&#039;re too dumb to get it you&#039;re too retarded to DIY a place to live. Most of them are autos which saves them from most user error/abuse, all have commonly available diesel engines like caterpillar, detroit, etc. so ANY diesel shop can fix em if you can&#039;t. Worst case scenario you can drop in a new engine/trans of ANY brand, the bodies and drive trains are made separately then assembled when a fleet orders o there&#039;s a lot of interoperability, whether new new or from a wrecked big rig, box truck or school bus. Most have air brakes though, I personally prefer air brakes for a large commercial-sized vehicle for the reliability and backup they offer, but if that&#039;s a sticking point for you some districts use hydraulics. Buy one from a area that doesn&#039;t get real winters IE Arizona to limit rust. If you&#039;re in a area that gets winter have her undercoated and keep it clean and the body will last forever.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. used to drive school busses, currently drive big rigs.
