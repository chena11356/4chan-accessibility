Basically, sanding it will turn it concrete white, smoothening and polishing on dark stone does bring it back to a dark color, but you really need to know your stuff to make it fully dark again.

It took me about 2-3 years to get to this point but I can easily make a grand a week now with relatively little stress on my own time. The same could be said of any field. You could set up security systems for old people and if you are persistent you will find a niche and clientele. One thing I would recommend with the building trades is not getting into the heavy labor side. You can market yourself as a custom &quot;anything&quot; (fence, cabinet, entryway ect). Once you get there you can charge alot more. Never Never Never equate what constitutes a high price in your eyes with your customers view of things. People have given me 8 hundred dollar tips on 4 day jobs because my bid was way too low. Never be affraid to start a bid high. If they like you, they will ushually pay you. Sometimes you have to lose a day to make them happy. If a customer loves you they will almost certainly talk to their friends about you and then it is game over.
