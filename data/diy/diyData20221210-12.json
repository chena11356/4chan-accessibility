It has torsion bar suspension and the torsion bar is shot out. Obviously I am trying to make as big of profit as possible so I would like to use only materials I already have. Recently I acquired a bunch of iron, &gt;&gt;/2517030 thread related, on another deal. As you can see, there is a perfect piece square tubing to make a leaf spring axle with. That did not come in deal, there are 2 3&#039; pieces on the rack 3x1/8&quot; on the rack that did come with the deal. So my question is, what, if there is one, would be the strongest and safest way to splice them together? I was thinking of sleeving in a piece of square stock or tube, I have either. OR cutting the joining ends at 45\u00b0 and fish plating it. If both are equally as strong, which would be less time consuming and or easier? There is also a 3rd option of converting it from torsion bar to coil springs, but that&#039;s a whole other kettle of rotten fish. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;picrel, the project.</span>", "filename": "Screenshot_20221209-183739", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670646397647282, "time": 1670646397, "md5": "1tVMKl6/uBHBEBdbRCJ/Iw==", "fsize": 1162304, "resto": 2514868}, {"no": 2518680, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)23:32:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2518676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2518676</a><br>Here is my last project trailer, wish I still had the pictures of when I bought it.
