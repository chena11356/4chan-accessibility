Ideally, you&#039;ll want something with an open channel on both sides, but good luck.<br>The tricky part is determining how much power and antenna height you&#039;ll need. The simple way to figue is, if you can get an antenna about 20 - 30ft in the air, 10 watts can ideally give you a few mile radius. To double your distance, rither quadruple your power output or antenna eight. <br>Easiest antennas are simple 1/2 wave or 1/4 wave ground plane. You can find sites to tell you how to make those, but take a coat hanger, straighten out, and cut it to length. Use the formula 468/freq (in Mhz) then multiply by 12 to get inches for your length. Solder into a PL259 connector. Cut your radials same length and attach to the corners of the connector and bend at 45 degree angle. <br>20ft metal or Schedule 80 pipe works great for portable tower with a TV tripod. Use 50 ohm coax. <br>Transmitters can be found on E-bay. Avoid Chinese made units, for they&#039;re dirty and their singal splatters.
