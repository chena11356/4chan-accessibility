I recently tried making a rectifier circuit, but when I checked its output signal on my oscilloscope, the peaks of the AC signal I was supplying it seemed to be getting inexplicably clipped. The diode is in series with a resistor, so I have no idea why this would happen. Anyone know what&#039;s happening? I can post my oscilloscope output if it helps.

It&#039;s kind of a pain to iron the stuff on, because it&#039;s so easy to melt synthetic fabrics while you&#039;re setting the tape. The proper tool for it is a tiny iron, they look more like soldering irons (look up &quot;electric leather iron&quot;, and Clover makes one too). If you use a normal household iron, you&#039;ll only be using the inch or half inch at the very tip, and it&#039;s more work to maneuver. It wouldn&#039;t be too bad on a broad, flat piece of fabric though.<br><br>I&#039;d recommend the pressure-sensitive kind if you can find some. Usually they are marketed as material specific (tape for X fabric, tape for Y fabric). Just make sure the fabric is clean, and press it on with a thumb/felt pad.

Was good at fixing my own shit, found that I could make money fixing other people&#039;s shit, too. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it (like my previous career,) got bored with some of the more mundane jobs. It was also nice being able to write off tools and equipment on my taxes.<br><br>I launched my business with a targeted postcard campaign, positioning myself as a knowledgeable DIYer who lived in the same community and was somebody like your neighbors and co-workers. I&#039;m in an affluent suburb, so many people really liked dealing with me, versus some crusty old drunk who smelled like cigarettes and BO, or someone who didn&#039;t speak English very well.<br><br>Did it for about 12 years. By the end, I was charging around $70/hr and had all the work I could handle. But it&#039;s a grind to get in enough billable hours during a week to really make great money. Even though I was just a schmuck-in-a-truck, there&#039;s overhead ($1M liability policy, business licenses, supplies, transportation etc.) and it&#039;s not always possible to consistently log 6-8 hours per day, 5-6 days per week. I always told people who asked, &quot;This job isn&#039;t paying my mortgage.&quot; My wife has a lucrative career that carried most of major expenses.<br><br>But the physical toll finally got to be too much. Moving from a desk job to something that physical, I wasn&#039;t really ready for it. After 12 years, I had developed arthritis in both thumbs that made many jobs very painful. As I got into my 50s, I was less comfortable on high ladders, and just kind of got tired of the whole grind.<br><br>Someone stronger, with more stamina, and a higher pain threshold could do well, though.
