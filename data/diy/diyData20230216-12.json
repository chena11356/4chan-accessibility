From what I understand, when RISC was new, CISC CPUs had tons of complicated instructions, which were typically microcoded and slow. Microcode is an internal instruction set, which is runs a small program for each user instruction, and controls what they do. The complexity was justified with assembler programmer convenience. Make every instruction do as much as possible. Pack common tasks into specialized instructions. Did you know that x86 has BCD instructions? Nobody uses them and they&#039;re slow.<br>When RISC came along, the idea was to throw out microcode and execute every instruction directly. Even if a RISC instruction could do less than a CISC instruction, it was faster, because they could execute an instruction in as little as 1 cycle. The reduced instruction complexity made pipelining simpler and possible and reduced the CPI.<br>Obviously, x86 (CISC) survived and became the instruction set of the fastest CPUs ever. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s the state of the art, but some x86 CPUs simply translated the CISC input into internal RISC instructions and stored it in the instruction cache. The CPU really executed the translated program. If you look at RISC instruction sets, you will notice that most of them have more instructions and more complexity than the original x86. It seems if you spend enough resources like design effort and transistors, the difference doesn&#039;t matter anymore.<br>RISC-V is puristic about the RISC concept. The designers argue that reducing complexity in the instruction set really does matter. Their main argument is that simplicity, in theory, can enable even better optimizations. Read the instruction set specification, the comments on their design decisions. It&#039;s interesting.<br>What instruction set do you like better than ARM?

Look into IR modulation techniques and how they eliminate ambient light from interfering with them. They output an IR square wave at a set frequency (e.g. 40kHz) for a unit of time as a logical 1, while no square wave for that same period of time makes a logical 0. That way you can just band-pass filter that frequency to avoid ambient light and 120Hz flicker from mains lighting.

Your phone company is inspecting the header metadata (shit that&#039;s not data itself in data packets your phone sends to and receives from your nearest cell tower).<br><br>Data is not exchanged over the internet in a connection, like old-timey landlines, but in discrete chunks of data around which are wrapped identifying data. We call data about data metadata, and the data plus the metadata is the packet. This identifying data is located in the part of the packet called a header, which is similar in concept to the from and to parts of an postal envelope. Along with telling you where it&#039;s coming from and where it&#039;s going, it also includes a lot of other info.<br><br>One of the pieces of info included is the TTL (Time-To-Live), which is a number. This number is decremented by every node through which that packet passes. When this number reaches zero, the packet is discarded by the next node it encounters. This occurs because if it didn&#039;t we&#039;d have lost packets being passed around forever, and the internet congestion would never end.<br><br>The TTL for most mobile operating systems is IIRC 64. The TTL for Windows, Linux, Mac, and other non-mobile OSes varies, but is usually greater than 64.<br><br>Another piece of data is the user agent string. This is information about the operating system, web browser, and other stuff so whatever website you&#039;re using can decide what sort of web page to serve you.

But with SOLIDWORKS you have to make the blueprints from 3D models unless you use some of the less sophisticated but 100% supported aspects of solidworks. If you do stuff like floorplans, then AUTOCAD is better since it&#039;s cheaper. You can do whatever you want with solidworks, but it&#039;s like $4,000. I do 80% machine design and 20% floor plan stuff and solidworks does it all great for me. But if you dont already know how to use 3D CAD, then i wouldnt use it for 2D floorplan stuff.

There&#039;s no point building a castle gate if you can&#039;t close said gate. Security threats are often far closer to home than people would like to consider, and heavy perimeter security can leave occupants trapped inside their own home with a threat and nowhere to run. The &quot;Threat&quot; here might be thief who&#039;s walked into your home when you were in the garden for example, it could be a stove that&#039;s on fire, it could be a snake, or a drunk family member, or a neibor who wants to talk about a trivial dispute<br><br>For this reason I strongly advise air-locking, and having a panic room rather than perimeter security.<br>rather than fortify your front door you might fortify a single bedroom door and the windows into that room, leaving you somewhere within the house to retreat to, an internal door which is easier to secure (you could sneak into it) and one which wouldn&#039;t tend to trap people inside.<br>Someone could break into the house, steal and TV, leave with the TV but not find or be able to harm the occupants.

Nor could the hedge be rammed.<br>The only way to get in would have been to use two double length ladders tied together at the top, or hoist someone in with a boom crane. This hedge stopped no les than 12 forced entries in 6 months, with most intruders trying to force their way through it only to find the wire, two half-assed attempts to cut the wire failed, and two climbers making my personal fails montage.<br>A key consideration in my planning was to make the hedge appear weak in order to tip the hand of would-be intruders, we actually wanted these people to attempt to gain entry rather than staking out the doors", "time": 1675999919, "resto": 2555313}, {"no": 2559899, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)22:38:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2555321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2555321</a><br>break ins where the intruder is simply searching for amenities are surprisingly common and present a persistent issue anywhere near bars/clubs.<br>Sometimes the people breaking in are simply hiding, looking for somewhere to poo, somewhere to have sex or a drinking tap.

Unfortunately these crews are often uncomfortably local and may warehouse the stolen goods within a mile of the theft in a shed the owner will claim its unused and unmonitored. &quot;How did four ton of stolen furniture get into my shed?&quot;<br><br>Generally you want a battery powered viewing platform on a mobile/satelite system just sat on the roof, you want to secure vehicles and significant tools individually with engine locks or cemented storage, you want silent alarms because you&#039;re more likely to prevent theft if the thieves are stealing more rather then less- very different to a urban propperty.<br><br>If you&#039;re worried about persons/raids you set up a second perimiter, like a chain link compound around sheds and vehicles. If rifles are part of your equasion you want to set up hard points with one foot high slits which allow you to engage one intruder on your perimiter without being exposed to fire from the whole perimiter. <br>This might look something like a 1/3 circle bench that faced into your garden that just happened to have a slot between the two back rests, if the bottom of the seat was simply legs but had an earth berm behind it and the back rests were railway sleepers this wouldn&#039;t look like a shitzo hard point. Another option would be a meter high wall with a water feature and pond, the feature would be fitted into a large slot in the wall which the water hose would go in the back of. <br><br>Serious criminals might stick an owner up on the road outside their house and force the owner to let them in.

Networking, video security system, and a few door controllers. They requested that each type of network use different color cables. Okay, weird, but sure. We ordered cables in several different colors. Generally we only have blue and gray. They wanted a color for computers, phones, security, doors, and a few more for the different types of machines they were operating. We had to special order cable and it cost a bit more.

Having never really done anything beyond simple repairs or troubleshooting stuff, my handy-ness is bleak. My boss gets pretty pissed at me sometimes. Like when I take too long screwing shit so I don\u2019t strip it, too long straightening up the drill (had no idea it could suck me in like that), or when I wasnt\u2019t cutting brick straight enough. He handed me a bolt to hammer into a beam and turns out it wasn\u2019t quite long enough, so it got only a nut with no washer or lock washer. He said that usually given two options, I pick the wrong one. But he does compliment how I am very strong and have an eye for detail.

The wine gets (similar to the &quot;corker&quot;) a so-called off-tone, so an unpleasant aroma. The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;). Sometimes a goat-like odor is spoken of, which is why the name B\u00f6ckser is derived from &quot;buck&quot;.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B\u00f6ckser can develop as a result of improper production or incorrect storage and is more common in young wines. The &quot;B\u00f6ckser&quot; is one of the reduction aromas that occur in the absence of air and is caused by the presence of sulfurous substances in the wine. These are formed by yeasts during fermentation, mainly from sulfur-containing amino acids and from sulfites and sulfates.

You may have grounding issues.<br><br>1: Use a microcontroller and DAC to DDS it from a lookup table. Higher frequency output means pricier DAC and/or filter, but you should be able to get low THD without difficulty. I&#039;d go for something like a pi pico or ESP32, and PCM1780. Maybe an Si5351 if you need a precise clock generator. Could also have two sines with arbitrarily offset phases, or custom waveforms.<br><br>2: Use a sine oscillator, with an AGC circuit of some sort to get a constant amplitude. You likely won&#039;t be able to get a wide range of frequencies easily, though with multiple ranges it might be possible. THD may be significant as a result of the AGC circuit. Both sine oscillators and AGCs are kinda funky.<br><br>3: Use a triangle oscillator with diode clipping. Pic related, it&#039;s the circuit from my analogue function generator, see U3/4/5.

Prior to the 1950s, triodes were made using vacuum tubes, now they use bipolar or field-effect transistors, but the basic operating mechanism is the same. The amount of current between pins 2 and 3 determines the amount of current that is allowed between 1 and 3, scaled up by some factor, we call Gain (this is a bit of a simplification, for FETs it&#039;s mostly voltage 2-3 that matters, not current).<br><br>So, simplest case, you are connecting pin 1 to power source, pin 2 to your low-power unamplified signal from the microphone or mixer, and pin 3 to the speaker, which then returns to the power source&#039;s other side. A couple of things can happen here to cause trouble if the speaker&#039;s impedance is unexpectedly high or low. One, the input path (2-&gt;3-&gt;Out) becomes less resistive in addition to the output, so its current scales up for a given voltage (the triode becomes &quot;misbiased&quot;). Because of nonlinear solidstate interactions (saturation for example), the response won&#039;t be directly proportional to the input anymore. IT could even setup a condition in which damaging high power could flow through part of the circuit not designed for it, or enough potential could build up somewhere to short over a component.<br><br>The amplifier circuit is designed with a particular output impedance in mind, keeping the triode(s) happy. Moving 10-20% in that range is almost certainly okay, although you&#039;ll experience some distortion and power inefficiency. Going to half or double is way out of spec.<br><br>These are just a few simple cases. Amps can also be built without open drains, and using operational amplifiers (a component built from multiple triodes, which addresses many of these shortcomings of the fundamental device). Even then, cutting output impedance in half wouldn&#039;t cleanly scale power or signal amplitude, because the load is still part of the circuit.", "time": 1676445672, "resto": 2559805}, {"no": 2563286, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)02:26:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2563283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2563283</a><br>to elaborate;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;power could flow through part of the circuit not designed for it, or enough potential could build up somewhere</span><br>Most modern non-chinesium electronics will feature some zener diodes or fuses to mitigate this risk.

Now the absolute most powerful way to brew anything..<br><br>First you need to start with ultra high quality water. No horse shit tap water. No bottled water from the single use bottles the water quality in those is still shit. Get yourself a 5 gallon Jug of water with a tap on it. You can get it from water stores. You want double reverse Osmosis water. Now what you&#039;ll want to do is get your coffee bean. I recommend a good kind like 100% Arabica. Some broke fags prefer Guatamalan which is decent. Now what you need to do is grind it into a powder put it in a tea bag or a diffuser and put your diffuser in your coffee pot. And then put the pot of coffee in the fridge for 48-72 hours. This is called cold brew. And it&#039;s potent as fuck. Now once you&#039;ve got your ultra dank cold brew. Pour it into your cup and dilute that shit with milk and brown sugar add a little bit of cinnamon even add a little bit of chocalate flakes and whipped cream if you want to be extra fancy. And that&#039;s how you have a kick ass cup of coffee. It&#039;s expensive at first. Buying the water jug will set you back about $50. But if you&#039;re a serious coffee drinker it&#039;ll be worth it.

Galleries are BRIGHT as hell, much brighter than your common house. So you want to avoid bulb lights (without significant diffusers), and flourescent lights (just in general).<br>Find some nice led lights that have good spectrum coverage (so not the chinesium crap), and stick diffusers on there. Proper diffusers make you lose around %30 light IIRC, or %50. So you&#039;ll need a lot of extra light.<br>Another issue in a house room is the low volume will inevitably cause wall washing and uneven wall lighting.<br>Personally, I&#039;d go with indirect lighting on the ceiling with hidden led strips (plenty of examples on google).

We tend to buy any cheap cow that isn&#039;t horrible and try to get a few calves out of her. Because of this, I have worked with many breeds. Firstly, I have never heard much about actual Wagyu meat being raised in the U.S. I think you would have a hard time finding a market that would give you a premium for it. Angus are a solid breed with good maternal instincts and a tendency to marble well, and you can actually get a premium price if it meets the specs for certified angus beef. Lowline are basically a miniature angus breed and are good for small operations. Their small carcass size means you&#039;ll get docked at large slaughter plants though. British whites tend to be similar to angus but are unlikely to meet certified angus specs due to coat color.<br> A lot of people like herefords, but I have had pretty bad luck with them. They are the dumbest cattle I have every worked with, but are extremely durable. I am convinced some herefords are too dumb to feel pain, as they hardly even flinch when you bend a pipe over their head. They aren&#039;t great mothers and have a bad tendency to lose calves and have trouble producing enough milk sometimes.<br>Simmentals have a very large frame and are good at getting very heavy carcasses. Their large size also means they have little trouble with birthing. However, they need to eat a lot and don&#039;t fatten well on grass. Also they tend to have udder issues later in life.<br>Charolais are good at heavy muscling. I have a limited experience with them but can&#039;t recall a whole lot of calving or mothering issues.<br>Salers are a less often known breed. I found they make great mothers with some of the most aggressive calves I have seen and gain well on grass. However, their meat is more lean and doesn&#039;t marble as well. <br>If you don&#039;t know much about cattle I would recommend getting a job where you can work with them.

Seamless pipe - lol.<br>Joining stainless is also tricky. Soldering stainless? Idk maybe it would cause galvanic corrosion, and soldering to stainless is hard. Welding? Copper-sized tubes would be hard to weld as wall thickness is 0.8-1.2 mm, plus it would require you purging a line with argon so pipe doesn&#039;t sugar on the inside. Black iron pipe sized stainless pipe? Yes, it can be welded, even with stick, maybe you can get around the sugaring problem with some sort of flux instead of argon...

Idk I could build stuff too if I&#039;d practice and somehow got stronger but I honestly hated all the woodwork stuff we did at school because I hardly could use any tools and it took me ages to saw through stuff and the machines scared me (but painting the products was fun!) and my creations were bad...

I&#039;ve made a few beanies and there are some that are worked in the round like amigurumi and some where you just make a rectangle and sew it together (these can look good if you only work in one loop of the stitch so it looks ribbed like knit)</span><br>A beanie is probably the safest option. I&#039;d love to make some cat or bear ears on his beanie but I know he&#039;d never ever use it if I did that... So I&#039;d say a round amigurumi-esque beanie is the thing I&#039;ll be making and it has to be navy blue apparently so yeah that&#039;s pretty much it!

You&#039;ve identified HPMC as a rate controlling polymer, which is further than 90% of people would get (nice work!), but you have a lot of planning to do before you even hit the formulations stage.<br>You need to figure out how you plan on creating a homogeneous dry blend without a V-blender, also how will you test content uniformity of your tablets? Chromatography seems like it&#039;s off the table, but if you have an analytical balance you can do it by weight if your blend uniformity is good and your tablet weight and API amount are high enough. <br>How you will test dissolution of your tablets for the rate of release without a dissolution apparatus and chromatographic equipment? Getting an HPMC + API blend into tablet form isn&#039;t your biggest hurdle, it&#039;s making sure that the product doesn&#039;t dump API into your system too quickly and cause you to OD, or take 48 hours to release entirely. You have to know this information alongside having tested for proper distribution before you go munching your Kitchen Crank ER\u2122 Tablets (the force you compress the tablets with will also affect the release rate so it&#039;s not a single variable equation).<br>You haven&#039;t mentioned what API you are working with yet (do you have a CoA for it or know the purity?). You need to verify that there are no interactions between your API and excipients, which is usually conducted using IR spectroscopy, but you might be able to find literature on this pertaining to your specific API compound.<br>Even if you&#039;re successful with making a rate controlled tablet (which isn&#039;t impossible, but you have a ton of prep work to do) there are additional tests and variables that factor into your production process.<br><br>Very interesting thread, curious to see where it ends up, but I don&#039;t blame you if you choose not to pursue the project.

Highly recommend a book &quot;Pioneer Pottery&quot; by Michael Cardew. As far as I know it is the most complete text on ceramic technology that takes you from wilderness to a functional pottery. It is replete with basic geological surveying, chemistry, machine-building, kilns, clays, and glazes. This book stops at around 1950-1960 level technology, and does not go into specific ceramic topics where most working potters are at today. There are other books for that. For instance: that primitive technology video guy has essentially worked through the first couple chapters of this book and that&#039;s where we were about 5,000 years ago. You see, free clay sounds like a blessing, and it may be in some cases; however, it is not always as <a href=\"#p2560789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2560789</a> points out kilns and forges capable of sustaining higher temperatures to work you (most likely) lower temperature clays and metals are made of refractory materials that took thousands of years to build upon. It sounds romantic to start with nothing, but we do not live long enough to fuck around with that. You&#039;re better off using modern IFBs, refractory castables, and ceramic fiber blankets to build your kilns and forges because you cannot even test your clay to see what it is capable of without a kiln.
