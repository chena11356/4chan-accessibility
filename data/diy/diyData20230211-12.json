The star on the cap was just an incidental design as I as using the circular pattern tool in Fusion 360 and when I incremented the count to 5 I liked that way it looked and went with it. I was going to try some really fancy and complicated detent feature to prevent it unrolling by itself but as it turns out I sized the casing perfectly so when it&#039;s fully wound in the tape takes up the whole interior and friction holds it perfectly. <br><br>The cap is off center because I widened the hole in the bottom of the casing to make assembly easier and failed to realize I no longer had any way of centering the spool. I have a new version of the casing printing now that has a notched opening for feeding the tape through rather than a huge reamed hole. I&#039;ll post it disassembled when I go to switch the casing out.", "filename": "20230209_223851", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 3000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676001069318338, "time": 1676001069, "md5": "Dc7NS754CS92pMHf3x8rXg==", "fsize": 3614948, "resto": 2557948}, {"no": 2559919, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)22:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2559876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2559876</a><br>You mean like this?", "filename": "pills-that-make-you-shit-gold-640x533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 533, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1676001236082075, "time": 1676001236, "md5": "bTclsUPCNL5qmWxaY223PQ==", "fsize": 125123, "resto": 2557948}, {"no": 2559960, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:54:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2559817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2559817</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;just comes unstuck for no reason</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;is actually very weak</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;badly hygroscopic</span><br>None of these are true, ABS is just as strong as PLA, even more so in terms of impact resistance.<br>ABS doesn&#039;t come unstuck from the right build surface (PEI).

You may have grounding issues.<br><br>1: Use a microcontroller and DAC to DDS it from a lookup table. Higher frequency output means pricier DAC and/or filter, but you should be able to get low THD without difficulty. I&#039;d go for something like a pi pico or ESP32, and PCM1780. Maybe an Si5351 if you need a precise clock generator. Could also have two sines with arbitrarily offset phases, or custom waveforms.<br><br>2: Use a sine oscillator, with an AGC circuit of some sort to get a constant amplitude. You likely won&#039;t be able to get a wide range of frequencies easily, though with multiple ranges it might be possible. THD may be significant as a result of the AGC circuit. Both sine oscillators and AGCs are kinda funky.<br><br>3: Use a triangle oscillator with diode clipping. Pic related, it&#039;s the circuit from my analogue function generator, see U3/4/5. The diode clipping method isn&#039;t perfect, you get a slight spike at the peaks and troughs, but with proper tuning it&#039;s pretty hard to see. Adding further stages of diode clipping to shrink the spike even further would help, though I can&#039;t say for sure if the output wouldn&#039;t still be rich in harmonics. Some simulations might help.<br><br>Don&#039;t forget to add a square wave output to trigger your scope with, assuming it has a port for external triggering.", "time": 1675999094, "resto": 2559805}, {"no": 2559971, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)00:14:13", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1675969979116", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1026, "h": 664, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1676006053226554, "time": 1676006053, "md5": "K10T1bJLgLdfLyrh/GsnwA==", "fsize": 135402, "resto": 2559805}, {"no": 2559986, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)00:38:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;circular saw stops working</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dissect the fucker</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3 years worth of sawdust cleaned up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;light clicker works</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trigger moves smoothly</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no corroded contacts to be seen</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking its the motor that burned out</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;put it back together 5 mins ago</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;motor runs for a second and stops again</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;subsequent trigger pulls do nothing </span><br>Must be a faulty connection?

There&#039;s no point building a castle gate if you can&#039;t close said gate. Security threats are often far closer to home than people would like to consider, and heavy perimeter security can leave occupants trapped inside their own home with a threat and nowhere to run. The &quot;Threat&quot; here might be thief who&#039;s walked into your home when you were in the garden for example, it could be a stove that&#039;s on fire, it could be a snake, or a drunk family member, or a neibor who wants to talk about a trivial dispute<br><br>For this reason I strongly advise air-locking, and having a panic room rather than perimeter security.<br>rather than fortify your front door you might fortify a single bedroom door and the windows into that room, leaving you somewhere within the house to retreat to, an internal door which is easier to secure (you could sneak into it) and one which wouldn&#039;t tend to trap people inside.<br>Someone could break into the house, steal and TV, leave with the TV but not find or be able to harm the occupants.

If you were trying to protect something like a family photo album you would be far better just putting it in a safe deposit box where it was protected from fire.<br><br>I&#039;m also a big advocate for hedges. They conceal the presence of occupants and so deter crimes against the person, they are far harder to traverse than even a high metal fence, and can be installed places where barbed wire is a threat to occupants or a legal issue.<br>One of the best jobs I ever did was install ram-proof bollards, install a free standing wire roll fence with a floppy top between it, then plant a box hedge between the bollards. The wire prevents someone cutting through the hedge, the floppy top stops the wire being used to climb the hedge, was a double length ladder used it couldn&#039;t rest on the top of either the hedge or wire, and someone who got to the top couldn&#039;t either move the ladder, climb onto the hedge, or jump down cleanly. Nor could the hedge be rammed.<br>The only way to get in would have been to use two double length ladders tied together at the top, or hoist someone in with a boom crane. This hedge stopped no les than 12 forced entries in 6 months, with most intruders trying to force their way through it only to find the wire, two half-assed attempts to cut the wire failed, and two climbers making my personal fails montage.<br>A key consideration in my planning was to make the hedge appear weak in order to tip the hand of would-be intruders, we actually wanted these people to attempt to gain entry rather than staking out the doors", "time": 1675999919, "resto": 2555313}, {"no": 2559899, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)22:38:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2555321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2555321</a><br>break ins where the intruder is simply searching for amenities are surprisingly common and present a persistent issue anywhere near bars/clubs.<br>Sometimes the people breaking in are simply hiding, looking for somewhere to poo, somewhere to have sex or a drinking tap.

From what I understand, when RISC was new, CISC CPUs had tons of complicated instructions, which were typically microcoded and slow. Microcode is an internal instruction set, which is runs a small program for each user instruction, and controls what they do. The complexity was justified with assembler programmer convenience. Make every instruction do as much as possible. Pack common tasks into specialized instructions. Did you know that x86 has BCD instructions? Nobody uses them and they&#039;re slow.<br>When RISC came along, the idea was to throw out microcode and execute every instruction directly. Even if a RISC instruction could do less than a CISC instruction, it was faster, because they could execute an instruction in as little as 1 cycle. The reduced instruction complexity made pipelining simpler and possible and reduced the CPI.<br>Obviously, x86 (CISC) survived and became the instruction set of the fastest CPUs ever. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s the state of the art, but some x86 CPUs simply translated the CISC input into internal RISC instructions and stored it in the instruction cache. The CPU really executed the translated program. If you look at RISC instruction sets, you will notice that most of them have more instructions and more complexity than the original x86. It seems if you spend enough resources like design effort and transistors, the difference doesn&#039;t matter anymore.<br>RISC-V is puristic about the RISC concept. The designers argue that reducing complexity in the instruction set really does matter. Their main argument is that simplicity, in theory, can enable even better optimizations. Read the instruction set specification, the comments on their design decisions. It&#039;s interesting.<br>What instruction set do you like better than ARM?

Lots of Gauze. Various sizes. Do not just get large pads thinking you can cut them to size, cutting gauze is bad for wound healing. ABD tauma pads too.<br>2. Iodine. It does not expire. Do not use alcohol. Do not use hydrogen peroxide <br>3. Saline and an insturment to flush wounds with. <br>4. Tweezers/instruments/flashlight/esp<wbr>ecially scissors for cutting open clothes to access wounds easier.<br>5. Steri-strips (butterfly bandages). It really pisses me off how many med kits do not come with these when they really should. These are the best thing to seal up open cut wounds that need to be stitched.<br>6. Self-adhesive bandage wraps, will come in handy if you can&#039;t use a hand.<br>7. Large triangular bandage for sling<br>8. Tourniquet.

The more I study this the less I&#039;m convinced the sensations are entirely independent. Bitter taste receptors are complex. The primary way I control these two is to grind finer to remove sourness. Most of my astringent cups have been offensively sour. The FP tolerates grinds that are too fine.

I worked at a tea store for 8 years. We made Tea&#039;s / Coffee&#039;s frappacino&#039;s , Tai tea. All sorts of shit. Now the absolute most powerful way to brew anything..<br><br>First you need to start with ultra high quality water. No horse shit tap water. No bottled water from the single use bottles the water quality in those is still shit. Get yourself a 5 gallon Jug of water with a tap on it. You can get it from water stores. You want double reverse Osmosis water. Now what you&#039;ll want to do is get your coffee bean. I recommend a good kind like 100% Arabica. Some broke fags prefer Guatamalan which is decent. Now what you need to do is grind it into a powder put it in a tea bag or a diffuser and put your diffuser in your coffee pot. And then put the pot of coffee in the fridge for 48-72 hours. This is called cold brew. And it&#039;s potent as fuck. Now once you&#039;ve got your ultra dank cold brew. Pour it into your cup and dilute that shit with milk and brown sugar add a little bit of cinnamon even add a little bit of chocalate flakes and whipped cream if you want to be extra fancy. And that&#039;s how you have a kick ass cup of coffee. It&#039;s expensive at first. Buying the water jug will set you back about $50. But if you&#039;re a serious coffee drinker it&#039;ll be worth it.

Got a bunch of shit from the night shift boomer to the point my boss asked him to come in later and the trainers were fairly strict in how they wanted shit to be done. Very sequential in every step. I&#039;d get bitched at for using the wrong broom. I hit the spindle against an aluminum fixture and pressed the corner of it down about 1/4&quot; while I was touching off a tool. That was my first big incident. A few weeks later, my trainer left me to do the opposite of a part we did in the morning and gave me the programs. He had them in the wrong folder and i uploaded them not realizing the program numbers were off, so I made a duplicate part with a wrong hole location (about 2 lbs of steel). I got sent home early for that and another of my trainers told me I wasn&#039;t cut out for this. I brought this up with my boss and he said he was inclined to agree. I asked to move to a different area with different trainers (I was about to go Private Pyle on these mfs) and he obliged. I went three months without scrapping any jobs (still made mistakes like bad pickups and not clearing the handle interrupt offset) but they were all fixable. My furnace blew out, I froze my ass off and came to work without sleep, leading the the vise incident. I was considered quiet but not a &quot;creep&quot;.

The wine gets (similar to the &quot;corker&quot;) a so-called off-tone, so an unpleasant aroma. The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;). Sometimes a goat-like odor is spoken of, which is why the name B\u00f6ckser is derived from &quot;buck&quot;.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B\u00f6ckser can develop as a result of improper production or incorrect storage and is more common in young wines. The &quot;B\u00f6ckser&quot; is one of the reduction aromas that occur in the absence of air and is caused by the presence of sulfurous substances in the wine. These are formed by yeasts during fermentation, mainly from sulfur-containing amino acids and from sulfites and sulfates.

I&#039;ve made a few beanies and there are some that are worked in the round like amigurumi and some where you just make a rectangle and sew it together (these can look good if you only work in one loop of the stitch so it looks ribbed like knit)</span><br>A beanie is probably the safest option. I&#039;d love to make some cat or bear ears on his beanie but I know he&#039;d never ever use it if I did that... So I&#039;d say a round amigurumi-esque beanie is the thing I&#039;ll be making and it has to be navy blue apparently so yeah that&#039;s pretty much it!

Your phone company is inspecting the header metadata (shit that&#039;s not data itself in data packets your phone sends to and receives from your nearest cell tower).<br><br>Data is not exchanged over the internet in a connection, like old-timey landlines, but in discrete chunks of data around which are wrapped identifying data. We call data about data metadata, and the data plus the metadata is the packet. This identifying data is located in the part of the packet called a header, which is similar in concept to the from and to parts of an postal envelope. Along with telling you where it&#039;s coming from and where it&#039;s going, it also includes a lot of other info.<br><br>One of the pieces of info included is the TTL (Time-To-Live), which is a number. This number is decremented by every node through which that packet passes. When this number reaches zero, the packet is discarded by the next node it encounters.

Otherwise you just built a radiator without any fins and a useless hose coming out the top. Presumably an intake on the bottom and an exhsut on top would let convection do its thing.<br><br>But here&#039;s the trick. A hose run through a pile of sand isn&#039;t a terribly great heat exchanger (you want to use a metal hose obviously, rather than something that would insulate the air in the hose from the warm sand. So basically you need a heat exchanger inside the pot to do the same job that fins on the outside of the pot did if you were using external convection instead of internal convection. Now, you might or might get decent results just coiling the tube all around in there. A typical, say, gas fired forced air furnace uses something much more like a car&#039;s radiator full of lots of channels and fins so that the air moving through the furnace has maximum surface area exposure to the heat of the flame. So if you have an old car radiator or intercooler or whatever then that might be a a substantial upgrade. I would also suggest keeping the diameter of the hose not very big so that once the convection gets going you&#039;ll have a reasonable velocity of air to act in a siphon-like fashion, since air, unlike water, is compressable and won&#039;t siphon as intensely based on a low pressure differential. A fan could cure this, but you can experiment with that as a later step.<br><br>In theory it should work, but you might need to mess around to get it to work well. I suspect you might have better results with water, since it stores and conducts heat relatively well, and all you&#039;d need to do is put a pressure relief valve on top in case you start boiling it. But there&#039;s no harm in trying sand (or even wet sand!) and not worry about venting pressure just to see.

Copper-sized tubes would be hard to weld as wall thickness is 0.8-1.2 mm, plus it would require you purging a line with argon so pipe doesn&#039;t sugar on the inside. Black iron pipe sized stainless pipe? Yes, it can be welded, even with stick, maybe you can get around the sugaring problem with some sort of flux instead of argon... But man it gets expensive.<br>Thus pro-press, flared and compression fittings are usable.<br>But then industry invented plastics. All sorts.

You&#039;ve identified HPMC as a rate controlling polymer, which is further than 90% of people would get (nice work!), but you have a lot of planning to do before you even hit the formulations stage.<br>You need to figure out how you plan on creating a homogeneous dry blend without a V-blender, also how will you test content uniformity of your tablets? Chromatography seems like it&#039;s off the table, but if you have an analytical balance you can do it by weight if your blend uniformity is good and your tablet weight and API amount are high enough. <br>How you will test dissolution of your tablets for the rate of release without a dissolution apparatus and chromatographic equipment? Getting an HPMC + API blend into tablet form isn&#039;t your biggest hurdle, it&#039;s making sure that the product doesn&#039;t dump API into your system too quickly and cause you to OD, or take 48 hours to release entirely. You have to know this information alongside having tested for proper distribution before you go munching your Kitchen Crank ER\u2122 Tablets (the force you compress the tablets with will also affect the release rate so it&#039;s not a single variable equation).<br>You haven&#039;t mentioned what API you are working with yet (do you have a CoA for it or know the purity?). You need to verify that there are no interactions between your API and excipients, which is usually conducted using IR spectroscopy, but you might be able to find literature on this pertaining to your specific API compound.<br>Even if you&#039;re successful with making a rate controlled tablet (which isn&#039;t impossible, but you have a ton of prep work to do) there are additional tests and variables that factor into your production process.<br><br>Very interesting thread, curious to see where it ends up, but I don&#039;t blame you if you choose not to pursue the project.

When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

Modern high power mode negotiation aside, USB isn&#039;t meant to deliver very much current, but if you average out your power demands over time, then it&#039;s entirely reasonable to use to, say, power a small audio amplifier where you&#039;d expect large transient demands for like kick drums or really loud sections, but well within the ability of the bus to power over the length of a song. So obviously what you wind up doing is chucking some appropriately sized capacitors in the power section to be able to take up the slack when more instantaneous current than USB can supply is required. But what happens when you plug in those empty capacitors? Bam it&#039;s basically a sustained short circuit from the perspective of the USB controller, so you have to put in reistors inline before them so that even if it were a short past the resistor it still wouldn&#039;t sink enough current to cause a problem. And that way the capacitors will slowly top themselves up as possible.<br><br>Ideally the H bridge would also take care of voltage spikes from an inductive load, but protection diodes (e.g. a zener after your input reisitors) might be enough beltt and suspenders without worrying about using an approrpiate choike or T/pi filter in line with the resistor.

Might as well add a 3-way wire nut on the incoming black as well, and then you have a single point of origin for the romex to your outlet.<br><br>If you want to do it the &quot;right way&quot; then now is the time to install a little junction box for your pair of 3-way wire nuts.<br><br>After that, you can use your outlet as the feed point for anything else you might want to add in the future. So like if you wire that in to the left side of your new outlet, then you can tap the next thing into the right side of the new outlet and just keep daisy chaining like that. That way you don&#039;t have to pony up for bus bars in place of your 3-way wire nuts.
