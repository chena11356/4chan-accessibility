When I say I action changes en masse, I mean 500-2000+ per batch, so the more Iogins I can juggle feasibly the faster I can work. Our database is also fucking slow (it&#039;s not uncommon for the thing to hang for 30+ seconds sometimes at certain steps in each action). And,<br>4. The VMs we use do not like being re-scaled. They bug the fuck if you try to change the window size, and they don&#039;t tile properly (I got IT to install Microsoft&#039;s FancyViews, but that didn&#039;t work); they are however fairly stable if you full-screen them, but they also run out of memory after a little while, if it&#039;s still responsive cool just close and open another, but when one gets stuck killing them from the process explorer kills all of them at once.

They often come with stickers, which you can read to figure out what version they are. Even if the memory (or memory inside something like a microcontroller) is erasable, in the early days this meant high-voltage programming. Having provisions for any sort of in-circuit-programming, let alone HV programming, increases board complexity. This added complexity is highly significant when it comes to gen-3 computing&#039;s parallel data and address lines.<br><br>In addition, so long as the socket&#039;s connections can be relied on, it&#039;s also a way of making repairs easier at the expense of adding a few dollars to the board cost. For something expensive like computer hardware it&#039;s likely always worth it, at least back when clock speeds were in the MHz. Now-days the size constraints, both in terms of compact design and in terms of minimising trace length, and also in terms of BGA chips with far greater pin-counts, make socketing undesirable.

It was the world&#039;s top producer of steel. It was of such strategic importance that the US Army set up an entire anti-ballistic missile system around the area, because it was assumed that it would be a prime target in any war.<br><br>Then, in the 1980s, the western world decided that manufacturing shit was lame, and we could just have Japan (later China/Vietnam/etc) do it instead. More profitable to build new factories in countries with none of those silly &quot;environmental protections&quot; or &quot;workers rights&quot;. So, all but *one* of the steel mills closed in the Pittsburgh area.<br><br>With the literal foundation of the area&#039;s economy removed overnight, work dried up left and right. It was basically as bad as the Great Depression. With no way to make a living, people left in droves. The neighborhoods where the mill workers and their families lived became empty shells. House values plummeted, and people were literally just abandoning their houses because the outstanding balance on their mortage was for more than the house was worth.<br>So you&#039;ve got these neighborhoods that have literally no jobs, very few people living there, and shit public services now that there&#039;s no revenue - but now tons of extra houses. This made rents ridiculously low, and the &quot;usual suspects&quot; moved in - the kinds of people who enjoy 9mm handguns and aren&#039;t concerned about working a job. Crime subsequently skyrocketed in those areas, preventing any significant investment or repopulation.<br><br>1/2", "time": 1674663708, "resto": 2549648}, {"no": 2549700, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:22:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2549698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2549698</a><br>2/2<br><br>It&#039;s now the late 90s, and Pittsburgh manages to make a miraculous economic recovery. The many universities and the city&#039;s extensive medical sector lead the way to it becoming an education/medicine/robotics type hub.<br>Other cities (e.g. Gary, Detroit, etc) didn&#039;t fare so well.<br>Fast forward to today. More young people are moving to Pittsburgh, and the young people born/raised there quit fleeing. The population still is on a very slight decline, since there is a massive population of old boomers which are dying off. This means that many of those houses that were abandoned in the 80&#039;s still haven&#039;t had any attention, and 40 years of neglect will really take a toll on any building.<br><br>As for /diy/ potential: Yes. Make sure you pick the right neighborhoods. The typical shitty &quot;house-flipper&quot; approach won&#039;t work very well, since there is no shortage of nicer homes for people with some money to move into.<br>You can buy properties that are currently very shitty for extremely low sums. If you put the work in to make them liveable (not &quot;fancy&quot;), they will absolutely sell/rent. Real /diy/ is required though, since they will probably need major work done.

The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;).

Once it has cooled, chip and scrape off whatever pieces of the result that you can. This is iron sulfide. Mixing iron sulfide with an acid will produce hydrogen sulfide gas, which is responsible for the smell of rotten eggs. You can hide a bottle acid in the ceiling, drop the FeS chunks in, and run away, or you can go the optional, slower release route. Make the hydrogen sulfide, and bubble it through the ammonia solution. This will create ammonium sulfide, which degrades back to hydrogen sulfide over time.

I had a good evening the other day with my king-of-random blast furnace. I melted aluminum over lump charcoal with a hairdryer in a silicon-graphite crucible. I made 2 ingots one run, and two more the next. I attempted a carbothermal reduction of ferrous oxide in a cermaic crucible I bought for $1 at goodwill, and another attempt in a glass crucible from goodwill. The ceramic crucible cracked, and the glass crucible melted, but didn&#039;t crack, but I didn&#039;t get a reduction. I cooked some pork chops and I beat on a railroad spike for a while until I ran out of charcoal. It was all really retarded and a lot of fun. I did it for like 6 hours. It was really hard work, really, and then I went to my job and swept the floor for 10 hours for $400 the next day.

When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

My job is cool because it&#039;s like truly neutral. I look after kids and play vidya with them which is like &quot;feminine&quot; stuff combined with &quot;masculine&quot; stuff and I have both male and female colleagues and the kids I have in my groups are not just boys but there are also girls so this thing shows how idiotic it is to think about stuff in some absolute binary thing instead of pretty neutral things that culture has assigned some labels but the labels are really pretty arbitrary or come from some old stuff that&#039;s not relevant anymore like how good wives would sew and knit and crochet and stuff and then the idea of those as something girly is blocking you guys from even trying. Idk I could build stuff too if I&#039;d practice and somehow got stronger but I honestly hated all the woodwork stuff we did at school because I hardly could use any tools and it took me ages to saw through stuff and the machines scared me (but painting the products was fun!) and my creations were bad...

When the cartridge is at the top of the magazine, and the bolt comes forward, the cartridge rides up the face of the feedramp so it can seat into the chamber. It&#039;s a disposable part because the copper jacket on the bullet wears the plastic surface and it&#039;s cheaper to just print a new feedramp. it works, it&#039;s fine, and it lasts long enough. <br>I have been thinking about how to make the feed ramp more resilient.

That is an option, but it&#039;s not repeatable. <br>I considered using steel flashing and trying to press a really thin layer over the surface of a plastic feedramp, and maybe JB welding it in, or bending ears over the side and securing it with a pin.

Chickens can be really fun to keep and watch and they do not need a lot of effort to keep happy.<br><br>Some pointers:<br>6-8 is a lot, if you are just looking to have fun pets and supply your family with eggs. I would recommend going for 3-4 hens, not more. That would give you a steady 3 eggs every day and I can tell you from experience that the novelty of having fresh eggs every day wears off rather fast and it can be hard to find people to give them away to at that quantity. Maybe look into getting a breed that is bred for looks and not so much for laying quantity, so you don&#039;t get swamped in eggs you cant use. Also chickens will tear the hell out of your yard. A good rule of thumb is about 10sqm (am eurofag) per bird if you want to keep the grass. If you plan on keeping them in an enclosed run then this will turn into a wasteland guaranteed, so preferably you would be able to let them have the run of your property and only keep them in an enclosed run when you are away for a time.<br><br>As for the coop:<br>You dont need to go for something overly large. The chickens will only use it to sleep and to lay eggs. Make it large enough that its easy to clean out. Keep the nesting boxes on the same height, you dont need one box for every hen, they will usually have a favourite and take turns laying. Also the roosting bar should be large enough for all of them, so there is no fighting about the best sleeping spot and put a large removable board under it, where the majority of shit lands on - makes cleaning so much easier.<br><br>Securing the run:<br>The main predator for chickens here in Europe is a type of mink. They can squeeze through pretty much everything that is larger than chicken wire, so that would be your go to material.

An angle grinder is, in my opinion, very rarely the best tool for the job. When you use them for things they *are* the best tool for the job for (removing mill scale from steel with a flap disk, for example) they are relatively safe.

By the time they are in high school, most kids dislike math and science because they think they&#039;re too hard. They aren&#039;t hard, they&#039;ve just been failed in one or more topics. Failing is a normal part of learning any subject, but schools don&#039;t give kids time to go back and retry things they didn&#039;t master the first time. So kids just accept that they &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; x subject and have to leave it at that because it&#039;s time to move on. Teachers have curriculum goals that they have to meet so that when standardized testing rolls around, enough kids can give enough right answers to keep the school funded.<br><br>Subjects like language arts and history are a lot harder to fail, because there&#039;s less to get wrong, so kids end up thinking these subjects are the only things they are &quot;good&quot; at. These subjects are often tested with essays read by human proctors, which are way more forgiving than multiple choice math and science.<br><br>When it comes time to graduate high school, theres enormous pressure on kids to go to college and pick a major. They, logically, want to pick a major they are likely to succeed at, so using their limited window into education and job training, they arrive at the conclusion that they have to take humanities.<br><br>In an ideal world, kids would learn hard subjects at their own pace, and take as much time to master subjects as they need.

Is there some kind of way I can insert a type of strainer under the toilets or something like that to catch a few tampons? I realize that\u2019s probably dumb but it\u2019s the only thing I can think of beyond cutting walls and coming up with some bizarre mess of plumbing. Any plumbers have a cover solution?

I just need to catch one or two tampons, that\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking about the strainer idea, even a very very wide strainer under a toilet might catch a tampon or two eventually, and once we find that we can take the next steps.", "filename": "D4413C3A-53B1-4CB2-8974-511A139B2C9F", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 870, "tn_w": 143, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1674000958398660, "time": 1674000958, "md5": "VNBv7FXY19ZYwCoisqo9qg==", "fsize": 113440, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-to-determine-which-tenant-is-flushing-tampons", "replies": 80, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 60}, {"no": 2544314, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:18:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Whatever you do maybe consider the legality of it first.

I&#039;ll repeat some of the details the few, very few, competent anons mentioned here. <br><br>A dental xray unit is fine in terms of xray energy for plants and shit. Focus may be a bit fuzzy but probably alright. Typical spot size is about 0.7-1mm for a dental tube. Go and find a microfocus source like that one anon said. <br><br>Bigger issue is the low duty cycle. Tube is designed to provide a relatively high dose of xrays briefly while the copper anode acts as a heat sink. That heat is then slowly rejected to the dielectric oil that fills the head. I don&#039;t have the datasheet for one of my tubes handy now but all of this is called out and it&#039;s fairly limiting in terms of what you can do. I had to go with a custom power supply as I wanted continuous operation at lower doses. You could find a more modern dental xray head that a switching power supply. The one I took apart had the ferrite transformer and multiplier inside the head and used a separate transformer for the filament. Control electronics were external and the head had divider resistors and a shunt for measuring tube voltage and current, respectively. Gotta make your own driver. Run the tube at your desired voltage which could be well under 70kV for optimal contrast with plants. Adjust your filament drive to get a low current through the tube such that it can operate continuously.", "time": 1673825067, "resto": 2541144}, {"no": 2542791, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:25:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Part 2 of my diary <br><br>Older xray cassettes are still available on eBay.

For detecting xrays and knowing if you have a leak somewhere, get a mica window geiger tube. Be mindful that geiger tubes saturate easily and if it stops counting that is indicative of a bunch of xrays coming out. Get a dosimeter just to be safe.

I brought the wheel out to test in the car and when attaching it up to my intended power source the car triggers the horn. I have an electrical diagnostic manual for my car so I referenced the horn circuit and it turns out it powers the horn when the circuit is closed (kind of obvious in hindsight). The doubly disappointing news is my other constant 12v power, which runs to the cruise control buttons, also triggers the horn when grounded because it shares the same inputs. I asked an electrical engineering friend if there was any way around it with the current layout and the only thing he could come up with was borrowing a signal wire from the cruise control circuit and redirecting it through a raspberry pi. From there I considered tearing down my clockspring and replacing the ribbon inside with one that contains more wires. I was wondering about amperage as well, so I googled how much amperage a clockspring could handle and happened upon this thread from someone asking the same question for the same application as mine: http://www.saturnfans.com/forums/sh<wbr>owthread.php?t=267981<br><br>In any case, my plan now is to salvage the clockspring from a newer car with more leads as well as from another identical Honda as mine and frankenstein the two together.

It&#039;s about as simple a 3d modeling program can get. You just create generic assets, like 2x4x8s and sheets of plywood, and copy/paste them as needed. I use the Pro version on a 30 day trail using accounts made with a throwaway email in order to have access to the 3d model and plug in warehouse which provides a lot of pre-made assets 1 click away, like pre-made water totes, vehicles, antennas, etc. I also used a number if plug-ins during the design such as a sun-orientation-adjuster so I can visualize how the sun will come in through the windows at different times of year as well ad a center-of-gravity plug in where I can give different materials different weights by volume to determine how heavy and balanced the structure is (important for a house on wheels).<br><br>Important! If you use sketchpad you need to be a organization nazi with the tagging system. Every asset you make will need a tag and if you duplicate an item it&#039;s tag moves with it. So if you want to show/hide parts of your structure you need to make sure the seperate sections do not overlap I&#039;m tags.<br><br>Wood boards that make up the framing should be tagged &quot;framing walls&quot; the foundation tagged &quot;foundation&quot; the roof framing &quot;framing roof&quot; etc. Then you csn show/hide each section as you want. BUT if you create a 2x4x8 and tag it &quot;framing walls&quot; then copy/paste it and use it for the roof, your tags will not show/hide correctly. You will have to go back to every copy/pasted instance of the asset used in the roof and re-tag it. Also grouping assets or turning them into components applies an additional tag on top of the original assets that needs to be managed too. So if you have studs tagged &quot;framing walls&quot; and you group all the south facing together and give it the tag &quot;framing walls south&quot; you will now need BOTH tags visible to see that wall.

I&#039;m no chimney sweeper, but installing oil and gas fireing systems is part of my job. When we install open gas &quot;furnaces&quot;, ovens or heating systems there is actually a formula and a bunch of rules of thumb with that you can calculate the need of air of an open fire regarding 2 points:<br>First one, &quot;mixing of exhaust fumes with fresh air&quot;, according to the law, is of course the protection of health and life - ever heared of carbon monoxide poisoning?<br>Second one is providing that your fire has enough &quot;fresh oxygen&quot; for the combustion itself - just because you light something on fire it doesn&#039;t mean its burning properly. Ever saw a coal rolling diesel engine? Its because the oxygen-combustion mix isn&#039;t right. <br><br>Now, how a chimney works is actually more than just &quot;hot smoke goes up&quot; - there is thermodynamics and very complicated shit - since its only a small part of my job I don&#039;t know everything about it. <br><br>Long story short - forget the glass. Your fireplace burns oxygen and the exhaust fumes go up into the chinmey - as long as there is new oxygen and some pressure to keep the chinmey system working.<br><br>What you need is ventilation, and as you don&#039;t want to open your windows you have 2 options: Picture related in your doors, you can actually use a jigsaw and some screws to install them. Alternatively you can make a core-drilling in some wall, preferably in the room of your fireplace, and put some faceplate there.<br><br>But forget about the glass, first of all its extremely hard as non-craftsman to properly process the right glass so it doesn&#039;t shatter and secondly your fire isn&#039;t gonna work anymore (or burn very shitty) as it can&#039;t get anymore oxygen.", "filename": "schlitz t\u00fcr", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 259, "h": 194, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674158137606132, "time": 1674158137, "md5": "rxi9/BYOHRbJ9GWcGeK8PA==", "fsize": 6598, "resto": 2545527}, {"no": 2545562, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)15:06:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2545527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2545527</a><br>I don&#039;t understand how a glass pane is gonna help your fire get more oxygen?
