If you haven&#039;t a recent eye exam get one and remember optometrists can write multiple prescriptions at one visit. I wear separate glasses for near vision and driving. Know what &quot;cheaters&quot; (plain magnifying lenses) are. Know the location of your local welding suppliers and visit them. <br><br>Different people prefer different tints and shade levels. I mostly weld with shade 9 gold or blue tinted lenses. <br><br>Have spare gloves (welding gloves are consumables) so you don&#039;t interrupt booth time replacing them. Have spare clear cover lenses for whatever helmet you wear because it&#039;s typical to expend one a day. You need to see to weld. Dress for work not the block and remember whatever you wear gets a spark bath. <br><br>A large visegrip plier is quite handy (I weld T-handles, just some 1/4&quot; scrap rod, to the adjusting knob to use it with gloves and because tightening the handle is vastly more powerful than manual squeeze.<br><br>See what the school issues for tools. Some don&#039;t issue small angle grinders because students destroy shit. Minimum personal grinder size should be a smallish bodied 6&quot; to use thin kerf cutting wheels as wells a 4-1/2&quot; rocks. If your school doesn&#039;t issue flap discs and you&#039;re not poor feel free to bring some. A rugged plastic bucket is the usual welder tote with an added rope handle.

The one thing I need to know myself is how this building method fares against handgun ammunition. I think the basic idea of having 2 different types of weaving improves it&#039;s effectivines. The light weave having 150g/m2 and the heavy around 800g/m2, first bolt of woven roving I bought had about 550g, I believe the 800, the second type I bought is falsely labeled as such. Hence epoxy consumption is the same as I calculated previously eith the first type<br><br>Anyways, I mentioned this a few times. I wrote emails to techthisoutmeow, a youtuber who specialized in diy ballistic armor. Drawing my inspiration mainly from him. Asked him if he&#039;s willing to either be sent test panels of mine or build after my method and finally shoot it with various calibers. A 18 (9 light 9 heavy) layers plate and a 18 + one or two layers porcelain shards + 6 layers plate. At minimum even the basic plate should stop some 9mm which is my greatest concern. But I want to know it&#039;s limits.<br><br>Also contacted the youtuber ZNA productions who made such plate and shot it. This info wasn&#039;t new at this time or anything but his vid is the most popular I think. I realy want to see results from this, even donating 10 bucks to both of them per month currently trough patreon, also to get into direct contact. Never used that before, also never had a youtube account or anything. Never &#039;liked and subscribed&#039; cuz that&#039;s gay and cringe. I just rarely want to see some kind of result from internet people, like that one time in dwarf fortress when I found out dorfs can not only wear armor fit for slightly smaller/larger animal people but also I found out that smaller weighs less and bice versa, there is also an overlap so to say, hyenna men and cougar men sized armor fits dorfs and humans alike, very useful if you have lots of humans who become citizens and you don&#039;t have to craft two sets of armor.<br><br>Appareantly nobody knew of this before and I asked the developer on his forum about this, what the actu", "time": 1668545808, "resto": 2500322}, {"no": 2503683, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)16:03:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2503680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503680</a><br>al size limits are and that the wiki is wrong about this subject.<br><br>tl dr I&#039;m autistic lulz<br><br><a href=\"#p2503591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2503591</a><br>yes I&#039;ve made a groin plate, which is the simplest piece as I wanted to make such plate too, it doesn&#039;t have curves or anything, simply a 33cm x 33cm rectangle.

You can find sites to tell you how to make those, but take a coat hanger, straighten out, and cut it to length. Use the formula 468/freq (in Mhz) then multiply by 12 to get inches for your length.
