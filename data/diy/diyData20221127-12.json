If it&#039;s based off a platform with continuing support replacing drivetrain is a option though.<br><br>Personally if I was going to get a ex-fleet vehicle to live in, I&#039;d pick a school bus. Lots more space than 26ft box truck, has built in man doors. Very strong bodies, busses are designed to keep unbelted children safe when they get t-boned. Depending on district most places cycle busses out when they hit 300k or when they hit 20~ years of age, typically age first if it&#039;s inner city, those machines don&#039;t travel far. Ritzy private schools often cycle them out much quicker, not uncommon to see a 10y/o bus with 80-k on the clock up for auction. License is dead easy to get, if you&#039;re too dumb to get it you&#039;re too retarded to DIY a place to live. Most of them are autos which saves them from most user error/abuse, all have commonly available diesel engines like caterpillar, detroit, etc. so ANY diesel shop can fix em if you can&#039;t. Worst case scenario you can drop in a new engine/trans of ANY brand, the bodies and drive trains are made separately then assembled when a fleet orders o there&#039;s a lot of interoperability, whether new new or from a wrecked big rig, box truck or school bus. Most have air brakes though, I personally prefer air brakes for a large commercial-sized vehicle for the reliability and backup they offer, but if that&#039;s a sticking point for you some districts use hydraulics. Buy one from a area that doesn&#039;t get real winters IE Arizona to limit rust. If you&#039;re in a area that gets winter have her undercoated and keep it clean and the body will last forever.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. used to drive school busses, currently drive big rigs.

I have confirmed the safety valve works by removing it, holding a lighter to the bulb, and blowing through where the propane goes.

But the perfect height for planing often is too low for other common bench tasks. For example, when routing, carving, cutting dovetails, or doing layout, I frequently have found myself bent over at an uncomfortable angle so that I could see clearly and work effectively. When performing these tasks, I like to have a workpiece positioned 6 in. to 10 in. above my waist level.<br><br>To bring a workpiece to my ideal height range, I made a small workbench that mounts quickly to my regular bench. When extra height is needed, the minibench effectively raises the work-surface to my comfort zone.
