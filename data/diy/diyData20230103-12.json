The only similarities that these two processes share is that they both use a slicer and the printers make things. The slicers that are available are extremely limited, unless you want to pay money for them. This is completely against the open source idea. Well you can use Pr*saSlicer if you want but unless you have one of their SLA printers, you are going to need to convert it into the format your printer uses. You know why? Because each manufacturer has their own bullshit proprietary format. So you have to use a program called UV Tools to convert it to the right format.<br>With my printer (chinkshit especial) connecting the printer via USB does nothing.mi either have to use WiFi, a USB stick, or Cr*ality&#039;s cloud app. No thanks for that.<br>The software is limited and it&#039;s bullshit. But you know what else is closed source? The fucking hardware. Which means you aren&#039;t going to do anything like put custom firmware on your machine. Some of them maybe I guess but it&#039;s nothing like putting Klipper on a FDM printer.

Hard to explain but basically when your printer moves it vibrates and the vibrations get transferred to your print. You could try printing slower, you could get some dampeners for your steppers. Preferably you would get your printer set up on Klipper and then go through the testing. You can also adjust your acceleration if you don&#039;t change the firmware. It could be mechanical though so check every screw on your frame and tighten your belts. Get a carpenter&#039;s square and make sure you frame is PERFECTLY square (if you haven&#039;t already).<br><a href=\"#p2533982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533982</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all arches are crappy at the top</span><br>Might be related to overextrusion. If you set the slicing right, your printer will slow down on overhangs/bridges like that.<br><br>If I was you, I would go through this guide to get everything set up: https://teachingtechyt.github.io/ca<wbr>libration.html . Its quite involved but really important to do, especially on an Ender 3. Watch the guy&#039;s video and then go through the process. After you can print his test print successfully, try the Benchy again. If you follow his calibration guide, your printer will print great. <br>What layer height are you using?

The cost to procure the item in question is entirely unrelated to this calculus, so put that out of your mind for now. Whether the offered price turns into a sale depends on whether anyone wants to buy the thing at that price, which depends on how much people want the thing (now how much it costs to procure the thing). The interplay of this over multiple sales determines a &quot;market price&quot;, for the item in question.

First, play some &#039;pink noise&#039; through your loudspeakers nice and loud. Go to the other room and listen - if you hear mainly a hissing sound, find the direction it&#039;s coming from and look around there for gaps and cracks between the loudspeaker and the receiving room. If it&#039;s a lower rumbling noise you hear, then the issue is mass so there&#039;s not much you can do without building a new or additional partition. <br><br>You could add some absorption inside your room, if so then get products which are min 25mm thick (so it will work better with lower end of human voice frequencies). Tack it to the wall at head height if you aren&#039;t covering the entire wall.

Do the math; you can get a pound of decent tobacco for like 15$ and tubes to go with it for another 5$ and make about 20 packs of cigarettes.<br>It&#039;ll probably average you around a dollar per pack or less.<br><br>One problem with doing this though is that the cigarettes won&#039;t be exactly like your favorite store brand. They won&#039;t taste exactly the same because cigarette manufacturers use a proprietary blend of flavors and treatments that is responsible for the distinct taste of their cigs. You can still find plenty of good quality, cheap tobacco (menthol, light, regular, extra bold, etc) but it will never be an exact match for your favorite brand.<br>Another thing is that these homemade ones will always burn just slightly differently than the industrial ones. Industrially made cigarettes are (AFAIK) made from a specially prepared reconstituted tobacco paper rather than shredded leaves. They do this to make things easier for their treatment steps, but also to make the mix have a 100% consistent texture and consistency that helps avoid problems with their processing and packing machinery. When you buy the cheap bags of raw tobacco, it&#039;s just leaves that have been cut/shredded to a consistency which is appropriate for rolling or tube packing cigs. So sometimes you may have a tiny inconsistency or packing error and wind up with a small void or an end of the tube that doesn&#039;t pack completely.<br><br>After you get familiar with the perfect amount of leaf to load in the machines chamber by doing a couple dozen cigs, you&#039;ll start to avoid this issue for the most part.<br><br>All in all, it&#039;s super cheap and easy to do and I&#039;m always amazed that more smokers don&#039;t RYO", "time": 1671219875, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523186, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Use your fingers roll em up<br>Look like a doobie man farout and groovy", "time": 1671220088, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523192, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:01:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523144</a><br>It can save you money, but it won&#039;t, it&#039;ll just give you the option to pop out $10-$20 cartons at will.<br><br>Fuck tubes, they&#039;re gross, and filling them yourself is a waste of time.<br>If you&#039;re going to roll your own, roll them.

They work great for a bit of usage then always have the same problem. I ended up buying an electronic one for a hundred dollars to test it out. Broke even in cost within 2 months, and actually had beer money left over after that. I kept having to travel for work and going out of town it wasn&#039;t practical to ever make enough to bring with and it was noticeable how fast buying packs would burn through cash. Even though it takes 5 minutes to make a pack worth of cigarettes with it usually it isn&#039;t worth the time compared to a tobacco pipe for me personally. Your mileage may vary. It was more than worth it for me the machines worked for over 5 years now (way more than I ever got out of hand crank ones) it&#039;s nice to be able to knock out a few really fast if I&#039;m in the mood for a cig, and they&#039;re convenient when walking around outside and it&#039;s windy on the way between the bar to pick up a few drinks. It can be difficult getting consistency in how tightly they&#039;re packed, with hand cranks you can pack a tube so tighly you basically can&#039;t keep it lit, electronic ones will jam and you can&#039;t force it and have to break it up and go with much looser packing in cigarettes, so you want to smoke them if you got them otherwise they&#039;ll tend to shake loose while you&#039;re walking around. It&#039;s not a big deal if you got a hard case you can just throw the shake back into the machine and repack it, tear off the empty part of the tube that it fell out, it can be annoying if you got like 3 half cigarettes, but you get a sense for which ones will do that and to smoke them first.

like that.<br><br>I prefer hand rolled. Packs are good but too expensive and honestly the additives in those cigarettes make them like 10 times more addictive. Like how you crave another cigarette right after smoking the first one. Don&#039;t have that with handrolled because it&#039;s pure tobacco. Pack cigs also have a sort of chemical flavour to it that you only really notice when you&#039;re used to hand rolled. Also way too expensive.<br><br>Machine made is a decent option although very messy and also an annoying task to do. Having to take extra time in the morning/before you go out/when the pack is empty to fill up another carton may seem like not a big deal but it really gets annoying after a while. It&#039;s also not a guarantee that every cigarette is going to be perfect. There&#039;s a certain learning curve to it where if you use too much tobacco the cigarette is impossible to smoke and if you use too little you smoke it in 10 seconds. Also annoying<br><br>Hand rolled are king imo. I smoke a 50gram pouch in a week with about 10-15 cigarettes a day. Comes down to about 45 euros a month on cigarettes, which to me is doable. Taste better and once you get the technique down right you can roll a perfect cig in under a minute, which is more convenient (to me) than having to machine out a whole pack every morning. Get a bag of those little filters and the rolling is much easier and the cigarette smokes nicer as well, no tobacco pieces in your mouth. Also nice for rolling the ocassional spliff.<br><br>When I go out to a party or a club though I&#039;ll usually just buy a small pack so I don&#039;t have to bother rolling a cig and can share with others.", "time": 1672733890, "resto": 2523144}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2527281, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:40:30", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/rcg/ Drone &amp; Radio Control general", "com": "In /rcg/ we discuss anything &amp; everything radio controlled: multirotors, fixed wing, cars, rovers, helis, boats, submarines, battlebots, lawnmowers, etc.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do I get started with racing drones?</span><br>https://oscarliang.com/build-racing<wbr>-drone-fpv-quadcopter/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about planes?</span><br>https://www.flitetest.com/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about aerial photography, is DIY viable?</span><br>If you want a practical flying camera platform, DJI is the sensible option.

I had a good evening the other day with my king-of-random blast furnace. I melted aluminum over lump charcoal with a hairdryer in a silicon-graphite crucible. I made 2 ingots one run, and two more the next. I attempted a carbothermal reduction of ferrous oxide in a cermaic crucible I bought for $1 at goodwill, and another attempt in a glass crucible from goodwill. The ceramic crucible cracked, and the glass crucible melted, but didn&#039;t crack, but I didn&#039;t get a reduction. I cooked some pork chops and I beat on a railroad spike for a while until I ran out of charcoal. It was all really retarded and a lot of fun. I did it for like 6 hours. It was really hard work, really, and then I went to my job and swept the floor for 10 hours for $400 the next day.

When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

By the time they are in high school, most kids dislike math and science because they think they&#039;re too hard. They aren&#039;t hard, they&#039;ve just been failed in one or more topics. Failing is a normal part of learning any subject, but schools don&#039;t give kids time to go back and retry things they didn&#039;t master the first time. So kids just accept that they &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; x subject and have to leave it at that because it&#039;s time to move on. Teachers have curriculum goals that they have to meet so that when standardized testing rolls around, enough kids can give enough right answers to keep the school funded.<br><br>Subjects like language arts and history are a lot harder to fail, because there&#039;s less to get wrong, so kids end up thinking these subjects are the only things they are &quot;good&quot; at.

So go ahead and give it some thought - you might be surprised at how much better off you&#039;ll be without that old, awful house.<br><br>And when you build that new house, make sure you power it entirely with propane.

Make damn sure that every single customer you work with posts something about you on either facebook or next-door and puts your phone number out there.

Rusty, splintery, poorly cared for tools are the mark of either a fucktard or a poser and you need to steer clear of them.<br><br>To condition your wooden tools, use a plane to take off the varnish and apply linseed oil. If your tool handle is oversized, you can use your plane to give it an octagonal shape which many old trades guys swear by for comfort. Allow it to cure completely, then apply at least one layer of Walrus Brand tool oil, both to the handle and to the steel head of whatever tool it is. If your tool (or PPE) has leather components, use Obenauf&#039;s leather oil and conditioner. If the tool is rusted, use steel wool or another abrasive to remove excess rust and restore remaining rust with 30% vinegar. If you&#039;re going to paint your tools, use the highest quality enamel paint you can get your hands on and follow the instructions else it will not last. Should your tool have moving internal parts, the manufacturer likely recommends specific products to lubricate with, and there are many different kinds of lubrication and grease that vary in their intended use (temperature/climate, use severity, etc).<br><br>So why am I telling you about restoring and conditioning your tools if you&#039;re interested in being a poser?

Anyone else have a wife that makes a lot more money than them? What is life like? Anons it is getting to be an insane disparity for me. I work in engineering in the Midwest USA meaning basically that at a country level I make shit pay. I make like $70k which is middling and I don&#039;t want to go into management. I met my wife like 5 years ago pre-covid. She is a programmer and once WFH happened she could work &#039;anywhere&#039; and her earning potential exploded. She now works for a tech company on the west coast and makes triple my salary. She has been promoted once already and she has been told she might become management and we still won&#039;t even have to move so it&#039;s probably going to be quadruple my salary soon. Anyone else in a marriage like this? I feel like I&#039;m dead weight holding us as a couple back. I&#039;m not even sure why I work any more. My engineering degree has been a huge bust. I&#039;m just wondering at what point is she going to realize I&#039;m a loser with no prospects and dragging her down instead of being with someone who makes comparable pay? As a couple she could easily be almost a millionaire with someone in a similar position to her. Also she&#039;s not bad with money per se but she is falling hard for lifestyle creep. She makes exponentially more money than either me or her former self and we don&#039;t even own a home or property. I try to save my meager wage and she keeps buying more things instead of saving her increases in pay. I don&#039;t know how to tell her to save money for a house without sounding like a bossy leech.

I&#039;m not writing this as a slight against you OP, it&#039;s just a bad mentality to have where the value we place on ourselves and our relationships is so dependent on how much money is earned. I get that it&#039;s necessary to survive, but it&#039;s an unfortunate reality that one is seen as less valuable in dating/working/social contexts because they don&#039;t work a stellar job; even if their character is impeccable. <br><br>You should also talk with your wife about your finances, how you plan to budget for necessary expenses, etc; but don&#039;t talk to her in a patronizing way about it. It&#039;s very true that most women aren&#039;t that great with money, there&#039;s a reason why most marketing targets women and most consumer spending is done by women. You both should have an agreed upon way of how your money is saved and spent, if you&#039;re pooling your earnings together. It&#039;s a top reason for divorces, so don&#039;t go in expecting things to work out perfectly.<br><br>You also seem a bit anxious about your worth relative to your wife, and fearful of abandonment if your perceived worth isn&#039;t enough for her. Talk to her about what she plans for in the future, what your relationship goals are, and find some reassurance.

If you&#039;re on a budget, Harbor Freight or the equivalent will have one cheap which should last you long enough.<br><br>I mentioned the voltage b/c the switch does a very simple thing. If the pressure in the tank falls below a set point, it closes the contacts you have circled in the original picture. Those contacts literally connect the black to black and white to white wires coming in and out of each conduit. One set comes from your breaker panel, and the other goes to your pump. That&#039;s it - contacts close, pump gets power, pump fills up pressure tank, contacts open, pump stops getting power.<br><br>if you measure the voltage coming from the panel (one black and one white) with your multimeter you&#039;ll get either ~120 or 240v. Most likely 240 unless you have some small pump. <br><br>you then want to check that the wires going to the pump are getting the same voltage when the contacts are closed.<br><br>Hope that makes sense - not trying to talk down to you, I&#039;m just not sure how much of the basics you have down.<br><br>If you are getting the same voltage on both sets of wires, your pump is getting the right voltage, and unfortunately your pump may be busted (at that point, get a well/plumber guy to come out and do some more testing)<br><br>If you&#039;re getting zero voltage on the pump side, the switch is not connecting them.

There is some variation in things like build size and exact resolution, but they are very simple machines that by all accounts are more or less functionally equal these days. That is, they can produce good detail and high resolution prints of complex models like miniatures. Compared to something like an SL1, they may have occasional minor horizontal lines, and they&#039;re likely slower to print, but at a fraction of the price they&#039;re much more economical. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I saw them selling another machine for wash and cure, and I think I&#039;d need that too</span><br>Washing and curing is something that needs to happen, but it doesn&#039;t need to happen in a purpose-made machine. You can use a large container (at least a gallon typically) of 90%+ isopropyl alcohol for washing, and a UV LED light for curing. If you&#039;re interested, you can use a lab-style magnetic stirrer and a large flask to do something like a purpose-made washer. However, there is a tradeoff between the pleasantness of the experience and the cost of equipment. A good washing/curing machine makes the process fast, easy, clean, and with minimal hassle. Doing everything manually can take a while and make a mess.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is this shit toxic?</span><br>In direct, actual toxicity, not remarkably so. The main concern is that prolonged exposure can sensitize an immune response and effectively make you allergic to it on further exposure. So resin should be kept off skin (wear rubber gloves), and it should be done in an area with good ventilation so as to avoid breathing the fumes. And the work area should be cleaned well when you&#039;re done if you spilled any resin. On that note, unless you&#039;ll always be using a single resin type, you should get some extra resin vats so you can swap them out without needing to clean out the resin. Vats with resin should be stored such that they don&#039;t vent fumes that can build up in inhabited areas.", "time": 1672423963, "resto": 2531610}, {"no": 2532340, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)13:16:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2532338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2532338</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and it should be done in an area with good ventilation so as to avoid breathing the fumes</span><br>OK, so no doing this shit in my bedroom, then.<br>Maybe I&#039;ll splurge some extra 190 bucks for the wash and cure station just for making things easier.<br>Thanks for the help.", "time": 1672424195, "resto": 2531610}, {"no": 2532341, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)13:17:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2532318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2532318</a><br><a href=\"#p2532338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2532338</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this thing would be in my room</span><br>Generally a bad idea for any 3D printer.

There was a TON of ghosting in the prints. Why? They use plastic parts on areas that should be made out of hardened aluminum or steel. It is missing the front of the frame so the sides are free to move about. The accordion enclosure, if you can call it that, looks like shit. The entire printer just looks like a fucking toy. <br><br>I don&#039;t hate prusa but they really are full of themselves. Having owned the MK3S+, the Ender 5 Pro, and the Ender 6, I gotta say just get yourself a chinese printer, add a v6 hotend, add a bltouch, and call it a fucking day. Once you learn how to slice and set deceleration in marlin or set your acceleration to be slower, enable z hop, etc in cura, you will print on par or better than anything Prusa will offer. Prusa printers are slow. The MK3S+ takes 2 hours 17 minutes to print a fucking benchy and you can&#039;t even read the rear license plate. The max travel speed on the XL will ONLY be 200MM/s and like 100MM/s print speed.The one I saw at maker fair was printing at 80mm/s and the prints all came off looking worse than a stock ender 6 with that cheap ass $12 mk8 hotend. The XL is suppose to have a very high end hotend but it really doesn&#039;t seem to translate well. CoreXY printers need the belts super tight and the ones on the XL were very slack. You would think for a $2000 base model printer it would be better. About the only thing I liked was the build size of 360x360x360. But when was the last time you ever printed anything that large? You have to need it to want it. Especially at this price point.

You will pay accordingly for the quality, but these do last several years.<br>But, ultimately the most DIY feasible solution is just to apply phosphorescent paint that reacts to UV light, and then use a UV light to illuminate it.

I make these sorts of things custom at work as needed, but it would probably be more economical for you to buy something premade unless you have a decent metal workshop.

Shrapnel protection for children. Reading about it on https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak_jac<wbr>ket <br><br>During the Korean and Vietnam wars, the flak jacket was changed and the manganese steel plates were replaced by other materials.[5] The U.S. Army&#039;s vests (Body Armor, Fragmentation Protective, Vest M69) weighed under eight pounds and were made of 12 layers of ballistic nylon. The vests used by the U.S. Marines (Vest, Armored M-1955) weighed more than ten pounds and were a combination of ballistic nylon layers and fiberglass plates known as Doron.[3] Doron was made of fiberglass fibers placed in an ethyl cellulose resin under high pressure. It was named after then-Colonel Georges F.

They&#039;re more efficient than a regular wood stove because they burn using a forced convection system, and as a result of the forced convection and their high density they burn at a much higher temperature than regular wood.

The process of making charcoal is essentially the same thing as what&#039;s happening in a gasifier, except by separating those processes you&#039;d be losing out on the stream of volatile exhaust gases that come out of the charcoal and relying solely on the carbon monoxide to fuel your car.

It is not a microcontroller. It does have some I/O pins, but the OS mostly gets in the way of using them. And you have to deal with it like a full computer, keeping the OS running, etc.<br>A microcontroller has nothing but maybe a bootloader. Any OS is built into your project. And there is usually nothing like a file system or network ports.<br><br>It&#039;s also that much more to throw out when (not if) something gets zapped. I was making a chip reader with a blue pill, and accidentally touched a +12 wire to an I/O pin, and now the thing runs hot because of the blown pin. I knew what I was doing, and was being careful, and still zapped it. I&#039;m kind of surprised that&#039;s the only time, there were other times I thought I had, and was wrong. But I started with a bag of twenty for $40 including shipping, seven-ish years ago, and most are still in the bag. And even then, it&#039;s only the main chip. I have some lower-spec ST chips that should drop right in.<br>The main thing you want when playing around with microcontrollers is to have identical spares around. You still want to be careful whenever you hook it up to something, but when it happens you need to be able to pull out another one and get back to work. If you had to change chip type, you would have to fuck with your build configuration. Also it lets you keep more than one project in progress at the same time. Blue pill is about as chink as you can get and still be able to get more.<br><br>The thing about micro:bit is that it already has a few useful things on the board (like the LED matrix), so you can do stuff without hooking it up anything, and it has the &quot;better&quot; I/O pins brought out to big holes you can clip to.

So that&#039;s 9 multiplications (2 cycles each) and 6 additions (1 cycle each) per transform, not sure to what extent I need load instructions or if I can directly act on my registers. I also need to use a sine lookup table, probably also a cosine lookup table, which I&#039;m guessing takes a clock cycle or two to fetch a value from. So minimum 30 cycles per double transform, probably more like 33-42. The PI controller is not something I&#039;m sure how to implement live in an MCU, though I think it&#039;s just a Z-transform-based thing that has Out(n+1) be a function only of In(n), In(n+1), and Out(n). So I&#039;m guessing maybe 12-20 cycles each. Then another pair of additions, then the inverse matrix, then the inverter. For the inverter I&#039;ll just be feeding the values into three CMP registers of a timer&#039;s PWM.

I was thinking about using a current transformer to measure load current and line voltage (line voltage measured with a resistor in series with current transformer) and an ADC connected to a microcontroller. The issue I came across is that the line voltage is mostly a sinusoidal wave, while the load current can be really fucked up. How would I go to measure the power when the current has all sorts of frequencies, including some high frequency in the case of some loads such as switch mode power supplies. In other words, how would I design a reliable current sensor that can handle such loads and measure the real power used by the load? Bonus points if it can also measure reactive power.<br><br>FROM THE PREVIOUS THREAD:<br><a href=\"/diy/thread/2519612#p2526860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526860</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gotta multiply instantaneous current by instantaneous voltage, and make some sort of weighted running average. Probably using DSP, since analogue multiplication is hard. Also consider a transformer or isolated ADC+divider for mains voltage, to prevent the majority of your digital circuitry from being mains referenced. A differential amplifier measuring live-neutral and referencing it to ground also works. Naturally you&#039;ll need anti-aliasing filters to obey the nyquist sampling theorem on both ADC inputs. Figuring out the power factor and reactive and apparent powers would just be a software problem.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As for the sensor itself, hall or shunt would be my desire, as current draws aren&#039;t necessarily symmetrical around 0V (see half-wave rectifiers</span><br><br>Can you go in more detail about the following?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;ll need anti-aliasing filters to obey the nyquist sampling theorem on both ADC inputs</span><br>If I am only interested in power (and not recreating the signal), is the nyquist rate important at all?

Worst case you&#039;ve got an SMPS putting out high frequency current noise so you just get a bunch of aliases wildly throwing off the power factor calculations. At least dampening them with a low pass filter doesn&#039;t give false frequency spikes. Arguably you might be fine with a pretty low frequency for your ADC, since parallel caps and series chokes are everywhere, though it depends on the purpose of your power measurement.

If you increase the Nyquist frequency significantly past your desired bandwidth, then you&#039;ll have more room for attenuation. Say if your desired bandwidth is 4kHz, and you want 60dB of attenuation, then a 5kHz nyquist frequency means 60dB/0.1dec = 600dB/decade (30 pole filter lmao). If you set the nyquist frequency to 100kHz then that means 60dB/1.4dec = 43dB/decade (2 pole filter). N bits of effective resolution means 20*log(2^N)dB of SNR (8bit = 48dB), but there&#039;s nothing stopping you from choosing a desired effective resolution lower than your ADC&#039;s resolution, which reduces the required filter attenuation.<br><br>t. retard who&#039;s never built an anti-aliasing filter before<br><br><a href=\"#p2526957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526957</a><br><a href=\"#p2526962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526962</a><br>gratz", "time": 1671699428, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526964, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)03:57:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526957</a><br>oh you changed it, yes that&#039;s what I found as well.", "time": 1671699447, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526965, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)03:59:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526963</a><br><a href=\"#p2526964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526964</a><br>yeah sorry I meant R2/R1, have it on paper and copied to mspaint incorrectly<br>thanks for checking", "time": 1671699546, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526966, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)04:01:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526954</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do I need some sort of active filter</span><br>Usually a good idea if you&#039;re after more than 1 pole (20dB/decade) of attenuation.

The Arduino IDE has a function called &quot;tone()&quot; that uses the aforementioned timer hardware to play a note.

In addition, I&#039;m not too sure how you&#039;d get two pins operating as a synchronous push-pull waveform output, you&#039;d likely have to write your own replacement for the tone function in order to use two timer pins with the same comparator value but with one inverted.<br>Pic related is my own shitty code from 2 years ago for an rgbduino (the one with the anime girl on it) to play megalovania when you plug it in. I used python to generate the array of note values from a midi file.<br>FYI, I&#039;d refrain from using unmodified Arduino hardware as the built-in LEDs make low-power operation pretty tough; you&#039;d eat through the batteries kinda quickly.

And using more flux than necessary never hurts. The solder is probably unknown chinese metal which doesn&#039;t help but it should be usable enough. If it&#039;s a chinese kit then it&#039;s probably one of those wall powered irons with a little temperature dial on it. The temperature probably isn&#039;t accurate so just turn it up so that the solder melts within one or two seconds of touching the iron.

If we want 20 mA going through LED, we would need to push transistor to amplify it to something like 200 mA, but it wouldn&#039;t reach that because it will saturate before it could pull that much current. For V1 = 9V and Vbe = 0.6V and gain of 80, to get 200 mA capacity R1 would need to be R = (9V - 0.6V)/(200mA/80) = 33600 ohm. You can safely use even something like 10k, 33.6k is maximum value that would work as intended. This will turn transistor into a switch which would have 0.2V across collector and emitter. Now you just need to select R1 to limit current through LED. For 20 mA, R = (V1 - Vled - Vsat)/I_led = (9V - 3V - 0.2V)/20mA = 290 ohm.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and does the led have a voltage drop or resistance?</span><br>It has both.
