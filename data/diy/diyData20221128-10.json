The stovetop works but the oven part does not. Everything in it is mechanical except the clock and the spark wires that light the gas, so it&#039;s not an electrical problem. The gas flow is good enough to light all four stovetop burners on full blast simultaneously. <br>Inside, when I turn on the oven, it clicks and lights the pilot. The pilot flame comes on after a concerningly long amount of clicking (which I attribute to mice chewing on the wires to the spark), but the rest of the pipe never lights. It is equipped with a mercury capillary-driven safety valve with a bulb over the pilot light, so if the pilot goes out the gas will stop. I have confirmed the safety valve works by removing it, holding a lighter to the bulb, and blowing through where the propane goes. After about 10 seconds of heat on the bulb I can feel it suddenly open up and air comes out where it&#039;s meant to. The main pipe the oven flames are supposed to come from is not clogged, it&#039;s not even dirty. <br>It does have a regulator on the back, which I have never touched. I&#039;ve read online that in many cases the regulator is just for the oven part and if it fails the stovetop will still work. How can I test if the regulator is bad without buying a new one, since it&#039;s practically antique?

If it&#039;s based off a platform with continuing support replacing drivetrain is a option though.<br><br>Personally if I was going to get a ex-fleet vehicle to live in, I&#039;d pick a school bus. Lots more space than 26ft box truck, has built in man doors. Very strong bodies, busses are designed to keep unbelted children safe when they get t-boned. Depending on district most places cycle busses out when they hit 300k or when they hit 20~ years of age, typically age first if it&#039;s inner city, those machines don&#039;t travel far. Ritzy private schools often cycle them out much quicker, not uncommon to see a 10y/o bus with 80-k on the clock up for auction. License is dead easy to get, if you&#039;re too dumb to get it you&#039;re too retarded to DIY a place to live. Most of them are autos which saves them from most user error/abuse, all have commonly available diesel engines like caterpillar, detroit, etc. so ANY diesel shop can fix em if you can&#039;t. Worst case scenario you can drop in a new engine/trans of ANY brand, the bodies and drive trains are made separately then assembled when a fleet orders o there&#039;s a lot of interoperability, whether new new or from a wrecked big rig, box truck or school bus. Most have air brakes though, I personally prefer air brakes for a large commercial-sized vehicle for the reliability and backup they offer, but if that&#039;s a sticking point for you some districts use hydraulics. Buy one from a area that doesn&#039;t get real winters IE Arizona to limit rust. If you&#039;re in a area that gets winter have her undercoated and keep it clean and the body will last forever.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. used to drive school busses, currently drive big rigs.

Tinned copper, silicone insulation.<br>What seems to be the go-to in the DIY battery pack and RC world is those very flexible silicone wires, the 10AWG ones on Amazon/Aliexpress for example seem to have 1050 (!) 0.08mm copper tinned strands.<br><br>Surely those 10AWG 1050 strands must have more resistance and lower amp rating than say a 10AWG 78 tinned copper strands wire, don&#039;t they? All that tin and shit. Is the difference significant?
