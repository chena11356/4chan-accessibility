I&#039;ve spent the past 6 years of my life researching everything there is to know about masonry and stone buildings. <br><br>You presented us with the question of whether or not this is feasible. I am happy to inform you that yes, this is 100% feasible and could easily be done. You are a citizen located in New England, this area of the US is almost completely earthquake free, so the option of making a traditional stone tower is possible. <br><br>There are pros and cons to this idea of yours. The biggest con is that to make a traditional tower, you&#039;ll need to shape each and every stone. Without going into it too much, you&#039;re not equipped nor skillful enough to make a traditional stone tower, nor would I advise you do so. <br><br>Your best and only hope is to create this stone tower using the slip form masonry technique. Utilizing this technique, you can simply gather stones of varying size, place them within your form, and apply cement to bond it all together. You&#039;ll also be using rebar throughout the entire structure to keep it held structurally sound. Now as you&#039;re beginning to build, you&#039;ll want a strong and wide foundation, and each layer of stone should be smaller than the previous layer. This will give your tower a strong base, and it will be reinforced with steel. Will your tower last for 150 years? No, but with simple repairs, it can last indefinitely. The mortar can be replaced, stones can be put back in. You can do this if you put your mind to it. <br><br>The floorboards and supporting wood can either rest directly on the stone wall of the tower, or you can build a wooden frame inside the tower, and build your interior that way. I&#039;m not sure which I&#039;d prefer, but these are choices you alone must make. <br><br>You&#039;ll want knowledge of concrete, and you&#039;ll want to understand loads and a bit of symmetry. The proportions if this tower must be equal. Consider also the drainage for your tower.

These tend not to be great, as can be seen by the roughness of your cuts. They generally have too much set and are sharpened all from one side so the burr is all on ones side of the saw which causes tracking issues. If it always pulls to the same side you can lightly stone that side, just a pass or two, then test again, may solve your issue, use a cheap fine/extra fine stone that you do not care about,those impulse hardened teeth will put a grove in the stone.<br><br>I always cut such joints to be a bit proud, much easier to make them flush with a plane or flush cut saw after the fact than get them perfect. Pine is generally best done with a flush cut saw but a finely set low angle block plane will do the job as well but make sure it is set as fine as you can, pine end grain does not take well to planes. Using a back saw to make them flush will probably not work well since the spine will prevent the saw from laying flush, you will end up cutting into the the other board as well.

Because the input voltage to the feedback pin will equal the reference voltage during normal operation. It\u2019s common practice to use a much smaller resistor (milliohms) and add an op-amp differential amplifier with a gain of 100 or so. Just ensure that your op-amps can sense and output close to he ground rail. This is what those LM2596 modules with more than one trimpot do, though they\u2019re bucks.<br><br>Another modification is to add external error amplifiers And an external reference voltage that you can adjust by hand (or via a DAC) for current or voltage control. Especially for a buck converter, this lets the voltage or current output be lower than what would equal the reference voltage.<br><br>You can also have both current and voltage feedback by using diodes to combine the signals from both a voltage divider and a current sense amplifier, such that the higher of the two voltages will enter the feedback pin. It\u2019s also an option to use a diode to implement overtemperature protection from a thermistor voltage divider.

A rapid start ballast will have a more or less constant current into the lamp. The exact power delivered will depend on the lamp. for instance, more voltage will appear across a longer lamp. More voltage at same current gives higher power, which is why the ballast can be used with the variety of lamps of differing power listed in the ballast specs. You may have more ballast choices than it seems. I could be wrong, but I think a sure thing would be to find a ballast with 2 output leads having a compatible power level when used with a compact lamp like you have.", "time": 1673062601, "resto": 2533439}, {"no": 2537363, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:45:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2537206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2537206</a><br>Resin 3D printer works well, ~50 micron resolution out of the cheap ones, fancier ones now push &lt;30 microns.<br>Scale your shit appropriately and bring it into UVTools, slap your board down into the vat, expose it.<br>Depending on your printer, it might be easier to stick the board directly to build plate with some hot glue.<br>Works as solder mask, works to add a silkscreen, pretty versatile process.<br>If you pick up a spare vat cheap, you can use actual UV solder mask, but don&#039;t do it in your normal vat.<br>It&#039;s a massive bitch to clean out, it&#039;ll tint or otherwise fuck with your resin for actual printing.", "time": 1673063107, "resto": 2533439}, {"no": 2537367, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:50:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2537358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2537358</a><br>A note unrelated to the replacement problem: many 4 pin lamps can also be used with a rapid start ballast.

Also, in general, use of rapid start ballasts will shorten lamp life when compared to programmed start ballasts that preheat the electrodes before ignition (two wires per lamp end).

First off, that roof is as crooked as a dog&#039;s hind leg. And those windows are fogged up worse than my old truck in the morning. The front door is hanging on by a thread, just like my patience with Bobby sometimes. And that yard is a mess - there are weeds everywhere. It&#039;s just not a very good-looking house at all.<br><br>You know what I&#039;d do if I were in your shoes? I&#039;d tear that old house down and start fresh. It ain&#039;t worth the time and effort to try and fix it up. And you&#039;ll save yourself a lot of headaches if you just start over. Who knows, you might even end up with a better house in the end. It&#039;s definitely worth considering. So go ahead and give it some thought - you might be surprised at how much better off you&#039;ll be without that old, awful house.<br><br>And when you build that new house, make sure you power it entirely with propane. You know, propane is the ultimate energy source. It&#039;s clean, it&#039;s reliable, and it&#039;s affordable. Plus, you don&#039;t need no fancy electricity to run your appliances and lights. Just beautiful, clean propane for everything. You&#039;ll save money on your utility bills and you&#039;ll be doing your part to help the environment. So go ahead and make the switch to propane - you won&#039;t regret it.<br><br>Peggy, have I told you about my idea for an all-propane house? Think about it - no more expensive electricity bills, no more worrying about power outages. Just beautiful, clean propane for everything. It&#039;s not like we need all those fancy electrical gadgets anyway. I mean, what did we do before we had electricity? We managed just fine. So let&#039;s do it - let&#039;s build an all-propane house and make the switch to a simpler, more efficient way of living.<br><br>We should do it Peggy, we could make it real.

Rusty, splintery, poorly cared for tools are the mark of either a fucktard or a poser and you need to steer clear of them.<br><br>To condition your wooden tools, use a plane to take off the varnish and apply linseed oil. If your tool handle is oversized, you can use your plane to give it an octagonal shape which many old trades guys swear by for comfort. Allow it to cure completely, then apply at least one layer of Walrus Brand tool oil, both to the handle and to the steel head of whatever tool it is. If your tool (or PPE) has leather components, use Obenauf&#039;s leather oil and conditioner. If the tool is rusted, use steel wool or another abrasive to remove excess rust and restore remaining rust with 30% vinegar. If you&#039;re going to paint your tools, use the highest quality enamel paint you can get your hands on and follow the instructions else it will not last. Should your tool have moving internal parts, the manufacturer likely recommends specific products to lubricate with, and there are many different kinds of lubrication and grease that vary in their intended use (temperature/climate, use severity, etc).<br><br>So why am I telling you about restoring and conditioning your tools if you&#039;re interested in being a poser?

You shouldn&#039;t be seeing blue with just the fuel on, you also don&#039;t have to make a huge acetylene flame before lighting the oxy, I&#039;d say once the flame has volume and is putting out thick black smoke then you&#039;re good for the oxy. When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

By the time they are in high school, most kids dislike math and science because they think they&#039;re too hard. They aren&#039;t hard, they&#039;ve just been failed in one or more topics. Failing is a normal part of learning any subject, but schools don&#039;t give kids time to go back and retry things they didn&#039;t master the first time. So kids just accept that they &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; x subject and have to leave it at that because it&#039;s time to move on. Teachers have curriculum goals that they have to meet so that when standardized testing rolls around, enough kids can give enough right answers to keep the school funded.<br><br>Subjects like language arts and history are a lot harder to fail, because there&#039;s less to get wrong, so kids end up thinking these subjects are the only things they are &quot;good&quot; at. These subjects are often tested with essays read by human proctors, which are way more forgiving than multiple choice math and science.<br><br>When it comes time to graduate high school, theres enormous pressure on kids to go to college and pick a major. They, logically, want to pick a major they are likely to succeed at, so using their limited window into education and job training, they arrive at the conclusion that they have to take humanities.<br><br>In an ideal world, kids would learn hard subjects at their own pace, and take as much time to master subjects as they need.

Thin wall ferrules are for low-pressure applications that just need to seal, and small ones are just over 1/16&quot; thick. They&#039;re easy to weld in a single pass with full penetration on a comparatively thick shell/whatever. Heavy wall ferrules are for pressure vessels, and have significantly thicker walls. They&#039;re typically welded in multiple passes on much thicker material.<br><br>Regarding fittings, one option is to use triclamp caps with various attachments welded on. I make these sorts of things custom at work as needed, but it would probably be more economical for you to buy something premade unless you have a decent metal workshop. Compared with threaded fittings, they would be more expensive, but access and sealing would be easier.

Ideally modern buildings yes they would have the ground wire on each device (switch) but it still isn&#039;t necessary as it just prevents the mounting metal from getting energized.

Two on one pole so that one line is always connected and then one on the other side that only activates when the switch is in the &quot;on&quot; position. Essentially the feeder line is getting split up into 2 outgoing lines, but only one of those lines is controlled by the switch. This is a common wiring technique for switches so that they don&#039;t have to pigtail the hot line (instead they are just using the one screw on the switch as the pigtail if that makes sense).<br><br>When in doubt, if you are just trying to replace the switch to say change the color/style/it&#039;s broken take a picture like you did and hook every wire back up to the new one the exact same way as the old.

Then after 2-3 minutes its like it senses the temp getting too hot and then the blower turns on as a failsafe.

Make damn sure that every single customer you work with posts something about you on either facebook or next-door and puts your phone number out there. Also get 500 flyers for your services off vista print.<br><br>No an LLC is a waste of time for the money you are gonna make.

I&#039;m not writing this as a slight against you OP, it&#039;s just a bad mentality to have where the value we place on ourselves and our relationships is so dependent on how much money is earned. I get that it&#039;s necessary to survive, but it&#039;s an unfortunate reality that one is seen as less valuable in dating/working/social contexts because they don&#039;t work a stellar job; even if their character is impeccable. <br><br>You should also talk with your wife about your finances, how you plan to budget for necessary expenses, etc; but don&#039;t talk to her in a patronizing way about it. It&#039;s very true that most women aren&#039;t that great with money, there&#039;s a reason why most marketing targets women and most consumer spending is done by women. You both should have an agreed upon way of how your money is saved and spent, if you&#039;re pooling your earnings together. It&#039;s a top reason for divorces, so don&#039;t go in expecting things to work out perfectly.<br><br>You also seem a bit anxious about your worth relative to your wife, and fearful of abandonment if your perceived worth isn&#039;t enough for her. Talk to her about what she plans for in the future, what your relationship goals are, and find some reassurance.

Shrapnel protection for children. Reading about it on https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak_jac<wbr>ket <br><br>During the Korean and Vietnam wars, the flak jacket was changed and the manganese steel plates were replaced by other materials.[5] The U.S. Army&#039;s vests (Body Armor, Fragmentation Protective, Vest M69) weighed under eight pounds and were made of 12 layers of ballistic nylon. The vests used by the U.S. Marines (Vest, Armored M-1955) weighed more than ten pounds and were a combination of ballistic nylon layers and fiberglass plates known as Doron.[3] Doron was made of fiberglass fibers placed in an ethyl cellulose resin under high pressure. It was named after then-Colonel Georges F.

The only similarities that these two processes share is that they both use a slicer and the printers make things. The slicers that are available are extremely limited, unless you want to pay money for them. This is completely against the open source idea. Well you can use Pr*saSlicer if you want but unless you have one of their SLA printers, you are going to need to convert it into the format your printer uses. You know why? Because each manufacturer has their own bullshit proprietary format. So you have to use a program called UV Tools to convert it to the right format.<br>With my printer (chinkshit especial) connecting the printer via USB does nothing.mi either have to use WiFi, a USB stick, or Cr*ality&#039;s cloud app. No thanks for that.<br>The software is limited and it&#039;s bullshit. But you know what else is closed source? The fucking hardware. Which means you aren&#039;t going to do anything like put custom firmware on your machine. Some of them maybe I guess but it&#039;s nothing like putting Klipper on a FDM printer.

Hard to explain but basically when your printer moves it vibrates and the vibrations get transferred to your print. You could try printing slower, you could get some dampeners for your steppers. Preferably you would get your printer set up on Klipper and then go through the testing. You can also adjust your acceleration if you don&#039;t change the firmware. It could be mechanical though so check every screw on your frame and tighten your belts. Get a carpenter&#039;s square and make sure you frame is PERFECTLY square (if you haven&#039;t already).<br><a href=\"#p2533982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533982</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all arches are crappy at the top</span><br>Might be related to overextrusion. If you set the slicing right, your printer will slow down on overhangs/bridges like that.<br><br>If I was you, I would go through this guide to get everything set up: https://teachingtechyt.github.io/ca<wbr>libration.html . Its quite involved but really important to do, especially on an Ender 3. Watch the guy&#039;s video and then go through the process. After you can print his test print successfully, try the Benchy again. If you follow his calibration guide, your printer will print great. <br>What layer height are you using?

The cost to procure the item in question is entirely unrelated to this calculus, so put that out of your mind for now. Whether the offered price turns into a sale depends on whether anyone wants to buy the thing at that price, which depends on how much people want the thing (now how much it costs to procure the thing). The interplay of this over multiple sales determines a &quot;market price&quot;, for the item in question.

First, play some &#039;pink noise&#039; through your loudspeakers nice and loud. Go to the other room and listen - if you hear mainly a hissing sound, find the direction it&#039;s coming from and look around there for gaps and cracks between the loudspeaker and the receiving room. If it&#039;s a lower rumbling noise you hear, then the issue is mass so there&#039;s not much you can do without building a new or additional partition. <br><br>You could add some absorption inside your room, if so then get products which are min 25mm thick (so it will work better with lower end of human voice frequencies). Tack it to the wall at head height if you aren&#039;t covering the entire wall.

They won&#039;t taste exactly the same because cigarette manufacturers use a proprietary blend of flavors and treatments that is responsible for the distinct taste of their cigs. You can still find plenty of good quality, cheap tobacco (menthol, light, regular, extra bold, etc) but it will never be an exact match for your favorite brand.<br>Another thing is that these homemade ones will always burn just slightly differently than the industrial ones. Industrially made cigarettes are (AFAIK) made from a specially prepared reconstituted tobacco paper rather than shredded leaves. They do this to make things easier for their treatment steps, but also to make the mix have a 100% consistent texture and consistency that helps avoid problems with their processing and packing machinery. When you buy the cheap bags of raw tobacco, it&#039;s just leaves that have been cut/shredded to a consistency which is appropriate for rolling or tube packing cigs. So sometimes you may have a tiny inconsistency or packing error and wind up with a small void or an end of the tube that doesn&#039;t pack completely.<br><br>After you get familiar with the perfect amount of leaf to load in the machines chamber by doing a couple dozen cigs, you&#039;ll start to avoid this issue for the most part.<br><br>All in all, it&#039;s super cheap and easy to do and I&#039;m always amazed that more smokers don&#039;t RYO", "time": 1671219875, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523186, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Use your fingers roll em up<br>Look like a doobie man farout and groovy", "time": 1671220088, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523192, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:01:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523144</a><br>It can save you money, but it won&#039;t, it&#039;ll just give you the option to pop out $10-$20 cartons at will.<br><br>Fuck tubes, they&#039;re gross, and filling them yourself is a waste of time.<br>If you&#039;re going to roll your own, roll them.

like that.<br><br>I prefer hand rolled. Packs are good but too expensive and honestly the additives in those cigarettes make them like 10 times more addictive. Like how you crave another cigarette right after smoking the first one. Don&#039;t have that with handrolled because it&#039;s pure tobacco. Pack cigs also have a sort of chemical flavour to it that you only really notice when you&#039;re used to hand rolled. Also way too expensive.<br><br>Machine made is a decent option although very messy and also an annoying task to do. Having to take extra time in the morning/before you go out/when the pack is empty to fill up another carton may seem like not a big deal but it really gets annoying after a while. It&#039;s also not a guarantee that every cigarette is going to be perfect. There&#039;s a certain learning curve to it where if you use too much tobacco the cigarette is impossible to smoke and if you use too little you smoke it in 10 seconds. Also annoying<br><br>Hand rolled are king imo. I smoke a 50gram pouch in a week with about 10-15 cigarettes a day. Comes down to about 45 euros a month on cigarettes, which to me is doable. Taste better and once you get the technique down right you can roll a perfect cig in under a minute, which is more convenient (to me) than having to machine out a whole pack every morning. Get a bag of those little filters and the rolling is much easier and the cigarette smokes nicer as well, no tobacco pieces in your mouth.
