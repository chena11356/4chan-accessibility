I was thinking about using a current transformer to measure load current and line voltage (line voltage measured with a resistor in series with current transformer) and an ADC connected to a microcontroller. The issue I came across is that the line voltage is mostly a sinusoidal wave, while the load current can be really fucked up. How would I go to measure the power when the current has all sorts of frequencies, including some high frequency in the case of some loads such as switch mode power supplies. In other words, how would I design a reliable current sensor that can handle such loads and measure the real power used by the load? Bonus points if it can also measure reactive power.<br><br>FROM THE PREVIOUS THREAD:<br><a href=\"/diy/thread/2519612#p2526860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526860</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gotta multiply instantaneous current by instantaneous voltage, and make some sort of weighted running average. Probably using DSP, since analogue multiplication is hard. Also consider a transformer or isolated ADC+divider for mains voltage, to prevent the majority of your digital circuitry from being mains referenced. A differential amplifier measuring live-neutral and referencing it to ground also works. Naturally you&#039;ll need anti-aliasing filters to obey the nyquist sampling theorem on both ADC inputs. Figuring out the power factor and reactive and apparent powers would just be a software problem.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As for the sensor itself, hall or shunt would be my desire, as current draws aren&#039;t necessarily symmetrical around 0V (see half-wave rectifiers</span><br><br>Can you go in more detail about the following?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;ll need anti-aliasing filters to obey the nyquist sampling theorem on both ADC inputs</span><br>If I am only interested in power (and not recreating the signal), is the nyquist rate important at all?

Worst case you&#039;ve got an SMPS putting out high frequency current noise so you just get a bunch of aliases wildly throwing off the power factor calculations. At least dampening them with a low pass filter doesn&#039;t give false frequency spikes. Arguably you might be fine with a pretty low frequency for your ADC, since parallel caps and series chokes are everywhere, though it depends on the purpose of your power measurement.

Ultimately you want the attenuation at and above your Nyquist frequency to be such that any signal there gets stamped into nothingness. If you want 8-bits of resolution then the attenuation will be a lot less than if you want a full 24 bits of resolution. If you increase the Nyquist frequency significantly past your desired bandwidth, then you&#039;ll have more room for attenuation. Say if your desired bandwidth is 4kHz, and you want 60dB of attenuation, then a 5kHz nyquist frequency means 60dB/0.1dec = 600dB/decade (30 pole filter lmao). If you set the nyquist frequency to 100kHz then that means 60dB/1.4dec = 43dB/decade (2 pole filter). N bits of effective resolution means 20*log(2^N)dB of SNR (8bit = 48dB), but there&#039;s nothing stopping you from choosing a desired effective resolution lower than your ADC&#039;s resolution, which reduces the required filter attenuation.<br><br>t. retard who&#039;s never built an anti-aliasing filter before<br><br><a href=\"#p2526957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526957</a><br><a href=\"#p2526962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526962</a><br>gratz", "time": 1671699428, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526964, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)03:57:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526957</a><br>oh you changed it, yes that&#039;s what I found as well.", "time": 1671699447, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526965, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)03:59:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526963</a><br><a href=\"#p2526964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526964</a><br>yeah sorry I meant R2/R1, have it on paper and copied to mspaint incorrectly<br>thanks for checking", "time": 1671699546, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526966, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)04:01:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526954</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do I need some sort of active filter</span><br>Usually a good idea if you&#039;re after more than 1 pole (20dB/decade) of attenuation.

Lead batteries are better for emergencies, as a backup power source. Lithium batteries (there are many kinds) can be placed in parallel in order to form a power bank, but they are much more expensive and fragile. You would need to either constantly monitor the voltage and current of the batteries in order to avoid overcharging, drawing too much current, etc. There are systems you can buy for this, but they are expensive. Solar creates DC, but you would need a device to regulate the amount of charge it delivers to the battery to avoid overcharging. The wind turbine and Sterling engine create AC, which has to be converted to DC with a rectifier in order to charge the batteries (again, device needed to protect battery from overcharging). When you&#039;re ready to use your stored power, you need a power inverter to convert DC to AC so you may use it in your home. As for the bicycle, many people have used alternators to generate electricity, but once again, it creates an irregular AC signal which has to be converted to DC and then fed into a voltage regulator that can stabilize the output voltage and charge the batteries.", "time": 1670908789, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520819, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:21:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why would I want to live off the grid unless I were a schizo who thinks the government is out to get me", "time": 1670908896, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520822, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:24:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cooling</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3b<wbr>JnKmeNJY", "time": 1670909040, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520838, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2520817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2520817</a><br>Let me correct myself: alternators create DC, not AC, so you can skip the rectifier, but you would still need a voltage regulator or some sort of charge controller that can reliably stabilize the output of the alternator and protect the batteries.

They will run off of all kinds of fuel, and are pretty easy to fix.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Water</span><br>This greatly depends on your area. In my locale (Western PA), you could live off of catchment water alone. Other places will need a well or desalination method.<br>For storage, it&#039;s hard to beat a massive cistern in the ground. The water should be somewhat filtered before going in, and filtered again when coming out. You pump the water up into a tank in the attic to give you pressure. This pump can be powered by anything - solar, wind, a horse, you, etc.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heating</span><br>Wood/coal/straw/poo fired boiler heating a giant insulated hot water tank, which acts as heat storage. Traditional wood stove as a secondary/backup. Optional ground source heat pump can handle all your heating (and cooling) needs when there&#039;s enough solar power, allowing you to save your fuel for those very cold and dark days.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cooling</span><br>Proper location and passive construction will help with this. Building partly underground/into a hill will allow you to leverage the earth&#039;s constant temperature for a source of cool in the summer, and heat in the winter. No matter what you build, insulation is a must. Ground source heat pump is the best method of active cooling.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Septic</span><br>Septic tank is ez, or you can treat it yourself by aerating the sewage in multiple stages.

PLA+ typically improves some of the drawbacks while sacrificing some of the strengths, resulting in something that doesn&#039;t quite fit the niches where regular PLA shines but which often compares poorly to other filaments like PETG and ASA.

On the upside, after some fine-tuning and getting low viscosity EVA glue, I started seeing passable results. On the downside, the passable results still required manual re-gluing with an iron about 70% of the time, maybe down to 50% after I got the hang of the required speed and consistency of feeding. Still, it was a massive pain in the ass to do some 40 meters of edging this way. I also didn&#039;t have a very good setup for trimming edges with a router, did a lot of it manually with a chisel.

It was also completely impossible to use it for banding thicker than 1mm, even 1mm was difficult. 0.5-0.7mm was alright.<br>This is what I then bought https://www.aliexpress.com/item/400<wbr>0569137844.html and first tests went well. It&#039;s pretty fast, the bond it leaves is really strong as it applies glue on both the ABS strip and the wood, and thanks to all the big rollers you can squeeze the edge on hard, even 2mm strips stuck just fine. Will see how it holds up next time I actually have a larger amount of edges to glue. Also I will definitely build a swiveling router mount for cutting the banding, I&#039;ve had it with chisels. <br>The steel frame was an extra layer of complication, if I had to build the same thing again, I&#039;d either go with thinner material or just use chipboard for the whole structure.

Find yourself an old back saw from before the thin plate came into vogue, file it rip, put in some set and then stone out almost all of the set and you will get wonderfully smooth miters in hardwoods. Stoning out the set instead of putting in very little set will give just enough fleam (functionally the same as fleam but not really fleam) on the outside of the tooth to give a smooth cut in even many softwoods. The old saws were not thicker because they could not make thin plates, they were thicker because it made it easier to get a smooth cut, the old guys knew what they were doing, sure it cut a tiny bit slower but it meant little to no fine tuning after the cut.

You can hear this flexing in many saws, if the blade rings during the cut it is because the blade is flexing fast enough to be vibrating and sound a note, especially noticeable when a saw is getting dull.

Trusses come in many shapes, but mainly these two:<br><br>Standard \u2013 has a flat bottom which allows for a flat ceiling<br><br>Scissor- crossed beams provide a vaulted ceiling. This gives you more head room or space for a loft if extra height is needed.<br>Overhang<br><br>This is how much roof is hanging past the walls on the ends and sides of the building. Overhang will typically be 12 to 24 inches.<br>Purlins<br><br>Purlins are the pieces of lumber on the roof that provide structure and where the metal panels are attached.<br>Girts<br><br>The girts are similar to the purlins in that they are 2x4s placed 24 inches on center, but on the walls instead of the roof. Girts also provide wall support.<br>Girder<br><br>The top support pieces are known as girders. Beam sizes will typically be 2\u00d710 or 2\u00d712.<br>Bottom Wall Girt- Skirt Board- Splash Board-Grade Board<br><br>There are several different names for the piece that sits on ground level.

It is not a microcontroller. It does have some I/O pins, but the OS mostly gets in the way of using them. And you have to deal with it like a full computer, keeping the OS running, etc.<br>A microcontroller has nothing but maybe a bootloader. Any OS is built into your project. And there is usually nothing like a file system or network ports.<br><br>It&#039;s also that much more to throw out when (not if) something gets zapped. I was making a chip reader with a blue pill, and accidentally touched a +12 wire to an I/O pin, and now the thing runs hot because of the blown pin. I knew what I was doing, and was being careful, and still zapped it. I&#039;m kind of surprised that&#039;s the only time, there were other times I thought I had, and was wrong. But I started with a bag of twenty for $40 including shipping, seven-ish years ago, and most are still in the bag. And even then, it&#039;s only the main chip. I have some lower-spec ST chips that should drop right in.<br>The main thing you want when playing around with microcontrollers is to have identical spares around. You still want to be careful whenever you hook it up to something, but when it happens you need to be able to pull out another one and get back to work. If you had to change chip type, you would have to fuck with your build configuration. Also it lets you keep more than one project in progress at the same time. Blue pill is about as chink as you can get and still be able to get more.<br><br>The thing about micro:bit is that it already has a few useful things on the board (like the LED matrix), so you can do stuff without hooking it up anything, and it has the &quot;better&quot; I/O pins brought out to big holes you can clip to.

So that&#039;s 9 multiplications (2 cycles each) and 6 additions (1 cycle each) per transform, not sure to what extent I need load instructions or if I can directly act on my registers. I also need to use a sine lookup table, probably also a cosine lookup table, which I&#039;m guessing takes a clock cycle or two to fetch a value from. So minimum 30 cycles per double transform, probably more like 33-42. The PI controller is not something I&#039;m sure how to implement live in an MCU, though I think it&#039;s just a Z-transform-based thing that has Out(n+1) be a function only of In(n), In(n+1), and Out(n). So I&#039;m guessing maybe 12-20 cycles each. Then another pair of additions, then the inverse matrix, then the inverter. For the inverter I&#039;ll just be feeding the values into three CMP registers of a timer&#039;s PWM.

Bandwidth is well the width of the frequency band. Bandwidth also dictates how much data you can theoretically feed though a connection. Antennas rely on complex impedance. Since they aren&#039;t a straight forward conductor, rather a strange hybrid between resistor, capacitor and inductor. Well this amalgam of all three can be fed a certain amount of power at a given frequency, and depending on the complex impedance measurements the antenna will either radiate most, some or none of that energy in to the either. There&#039;s is a lot to antenna theory but this is a very plastic explanation.<br><br>Building a transmitter you&#039;ll need to get a handle on modulation and demodulation.

They won&#039;t taste exactly the same because cigarette manufacturers use a proprietary blend of flavors and treatments that is responsible for the distinct taste of their cigs. You can still find plenty of good quality, cheap tobacco (menthol, light, regular, extra bold, etc) but it will never be an exact match for your favorite brand.<br>Another thing is that these homemade ones will always burn just slightly differently than the industrial ones. Industrially made cigarettes are (AFAIK) made from a specially prepared reconstituted tobacco paper rather than shredded leaves. They do this to make things easier for their treatment steps, but also to make the mix have a 100% consistent texture and consistency that helps avoid problems with their processing and packing machinery. When you buy the cheap bags of raw tobacco, it&#039;s just leaves that have been cut/shredded to a consistency which is appropriate for rolling or tube packing cigs. So sometimes you may have a tiny inconsistency or packing error and wind up with a small void or an end of the tube that doesn&#039;t pack completely.<br><br>After you get familiar with the perfect amount of leaf to load in the machines chamber by doing a couple dozen cigs, you&#039;ll start to avoid this issue for the most part.<br><br>All in all, it&#039;s super cheap and easy to do and I&#039;m always amazed that more smokers don&#039;t RYO", "time": 1671219875, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523186, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Use your fingers roll em up<br>Look like a doobie man farout and groovy", "time": 1671220088, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523192, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:01:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523144</a><br>It can save you money, but it won&#039;t, it&#039;ll just give you the option to pop out $10-$20 cartons at will.<br><br>Fuck tubes, they&#039;re gross, and filling them yourself is a waste of time.<br>If you&#039;re going to roll your own, roll them.

I don&#039;t remember exactly what he shot it with but I recovered the jacket of a large caliber pistol, possibly 45ACP and a small rifle round, most likely .223. Simply put, ceramic tiles are not hard enough to stop rifle rounds and while they may be able to fragment pistol rounds, they then turn into shrapnel that blows right through the backing.

Economies of scale make it impractical to manufacture your own wood pellets and if your concern is off grid living you should stick with regular wood as a heat source.<br><br>I get that not everything has to be a strictly economic transaction and that the whole point of hobbies is doing inefficient unpaid labor because you like doing it, but /diy/ pellets are not it.

I think the most efficient way to to this would be to somehow automate or at least greatly simplify the process of loading entire logs into the combustion chamber.<br><br>As for wood pellets, a lot of the reason for their efficiency advantages don&#039;t apply in a gasifier. They&#039;re more efficient than a regular wood stove because they burn using a forced convection system, and as a result of the forced convection and their high density they burn at a much higher temperature than regular wood. Forced convection isn&#039;t possible in a gasifier and the heat of the reaction doesn&#039;t matter much when the process you&#039;re using relies on further chemical reactions downstream of the gasifier.<br><br>I also question if charcoal in a gasifier is a good idea. The process of making charcoal is essentially the same thing as what&#039;s happening in a gasifier, except by separating those processes you&#039;d be losing out on the stream of volatile exhaust gases that come out of the charcoal and relying solely on the carbon monoxide to fuel your car. Using charcoal you&#039;re throwing away a good portion of the energy of the wood, and once again the advantage of a higher temperature burn doesn&#039;t benefit a gasifier like it would in a furnace.<br><br><a href=\"#p2518180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2518180</a><br>I think that even if things did &quot;go to shit&quot; we&#039;d still have a healthy supply of oil.

Some of the wood gas converted cars stayed like that for decades, until the government got stricter about what you were allowed to drive on the road.

He drove it into town for the autumn market festival to show it off a few times. Using firewood probably produces more exhaust or ash than the bilved, because pine doesn&#039;t burn as well as birch in the first place, but I don&#039;t think that matters too much.

So rip the cane completely out of one and see if it has holes or a groove. Order the supplies and have at it, expect a chair or two to be failures before you get the technique down. If you are weaving then I would get a book, having those nice color photos well arranged with descriptions of the process well arranged and laid out for you to reference while you work will be very helpful. Most libraries should have a caning book or a chair making/repair book or a canoe making book (canoes often have woven cane seats so your butt can dry out).

Lots of them now have hollow handles for storage, but that really weakens it as the handle bends and sometimes even breaks in my hand when I grip too hard, the old metal ones never did that. Reason I still like them is I have had projects where I drive in hundreds and hundreds of screws by hand. I had bits wear out which lead to other problems. By switch to fresh bits as I go I didn&#039;t have to keep buying screw drivers which cost more then a box of bits. It also lets me change to other types as the job had 8 screw types, so finding a comfy handle each item was annoying.

Got my journeyman, quit residential and went commercial. Then 2008 happened and commercial shut down in my area. Had to go back to residential and work for a dipshit, who I think sucked a LOT of dicks to get where he was at. That pissed me off enough to get my contractors and start my own company.

I have a rough idea of the most sensible sequence in which things need to be done. A new water heater is on the list, but it&#039;s waiting on an electrical overhaul, which in turn is waiting on other things. Unfortunately, the regulator on my water heater seems to have begun to leak gas into my kitchen, and I don&#039;t think I want to spend $200 (the price of a new regulator) to repair a unit I plan on throwing away as soon as possible. I&#039;m therefore faced with installing a water heater before my electrical system is ready for it.<br><br>I want to replace my 40 gallon gas water heater with a tankless electric one. I want it to be electric precisely so that it can&#039;t malfunction and leak explosive gas into my kitchen, and tankless because there&#039;s not a good location for a water heater in my house, which was built without closets. It&#039;s currently in the corner of the kitchen, where it&#039;s a major eyesore. Another reason to go with an electric heater is that I&#039;d like to perform as much of the installation as possible myself and to be able to service it myself moving forward, and I am much more comfortable working with electricity than with gas.<br><br>A 27 kW water heater calls for 3 x 40 A breakers and pulls up to 112.5 A. A have a 200 A main panel with room for those breakers. Unfortunately, the typical load on that panel is pretty high thanks to my reliance on resistive heating (electric radiators - no ductwork yet) and to the fact that it supplies not only a large-ish house but also a large-ish workshop. I&#039;m probably using 80 - 100 amps for heat, and I can see myself using 25 A for other stuff if I&#039;m working in the shop. If, say, two other people are using hot water at the same time, I can see that 200 amp capacity being exceeded.<br><br>The worst that can happen is that I flip my main breaker, right?

Anyone else have a wife that makes a lot more money than them? What is life like? Anons it is getting to be an insane disparity for me. I work in engineering in the Midwest USA meaning basically that at a country level I make shit pay. I make like $70k which is middling and I don&#039;t want to go into management. I met my wife like 5 years ago pre-covid. She is a programmer and once WFH happened she could work &#039;anywhere&#039; and her earning potential exploded. She now works for a tech company on the west coast and makes triple my salary. She has been promoted once already and she has been told she might become management and we still won&#039;t even have to move so it&#039;s probably going to be quadruple my salary soon. Anyone else in a marriage like this? I feel like I&#039;m dead weight holding us as a couple back. I&#039;m not even sure why I work any more. My engineering degree has been a huge bust. I&#039;m just wondering at what point is she going to realize I&#039;m a loser with no prospects and dragging her down instead of being with someone who makes comparable pay? As a couple she could easily be almost a millionaire with someone in a similar position to her. Also she&#039;s not bad with money per se but she is falling hard for lifestyle creep. She makes exponentially more money than either me or her former self and we don&#039;t even own a home or property. I try to save my meager wage and she keeps buying more things instead of saving her increases in pay. I don&#039;t know how to tell her to save money for a house without sounding like a bossy leech. I mean this feels like right now is great but I feel a &quot;dark&quot; wife to this that could ruin a marriage if we aren&#039;t careful. <br><br>Also general job thread talk about jobs and job related things.", "filename": "1665550646272358", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 860, "h": 960, "tn_w": 223, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671581254841886, "time": 1671581254, "md5": "tD68KVc6Ho1/v5FT2Asf/g==", "fsize": 66163, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "theres-no-jobs-board", "replies": 14, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 2526019, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)19:10:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526016</a><br>Do you enjoy what you do?

When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far.

In general, distilling alcohol from a dilute solution while using a water bath as the heat source is slow and frustrating. With all the heat loss and poor dynamics that you have going on here, it may not distill at all<br><br>-For one thing you should have more head space in that boiling jar.... The liquid will expand by about 5% as it heats up to boiling temp, and it will also roll, bubble, and sometimes foam a bit. You have so little space up there that it&#039;s likely to foam or bump up into the tubing.<br>-You&#039;re not going to have good heat transfer from the water bath to the boiling vessel. The level of that water bath is very low compared to the level in the jar. It&#039;s losing a lot of heat to the air from all around that boiling vessel. You should use a bigger pot with a deeper water bath and/or a much lower level of liquid in the jar. Also, you can insulate the jar and head of the still above the level of the water in order to retain heat and encourage distillation. Even an aluminum foil tent made from the rim of the pot to the top of the jar would help; anything to help retain heat inside the jar.<br>-That looks like vinyl tubing from the hardware store and its a terrible choice for this application. You would be better off with a small (~1/4&quot; or 5/16&quot;) copper tubing stuck into a hole drilled through a stopper. Vinyl tubing will tend to get really soft and deformed at even the relatively low temps that it will see in this application. Also it leaches gross chemicals and a nasty taste into the alcohol. If you steep a piece of it in a cup of hot water and then smell or taste the water after a few minutes, you&#039;ll see what I mean.<br>-In general with little crappy setups like this, throwing a few pea sized pieces of pumice or chips from a broken ceramic mug into your boiling vessel will help it boil smoothly and evenly.

These adhesives typically come in two parts that must be mixed together before use, and they often have a longer working time than super glue, which can give you more time to adjust the fit of the parts as you are bonding them together.<br><br>Additionally, you may want to consider using some plastic reinforcement, such as plastic welding rods, to help provide additional strength to the repair. This can help to ensure that the repaired area is strong enough to withstand normal use of the printer.<br><br>Overall, it is important to make sure that the repair is performed carefully and that the adhesive is allowed to cure fully before using the printer again. This will help to ensure that the repair is strong and will last for a long time.", "time": 1670539236, "resto": 2517522}, {"no": 2517987, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)17:41:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m trying to fix my wired Xbox 360 controller.

The firewall WAN port goes to the modem, the LAN port goes to the network switch which the &#039;splits&#039; the connection between different devices: servers, phones, computers<br>4. On the switch there are different devices like a file sharing server (that often also does DNS and DHCP but in a shit way), a VOIP server, a DVR server, and of course your normie PC users, and VOIP phones. You can have different logical networks on the same physical network so if you&#039;re running out of IP addresses you can put the VOIP phones on a different class network like 10.something instead of 192.168. something.

The downside is that designing like this is very time consuming and you can&#039;t make things compact.", "time": 1671358831, "resto": 2523883}, {"no": 2524224, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:40:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523961</a>", "filename": "smuggie", "ext": ".png", "w": 735, "h": 541, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1671360042279555, "time": 1671360042, "md5": "rvMhQsyMJLhwtS9oK9hqJQ==", "fsize": 41108, "resto": 2523883}, {"no": 2524247, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:18:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523961</a><br>Kill yourself, faggot", "time": 1671365920, "resto": 2523883}, {"no": 2524416, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)12:53:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523883</a><br>you didn&#039;t need to make a thread for this retarded question<br>all devices have to have the planned obsolecency switch labeled by name and the planned obsolecency logo, you just need to open your eyes for once in your life and not rely on internet strangers so much", "time": 1671386017, "resto": 2523883}, {"no": 2524468, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)13:39:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523883</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do I remove planned obsolecency from an device?</span><br>there is no component in any device that is the &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; device.<br><br>devices are sometimes engineered and tested to failure, then components are designed to come close to that. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoeb<wbr>us_cartel<br><br>devices can be made to last a VERY long time but at a cost. things are made to a price point.<br><br>go buy a rolls royce car they &quot;never&quot; break down.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I feel this is specially possible,</span><br>ah yes the ol&#039; I have no brain/can&#039;t think but since I have *emotion* about it, it must be so.", "time": 1671388791, "resto": 2523883}, {"no": 2524469, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)13:42:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523883</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;planned obsolecency</span><br>is not the issue, if parts break and the manufacturer will not sell you spares (I&#039;m looking at you QNAP). you are fucked.", "time": 1671388927, "resto": 2523883}, {"no": 2525013, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:31:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523883</a><br>are you the retarded? planned obsolescence is just using low quality materials.", "time": 1671438661, "resto": 2523883}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2519612, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)07:21:40", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/ohm/ - Electronics General", "com": "dyslektik edishon<br><br>Thread wasn&#039;t EMP proofed against Russian nukes:<a href=\"/diy/thread/2513810#p2513810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2513810</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m new to electronics.

It&#039;s a real modern part with the ability to strap a heat-sink directly on top of it, that can operate up to 175C.

The FET&#039;s gate resistance gets up to 2m\u03a9 at 175C, so through P = R*I^2 we get I = \u221a(P/R) = \u221a(21/0.002) = 102A.

Best to use an iron transformer-based power supply with linear regulators and sufficiently large caps. If you absolutely have to use a switching power supply (can be very noisy with audio circuits) then ensure you tie the ground rail to protective earth, and try to use LC filters or capacitive multipliers or zener-pass regulators on the power rails to block that noise.

What voltage will be across each transistor? P = I*V, so if it&#039;s 12V then it&#039;s 6V on each transistor, and so 12W dissipated in a transistor worst case. You can probably derate that depending on situation. 2A is a bit much for a BD139/BD140, so I guess I&#039;d use something like a TIP31/32. The minimum hFE of them is 10, so that&#039;s 200mA out of the op-amp, which is kinda high.

The TO-220 package has a resistance to ambient of 57C/W, for reference. Can maybe run it a bit hotter than that, and derate the power dissipation based off required current output waveform. Each transistor will only heat half of that if the average current is 0, but if both are strapped to the heat-sink it&#039;s the same required thermal resistance. Divide that 1.7C/W by 2 if it&#039;s even.<br>Naturally, use your own PSU voltage.<br><br>Also watch out for crossover distortion when the current goes from positive to negative, I&#039;d want to use a high-slew-rate op-amp if not turn that into a class-AB topology instead of a class-B. Or just use a power amplifier IC. A big output cap or two would likely help a lot. Actually big enough output caps would buffer the current so it wouldn&#039;t have to come from the transistors.

No, very most liekely not.<br>Will it taste like a good and proper dark beer? Hell yes, it will, because the malt will already contribute 90% of the flavor.<br>The only distinction that I allow in this discussion is that bakers yeast tends to not settle into a compact sediment-cake at the bottom after fermentation is done but will stay in a loosely, floaty state at the bottom of the fermenter, but that has nothing to do with the flavor.<br><br>Fun fact: Most breweries fucking 1000 years ago in the Germanic/Bohemian regions got their yeast from surrounding bakeries.
