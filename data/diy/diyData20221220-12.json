It is not a microcontroller. It does have some I/O pins, but the OS mostly gets in the way of using them. And you have to deal with it like a full computer, keeping the OS running, etc.<br>A microcontroller has nothing but maybe a bootloader. Any OS is built into your project. And there is usually nothing like a file system or network ports.<br><br>It&#039;s also that much more to throw out when (not if) something gets zapped. I was making a chip reader with a blue pill, and accidentally touched a +12 wire to an I/O pin, and now the thing runs hot because of the blown pin. I knew what I was doing, and was being careful, and still zapped it. I&#039;m kind of surprised that&#039;s the only time, there were other times I thought I had, and was wrong. But I started with a bag of twenty for $40 including shipping, seven-ish years ago, and most are still in the bag. And even then, it&#039;s only the main chip. I have some lower-spec ST chips that should drop right in.<br>The main thing you want when playing around with microcontrollers is to have identical spares around. You still want to be careful whenever you hook it up to something, but when it happens you need to be able to pull out another one and get back to work. If you had to change chip type, you would have to fuck with your build configuration. Also it lets you keep more than one project in progress at the same time. Blue pill is about as chink as you can get and still be able to get more.<br><br>The thing about micro:bit is that it already has a few useful things on the board (like the LED matrix), so you can do stuff without hooking it up anything, and it has the &quot;better&quot; I/O pins brought out to big holes you can clip to.

So that&#039;s 9 multiplications (2 cycles each) and 6 additions (1 cycle each) per transform, not sure to what extent I need load instructions or if I can directly act on my registers. I also need to use a sine lookup table, probably also a cosine lookup table, which I&#039;m guessing takes a clock cycle or two to fetch a value from. So minimum 30 cycles per double transform, probably more like 33-42. The PI controller is not something I&#039;m sure how to implement live in an MCU, though I think it&#039;s just a Z-transform-based thing that has Out(n+1) be a function only of In(n), In(n+1), and Out(n). So I&#039;m guessing maybe 12-20 cycles each. Then another pair of additions, then the inverse matrix, then the inverter. For the inverter I&#039;ll just be feeding the values into three CMP registers of a timer&#039;s PWM.

It&#039;s definitely worth considering. So go ahead and give it some thought - you might be surprised at how much better off you&#039;ll be without that old, awful house.<br><br>And when you build that new house, make sure you power it entirely with propane. You know, propane is the ultimate energy source. It&#039;s clean, it&#039;s reliable, and it&#039;s affordable. Plus, you don&#039;t need no fancy electricity to run your appliances and lights.

So go ahead and make the switch to propane - you won&#039;t regret it.<br><br>Peggy, have I told you about my idea for an all-propane house? Think about it - no more expensive electricity bills, no more worrying about power outages. Just beautiful, clean propane for everything.

I have a rough idea of the most sensible sequence in which things need to be done. A new water heater is on the list, but it&#039;s waiting on an electrical overhaul, which in turn is waiting on other things. Unfortunately, the regulator on my water heater seems to have begun to leak gas into my kitchen, and I don&#039;t think I want to spend $200 (the price of a new regulator) to repair a unit I plan on throwing away as soon as possible. I&#039;m therefore faced with installing a water heater before my electrical system is ready for it.<br><br>I want to replace my 40 gallon gas water heater with a tankless electric one. I want it to be electric precisely so that it can&#039;t malfunction and leak explosive gas into my kitchen, and tankless because there&#039;s not a good location for a water heater in my house, which was built without closets. It&#039;s currently in the corner of the kitchen, where it&#039;s a major eyesore. Another reason to go with an electric heater is that I&#039;d like to perform as much of the installation as possible myself and to be able to service it myself moving forward, and I am much more comfortable working with electricity than with gas.<br><br>A 27 kW water heater calls for 3 x 40 A breakers and pulls up to 112.5 A. A have a 200 A main panel with room for those breakers. Unfortunately, the typical load on that panel is pretty high thanks to my reliance on resistive heating (electric radiators - no ductwork yet) and to the fact that it supplies not only a large-ish house but also a large-ish workshop. I&#039;m probably using 80 - 100 amps for heat, and I can see myself using 25 A for other stuff if I&#039;m working in the shop. If, say, two other people are using hot water at the same time, I can see that 200 amp capacity being exceeded.<br><br>The worst that can happen is that I flip my main breaker, right?

On the downside, the passable results still required manual re-gluing with an iron about 70% of the time, maybe down to 50% after I got the hang of the required speed and consistency of feeding. Still, it was a massive pain in the ass to do some 40 meters of edging this way. I also didn&#039;t have a very good setup for trimming edges with a router, did a lot of it manually with a chisel.

It was also completely impossible to use it for banding thicker than 1mm, even 1mm was difficult. 0.5-0.7mm was alright.<br>This is what I then bought https://www.aliexpress.com/item/400<wbr>0569137844.html and first tests went well. It&#039;s pretty fast, the bond it leaves is really strong as it applies glue on both the ABS strip and the wood, and thanks to all the big rollers you can squeeze the edge on hard, even 2mm strips stuck just fine. Will see how it holds up next time I actually have a larger amount of edges to glue. Also I will definitely build a swiveling router mount for cutting the banding, I&#039;ve had it with chisels. <br>The steel frame was an extra layer of complication, if I had to build the same thing again, I&#039;d either go with thinner material or just use chipboard for the whole structure.

Find yourself an old back saw from before the thin plate came into vogue, file it rip, put in some set and then stone out almost all of the set and you will get wonderfully smooth miters in hardwoods. Stoning out the set instead of putting in very little set will give just enough fleam (functionally the same as fleam but not really fleam) on the outside of the tooth to give a smooth cut in even many softwoods. The old saws were not thicker because they could not make thin plates, they were thicker because it made it easier to get a smooth cut, the old guys knew what they were doing, sure it cut a tiny bit slower but it meant little to no fine tuning after the cut.

You can hear this flexing in many saws, if the blade rings during the cut it is because the blade is flexing fast enough to be vibrating and sound a note, especially noticeable when a saw is getting dull.

It&#039;s going well so far. I burn a few logs of wood in the old combination oil/wood furnace once in the morning and once in the evening, which is enough to have hot water 24/7 (I&#039;ve turned the radiators off since they use up all the hot water overnight and I like showering first thing in the morning). I keep a (tiny) fire going in the old wood stove over the course of the day, which heats the whole house and actually works great to cook on. If the power were to go out tomorrow all I would lose is the computer, the lights, and running water, but during winter I can melt snow and in summer the neighbours have a functioning traditional well so I could get water from them. I also have an emergency flashlight that charges with a crank, so I&#039;ll have light. Town is about half an hour away by bicycle, so as long as it doesn&#039;t snow too much I could get by without diesel. If it does snow I could make the trip with skis, but I wouldn&#039;t be happy about it. My power bills are lower than they were in the summer, even though electricity is four times as expensive now.<br>I use about one paper shopping bag of wood a day, which is fine because my family owns forest and I can get basically as much as I need for free, just need to put a weekend in summer aside to travel out there, chop it up, and placing it in the barn to dry.", "time": 1670437868, "resto": 2504527}, {"no": 2517289, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)15:05:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2517249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2517249</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a few square metres of solar panel to trickle-charge your electric truck</span><br>I live in Norway, and even south of the polar circle we have just a few hours of sunlight, further reduced since the sun barely clears the mountains we have so many of here.

New planks/panels is really the only solution here, unless you have solid woodworking skills and a shop. <br><br>The best way to flatten them is to remove the panels, get them wet, and then have them dry in battens and keep rewetting them and drying until they&#039;re flat again - and you may have to repeat this for the x and y axis. <br><br>Sanding them is what mouthbreathers would do - and you&#039;ll get a bunch of them in this thread. The tops need to be sanded for the finish, but you don&#039;t straighten bent panels by sanding them. <br><br>This table isn&#039;t a museum piece, or valuable, so it&#039;s up to you. New panels would be the easiest...kind of. A folding leaf top has to be done right, they&#039;re tricky.

In general, distilling alcohol from a dilute solution while using a water bath as the heat source is slow and frustrating. With all the heat loss and poor dynamics that you have going on here, it may not distill at all<br><br>-For one thing you should have more head space in that boiling jar.... The liquid will expand by about 5% as it heats up to boiling temp, and it will also roll, bubble, and sometimes foam a bit. You have so little space up there that it&#039;s likely to foam or bump up into the tubing.<br>-You&#039;re not going to have good heat transfer from the water bath to the boiling vessel. The level of that water bath is very low compared to the level in the jar. It&#039;s losing a lot of heat to the air from all around that boiling vessel. You should use a bigger pot with a deeper water bath and/or a much lower level of liquid in the jar. Also, you can insulate the jar and head of the still above the level of the water in order to retain heat and encourage distillation. Even an aluminum foil tent made from the rim of the pot to the top of the jar would help; anything to help retain heat inside the jar.<br>-That looks like vinyl tubing from the hardware store and its a terrible choice for this application. You would be better off with a small (~1/4&quot; or 5/16&quot;) copper tubing stuck into a hole drilled through a stopper. Vinyl tubing will tend to get really soft and deformed at even the relatively low temps that it will see in this application. Also it leaches gross chemicals and a nasty taste into the alcohol. If you steep a piece of it in a cup of hot water and then smell or taste the water after a few minutes, you&#039;ll see what I mean.<br>-In general with little crappy setups like this, throwing a few pea sized pieces of pumice or chips from a broken ceramic mug into your boiling vessel will help it boil smoothly and evenly.

Lots of them now have hollow handles for storage, but that really weakens it as the handle bends and sometimes even breaks in my hand when I grip too hard, the old metal ones never did that. Reason I still like them is I have had projects where I drive in hundreds and hundreds of screws by hand. I had bits wear out which lead to other problems. By switch to fresh bits as I go I didn&#039;t have to keep buying screw drivers which cost more then a box of bits. It also lets me change to other types as the job had 8 screw types, so finding a comfy handle each item was annoying.

It&#039;s a real modern part with the ability to strap a heat-sink directly on top of it, that can operate up to 175C.

The FET&#039;s gate resistance gets up to 2m\u03a9 at 175C, so through P = R*I^2 we get I = \u221a(P/R) = \u221a(21/0.002) = 102A.

Best to use an iron transformer-based power supply with linear regulators and sufficiently large caps. If you absolutely have to use a switching power supply (can be very noisy with audio circuits) then ensure you tie the ground rail to protective earth, and try to use LC filters or capacitive multipliers or zener-pass regulators on the power rails to block that noise.

What voltage will be across each transistor? P = I*V, so if it&#039;s 12V then it&#039;s 6V on each transistor, and so 12W dissipated in a transistor worst case. You can probably derate that depending on situation. 2A is a bit much for a BD139/BD140, so I guess I&#039;d use something like a TIP31/32. The minimum hFE of them is 10, so that&#039;s 200mA out of the op-amp, which is kinda high.

The TO-220 package has a resistance to ambient of 57C/W, for reference. Can maybe run it a bit hotter than that, and derate the power dissipation based off required current output waveform. Each transistor will only heat half of that if the average current is 0, but if both are strapped to the heat-sink it&#039;s the same required thermal resistance. Divide that 1.7C/W by 2 if it&#039;s even.<br>Naturally, use your own PSU voltage.<br><br>Also watch out for crossover distortion when the current goes from positive to negative, I&#039;d want to use a high-slew-rate op-amp if not turn that into a class-AB topology instead of a class-B. Or just use a power amplifier IC. A big output cap or two would likely help a lot. Actually big enough output caps would buffer the current so it wouldn&#039;t have to come from the transistors.

How would you measure out your face this way? I did with simple gypsum bandages. And then print it how? Carbon fibres? For costs, a 33cm x 33cm rectangle plate costs about 15\u20ac in material costs, the groin plate has this size. thats 9 + 9 patches of the heavy a d light glass filament. 1m2 can be cut into 9 patches. 1m2 of glass weave costs about 3-5\u20ac, so about 3 for the light and 5 for the heavy, 8\u20ac total for the weave. Epoxy resin can be expensive, cheapest I found was 11\u20ac per kg. for a 33cmx33cm plate with 18 layers of mixed weaves I needed 750g of epoxy, so about 7-9\u20ac or something. Now you got a basic plate for what 15-20\u20ac. Porcelain is the best worst ceramic for balistic protection, you can source that for free. Add another glass weave for spalling protection above that to stop porcelain fragments from flying everywhere and boom you got a decent plate I&#039;d say. 25\u20ac max.", "time": 1669366984, "resto": 2509339}, {"no": 2509753, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)04:28:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2509750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2509750</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAg<wbr>fHkocU2g<br><br>I imagine you can just scan your face and fit it to you personally with cad programs.

No, very most liekely not.<br>Will it taste like a good and proper dark beer? Hell yes, it will, because the malt will already contribute 90% of the flavor.<br>The only distinction that I allow in this discussion is that bakers yeast tends to not settle into a compact sediment-cake at the bottom after fermentation is done but will stay in a loosely, floaty state at the bottom of the fermenter, but that has nothing to do with the flavor.<br><br>Fun fact: Most breweries fucking 1000 years ago in the Germanic/Bohemian regions got their yeast from surrounding bakeries.

If you don&#039;t have enough sugar in your brew, you won&#039;t reach 15%, no matter the yeast. For 15% ABV you&#039;ll need around 290g sugar per liter. Depending on quality and time of the year, honey can have around 80g - 90g sugar per 100g honey, so 300g honey per liter is what you&#039;d want to use. As for additives, you&#039;d need yeast nutrients, since honey is very low in nutrients that yeast can use, also you need to shake in a lot of air before pitching the yeast.

Even a cheap, inaccurate hydrometer will do, since the hydrometer is in essence not a tool that delivers an accurate value of X in a single measurement. It&#039;s rather a tool to measure differences and change over time. If your hydrometer is cheap and inaccurate, you might not be able to accurately calculate your ABV and you might be off by +/- 1%, but what it can do is track a value of X today and a value of &lt;X next week which tells you that fermentation is still ongoing and it&#039;s too soon to bottle.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there a recommended recipe with more exact amounts that can be split or doubled as needed?</span><br>There is a ton out there.

Do the math; you can get a pound of decent tobacco for like 15$ and tubes to go with it for another 5$ and make about 20 packs of cigarettes.<br>It&#039;ll probably average you around a dollar per pack or less.<br><br>One problem with doing this though is that the cigarettes won&#039;t be exactly like your favorite store brand. They won&#039;t taste exactly the same because cigarette manufacturers use a proprietary blend of flavors and treatments that is responsible for the distinct taste of their cigs. You can still find plenty of good quality, cheap tobacco (menthol, light, regular, extra bold, etc) but it will never be an exact match for your favorite brand.<br>Another thing is that these homemade ones will always burn just slightly differently than the industrial ones. Industrially made cigarettes are (AFAIK) made from a specially prepared reconstituted tobacco paper rather than shredded leaves. They do this to make things easier for their treatment steps, but also to make the mix have a 100% consistent texture and consistency that helps avoid problems with their processing and packing machinery. When you buy the cheap bags of raw tobacco, it&#039;s just leaves that have been cut/shredded to a consistency which is appropriate for rolling or tube packing cigs. So sometimes you may have a tiny inconsistency or packing error and wind up with a small void or an end of the tube that doesn&#039;t pack completely.<br><br>After you get familiar with the perfect amount of leaf to load in the machines chamber by doing a couple dozen cigs, you&#039;ll start to avoid this issue for the most part.<br><br>All in all, it&#039;s super cheap and easy to do and I&#039;m always amazed that more smokers don&#039;t RYO", "time": 1671219875, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523186, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Use your fingers roll em up<br>Look like a doobie man farout and groovy", "time": 1671220088, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523192, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:01:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523144</a><br>It can save you money, but it won&#039;t, it&#039;ll just give you the option to pop out $10-$20 cartons at will.<br><br>Fuck tubes, they&#039;re gross, and filling them yourself is a waste of time.<br>If you&#039;re going to roll your own, roll them.

They work great for a bit of usage then always have the same problem. I ended up buying an electronic one for a hundred dollars to test it out. Broke even in cost within 2 months, and actually had beer money left over after that. I kept having to travel for work and going out of town it wasn&#039;t practical to ever make enough to bring with and it was noticeable how fast buying packs would burn through cash. Even though it takes 5 minutes to make a pack worth of cigarettes with it usually it isn&#039;t worth the time compared to a tobacco pipe for me personally. Your mileage may vary. It was more than worth it for me the machines worked for over 5 years now (way more than I ever got out of hand crank ones) it&#039;s nice to be able to knock out a few really fast if I&#039;m in the mood for a cig, and they&#039;re convenient when walking around outside and it&#039;s windy on the way between the bar to pick up a few drinks. It can be difficult getting consistency in how tightly they&#039;re packed, with hand cranks you can pack a tube so tighly you basically can&#039;t keep it lit, electronic ones will jam and you can&#039;t force it and have to break it up and go with much looser packing in cigarettes, so you want to smoke them if you got them otherwise they&#039;ll tend to shake loose while you&#039;re walking around. It&#039;s not a big deal if you got a hard case you can just throw the shake back into the machine and repack it, tear off the empty part of the tube that it fell out, it can be annoying if you got like 3 half cigarettes, but you get a sense for which ones will do that and to smoke them first.

Lead batteries are better for emergencies, as a backup power source. Lithium batteries (there are many kinds) can be placed in parallel in order to form a power bank, but they are much more expensive and fragile. You would need to either constantly monitor the voltage and current of the batteries in order to avoid overcharging, drawing too much current, etc. There are systems you can buy for this, but they are expensive. Solar creates DC, but you would need a device to regulate the amount of charge it delivers to the battery to avoid overcharging. The wind turbine and Sterling engine create AC, which has to be converted to DC with a rectifier in order to charge the batteries (again, device needed to protect battery from overcharging). When you&#039;re ready to use your stored power, you need a power inverter to convert DC to AC so you may use it in your home. As for the bicycle, many people have used alternators to generate electricity, but once again, it creates an irregular AC signal which has to be converted to DC and then fed into a voltage regulator that can stabilize the output voltage and charge the batteries.", "time": 1670908789, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520819, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:21:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why would I want to live off the grid unless I were a schizo who thinks the government is out to get me", "time": 1670908896, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520822, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:24:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cooling</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3b<wbr>JnKmeNJY", "time": 1670909040, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520838, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2520817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2520817</a><br>Let me correct myself: alternators create DC, not AC, so you can skip the rectifier, but you would still need a voltage regulator or some sort of charge controller that can reliably stabilize the output of the alternator and protect the batteries.

They will run off of all kinds of fuel, and are pretty easy to fix.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Water</span><br>This greatly depends on your area. In my locale (Western PA), you could live off of catchment water alone. Other places will need a well or desalination method.<br>For storage, it&#039;s hard to beat a massive cistern in the ground. The water should be somewhat filtered before going in, and filtered again when coming out. You pump the water up into a tank in the attic to give you pressure. This pump can be powered by anything - solar, wind, a horse, you, etc.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heating</span><br>Wood/coal/straw/poo fired boiler heating a giant insulated hot water tank, which acts as heat storage. Traditional wood stove as a secondary/backup. Optional ground source heat pump can handle all your heating (and cooling) needs when there&#039;s enough solar power, allowing you to save your fuel for those very cold and dark days.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cooling</span><br>Proper location and passive construction will help with this. Building partly underground/into a hill will allow you to leverage the earth&#039;s constant temperature for a source of cool in the summer, and heat in the winter. No matter what you build, insulation is a must. Ground source heat pump is the best method of active cooling.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Septic</span><br>Septic tank is ez, or you can treat it yourself by aerating the sewage in multiple stages.

So rip the cane completely out of one and see if it has holes or a groove. Order the supplies and have at it, expect a chair or two to be failures before you get the technique down. If you are weaving then I would get a book, having those nice color photos well arranged with descriptions of the process well arranged and laid out for you to reference while you work will be very helpful. Most libraries should have a caning book or a chair making/repair book or a canoe making book (canoes often have woven cane seats so your butt can dry out). Videos will suck for this since you will find you need to jump back and fourth a lot.

This is a big deal unless your laying down some thicc .5 mm layer heights with a big phat nozzle.

Z should remain locked. Adjust z offset until sliding a piece of paper beneath the nozzle meets with a little resistance. Now move the nozzle to each corner of the bed and slide the paper under it. Adjust the wheel below until you feel about the same resistance as you did at the center. Repeat in each corner.

I chose this knot for several reasons:<br>-easy to make in every condition<br>-easy to undo in every condition, should you need to (even if the rope is wet, frozen and you can&#039;t see)<br>-can hold onto the carabiner when the rope is not in tension (so the carabiner doesn&#039;t just slip out)<br>-can tighten around the carabiner when the rope is in tension<br>Also, this particular knot stays a bit loose when the rope isn&#039;t being pulled, which does 2 things:<br>-allows for adjustments according to need (if the carabiner is tethered at a weird angle, the knot can slip on the carabiner and match the weird angle, as opposed to having the rope stretch over a rigid knot, which wears out the rope faster)<br>-tightens around the carabiner only when needed, as opposed to having the knot keep the rope always tense (I&#039;m referring to the bit of rope that the knot is made of). This prevents unnecessary wear and tear on the rope. Why does that matter? Let&#039;s say you&#039;ve tethered yourself to a rock, and you need to readjust your position. The rope is loose, but the knot will still rub on the rocks. If the knot is somewhat loose, some of the fibers in the knot will get caught by the rock&#039;s jagged edges, but they won&#039;t break, they&#039;ll just stretch a little. If the knot is tight, those fibers can&#039;t stretch, so they&#039;ll tear. This isn&#039;t a problem initially, but if you do this for 2-3 years, the rope will get worn out, and you better hope you realize what&#039;s going on and replace your rope before it wears out too much to hold your weight.", "time": 1671268821, "resto": 2522922}, {"no": 2523567, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)04:47:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523401</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bowline</span><br>I don&#039;t really like this knot, because it&#039;s too rigid, it&#039;s difficult to undo it in unfavorable conditions, and because tensioning the rope pulls the loose end back into the knot, aka the knot gets undone with time. Maybe it would be useful for snares, but even then, the amount of friction prevents it from tightening quick enough. If you really want to use a knot that works like a bowline, then it would be better to tie square knot around a round object, and then pass the working end through the loop. Or at least tie a knot in the standing end of the bowline and then partially melt the very end to prevent the knot from coming undone.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;e-taping</span><br>No. That shit wears out too fast, it ages poorly, and the glue doesn&#039;t even do that good of a job at preventing the fibers from slipping (+ it makes an annoying crinkly noise every time you move it).
