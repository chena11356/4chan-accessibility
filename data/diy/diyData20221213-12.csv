The substance would be radiating light over top of the printed surfaces. This is a much different effect than shining a light on a reflective surface. It would be more akin to the glare of light on a monitor, where-in the monitor is trying to emit light, but the surface of the screen is reflecting light in front of the monitor&#039;s light. It would wash out the printed letters on the keyboard and make them unreadable.<br>Perhaps that is okay, if you are a touch-typist and not trying to read the keyboard. But if that were the case, why would you be asking for a lighting solution? The keyboard appears to already have the usual tactile markers for hand placement.<br>But I think you&#039;d get a much better effect by just detail painting in the accents you need lighted, like the printed letters on each key.<br><br>Furthermore, luminescent materials are not &quot;free energy.&quot; They do require something to power them.<br>Some do retain the charge imparted by exposure to UV light and release it gradually after being removed, but the effect of relying on the very limited energy capacity of the coating will likely be underwhelming.<br>There are radio-luminescent materials like tritium paint. You will pay accordingly for the quality, but these do last several years.<br>But, ultimately the most DIY feasible solution is just to apply phosphorescent paint that reacts to UV light, and then use a UV light to illuminate it. You will obviously need to power the UV light source, but this is not a difficult DIY problem to solve. You could just put a headlamp on for the purpose.<br><br>Actually, why NOT just wear a fucking headlamp, perhaps with a red filter to be less offensive in the dark?

You may want to check the noise specs to ensure your signal is staying significantly above the noise floor for a given input amplitude. Also specs like common-mode input range, slew-rate, etc. could be handy to check depending on the signal input, but generally a line-level audio signal isn&#039;t going to get anywhere near the limits of a common op-amp on those.<br><br>Should go without saying but that circuit wants a split-rail power supply. ±5 to ±18 is usually what you&#039;re aiming for, but some op-amps (especially JFET-input op-amps) want a wider range rather than a smaller range. Best to use an iron transformer-based power supply with linear regulators and sufficiently large caps. If you absolutely have to use a switching power supply (can be very noisy with audio circuits) then ensure you tie the ground rail to protective earth, and try to use LC filters or capacitive multipliers or zener-pass regulators on the power rails to block that noise.

The power is definitely lacking, but even then if it had decent focus it would still be usable for what I want (burning away thin etch-resistant coatings). But my laser does not have decent focus, getting the beam small enough to really ablate coatings is a tricky task, but charring wood is definitely doable.

The idea was to retrofit a trailer with the aforementioned engine and power my house and potentially remote cabin. Recently I bought a light tower trailer with a Kubota D905 and 6kW gen head and have been cleaning it up. The idea is to ditch the 6kW head and upgrade, while installing the Kubota D1105T in place. Had a few questions for anyone who knows these engines pretty well, or had this type of idea. Both of the engines above come from different applications. The Kubota D905 engine has a mfg sticker mentioning &#039;constant speed only&#039;. I&#039;ve disassembled the engine far enough to compare the governor assemblies and I&#039;m stuck scratching my head. Both engines seem to have the exact same assemblies from what I can tell. Seemingly the only factors keeping the smaller engine at a &quot;constant speed&quot; are the throttle control screws on the outside of the engine. If my plan is to put the D1105T (variable speed) in the trailer, and maybe down the line throw the D905 (constant speed) in a utv build, am I going to have to change any internal governor components in either engine?",BTP64MH,.jpg,1704,2272,187,250,1670812457471806,1670812457,Ff12si4qLEpzT4nLK5o8vg==,164322,0,,retrofitting-a-light-tower-trailer-generator,1,0,"[{'no': 2520101, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)22:09:49', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Load will determine the final rpm.

After most of the flesh etc. is gone, you want to soak it in a bucket of water for a while to get into all the nooks and crannies. Adding a small amount of dish soap will help things along. Take it out and give it a good scrub and change the water every week or so. At this stage the teeth may potentially come loose so make sure you don&#039;t loose any.

But it&#039;s realistically a tear-down. You&#039;re basically rebuilding the house at this point, I guarantee that it needs all new plumbing, wiring, septic, etc. So you&#039;re replacing everything. How much is too much, for your budget? When/if do you plan to live in it? What&#039;s the neighborhood like, for potential rental income? <br>I mean, with some study and going slowly, you might get some of it done. You want professionals dealing with the roof, and electrical/plumbing. <br>This has every red flag for being a complete money pit. To what end? What is your final plan for the house? What is your realistic potential here? <br>If you plan to live in it, that&#039;s one thing.
