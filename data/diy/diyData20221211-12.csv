110,2516691,,,12/06/22(Tue)16:53:19,Anonymous,How can I be sure this is tinned copper?,"My autism is making me paranoid. Today I received this 10AWG tinned copper silicone wire from Aliexpress. The reviews are good, the core/insulation measurements match or even outmatch the specs but you&#039;ll always get some retards in the reviews saying that this is not real tinned copper and that it&#039;s aluminium, silver, brass or whatever. But what if those retards are actually the smart ones and all the others got fooled?<br><br>Here is what I&#039;ve done so far:<br>-Burned the shit out of some strands. Nothing gets brittle. Only thing that melts is the end of some of the strands, once they&#039;re cooled down they form a small ball at the end of the strand. Overall after many burns the conductor hasn&#039;t lost its thickness whatsoever.<br>-The burning definitely reveals some orange colors on the strands. You also get some yellowish and even greenish/blueish tints sometimes. Will post some shitty pics bellow.<br>-Scrapping strands with a knife doesn&#039;t reveal shit because they&#039;re just too small.<br>-Checked with my multimeter and I get 000.1Ω from one 5m wire but from what I understand this doesn&#039;t necessarily mean anything. Ideally you need a &quot;4-wire measurement&quot; thingy and I don&#039;t have one.<br>-Not the main subject but it&#039;s definitely silicone insulation, smells like shit out of the box and hasn&#039;t melted one bit from all my burning tests.<br><br>Overall it seems legit but I&#039;m just asking you smarter autists just to be sure.

An easy fix would be to replace the broken plastic bolt with a threaded bolt (which I can then fix to the headphones with a corresponding nut).

The cost of setting up a truly good air compressor and running hoses all over your workshop is in all likelihood not worth it, and if you cheap out on anything you&#039;ll be sorely dissapointed.
