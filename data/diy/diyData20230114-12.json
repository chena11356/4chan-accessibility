When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

The wine gets (similar to the &quot;corker&quot;) a so-called off-tone, so an unpleasant aroma. The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;).

The &quot;B\u00f6ckser&quot; is one of the reduction aromas that occur in the absence of air and is caused by the presence of sulfurous substances in the wine. These are formed by yeasts during fermentation, mainly from sulfur-containing amino acids and from sulfites and sulfates. Excessive sulfurization, residues of pesticides, a fermentation temperature that is too high or incorrect pH values can all contribute.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In order to avoid the B\u00f6ckser, it is advisable to remove the lees in good time.

When the cartridge is at the top of the magazine, and the bolt comes forward, the cartridge rides up the face of the feedramp so it can seat into the chamber. It&#039;s a disposable part because the copper jacket on the bullet wears the plastic surface and it&#039;s cheaper to just print a new feedramp. it works, it&#039;s fine, and it lasts long enough. <br>I have been thinking about how to make the feed ramp more resilient. I don&#039;t have a mill. I considered taking a cube of steel and using a dremel to shape it to fit. That is an option, but it&#039;s not repeatable. <br>I considered using steel flashing and trying to press a really thin layer over the surface of a plastic feedramp, and maybe JB welding it in, or bending ears over the side and securing it with a pin.

They literally fill the bottles with city water. They don&#039;t even filter it. Some of the brands add minerals to it for &quot;taste&quot; but it&#039;s no more pure than your tap. In fact, it&#039;s probably worse since you&#039;re being exposed to BPA in the plastic water bottles. Oh, and that yummy yummy mind control fluoride you NPCs love so much. <br>Spring water comes from an aquifer but they don&#039;t actually sit next to a spring and dip bottles in to fill them. They usually drill a borehole and pump the water into trucks for transport to the bottling plant. Again because it&#039;s in the same plastic bottle you&#039;re getting a big gulp of BPA, but at least it isn&#039;t fluoridated.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. eurofag</span><br>You have to go back.", "time": 1673147480, "resto": 2533536}, {"no": 2539655, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)11:32:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533536</a><br>https://prooneusa.com/product/brush<wbr>ed-nickel-handheld-shower/", "time": 1673368335, "resto": 2533536}, {"no": 2539815, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)16:18:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You either need a low pass filter or a high pass filter.", "time": 1673385531, "resto": 2533536}, {"no": 2539821, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)16:22:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "snakeoil<br>Actual filtration takes time", "time": 1673385761, "resto": 2533536}, {"no": 2540095, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)00:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2533536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2533536</a>", "filename": "showerfilter", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1796, "h": 1437, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1673415060586060, "time": 1673415060, "md5": "UIL6U24E4dDOj/PW4SsuPg==", "fsize": 159572, "resto": 2533536}, {"no": 2540775, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)05:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Private well chad reporting in", "filename": "PSX_20230112_063047", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 845, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673519548172819, "time": 1673519548, "md5": "5iRgi6+/xaT+C1DggGQyJQ==", "fsize": 296064, "resto": 2533536}, {"no": 2541781, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)00:32:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can you filter diluted chlorine?

Rusty, splintery, poorly cared for tools are the mark of either a fucktard or a poser and you need to steer clear of them.<br><br>To condition your wooden tools, use a plane to take off the varnish and apply linseed oil. If your tool handle is oversized, you can use your plane to give it an octagonal shape which many old trades guys swear by for comfort. Allow it to cure completely, then apply at least one layer of Walrus Brand tool oil, both to the handle and to the steel head of whatever tool it is. If your tool (or PPE) has leather components, use Obenauf&#039;s leather oil and conditioner. If the tool is rusted, use steel wool or another abrasive to remove excess rust and restore remaining rust with 30% vinegar. If you&#039;re going to paint your tools, use the highest quality enamel paint you can get your hands on and follow the instructions else it will not last. Should your tool have moving internal parts, the manufacturer likely recommends specific products to lubricate with, and there are many different kinds of lubrication and grease that vary in their intended use (temperature/climate, use severity, etc).<br><br>So why am I telling you about restoring and conditioning your tools if you&#039;re interested in being a poser?

I grabbed the little 3/8\u201d stubby which isn\u2019t any more powerful than what you can do by hand with a 1/2\u201d ratchet, but I held the blade of the edger with one hand and spun the bolt out in 2 seconds.<br><br>If you end up with a real big truck, the high torque 1/2\u201d cordless guns will normally do those, but most truck shops with Class 8 shit use a 1\u201d impact wrench. I\u2019ve talked to diesel mechanics who use the big 1/2\u201d on truck lugs and it works most of the time but makes the wrenches die a premature death because it\u2019s a struggle for them.", "filename": "76CCF989-FBE1-4380-B4F1-D5C15DFB9253", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 958, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672407317201128, "time": 1672407317, "md5": "FiIzPDlJFcrEOGn7vxzzig==", "fsize": 453918, "resto": 2525286, "trip": "!ZNBx60Gj/k"}, {"no": 2532276, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)11:28:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2532175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2532175</a><br>thanks i&#039;ll try it out on the grinder<br><br>biggest truck i&#039;d get is a class 6 grain truck, much more likely a 3/4 or 1 ton pickup. but maybe the winning move is to use the 450 ft-lbs. where needed and then save up for the big 1&quot; impact if i get that. problem is that the 1&quot; would only be for such large things, using that on anything that didn&#039;t absolutely need it (car lugs) would probably fuck up the bolts", "time": 1672417713, "resto": 2525286}, {"no": 2532297, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:04:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2528292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2528292</a><br>yes<br><br><a href=\"#p2528795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2528795</a><br>post burner email/contact and ill see what i can do.", "time": 1672419870, "resto": 2525286}, {"no": 2532312, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:28:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "looks like someone at the china factory fucked these up with the measurements. it wont fit my ryobi angle grinder with 22.2mm &#039;arbor&#039;<br><br>ID is 4/5in or 20mm... do you think that was some sort of conversion fuck up? or are there other saws that take this size?<br>the 20mm ID doesnt sit on the &#039;shelf&#039; of my angle grinder lock nuts<br>the 5/8 spacer sits super loose on the angle grinder spindle and it seems unwise to use a grinding disc that is not perfectly centered.<br><br>what can i do to rememedy this?<br>-can i return to amazon after 60 days?<br>-can i drill out center to 22.2 somehow?<br>-is there a washer/spacer i can get to make this fit my ryobi angle grinder?", "filename": "saw2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 993, "h": 529, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 66, "tim": 1672421282794381, "time": 1672421282, "md5": "rDnqw0Mo5dNt5kCUvFr76Q==", "fsize": 169097, "resto": 2525286}, {"no": 2532336, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)13:05:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Anyone know how 8mm film projectors work?

I&#039;ve spent the past 6 years of my life researching everything there is to know about masonry and stone buildings. <br><br>You presented us with the question of whether or not this is feasible. I am happy to inform you that yes, this is 100% feasible and could easily be done. You are a citizen located in New England, this area of the US is almost completely earthquake free, so the option of making a traditional stone tower is possible. <br><br>There are pros and cons to this idea of yours. The biggest con is that to make a traditional tower, you&#039;ll need to shape each and every stone. Without going into it too much, you&#039;re not equipped nor skillful enough to make a traditional stone tower, nor would I advise you do so. <br><br>Your best and only hope is to create this stone tower using the slip form masonry technique. Utilizing this technique, you can simply gather stones of varying size, place them within your form, and apply cement to bond it all together. You&#039;ll also be using rebar throughout the entire structure to keep it held structurally sound. Now as you&#039;re beginning to build, you&#039;ll want a strong and wide foundation, and each layer of stone should be smaller than the previous layer. This will give your tower a strong base, and it will be reinforced with steel. Will your tower last for 150 years? No, but with simple repairs, it can last indefinitely. The mortar can be replaced, stones can be put back in. You can do this if you put your mind to it. <br><br>The floorboards and supporting wood can either rest directly on the stone wall of the tower, or you can build a wooden frame inside the tower, and build your interior that way. I&#039;m not sure which I&#039;d prefer, but these are choices you alone must make. <br><br>You&#039;ll want knowledge of concrete, and you&#039;ll want to understand loads and a bit of symmetry. The proportions if this tower must be equal. Consider also the drainage for your tower. When water runs off it, it should not collect at the foundation.", "filename": "1671719131799324", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 817, "h": 569, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1673050651115671, "time": 1673050651, "md5": "K6GHhdwcr2JT3jrXURPtkw==", "fsize": 72794, "resto": 2536571}, {"no": 2537297, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:40:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2536571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2536571</a><br>Build a form from the finest pallets to support your shipping containers which you then fill with concrete after stacking in castellary fashion.<br><br>Use your feeding spoon as a trowel.", "time": 1673055604, "resto": 2536571}, {"no": 2537309, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:53:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Just pour one with concrete, then apply wallpaper and seal it.

Pretty cool to see it done, but naturally, there are many ways to make this much better. Disney spent absolutely no time at all making the buildings or anything there look authentic. I personally would have gone for a European-esque city square or street. If you arrange the buildings well enough, you could always immerse yourself in your creation. That Disney pic is bad cause the buildings are shit and so is that blue light which obviously ends all immersion for anyone there. You can easily see that the roof is right there and that the end of the building is by that blue light. <br><br><a href=\"#p2541006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2541006</a><br>Yeah and with enough cleverness and fauna, correct building materials, you could simulate pretty much anywhere you want. I would have a main street, wouldn&#039;t be too long, and at the end of the street maybe a very regal building, and to the left and right of that you&#039;d have a few more buildings. So if you were on main street, you could look down either end and not see any sign that you were inside a building. I think the ceiling would have to be quite high, or coated with an extremely black paint. <br><br>The real beauty of such a place would be the buildings inside of the building. An old world themed and cigar lounge kinda steakhouse...which you can do whatever you want it, and maybe across the street there&#039;s some apartments for when people stay over. <br><br>Some guy did a small version of this in Wisconsin, can&#039;t remember the name of the place but it&#039;s vaguely similar. The only difference is, this guy was a faggoty artist who made most of the house into a weird art exhibit, but there&#039;s a portion of this large house which look like a small city street. Kinda cool too see. <br><br>Wait I found it.

Shrapnel protection for children. Reading about it on https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak_jac<wbr>ket <br><br>During the Korean and Vietnam wars, the flak jacket was changed and the manganese steel plates were replaced by other materials.[5] The U.S. Army&#039;s vests (Body Armor, Fragmentation Protective, Vest M69) weighed under eight pounds and were made of 12 layers of ballistic nylon. The vests used by the U.S. Marines (Vest, Armored M-1955) weighed more than ten pounds and were a combination of ballistic nylon layers and fiberglass plates known as Doron.[3] Doron was made of fiberglass fibers placed in an ethyl cellulose resin under high pressure. It was named after then-Colonel Georges F.

if you can, are you sure you&#039;re not feeling two? move the pick back and forth slightly until you can feel it better. once you&#039;re sure you have one, you can continue. if not, select a pin you might think works better. remember that slimmer and smaller is usually better on padlocks. don&#039;t try to single pin pick with a fuckin clover pick. just a hook is best.<br><br>then, apply some tension with a tension bar placed at the bottom of the keyway. a good idea for tensioning is what you might apply to a real key: since you&#039;re learning, lock and unlock your padlock with the key to figure out how much tension it takes. then, slowly move your pin up so you have a tactile and audible *click* and your tumbler moves a little bit. hold the lock up to your ear if you&#039;re a half-deaf retard like me. the important part is that you memorize not where the pin sets, but how it feels when it sets. it&#039;s very distinctive.<br><br>now that your first pin is set, you can move to the next: slowly and steadily move the next pin up. maintain pressure on the tumbler, try not to release it or apply a lot more. it&#039;s a balancing act, but it&#039;s easy to understand after a few tries.<br><br>if you can set the other 3-5 pins, you&#039;ll turn the tumbler. most cheap padlocks only have 4 non-security pins, so you won&#039;t need to worry about false sets from serrated or mushroom pins. 1/2", "time": 1673226079, "resto": 2538214}, {"no": 2538677, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)20:08:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2538672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2538672</a><br>2/2<br><br>now i&#039;ll tell you the easy ways to say &quot;fuck this shit&quot; and negro-hack locks.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1</span><br>you see that wiggly pick there that has teeth about halfway down?
