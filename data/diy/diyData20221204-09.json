A UV light source or dedicated curing station (if you get a station, get a UV flashlight too for curing spilled resin on paper towels so it doesn&#039;t offgas from the trash bin). Rubber gloves, paper towels, sharp putty knife for removing prints, at least one spare memory card.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How much will I end up spending on resin and accessories comparatively?</span><br>Different resins formulated for different purposes cost different amounts. Around $15/liter for cheapo ones to $75 for high performance moulding resin that can be used for things like vulcanizing rubber products, to several times that for specialty things like ceramic or metal impregnated resin intended to produce sintered parts. Good structural resins for utilitarian purposes may be in the neighborhood of $40-50 per liter, while decent modeling resins may be around half that. IPA is somewhat expensive in the amounts used for cleaning, but it&#039;s not awful if purchased in bulk. UV lights can be pretty cheap, so you don&#039;t HAVE to spend much on accessories. However, there is a tradeoff between cost and hassle. Making do with very basic cleaning and curing supplies is notoriously bothersome, while something like a Prusa CW1 makes it a breeze.

It took me about 2-3 years to get to this point but I can easily make a grand a week now with relatively little stress on my own time. The same could be said of any field. You could set up security systems for old people and if you are persistent you will find a niche and clientele. One thing I would recommend with the building trades is not getting into the heavy labor side. You can market yourself as a custom &quot;anything&quot; (fence, cabinet, entryway ect). Once you get there you can charge alot more. Never Never Never equate what constitutes a high price in your eyes with your customers view of things. People have given me 8 hundred dollar tips on 4 day jobs because my bid was way too low. Never be affraid to start a bid high. If they like you, they will ushually pay you. Sometimes you have to lose a day to make them happy. If a customer loves you they will almost certainly talk to their friends about you and then it is game over.

Modern Times Brewing in San Diego designs their tasting rooms to use reclaimed &quot;retro&quot; materials, and their bars are decorated to look like a VHS stack like what you have pictured. They build a regular (wooden probably) structure, then use a bunch of paper VHS covers to make a collage. I&#039;ve seen this thing IRL and I can guarantee you it looks like ass. The artist who drew your picture in the OP was able to make something cute and tasteful because they had full control over all the colors. Unless you are going to design and print hundreds of labels yourself, you are going to end up with a hideous mix of browns, blues, beiges, reds and whites that will make your living room look like an old thrift store.", "filename": "North Park Flavordomerev2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1400, "h": 882, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1670111020376892, "time": 1670111020, "md5": "TkOPnYpsVlwvh2YyU/WIUA==", "fsize": 1148730, "resto": 2514636}, {"no": 2514760, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)18:59:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2514748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2514748</a><br>People are giving VHS tapes all the time free on classifieds.

Still, it was a massive pain in the ass to do some 40 meters of edging this way. I also didn&#039;t have a very good setup for trimming edges with a router, did a lot of it manually with a chisel.

It was also completely impossible to use it for banding thicker than 1mm, even 1mm was difficult. 0.5-0.7mm was alright.<br>This is what I then bought https://www.aliexpress.com/item/400<wbr>0569137844.html and first tests went well. It&#039;s pretty fast, the bond it leaves is really strong as it applies glue on both the ABS strip and the wood, and thanks to all the big rollers you can squeeze the edge on hard, even 2mm strips stuck just fine. Will see how it holds up next time I actually have a larger amount of edges to glue.

So far this is what I know:<br>144 LED per 5m is the densest so get that one if density is important. Heat can be a problem with higher densities. You can use a computer power supply for 3v 5v and 12v. You\u2019ll want a separate power supply for the controller, probably an extra 5w USB charger. You\u2019ll need a relay. The controller is either an ESP32 if you want BT or esp8266 if you\u2019re ok with WiFi. There\u2019s an app on iOS and android called WLED that can control it if you upload the firmware to the boards. <br>If you\u2019re ok with wasting about half your power used you can ignore the relays. I think they use about 60w~84w at the highest density.
