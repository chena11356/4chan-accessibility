His system combines a 7\u2033 800 x 480 TFT screen, an SD card reader acting as the disk, and a PS/2 port for connecting a keyboard. <br><br>He began by mounting the TFT display shield to the Arduino by slotting it in place and inserting an SD card to function as the external disk since floppy drives have long since disappeared and would be far too unwieldy. After soldering some additional wires to the SPI and I2C bus pins, a level shifter was attached to two digital pins that serve as the data and clock lines for the external PS/2 socket. <br><br>Most of the \u201cmagic\u201d in this project comes from the programming which handles everything from reading inputs to showing graphics on the LCD and even interfacing with other peripherals over either I2C or SPI. All of the code needed for this retro home computer can be found here in Lenz\u2019s tinybasic repository, which contains a plethora of example projects and demonstrations that can be run/modified.<br><br>https://github.com/slviajero/tinyba<wbr>sic", "filename": "own made pc", "ext": ".png", "w": 1599, "h": 609, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 47, "tim": 1668699759415565, "time": 1668699759, "md5": "wekMOVSJYIwO/ETfvWWoSQ==", "fsize": 1347617, "resto": 2491169}, {"no": 2504609, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)10:45:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504607</a><br>try to play with some trnsistors of a computer it can have nice effects while using it", "time": 1668699902, "resto": 2491169}, {"no": 2504611, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)10:55:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2504607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2504607</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most of the \u201cmagic\u201d in this project comes from</span><br><br>The idiot who wrote this line has no business writing about tech.", "time": 1668700540, "resto": 2491169}], "last_modified": 1668700540}, {"no": 2504443, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:43:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I want to make a better workbench.

If you&#039;re in a large metropolitan area, available frequencies in the FM band are going to be tough to find. Best way to do that is to drive around and tune throughout the band. Ideally, you&#039;ll want something with an open channel on both sides, but good luck.<br>The tricky part is determining how much power and antenna height you&#039;ll need. The simple way to figue is, if you can get an antenna about 20 - 30ft in the air, 10 watts can ideally give you a few mile radius. To double your distance, rither quadruple your power output or antenna eight. <br>Easiest antennas are simple 1/2 wave or 1/4 wave ground plane. You can find sites to tell you how to make those, but take a coat hanger, straighten out, and cut it to length. Use the formula 468/freq (in Mhz) then multiply by 12 to get inches for your length. Solder into a PL259 connector. Cut your radials same length and attach to the corners of the connector and bend at 45 degree angle. <br>20ft metal or Schedule 80 pipe works great for portable tower with a TV tripod. Use 50 ohm coax. <br>Transmitters can be found on E-bay. Avoid Chinese made units, for they&#039;re dirty and their singal splatters. Free Radio Berkeley still builds them by hand, but he&#039;s slow and it&#039;ll take months for him to finish.<br><br>Good luck, Anon. Read around the net to learn more.

The ML was designed to recognize people&#039;s faces, and then send a signal to the arduino &amp; motor circuit to change direction. The robot (Harry) would then theoretically chase the person around the room. It was laggy (the TPU and arduino do not interface well), and the signals became all confused when the sonar and TPU issued different commands. Probably possible if I went back and put more time into it. Here&#039;s Harry (he has a gf robot called Sally). I&#039;ve stolen the TPU battery and camera off it for other things, and he&#039;s dusty af, but he&#039;s 98% alive.<br><br>Anyway, to relate this to you, you need a TPU like a Coral board and a LOT of images to recognize terrain.

More specifically cleaned in advance of a condition survey to determine rehab method.<br>Or they may be cleaned for odor control. Any sewage that rises above the level of the pipe shelf in a storm event and can stick to the walls, especially for brick manholes or those with severe sulfide attack, will cause odor if the cover is vented, even if the pipes are flowing normally.<br>They could also be cleaned in advance of jetting or CCTV on the sewer pipes that pass through the manhole. But this is not absolutely necessary as this can and should be done remotely (from the surface).<br>OP&#039;s video I assume is not taken in America as the worker is violating OSHA requirements for confined space and PPE. But in this situation it would be necessary to jet clean a brick manhole to replace grout between the bricks, or to apply a cementitious liner (basically a layer of non-shrink grout that covers the bricks), or a structural epoxy liner (a one- or three-layer spray that creates a new manhole that is structurally sound even if the existing manhole crumbles around it).<br>The general purpose of rehabilitation is either to replace broken infrastructure without open cuts that close down roads to traffic and are more expensive, or to reduce inflow/infiltration (storm runoff that enters sanitary sewers and must be treated, or cause overflows where untreated sewage/stormwater is released into surface waters).<br>I have plenty of photos demonstrating sewer rehabilitation if anyone wants them.<br>The point is that all of you should be mindful of the effort that goes into making sure your shit leaves your house in an orderly manner.

If you haven&#039;t a recent eye exam get one and remember optometrists can write multiple prescriptions at one visit. I wear separate glasses for near vision and driving. Know what &quot;cheaters&quot; (plain magnifying lenses) are. Know the location of your local welding suppliers and visit them. <br><br>Different people prefer different tints and shade levels. I mostly weld with shade 9 gold or blue tinted lenses. <br><br>Have spare gloves (welding gloves are consumables) so you don&#039;t interrupt booth time replacing them. Have spare clear cover lenses for whatever helmet you wear because it&#039;s typical to expend one a day. You need to see to weld. Dress for work not the block and remember whatever you wear gets a spark bath. <br><br>A large visegrip plier is quite handy (I weld T-handles, just some 1/4&quot; scrap rod, to the adjusting knob to use it with gloves and because tightening the handle is vastly more powerful than manual squeeze.<br><br>See what the school issues for tools. Some don&#039;t issue small angle grinders because students destroy shit. Minimum personal grinder size should be a smallish bodied 6&quot; to use thin kerf cutting wheels as wells a 4-1/2&quot; rocks. If your school doesn&#039;t issue flap discs and you&#039;re not poor feel free to bring some. A rugged plastic bucket is the usual welder tote with an added rope handle.
