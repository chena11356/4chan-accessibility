I was thinking about using a current transformer to measure load current and line voltage (line voltage measured with a resistor in series with current transformer) and an ADC connected to a microcontroller. The issue I came across is that the line voltage is mostly a sinusoidal wave, while the load current can be really fucked up. How would I go to measure the power when the current has all sorts of frequencies, including some high frequency in the case of some loads such as switch mode power supplies. In other words, how would I design a reliable current sensor that can handle such loads and measure the real power used by the load?

Probably using DSP, since analogue multiplication is hard. Also consider a transformer or isolated ADC+divider for mains voltage, to prevent the majority of your digital circuitry from being mains referenced. A differential amplifier measuring live-neutral and referencing it to ground also works. Naturally you&#039;ll need anti-aliasing filters to obey the nyquist sampling theorem on both ADC inputs.

Worst case you&#039;ve got an SMPS putting out high frequency current noise so you just get a bunch of aliases wildly throwing off the power factor calculations. At least dampening them with a low pass filter doesn&#039;t give false frequency spikes. Arguably you might be fine with a pretty low frequency for your ADC, since parallel caps and series chokes are everywhere, though it depends on the purpose of your power measurement.

Ultimately you want the attenuation at and above your Nyquist frequency to be such that any signal there gets stamped into nothingness. If you want 8-bits of resolution then the attenuation will be a lot less than if you want a full 24 bits of resolution. If you increase the Nyquist frequency significantly past your desired bandwidth, then you&#039;ll have more room for attenuation. Say if your desired bandwidth is 4kHz, and you want 60dB of attenuation, then a 5kHz nyquist frequency means 60dB/0.1dec = 600dB/decade (30 pole filter lmao).

The Arduino IDE has a function called &quot;tone()&quot; that uses the aforementioned timer hardware to play a note.

In addition, I&#039;m not too sure how you&#039;d get two pins operating as a synchronous push-pull waveform output, you&#039;d likely have to write your own replacement for the tone function in order to use two timer pins with the same comparator value but with one inverted.<br>Pic related is my own shitty code from 2 years ago for an rgbduino (the one with the anime girl on it) to play megalovania when you plug it in. I used python to generate the array of note values from a midi file.<br>FYI, I&#039;d refrain from using unmodified Arduino hardware as the built-in LEDs make low-power operation pretty tough; you&#039;d eat through the batteries kinda quickly.

And using more flux than necessary never hurts. The solder is probably unknown chinese metal which doesn&#039;t help but it should be usable enough. If it&#039;s a chinese kit then it&#039;s probably one of those wall powered irons with a little temperature dial on it. The temperature probably isn&#039;t accurate so just turn it up so that the solder melts within one or two seconds of touching the iron.

If we want 20 mA going through LED, we would need to push transistor to amplify it to something like 200 mA, but it wouldn&#039;t reach that because it will saturate before it could pull that much current. For V1 = 9V and Vbe = 0.6V and gain of 80, to get 200 mA capacity R1 would need to be R = (9V - 0.6V)/(200mA/80) = 33600 ohm. You can safely use even something like 10k, 33.6k is maximum value that would work as intended. This will turn transistor into a switch which would have 0.2V across collector and emitter. Now you just need to select R1 to limit current through LED. For 20 mA, R = (V1 - Vled - Vsat)/I_led = (9V - 3V - 0.2V)/20mA = 290 ohm.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and does the led have a voltage drop or resistance?</span><br>It has both.

It is not a microcontroller. It does have some I/O pins, but the OS mostly gets in the way of using them. And you have to deal with it like a full computer, keeping the OS running, etc.<br>A microcontroller has nothing but maybe a bootloader. Any OS is built into your project. And there is usually nothing like a file system or network ports.<br><br>It&#039;s also that much more to throw out when (not if) something gets zapped. I was making a chip reader with a blue pill, and accidentally touched a +12 wire to an I/O pin, and now the thing runs hot because of the blown pin. I knew what I was doing, and was being careful, and still zapped it. I&#039;m kind of surprised that&#039;s the only time, there were other times I thought I had, and was wrong. But I started with a bag of twenty for $40 including shipping, seven-ish years ago, and most are still in the bag. And even then, it&#039;s only the main chip. I have some lower-spec ST chips that should drop right in.<br>The main thing you want when playing around with microcontrollers is to have identical spares around. You still want to be careful whenever you hook it up to something, but when it happens you need to be able to pull out another one and get back to work. If you had to change chip type, you would have to fuck with your build configuration. Also it lets you keep more than one project in progress at the same time. Blue pill is about as chink as you can get and still be able to get more.<br><br>The thing about micro:bit is that it already has a few useful things on the board (like the LED matrix), so you can do stuff without hooking it up anything, and it has the &quot;better&quot; I/O pins brought out to big holes you can clip to.

So I&#039;m guessing maybe 12-20 cycles each. Then another pair of additions, then the inverse matrix, then the inverter.

First, play some &#039;pink noise&#039; through your loudspeakers nice and loud. Go to the other room and listen - if you hear mainly a hissing sound, find the direction it&#039;s coming from and look around there for gaps and cracks between the loudspeaker and the receiving room. If it&#039;s a lower rumbling noise you hear, then the issue is mass so there&#039;s not much you can do without building a new or additional partition. <br><br>You could add some absorption inside your room, if so then get products which are min 25mm thick (so it will work better with lower end of human voice frequencies).

By the time they are in high school, most kids dislike math and science because they think they&#039;re too hard. They aren&#039;t hard, they&#039;ve just been failed in one or more topics. Failing is a normal part of learning any subject, but schools don&#039;t give kids time to go back and retry things they didn&#039;t master the first time. So kids just accept that they &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; x subject and have to leave it at that because it&#039;s time to move on. Teachers have curriculum goals that they have to meet so that when standardized testing rolls around, enough kids can give enough right answers to keep the school funded.<br><br>Subjects like language arts and history are a lot harder to fail, because there&#039;s less to get wrong, so kids end up thinking these subjects are the only things they are &quot;good&quot; at.

They won&#039;t taste exactly the same because cigarette manufacturers use a proprietary blend of flavors and treatments that is responsible for the distinct taste of their cigs. You can still find plenty of good quality, cheap tobacco (menthol, light, regular, extra bold, etc) but it will never be an exact match for your favorite brand.<br>Another thing is that these homemade ones will always burn just slightly differently than the industrial ones. Industrially made cigarettes are (AFAIK) made from a specially prepared reconstituted tobacco paper rather than shredded leaves. They do this to make things easier for their treatment steps, but also to make the mix have a 100% consistent texture and consistency that helps avoid problems with their processing and packing machinery. When you buy the cheap bags of raw tobacco, it&#039;s just leaves that have been cut/shredded to a consistency which is appropriate for rolling or tube packing cigs. So sometimes you may have a tiny inconsistency or packing error and wind up with a small void or an end of the tube that doesn&#039;t pack completely.<br><br>After you get familiar with the perfect amount of leaf to load in the machines chamber by doing a couple dozen cigs, you&#039;ll start to avoid this issue for the most part.<br><br>All in all, it&#039;s super cheap and easy to do and I&#039;m always amazed that more smokers don&#039;t RYO", "time": 1671219875, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523186, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Use your fingers roll em up<br>Look like a doobie man farout and groovy", "time": 1671220088, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523192, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:01:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523144</a><br>It can save you money, but it won&#039;t, it&#039;ll just give you the option to pop out $10-$20 cartons at will.<br><br>Fuck tubes, they&#039;re gross, and filling them yourself is a waste of time.<br>If you&#039;re going to roll your own, roll them.

They work great for a bit of usage then always have the same problem. I ended up buying an electronic one for a hundred dollars to test it out. Broke even in cost within 2 months, and actually had beer money left over after that. I kept having to travel for work and going out of town it wasn&#039;t practical to ever make enough to bring with and it was noticeable how fast buying packs would burn through cash. Even though it takes 5 minutes to make a pack worth of cigarettes with it usually it isn&#039;t worth the time compared to a tobacco pipe for me personally. Your mileage may vary. It was more than worth it for me the machines worked for over 5 years now (way more than I ever got out of hand crank ones) it&#039;s nice to be able to knock out a few really fast if I&#039;m in the mood for a cig, and they&#039;re convenient when walking around outside and it&#039;s windy on the way between the bar to pick up a few drinks. It can be difficult getting consistency in how tightly they&#039;re packed, with hand cranks you can pack a tube so tighly you basically can&#039;t keep it lit, electronic ones will jam and you can&#039;t force it and have to break it up and go with much looser packing in cigarettes, so you want to smoke them if you got them otherwise they&#039;ll tend to shake loose while you&#039;re walking around. It&#039;s not a big deal if you got a hard case you can just throw the shake back into the machine and repack it, tear off the empty part of the tube that it fell out, it can be annoying if you got like 3 half cigarettes, but you get a sense for which ones will do that and to smoke them first.

You know, propane is the ultimate energy source. It&#039;s clean, it&#039;s reliable, and it&#039;s affordable. Plus, you don&#039;t need no fancy electricity to run your appliances and lights. Just beautiful, clean propane for everything. You&#039;ll save money on your utility bills and you&#039;ll be doing your part to help the environment. So go ahead and make the switch to propane - you won&#039;t regret it.<br><br>Peggy, have I told you about my idea for an all-propane house? Think about it - no more expensive electricity bills, no more worrying about power outages. Just beautiful, clean propane for everything. It&#039;s not like we need all those fancy electrical gadgets anyway. I mean, what did we do before we had electricity? We managed just fine. So let&#039;s do it - let&#039;s build an all-propane house and make the switch to a simpler, more efficient way of living.<br><br>We should do it Peggy, we could make it real. The first home powered entirely by propane, not a wire in sight.", "time": 1670347004, "resto": 2514747}, {"no": 2517561, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)22:53:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Two roads over, there is something I call &quot;The Redneck Compound&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nestled between two swamps in a valley</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A singlewide trailer with an extended roof supported by stacks of tree stumps and logs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A pool next to the road, it&#039;s usually green</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Five sheds, some wood and some steel, scabbed together to form mega-shed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also connected to the singlewide and mega-shed is a quonset made out of scrap metal and multiple layers of canvas tarps</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another singlewide trailer is adjacent to the first structure</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Washing machine and dryer are in the lawn with 240 extension cords running to them</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spigot runs to a shower head hanging from a tree near the road</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Giant burn pit in the center of the dirt driveway</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Makeshift spit formed from rebar, they&#039;re always cooking something on it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spit is powered by a 1970s F150 on cinder blocks with a belt running from the driveshaft like in Predator</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A large chicken-wire rodeo area complete with goats, a cow, two horses, and a shitload of chickens co-existing on about 900 square feet of grass</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New dog every week or two, since they let them run loose and they get hit hy traffic</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trash and junk everywhere.

You shouldn&#039;t be seeing blue with just the fuel on, you also don&#039;t have to make a huge acetylene flame before lighting the oxy, I&#039;d say once the flame has volume and is putting out thick black smoke then you&#039;re good for the oxy. When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

I think the most efficient way to to this would be to somehow automate or at least greatly simplify the process of loading entire logs into the combustion chamber.<br><br>As for wood pellets, a lot of the reason for their efficiency advantages don&#039;t apply in a gasifier. They&#039;re more efficient than a regular wood stove because they burn using a forced convection system, and as a result of the forced convection and their high density they burn at a much higher temperature than regular wood. Forced convection isn&#039;t possible in a gasifier and the heat of the reaction doesn&#039;t matter much when the process you&#039;re using relies on further chemical reactions downstream of the gasifier.<br><br>I also question if charcoal in a gasifier is a good idea. The process of making charcoal is essentially the same thing as what&#039;s happening in a gasifier, except by separating those processes you&#039;d be losing out on the stream of volatile exhaust gases that come out of the charcoal and relying solely on the carbon monoxide to fuel your car.

What I liked about my creality is that it was &quot;affordable&quot; and it had a lot of support and community online. But that was around 2018/2019. There is a big down side to creality regarding the time and money wasted calibrating and improving your machine so that it is up to brass. There is the upside that you will learn a lot along the way but for some the time wasted and money invested is simply not worth it. I get that some people simply cannot or do not want to waste time tinkering.

By then ender should have also put out higher quality printers or same quality printers but at a cheaper price. From what ive seen they did try doing that but their quality is still held back by the consumer having to still modify and calibrate the machine. Prussa sissies are right in saying that creality is retarded in the sense that they makes poor design choices.

Rusty, splintery, poorly cared for tools are the mark of either a fucktard or a poser and you need to steer clear of them.<br><br>To condition your wooden tools, use a plane to take off the varnish and apply linseed oil. If your tool handle is oversized, you can use your plane to give it an octagonal shape which many old trades guys swear by for comfort. Allow it to cure completely, then apply at least one layer of Walrus Brand tool oil, both to the handle and to the steel head of whatever tool it is. If your tool (or PPE) has leather components, use Obenauf&#039;s leather oil and conditioner. If the tool is rusted, use steel wool or another abrasive to remove excess rust and restore remaining rust with 30% vinegar. If you&#039;re going to paint your tools, use the highest quality enamel paint you can get your hands on and follow the instructions else it will not last. Should your tool have moving internal parts, the manufacturer likely recommends specific products to lubricate with, and there are many different kinds of lubrication and grease that vary in their intended use (temperature/climate, use severity, etc).<br><br>So why am I telling you about restoring and conditioning your tools if you&#039;re interested in being a poser?

Anyone else have a wife that makes a lot more money than them? What is life like? Anons it is getting to be an insane disparity for me. I work in engineering in the Midwest USA meaning basically that at a country level I make shit pay. I make like $70k which is middling and I don&#039;t want to go into management. I met my wife like 5 years ago pre-covid. She is a programmer and once WFH happened she could work &#039;anywhere&#039; and her earning potential exploded. She now works for a tech company on the west coast and makes triple my salary. She has been promoted once already and she has been told she might become management and we still won&#039;t even have to move so it&#039;s probably going to be quadruple my salary soon. Anyone else in a marriage like this? I feel like I&#039;m dead weight holding us as a couple back. I&#039;m not even sure why I work any more. My engineering degree has been a huge bust. I&#039;m just wondering at what point is she going to realize I&#039;m a loser with no prospects and dragging her down instead of being with someone who makes comparable pay? As a couple she could easily be almost a millionaire with someone in a similar position to her. Also she&#039;s not bad with money per se but she is falling hard for lifestyle creep. She makes exponentially more money than either me or her former self and we don&#039;t even own a home or property.

I&#039;m not writing this as a slight against you OP, it&#039;s just a bad mentality to have where the value we place on ourselves and our relationships is so dependent on how much money is earned. I get that it&#039;s necessary to survive, but it&#039;s an unfortunate reality that one is seen as less valuable in dating/working/social contexts because they don&#039;t work a stellar job; even if their character is impeccable. <br><br>You should also talk with your wife about your finances, how you plan to budget for necessary expenses, etc; but don&#039;t talk to her in a patronizing way about it. It&#039;s very true that most women aren&#039;t that great with money, there&#039;s a reason why most marketing targets women and most consumer spending is done by women. You both should have an agreed upon way of how your money is saved and spent, if you&#039;re pooling your earnings together. It&#039;s a top reason for divorces, so don&#039;t go in expecting things to work out perfectly.<br><br>You also seem a bit anxious about your worth relative to your wife, and fearful of abandonment if your perceived worth isn&#039;t enough for her. Talk to her about what she plans for in the future, what your relationship goals are, and find some reassurance.

On the downside, the passable results still required manual re-gluing with an iron about 70% of the time, maybe down to 50% after I got the hang of the required speed and consistency of feeding. Still, it was a massive pain in the ass to do some 40 meters of edging this way. I also didn&#039;t have a very good setup for trimming edges with a router, did a lot of it manually with a chisel.

It was also completely impossible to use it for banding thicker than 1mm, even 1mm was difficult. 0.5-0.7mm was alright.<br>This is what I then bought https://www.aliexpress.com/item/400<wbr>0569137844.html and first tests went well. It&#039;s pretty fast, the bond it leaves is really strong as it applies glue on both the ABS strip and the wood, and thanks to all the big rollers you can squeeze the edge on hard, even 2mm strips stuck just fine. Will see how it holds up next time I actually have a larger amount of edges to glue. Also I will definitely build a swiveling router mount for cutting the banding, I&#039;ve had it with chisels. <br>The steel frame was an extra layer of complication, if I had to build the same thing again, I&#039;d either go with thinner material or just use chipboard for the whole structure.

I did not say it was aggressively set, just that it is overset for miters which need little set. Any saw which works well for crosscutting will be overset (but still doable) for miters. It does flex but we are not talking flexing to the point where you see the blade bend or the cut curves, just a slight bend which can only be seen in the marks left by the tool, you can&#039;t avoid this and it is a fact of life. You can hear this flexing in many saws, if the blade rings during the cut it is because the blade is flexing fast enough to be vibrating and sound a note, especially noticeable when a saw is getting dull. Back saws generally will not ring like this since only ~50% of the blade can flex and that unflexing portion and the spine prevent the flexing from progressing to vibrating.

They are customized to support your pole barn. The centers come in 2, 4, or 8 ft, depending on the ceiling load. Trusses come in many shapes, but mainly these two:<br><br>Standard \u2013 has a flat bottom which allows for a flat ceiling<br><br>Scissor- crossed beams provide a vaulted ceiling. This gives you more head room or space for a loft if extra height is needed.<br>Overhang<br><br>This is how much roof is hanging past the walls on the ends and sides of the building. Overhang will typically be 12 to 24 inches.<br>Purlins<br><br>Purlins are the pieces of lumber on the roof that provide structure and where the metal panels are attached.<br>Girts<br><br>The girts are similar to the purlins in that they are 2x4s placed 24 inches on center, but on the walls instead of the roof. Girts also provide wall support.<br>Girder<br><br>The top support pieces are known as girders. Beam sizes will typically be 2\u00d710 or 2\u00d712.<br>Bottom Wall Girt- Skirt Board- Splash Board-Grade Board<br><br>There are several different names for the piece that sits on ground level.

It doesn&#039;t sound all that great, even ignoring my poor playing, but it&#039;s not difficult to get a solid note out of. There are things that could be slightly better on that front, but nothing that should really affect price.

Your goal is to generate enough heat with the rubbing to work it well into the grain. Main trick is to learn how much wax to apply, if you put on too much from the start the cloth/leather you use to rub it in with will just drag and you will not generate enough heat to get it to work into the grain. Start out light with the wax and work your way up to learn how much to apply. This is my standard finish for my planes, holds up well, nice in the hand and is one of the finest looking matte finishes out there. <br><br>You can do this with most waxes, paraffin wax does a good job as well and is a bit easier to work in.

The two newer ones have better wiring and electrical it seems, there\u2019s a lot more outlets and they actually have cieling fans and built in lighting where the older two expected you to plug in lamps in any bedroom. The newest house, the \u201899 house, it has to be built to a decent standard because South Florida implemented a ton of rules after Hurricane Andrew in \u201892, although my \u201889 Florida house was much more solid it seemed than the \u201870s house just a few blocks away, but I think it was an middle-upper-middle class home compared to a middle class house in the 70s. The \u201899 house has PVC pluming though, and there\u2019s something I don\u2019t really trust about it. Shit\u2019s easy to repair in lots of situations, but you always have to cut off a chunk that\u2019s cemented which means the original installed pipes get shorter and shorter every time or end up with a bunch of extra connections which means more potential for leaks.

PLA+ typically improves some of the drawbacks while sacrificing some of the strengths, resulting in something that doesn&#039;t quite fit the niches where regular PLA shines but which often compares poorly to other filaments like PETG and ASA.

Lots of them now have hollow handles for storage, but that really weakens it as the handle bends and sometimes even breaks in my hand when I grip too hard, the old metal ones never did that. Reason I still like them is I have had projects where I drive in hundreds and hundreds of screws by hand. I had bits wear out which lead to other problems. By switch to fresh bits as I go I didn&#039;t have to keep buying screw drivers which cost more then a box of bits. It also lets me change to other types as the job had 8 screw types, so finding a comfy handle each item was annoying.
