Goes a long way to making your stitches look right.<br><br>Understand that just because you have a pattern, it doesn&#039;t mean that it will just magically fit you.

When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

Biden also failed to handle energy properly, leading to more inflation because it takes energy to manufacture and transport literally everything, so if gas is expensive then everything else is more expensive too. Biden first begged the russians and saudis to produce more oil because he had to pander to environmnetalists domestically by not allowing drilling (even though it&#039;s cleaner here in the US). Then he told the US energy industry to go fuck themselves, and even chided the Saudis. For a guy who touts diplomacy instead of &quot;bombing the shit out of [other countries]&quot; like Trump literally said, Biden is pretty shit.

The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;).

Also driving an inductive load directly is a good way to accidently chuck bigass voltage transients back into the chip that it is not designed to handle.<br><br>You could kind of draw a parallel to designing primitive USB peripherals. Modern high power mode negotiation aside, USB isn&#039;t meant to deliver very much current, but if you average out your power demands over time, then it&#039;s entirely reasonable to use to, say, power a small audio amplifier where you&#039;d expect large transient demands for like kick drums or really loud sections, but well within the ability of the bus to power over the length of a song. So obviously what you wind up doing is chucking some appropriately sized capacitors in the power section to be able to take up the slack when more instantaneous current than USB can supply is required. But what happens when you plug in those empty capacitors? Bam it&#039;s basically a sustained short circuit from the perspective of the USB controller, so you have to put in reistors inline before them so that even if it were a short past the resistor it still wouldn&#039;t sink enough current to cause a problem. And that way the capacitors will slowly top themselves up as possible.<br><br>Ideally the H bridge would also take care of voltage spikes from an inductive load, but protection diodes (e.g. a zener after your input reisitors) might be enough beltt and suspenders without worrying about using an approrpiate choike or T/pi filter in line with the resistor.

Otherwise you just built a radiator without any fins and a useless hose coming out the top. Presumably an intake on the bottom and an exhsut on top would let convection do its thing.<br><br>But here&#039;s the trick. A hose run through a pile of sand isn&#039;t a terribly great heat exchanger (you want to use a metal hose obviously, rather than something that would insulate the air in the hose from the warm sand. So basically you need a heat exchanger inside the pot to do the same job that fins on the outside of the pot did if you were using external convection instead of internal convection. Now, you might or might get decent results just coiling the tube all around in there. A typical, say, gas fired forced air furnace uses something much more like a car&#039;s radiator full of lots of channels and fins so that the air moving through the furnace has maximum surface area exposure to the heat of the flame. So if you have an old car radiator or intercooler or whatever then that might be a a substantial upgrade. I would also suggest keeping the diameter of the hose not very big so that once the convection gets going you&#039;ll have a reasonable velocity of air to act in a siphon-like fashion, since air, unlike water, is compressable and won&#039;t siphon as intensely based on a low pressure differential. A fan could cure this, but you can experiment with that as a later step.<br><br>In theory it should work, but you might need to mess around to get it to work well. I suspect you might have better results with water, since it stores and conducts heat relatively well, and all you&#039;d need to do is put a pressure relief valve on top in case you start boiling it. But there&#039;s no harm in trying sand (or even wet sand!) and not worry about venting pressure just to see. Substantially venting vapor then you know you have an inefficient heat exchange and need more velocity or surface area", "time": 1675802605, "resto": 2548172}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2554031, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)04:39:43", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Making my own slow-release tablets", "com": "I want to make my own slow/extended release tablets to release a drug over preferably 8 or so hours, or more.

You&#039;ve identified HPMC as a rate controlling polymer, which is further than 90% of people would get (nice work!), but you have a lot of planning to do before you even hit the formulations stage.<br>You need to figure out how you plan on creating a homogeneous dry blend without a V-blender, also how will you test content uniformity of your tablets? Chromatography seems like it&#039;s off the table, but if you have an analytical balance you can do it by weight if your blend uniformity is good and your tablet weight and API amount are high enough. <br>How you will test dissolution of your tablets for the rate of release without a dissolution apparatus and chromatographic equipment? Getting an HPMC + API blend into tablet form isn&#039;t your biggest hurdle, it&#039;s making sure that the product doesn&#039;t dump API into your system too quickly and cause you to OD, or take 48 hours to release entirely. You have to know this information alongside having tested for proper distribution before you go munching your Kitchen Crank ER\u2122 Tablets (the force you compress the tablets with will also affect the release rate so it&#039;s not a single variable equation).<br>You haven&#039;t mentioned what API you are working with yet (do you have a CoA for it or know the purity?). You need to verify that there are no interactions between your API and excipients, which is usually conducted using IR spectroscopy, but you might be able to find literature on this pertaining to your specific API compound.<br>Even if you&#039;re successful with making a rate controlled tablet (which isn&#039;t impossible, but you have a ton of prep work to do) there are additional tests and variables that factor into your production process.<br><br>Very interesting thread, curious to see where it ends up, but I don&#039;t blame you if you choose not to pursue the project.

It may shock you but hobbies can be done by anyone and I think people would be a lot happier if hobbies were less gendered. Just because I like crocheting stuff I don&#039;t have to be female and I don&#039;t have to be a guy because I like playing games lol anyone can do those things ANYONE, you, me! My job is cool because it&#039;s like truly neutral. I look after kids and play vidya with them which is like &quot;feminine&quot; stuff combined with &quot;masculine&quot; stuff and I have both male and female colleagues and the kids I have in my groups are not just boys but there are also girls so this thing shows how idiotic it is to think about stuff in some absolute binary thing instead of pretty neutral things that culture has assigned some labels but the labels are really pretty arbitrary or come from some old stuff that&#039;s not relevant anymore like how good wives would sew and knit and crochet and stuff and then the idea of those as something girly is blocking you guys from even trying. Idk I could build stuff too if I&#039;d practice and somehow got stronger but I honestly hated all the woodwork stuff we did at school because I hardly could use any tools and it took me ages to saw through stuff and the machines scared me (but painting the products was fun!) and my creations were bad...

Now the absolute most powerful way to brew anything..<br><br>First you need to start with ultra high quality water. No horse shit tap water. No bottled water from the single use bottles the water quality in those is still shit. Get yourself a 5 gallon Jug of water with a tap on it. You can get it from water stores. You want double reverse Osmosis water. Now what you&#039;ll want to do is get your coffee bean. I recommend a good kind like 100% Arabica. Some broke fags prefer Guatamalan which is decent. Now what you need to do is grind it into a powder put it in a tea bag or a diffuser and put your diffuser in your coffee pot. And then put the pot of coffee in the fridge for 48-72 hours. This is called cold brew. And it&#039;s potent as fuck. Now once you&#039;ve got your ultra dank cold brew. Pour it into your cup and dilute that shit with milk and brown sugar add a little bit of cinnamon even add a little bit of chocalate flakes and whipped cream if you want to be extra fancy. And that&#039;s how you have a kick ass cup of coffee. It&#039;s expensive at first. Buying the water jug will set you back about $50. But if you&#039;re a serious coffee drinker it&#039;ll be worth it.

Even if you go for a cutlass bearing, you&#039;ll still likely be unable to prevent water ingress, even one of those spiral shaft bearings that actively purge water would only work until a certain (probably shallow) depth. So I&#039;d look at motors used in those hydroplane electric surfboards, which I think have been designed with water flowing inside the housing with bearings that can handle that.<br>The other option (as Hyperspace Pirate alluded to in his submarine kayak video) is to have a way of equalising internal and external pressure, if just into the section where the motor is stored. He suggests using something like a balloon with far more inflated volume than the motor, such that as water pressure crushes the balloon it keeps the motor pressure the same as the outside pressure. That way the bearings don&#039;t need to hold back the pressure of the water, which is particularly important for him using brushed motors. Potential downsides include instability; you have more buoyancy when at a shallower depth than at a deep depth, giving hysteresis / positive feedback. If you need sufficient ballast to descend when on the surface with full balloons, then you&#039;ll need to dump quite a lot of that when you&#039;re deep underwater with crushed balloons. Maybe there&#039;s an easy way of cancelling this out, but I can&#039;t think of one.<br><br><a href=\"#p2554939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554939</a><br>CH341 or FT232", "time": 1675370918, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554992, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:51:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554972</a><br><a href=\"#p2554974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554974</a><br><a href=\"#p2554989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554989</a><br>Trash.", "time": 1675371089, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554994, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:54:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554992</a><br>tell me the right and true answer, oh wise one.", "filename": "1640258812507", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 278, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1675371279797223, "time": 1675371279, "md5": "8midA0vIA5IQR4Qu3HXVqw==", "fsize": 2733979, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554997, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554992</a><br>raspee peeko lmao", "time": 1675371401, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554999, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:57:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554994</a><br>I don&#039;t know, which is why I&#039;m asking.", "time": 1675371470, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2555000, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:58:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554999</a><br>There is no answer.

Going further up the chain and paying someone to do all that for you is a lot less efficient, but so is going down the chain and making your own silicon and resistors. While there are a couple of people out there doing diy silicon, the extra utility from doing so is minimal, and the extra equipment required serves as a massive barrier to entry, not to mention the knowledge.

Got a bunch of shit from the night shift boomer to the point my boss asked him to come in later and the trainers were fairly strict in how they wanted shit to be done. Very sequential in every step. I&#039;d get bitched at for using the wrong broom. I hit the spindle against an aluminum fixture and pressed the corner of it down about 1/4&quot; while I was touching off a tool. That was my first big incident. A few weeks later, my trainer left me to do the opposite of a part we did in the morning and gave me the programs. He had them in the wrong folder and i uploaded them not realizing the program numbers were off, so I made a duplicate part with a wrong hole location (about 2 lbs of steel). I got sent home early for that and another of my trainers told me I wasn&#039;t cut out for this. I brought this up with my boss and he said he was inclined to agree. I asked to move to a different area with different trainers (I was about to go Private Pyle on these mfs) and he obliged. I went three months without scrapping any jobs (still made mistakes like bad pickups and not clearing the handle interrupt offset) but they were all fixable. My furnace blew out, I froze my ass off and came to work without sleep, leading the the vise incident. I was considered quiet but not a &quot;creep&quot;.

Because I like to frequently change coffees I would take the plastic hopper off every day to brush out the ridiculous amount of retained grounds. This required me to click through the entire size range, since the mechanism was built into the rotation of the hopper. Within six months the shitty little plastic tabs on the underside which engaged with the dial adjustment broke. Piece of trash. Realized immediately there was no fixing it.

It&#039;s a spinner you can quickly use with or without gloves for fast adjustment and as a T-handle it gives a very fucking large leverage increase over a much more awkward manual squeeze.

However continuity should be only tested while powered off. Anyway it is a good sign if all solenoids got the same resistance. Coils should working. For the next step you would test the voltage to make sure the relay switch on the control board is working. I know you hear a buzzing but it&#039;s better to know which solenoid is emitting it. To test it you would need to power on the machine and run a program, obviously. Make sure to not get electrocuted... I guess any of the three-way solenoids (the first or second from the left (blue/white) on the picture) should get a voltage of ~110V (if you are living in the US). Since you&#039;ve got resistance on the coils and receiving voltage, the left error source is a limescale problem in the solenoid and can be simply resolved by dissambling and cleaning it... or buying a new one if you want it. In the end, if you are unsure about measuring the three-way-solenoids, you can just skip this step and clean it (doesn&#039;t hurt anyway if your machine is old / often used)<br><br>Alternating voltage measurement with a mulitmeter:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53U<wbr>LYNFdfCo<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW1<wbr>3vjQjS5M<br><br>Solenoid animation:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swq<wbr>M8zpmAD8<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Biz<wbr>rXalCWps<br><br>Solenoid resistance measurement:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-66<wbr>1-1NbYZ4<br><br>Solenoid maintenance:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZ<wbr>95CzWrfA<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNF<wbr>a7aSfHgU (shitty quality)", "time": 1675528317, "resto": 2555438}, {"no": 2556199, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)13:06:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2555438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2555438</a><br>As long as you aren&#039;t retarded I would suggest unplugging the solenoids and putting the proper voltage on them to see if they operate.

At 1&quot; thickness depth of hardness will be about 3/16&quot;, at chisel size the quench is more efficient and goes deeper but lets go with 3/16&quot;, that is 3/16&quot; from all sides so most old chisels and all plane blades are actually through hardened with 1/2&quot; and up mortise chisels being the exception but even my old Stanley 1/8&quot; got twisted during a particularly deep mortise. <br><br>Irregularity in hardness along length comes more from tempering but you pretty much have to go to pre industrial revolution to see that and even then it is not the rule and depends on the markers method for tempering.

The cause of this irregularity in hardness was from applying the heat at the ass end of the blade and watching the color change down the blade, this left the ass end softer. But that is one off type work, before ovens the standard way was on a plate of steel over a fire, the plate evens the heat and allows you to do many at once with ease, but you still needed to watch it. <br><br>You seem to have swallowed every bit of marketing on steel that the tool manufactures throw out there.", "time": 1675033710, "resto": 2547519}, {"no": 2552313, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:47:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2552239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2552239</a><br><br>Yeah, I know.
