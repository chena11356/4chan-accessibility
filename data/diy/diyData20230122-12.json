They often come with stickers, which you can read to figure out what version they are. Even if the memory (or memory inside something like a microcontroller) is erasable, in the early days this meant high-voltage programming. Having provisions for any sort of in-circuit-programming, let alone HV programming, increases board complexity. This added complexity is highly significant when it comes to gen-3 computing&#039;s parallel data and address lines.<br><br>In addition, so long as the socket&#039;s connections can be relied on, it&#039;s also a way of making repairs easier at the expense of adding a few dollars to the board cost. For something expensive like computer hardware it&#039;s likely always worth it, at least back when clock speeds were in the MHz. Now-days the size constraints, both in terms of compact design and in terms of minimising trace length, and also in terms of BGA chips with far greater pin-counts, make socketing undesirable.

The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;).

In a way this makes sense because I recently did lower the air pressure in the tank by a few psi. However, the reason I lowered it is because (unless my pressure gauge is off by a few psi) it was a few psi higher than it is supposed to be for my pressure switch (given that my pressure switch was at the default spring settings).<br>Furthermore, to my understanding, once the water pressure reaches lower than the air pressure, the water goes out pretty much immediately if the pump doesn&#039;t kick in, meaning it should be set to make the pump kick in before reaching as low as the air pressure, meaning that loosening the spring should make the problem worse not better. Yet from what I can tell so far, it seems to be making it better, but again too soon to tell for sure.<br>Does this make any sense? Having the spring too tight (so too high of a cutoff/cuton pressure on the switch) relative to the air pressure in the tank (or alternative way of looking at it: Too low air pressure in the tank relative to the pressure switch&#039;s settings) would make the pressure switch fail to kick in when it gets down to the cuton pressure?<br><a href=\"#p2542884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2542884</a><br>Yea its possible<br><a href=\"#p2542901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2542901</a><br>I&#039;ve already learned about them a few weeks ago when I installed it", "time": 1673840496, "resto": 2542817}, {"no": 2543214, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)10:14:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You\u2019re checking the pressure tank with the water drained correct? 2nd thing I sometimes ran into was corrosion in the tee for the PSI or sediment getting into the pressure switch after swapping one out.", "time": 1673882044, "resto": 2542817}, {"no": 2543463, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)15:20:56", "name": "OP", "com": "I am now 99% certain the problem arose due to me lowering the air pressure, and resolved by me lowering the cuton/cutoff pressure.<br>When I had the frozen pipe a few weeks ago I learned about this stuff, including that the tank air pressure is supposed to be 2psi below the bottom of the pressure switch range.

In the interest of saving some time and money, I&#039;ve been thinking about building a DIY machine; even if we end up ordering the &quot;real&quot; machine, it would be useful to have something usable - if somewhat inferior - several months prior. I&#039;m a software/robotics engineer and it seems like a pretty simple system (aside from the xrays). The hardware (turntable + vertical actuator) is trivial and the software/algorithm used to compute slices (inverse radon transform) is available online for free. However, the x-ray element is intimidating; I&#039;m not even sure if I can get one as a pleb with no special licenses.<br><br>I should mention - this is being used for research (non-medical) purposes, so the requirements are somewhat relaxed.

Tube is designed to provide a relatively high dose of xrays briefly while the copper anode acts as a heat sink. That heat is then slowly rejected to the dielectric oil that fills the head. I don&#039;t have the datasheet for one of my tubes handy now but all of this is called out and it&#039;s fairly limiting in terms of what you can do. I had to go with a custom power supply as I wanted continuous operation at lower doses. You could find a more modern dental xray head that a switching power supply. The one I took apart had the ferrite transformer and multiplier inside the head and used a separate transformer for the filament. Control electronics were external and the head had divider resistors and a shunt for measuring tube voltage and current, respectively. Gotta make your own driver.

For detecting xrays and knowing if you have a leak somewhere, get a mica window geiger tube.

When the cartridge is at the top of the magazine, and the bolt comes forward, the cartridge rides up the face of the feedramp so it can seat into the chamber. It&#039;s a disposable part because the copper jacket on the bullet wears the plastic surface and it&#039;s cheaper to just print a new feedramp. it works, it&#039;s fine, and it lasts long enough. <br>I have been thinking about how to make the feed ramp more resilient.

That is an option, but it&#039;s not repeatable. <br>I considered using steel flashing and trying to press a really thin layer over the surface of a plastic feedramp, and maybe JB welding it in, or bending ears over the side and securing it with a pin.

When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

By the time they are in high school, most kids dislike math and science because they think they&#039;re too hard. They aren&#039;t hard, they&#039;ve just been failed in one or more topics. Failing is a normal part of learning any subject, but schools don&#039;t give kids time to go back and retry things they didn&#039;t master the first time. So kids just accept that they &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; x subject and have to leave it at that because it&#039;s time to move on. Teachers have curriculum goals that they have to meet so that when standardized testing rolls around, enough kids can give enough right answers to keep the school funded.<br><br>Subjects like language arts and history are a lot harder to fail, because there&#039;s less to get wrong, so kids end up thinking these subjects are the only things they are &quot;good&quot; at. These subjects are often tested with essays read by human proctors, which are way more forgiving than multiple choice math and science.<br><br>When it comes time to graduate high school, theres enormous pressure on kids to go to college and pick a major. They, logically, want to pick a major they are likely to succeed at, so using their limited window into education and job training, they arrive at the conclusion that they have to take humanities.<br><br>In an ideal world, kids would learn hard subjects at their own pace, and take as much time to master subjects as they need.

You may use a ram pump to fill a pool and generate from it, but for typical sizes you would only be able to run the turbine for a few minutes every few days.<br>Same for collecting rainwater into a pool unless, again, you are taking up most of the 7 acres with a reservoir.<br>If you have high flow and low head / elevation drop you would be better off looking at a vortex turbine.", "time": 1674174951, "resto": 2545381}, {"no": 2545764, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:47:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2545381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2545381</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how much energy </span><br>Energy = mass * gravity * height<br>* like .20 from all the losses you&#039;ll have from a not optimal setup and generation losses.", "time": 1674175647, "resto": 2545381}, {"no": 2545831, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)21:18:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "a lot of energy. if it generates less power, it could be a clogged wire. buy an electric wire plunger on amazon<br><br>Captcha: XAMPNG", "filename": "1673779220250293", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 411, "h": 543, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674181133848340, "time": 1674181133, "md5": "irlWmBEuGlTxUlrzgtImhg==", "fsize": 41214, "resto": 2545381}, {"no": 2545885, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2545433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2545433</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s some kinda &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot; shit</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zig<wbr>lw2mXbS8", "time": 1674188197, "resto": 2545381}, {"no": 2546315, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)16:12:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I was googling and a company in my country makes these: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buF<wbr>8ASmwXt4<br>Thoughts?", "time": 1674249134, "resto": 2545381}, {"no": 2546427, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)18:28:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2545381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2545381</a><br>there used to be a guy running similar setup rigged from old washing machine on youtube.

An angle grinder is, in my opinion, very rarely the best tool for the job. When you use them for things they *are* the best tool for the job for (removing mill scale from steel with a flap disk, for example) they are relatively safe. Cutoff wheels are genuinely dangerous and I will go to great lengths to not use one. Get yourself a die grinder for small work and a proper set of saws for larger stuff. They are much cheaper than an ER visit. <br><br>Get a corded one with a paddle switch. The cord limits its reach, which is a safety feature.

I was having a somewhat similar error and if I remember correctly the issue was that the microSD card was fried. The ESP32 module worked fine when I removed or replaced the microSD card. I doubt this is the case though since if your code uses a microSD card then it would probably halt and not send the serial data that it&#039;s sending, and if it doesn&#039;t use it then chances are you wouldn&#039;t have one inside.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe it&#039;s a permission issue with your USB.

I&#039;m going to try and make them as short as possible to avoid adding extra resistance to the circuit, but the positive end at least had to be lengthened by a few inches to reach my power tap point.", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 660, "h": 178, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 33, "tim": 1673719481194519, "time": 1673719481, "md5": "AM5am8SBC0ODA9yktmzzLQ==", "fsize": 40395, "resto": 2536753}, {"no": 2543909, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)05:55:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2536753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2536753</a><br>Any updates?", "time": 1673952906, "resto": 2536753}, {"no": 2544454, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2543909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2543909</a><br>Some disappointing updates which is why I didn&#039;t post them. I figured nobody else cared and I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll be able to finish the project before the thread loses momentum. I brought the wheel out to test in the car and when attaching it up to my intended power source the car triggers the horn. I have an electrical diagnostic manual for my car so I referenced the horn circuit and it turns out it powers the horn when the circuit is closed (kind of obvious in hindsight). The doubly disappointing news is my other constant 12v power, which runs to the cruise control buttons, also triggers the horn when grounded because it shares the same inputs. I asked an electrical engineering friend if there was any way around it with the current layout and the only thing he could come up with was borrowing a signal wire from the cruise control circuit and redirecting it through a raspberry pi. From there I considered tearing down my clockspring and replacing the ribbon inside with one that contains more wires. I was wondering about amperage as well, so I googled how much amperage a clockspring could handle and happened upon this thread from someone asking the same question for the same application as mine: http://www.saturnfans.com/forums/sh<wbr>owthread.php?t=267981<br><br>In any case, my plan now is to salvage the clockspring from a newer car with more leads as well as from another identical Honda as mine and frankenstein the two together.

To do so, first make sure that you use lead solder, not that lead-free crap since it requires higher temperature. Second, make sure to prepare the surface. it looks like this contact is corroded. So sandpaper it, then wash it as best as you can to make sure it takes solder easily and reduces the time it needs to be heated up. Second, try to solder as far away from the plastic as possible. If you can, try to solder on the top edges, since it will increase the time for the heat to transfer to the plastic.

I bought an old laptop from the early 90s and it takes seven C-type 1.2V battery cells connected in series to get 8.4V voltage total. The cell technology is specified as NiCd, but I don&#039;t think those are sold any more. The laptop also takes a 4-pin power supply with two different voltages: 12V and 9.5V. I have no idea which voltage goes on which pin and how many pluses and minuses there are (there is a chance I could find this out by disassembling the laptop, but I&#039;m not very good with electronics so idk), and sourcing an original power supply for this model is pretty much impossible nowadays. Nevertheless, if I somehow happened to come into possession of a working charger, I would like to be able to charge the batteries inside the laptop and not have to use an external charger. My first thought was lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, but those don&#039;t seem to be sold in this form factor and voltage specification. The only stuff that matches the specification is nickel-metal hydrate batteries. I can get type Cs with 1.2V and they are rechargeable. The only problem is that I&#039;ve read that NiMH batteries can only be used in place of NiCd batteries if they will not be charged inside the device. Different charging characteristics will make NiMh cells quickly deteriorate. At least that&#039;s what I&#039;ve read, so I came here looking for confirmation and asking for better ideas if anyone has any. Going with NiMh would necessitate using an external charger, but chances of finding or making a working power supply for this thing are very slim as it is, so it&#039;s not a deal-breaker.", "filename": "91c0f7d2439bab16fd0997941417", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1032, "h": 774, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673968776786724, "time": 1673968776, "md5": "3ABSuyd4yE7G/C2eGk8vlA==", "fsize": 134417, "resto": 2539950}, {"no": 2544020, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)10:33:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2543917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2543917</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Annoyingly I have no idea how to characterize the resonant circuit, so I&#039;m just copying what other people have built.

The mains power supply is on a different shelf above and next to the fridge, so that water can&#039;t get anywhere near it, that&#039;s why I used a 3 meter long cable which feeds into the fridge.<br><br>Worst case the fridge gets flooded and with it the kitchen, but even so, relatively slowly because the filter (on top of the fridge, might mount on wall) and the 1/4 inch water pipe both already limit the water flow considerably. For the water connection I used the same 1/4 inch pipes and plug fittings that are used for those samsung fridges and we&#039;ve been using those for at least 8 years and they&#039;re extremely reliable, never had any issues with this style of fittings. The small pump is hanging from the ceiling inside the fridge to reduce noise and also prevent water getting to it from the outside in case of a leak.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are you using gas from a welding cylinder, or something like a sodastream cylinder?</span><br>I use a 2kg CO2 flask, sodastream is overpriced.
