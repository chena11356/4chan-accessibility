The substance would be radiating light over top of the printed surfaces. This is a much different effect than shining a light on a reflective surface.

You will pay accordingly for the quality, but these do last several years.<br>But, ultimately the most DIY feasible solution is just to apply phosphorescent paint that reacts to UV light, and then use a UV light to illuminate it.

You may want to check the noise specs to ensure your signal is staying significantly above the noise floor for a given input amplitude.

Best to use an iron transformer-based power supply with linear regulators and sufficiently large caps. If you absolutely have to use a switching power supply (can be very noisy with audio circuits) then ensure you tie the ground rail to protective earth, and try to use LC filters or capacitive multipliers or zener-pass regulators on the power rails to block that noise.

The power is definitely lacking, but even then if it had decent focus it would still be usable for what I want (burning away thin etch-resistant coatings). But my laser does not have decent focus, getting the beam small enough to really ablate coatings is a tricky task, but charring wood is definitely doable. I may have to 3D print a lens-holder with more degrees of freedom, or just go for a fibre-coupled laser or Nd:YAG. A more expensive laser like that 1.6W may well be higher quality.<br><br>10W is a fair bit for engraving, and it will easily burn away thin coatings like aluminium anodising, paint, PCB solder mask, etc.<br><br>Watch out though, the third party software availability for turning a 3D printer into a laser is kinda shit. Lightburn is almost certainly the way to go, but it&#039;s not FOSS. Creality have their own (windows only) software.

Recently I bought a light tower trailer with a Kubota D905 and 6kW gen head and have been cleaning it up. The idea is to ditch the 6kW head and upgrade, while installing the Kubota D1105T in place. Had a few questions for anyone who knows these engines pretty well, or had this type of idea. Both of the engines above come from different applications. The Kubota D905 engine has a mfg sticker mentioning &#039;constant speed only&#039;. I&#039;ve disassembled the engine far enough to compare the governor assemblies and I&#039;m stuck scratching my head. Both engines seem to have the exact same assemblies from what I can tell. Seemingly the only factors keeping the smaller engine at a &quot;constant speed&quot; are the throttle control screws on the outside of the engine. If my plan is to put the D1105T (variable speed) in the trailer, and maybe down the line throw the D905 (constant speed) in a utv build, am I going to have to change any internal governor components in either engine?", "filename": "BTP64MH", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1704, "h": 2272, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670812457471806, "time": 1670812457, "md5": "Ff12si4qLEpzT4nLK5o8vg==", "fsize": 164322, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "retrofitting-a-light-tower-trailer-generator", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 2520101, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)22:09:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Load will determine the final rpm.

But it&#039;s realistically a tear-down. You&#039;re basically rebuilding the house at this point, I guarantee that it needs all new plumbing, wiring, septic, etc. So you&#039;re replacing everything. How much is too much, for your budget? When/if do you plan to live in it? What&#039;s the neighborhood like, for potential rental income? <br>I mean, with some study and going slowly, you might get some of it done. You want professionals dealing with the roof, and electrical/plumbing. <br>This has every red flag for being a complete money pit. To what end? What is your final plan for the house? What is your realistic potential here? <br>If you plan to live in it, that&#039;s one thing. But if you want to fix it up to flip it, you could put a bunch of money into it, but won&#039;t be able to sell it for what it&#039;s now worth, if prices are lower in that area. <br>Your time, your money. Could be a big toilet you flush a big chunk of your paycheck into every month, for little or no return. <br><br>Like another anon said, get an inspector in there. Go over every inch of the house. Then get estimates from electricians, plumbers, and hvac for what they consider to be legal/recommended upgrades, while you get the shell of the house repaired. Maybe call around local contractors and see if they&#039;d be willing to consult and just sit down and write you out a general plan, and throw them some of the work, like the roof. <br>Get the foundation checked first, like other anons have said.
