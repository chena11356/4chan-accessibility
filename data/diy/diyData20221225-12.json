Steam engines become very complicated when trying to make them competitive. Most people aren&#039;t going to mess with steam boilers (regardless of whether the design is safe), while steam generators require precise controls.

Economies of scale make it impractical to manufacture your own wood pellets and if your concern is off grid living you should stick with regular wood as a heat source.<br><br>I get that not everything has to be a strictly economic transaction and that the whole point of hobbies is doing inefficient unpaid labor because you like doing it, but /diy/ pellets are not it.

I think the most efficient way to to this would be to somehow automate or at least greatly simplify the process of loading entire logs into the combustion chamber.<br><br>As for wood pellets, a lot of the reason for their efficiency advantages don&#039;t apply in a gasifier. They&#039;re more efficient than a regular wood stove because they burn using a forced convection system, and as a result of the forced convection and their high density they burn at a much higher temperature than regular wood. Forced convection isn&#039;t possible in a gasifier and the heat of the reaction doesn&#039;t matter much when the process you&#039;re using relies on further chemical reactions downstream of the gasifier.<br><br>I also question if charcoal in a gasifier is a good idea. The process of making charcoal is essentially the same thing as what&#039;s happening in a gasifier, except by separating those processes you&#039;d be losing out on the stream of volatile exhaust gases that come out of the charcoal and relying solely on the carbon monoxide to fuel your car.

PLA+ typically improves some of the drawbacks while sacrificing some of the strengths, resulting in something that doesn&#039;t quite fit the niches where regular PLA shines but which often compares poorly to other filaments like PETG and ASA.

It is not a microcontroller. It does have some I/O pins, but the OS mostly gets in the way of using them. And you have to deal with it like a full computer, keeping the OS running, etc.<br>A microcontroller has nothing but maybe a bootloader. Any OS is built into your project. And there is usually nothing like a file system or network ports.<br><br>It&#039;s also that much more to throw out when (not if) something gets zapped. I was making a chip reader with a blue pill, and accidentally touched a +12 wire to an I/O pin, and now the thing runs hot because of the blown pin. I knew what I was doing, and was being careful, and still zapped it. I&#039;m kind of surprised that&#039;s the only time, there were other times I thought I had, and was wrong. But I started with a bag of twenty for $40 including shipping, seven-ish years ago, and most are still in the bag. And even then, it&#039;s only the main chip. I have some lower-spec ST chips that should drop right in.<br>The main thing you want when playing around with microcontrollers is to have identical spares around. You still want to be careful whenever you hook it up to something, but when it happens you need to be able to pull out another one and get back to work. If you had to change chip type, you would have to fuck with your build configuration. Also it lets you keep more than one project in progress at the same time. Blue pill is about as chink as you can get and still be able to get more.<br><br>The thing about micro:bit is that it already has a few useful things on the board (like the LED matrix), so you can do stuff without hooking it up anything, and it has the &quot;better&quot; I/O pins brought out to big holes you can clip to.

So that&#039;s 9 multiplications (2 cycles each) and 6 additions (1 cycle each) per transform, not sure to what extent I need load instructions or if I can directly act on my registers. I also need to use a sine lookup table, probably also a cosine lookup table, which I&#039;m guessing takes a clock cycle or two to fetch a value from. So minimum 30 cycles per double transform, probably more like 33-42. The PI controller is not something I&#039;m sure how to implement live in an MCU, though I think it&#039;s just a Z-transform-based thing that has Out(n+1) be a function only of In(n), In(n+1), and Out(n). So I&#039;m guessing maybe 12-20 cycles each. Then another pair of additions, then the inverse matrix, then the inverter. For the inverter I&#039;ll just be feeding the values into three CMP registers of a timer&#039;s PWM.

I was thinking about using a current transformer to measure load current and line voltage (line voltage measured with a resistor in series with current transformer) and an ADC connected to a microcontroller. The issue I came across is that the line voltage is mostly a sinusoidal wave, while the load current can be really fucked up. How would I go to measure the power when the current has all sorts of frequencies, including some high frequency in the case of some loads such as switch mode power supplies. In other words, how would I design a reliable current sensor that can handle such loads and measure the real power used by the load?

Probably using DSP, since analogue multiplication is hard. Also consider a transformer or isolated ADC+divider for mains voltage, to prevent the majority of your digital circuitry from being mains referenced. A differential amplifier measuring live-neutral and referencing it to ground also works. Naturally you&#039;ll need anti-aliasing filters to obey the nyquist sampling theorem on both ADC inputs. Figuring out the power factor and reactive and apparent powers would just be a software problem.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As for the sensor itself, hall or shunt would be my desire, as current draws aren&#039;t necessarily symmetrical around 0V (see half-wave rectifiers</span><br><br>Can you go in more detail about the following?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;ll need anti-aliasing filters to obey the nyquist sampling theorem on both ADC inputs</span><br>If I am only interested in power (and not recreating the signal), is the nyquist rate important at all?

Worst case you&#039;ve got an SMPS putting out high frequency current noise so you just get a bunch of aliases wildly throwing off the power factor calculations. At least dampening them with a low pass filter doesn&#039;t give false frequency spikes. Arguably you might be fine with a pretty low frequency for your ADC, since parallel caps and series chokes are everywhere, though it depends on the purpose of your power measurement.

Ultimately you want the attenuation at and above your Nyquist frequency to be such that any signal there gets stamped into nothingness. If you want 8-bits of resolution then the attenuation will be a lot less than if you want a full 24 bits of resolution. If you increase the Nyquist frequency significantly past your desired bandwidth, then you&#039;ll have more room for attenuation. Say if your desired bandwidth is 4kHz, and you want 60dB of attenuation, then a 5kHz nyquist frequency means 60dB/0.1dec = 600dB/decade (30 pole filter lmao). If you set the nyquist frequency to 100kHz then that means 60dB/1.4dec = 43dB/decade (2 pole filter). N bits of effective resolution means 20*log(2^N)dB of SNR (8bit = 48dB), but there&#039;s nothing stopping you from choosing a desired effective resolution lower than your ADC&#039;s resolution, which reduces the required filter attenuation.<br><br>t. retard who&#039;s never built an anti-aliasing filter before<br><br><a href=\"#p2526957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526957</a><br><a href=\"#p2526962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526962</a><br>gratz", "time": 1671699428, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526964, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)03:57:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526957</a><br>oh you changed it, yes that&#039;s what I found as well.", "time": 1671699447, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526965, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)03:59:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526963</a><br><a href=\"#p2526964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526964</a><br>yeah sorry I meant R2/R1, have it on paper and copied to mspaint incorrectly<br>thanks for checking", "time": 1671699546, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2526966, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)04:01:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2526954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2526954</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do I need some sort of active filter</span><br>Usually a good idea if you&#039;re after more than 1 pole (20dB/decade) of attenuation.

That said, some low-power controllers are definitely able to run at such low voltages, and there&#039;s also the option of using a 3V lithium coin cell instead. I imagine it&#039;s just a cost thing.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the blob</span><br>Silicon chip stuck to the board with thin bond-wires from it to the surrounding traces, and a blob of thermoset resin over it to protect the silicon and bond-wires. It&#039;s a cheaper method than soldering a plastic-encapsulated chip for very large quantities.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is 5 exactly</span><br>Looks like a piezo disc. To play sound you need to send them an AC waveform to them. Electrically they behave like a capacitor, the disc is deformed by applying a voltage across it. In the case of this circuit, one side is pulled to 3V and the other to 0V, then the other way around, to get a square wave with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 6V.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how does it know what notes to play in the little tune</span><br>The controller under blob 2 would have internal read-only-memory containing the notes in some simple format. Chances are there&#039;s an oscillator in the chip for timing the notes and for basing the frequencies off. Read a microcontroller datasheet (e.g. ATmega328P) to see how you can set one of its timers to play a tone if you&#039;re interested. Considering the cost, it may not be a microcontroller chip under the blob but an entirely purpose-built chip, but regardless I imagine all programming in there is read-only as it&#039;s cheaper that way.<br><br>cont.", "time": 1671926859, "resto": 2526866}, {"no": 2528634, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2528606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2528606</a><br><a href=\"#p2528623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2528623</a><br>cont.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is it also possible to remove the buzzer that is there right now and place my own buzzer that plays whatever note sequence I tell it to</span><br>For the above reasons, you&#039;d keep the piezo disc and remove the blob to replace with your own microcontroller. The Arduino IDE has a function called &quot;tone()&quot; that uses the aforementioned timer hardware to play a note. Though due to RAM limitations, for more than a short series of notes I&#039;d use program memory to store it instead. In addition, I&#039;m not too sure how you&#039;d get two pins operating as a synchronous push-pull waveform output, you&#039;d likely have to write your own replacement for the tone function in order to use two timer pins with the same comparator value but with one inverted.<br>Pic related is my own shitty code from 2 years ago for an rgbduino (the one with the anime girl on it) to play megalovania when you plug it in. I used python to generate the array of note values from a midi file.<br>FYI, I&#039;d refrain from using unmodified Arduino hardware as the built-in LEDs make low-power operation pretty tough; you&#039;d eat through the batteries kinda quickly. I&#039;d also flash the fuses to make it run a lot slower.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where would I need to place the pins to know what&#039;s going on in the circuit</span><br>So putting the VDC probes across the power input of the blob/LED should be 0V when the button isn&#039;t pressed, and ~3V when it is pressed. Then putting the VAC probes across the piezo disc itself should show a some Hz and some approximately average voltage when a note is playing, depending on whether your meter can measure 200-2kHz square waves.

On the downside, the passable results still required manual re-gluing with an iron about 70% of the time, maybe down to 50% after I got the hang of the required speed and consistency of feeding. Still, it was a massive pain in the ass to do some 40 meters of edging this way. I also didn&#039;t have a very good setup for trimming edges with a router, did a lot of it manually with a chisel.

It was also completely impossible to use it for banding thicker than 1mm, even 1mm was difficult. 0.5-0.7mm was alright.<br>This is what I then bought https://www.aliexpress.com/item/400<wbr>0569137844.html and first tests went well. It&#039;s pretty fast, the bond it leaves is really strong as it applies glue on both the ABS strip and the wood, and thanks to all the big rollers you can squeeze the edge on hard, even 2mm strips stuck just fine. Will see how it holds up next time I actually have a larger amount of edges to glue. Also I will definitely build a swiveling router mount for cutting the banding, I&#039;ve had it with chisels. <br>The steel frame was an extra layer of complication, if I had to build the same thing again, I&#039;d either go with thinner material or just use chipboard for the whole structure.

Find yourself an old back saw from before the thin plate came into vogue, file it rip, put in some set and then stone out almost all of the set and you will get wonderfully smooth miters in hardwoods. Stoning out the set instead of putting in very little set will give just enough fleam (functionally the same as fleam but not really fleam) on the outside of the tooth to give a smooth cut in even many softwoods. The old saws were not thicker because they could not make thin plates, they were thicker because it made it easier to get a smooth cut, the old guys knew what they were doing, sure it cut a tiny bit slower but it meant little to no fine tuning after the cut.

You can hear this flexing in many saws, if the blade rings during the cut it is because the blade is flexing fast enough to be vibrating and sound a note, especially noticeable when a saw is getting dull.

They are customized to support your pole barn. The centers come in 2, 4, or 8 ft, depending on the ceiling load. Trusses come in many shapes, but mainly these two:<br><br>Standard \u2013 has a flat bottom which allows for a flat ceiling<br><br>Scissor- crossed beams provide a vaulted ceiling. This gives you more head room or space for a loft if extra height is needed.<br>Overhang<br><br>This is how much roof is hanging past the walls on the ends and sides of the building. Overhang will typically be 12 to 24 inches.<br>Purlins<br><br>Purlins are the pieces of lumber on the roof that provide structure and where the metal panels are attached.<br>Girts<br><br>The girts are similar to the purlins in that they are 2x4s placed 24 inches on center, but on the walls instead of the roof. Girts also provide wall support.<br>Girder<br><br>The top support pieces are known as girders. Beam sizes will typically be 2\u00d710 or 2\u00d712.<br>Bottom Wall Girt- Skirt Board- Splash Board-Grade Board<br><br>There are several different names for the piece that sits on ground level.

It doesn&#039;t sound all that great, even ignoring my poor playing, but it&#039;s not difficult to get a solid note out of. There are things that could be slightly better on that front, but nothing that should really affect price.

For example, you might, say, use the wrong vessel for performing the experiment, and have the reactant react with the vessel too. Or you might not be able to keep the reaction at the required temperature (maybe it&#039;s exothermic, and you poured too much, which sped up the reaction significantly, or some random contaminant acts as a catalyst, etc), and thus have it turn into something else while it&#039;s outside of the correct temperature range.

By the time they are in high school, most kids dislike math and science because they think they&#039;re too hard. They aren&#039;t hard, they&#039;ve just been failed in one or more topics. Failing is a normal part of learning any subject, but schools don&#039;t give kids time to go back and retry things they didn&#039;t master the first time. So kids just accept that they &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; x subject and have to leave it at that because it&#039;s time to move on. Teachers have curriculum goals that they have to meet so that when standardized testing rolls around, enough kids can give enough right answers to keep the school funded.<br><br>Subjects like language arts and history are a lot harder to fail, because there&#039;s less to get wrong, so kids end up thinking these subjects are the only things they are &quot;good&quot; at.

You shouldn&#039;t be seeing blue with just the fuel on, you also don&#039;t have to make a huge acetylene flame before lighting the oxy, I&#039;d say once the flame has volume and is putting out thick black smoke then you&#039;re good for the oxy. When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

Lots of them now have hollow handles for storage, but that really weakens it as the handle bends and sometimes even breaks in my hand when I grip too hard, the old metal ones never did that. Reason I still like them is I have had projects where I drive in hundreds and hundreds of screws by hand. I had bits wear out which lead to other problems. By switch to fresh bits as I go I didn&#039;t have to keep buying screw drivers which cost more then a box of bits. It also lets me change to other types as the job had 8 screw types, so finding a comfy handle each item was annoying.

Do the math; you can get a pound of decent tobacco for like 15$ and tubes to go with it for another 5$ and make about 20 packs of cigarettes.<br>It&#039;ll probably average you around a dollar per pack or less.<br><br>One problem with doing this though is that the cigarettes won&#039;t be exactly like your favorite store brand. They won&#039;t taste exactly the same because cigarette manufacturers use a proprietary blend of flavors and treatments that is responsible for the distinct taste of their cigs. You can still find plenty of good quality, cheap tobacco (menthol, light, regular, extra bold, etc) but it will never be an exact match for your favorite brand.<br>Another thing is that these homemade ones will always burn just slightly differently than the industrial ones. Industrially made cigarettes are (AFAIK) made from a specially prepared reconstituted tobacco paper rather than shredded leaves. They do this to make things easier for their treatment steps, but also to make the mix have a 100% consistent texture and consistency that helps avoid problems with their processing and packing machinery. When you buy the cheap bags of raw tobacco, it&#039;s just leaves that have been cut/shredded to a consistency which is appropriate for rolling or tube packing cigs. So sometimes you may have a tiny inconsistency or packing error and wind up with a small void or an end of the tube that doesn&#039;t pack completely.<br><br>After you get familiar with the perfect amount of leaf to load in the machines chamber by doing a couple dozen cigs, you&#039;ll start to avoid this issue for the most part.<br><br>All in all, it&#039;s super cheap and easy to do and I&#039;m always amazed that more smokers don&#039;t RYO", "time": 1671219875, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523186, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Use your fingers roll em up<br>Look like a doobie man farout and groovy", "time": 1671220088, "resto": 2523144}, {"no": 2523192, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:01:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2523144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2523144</a><br>It can save you money, but it won&#039;t, it&#039;ll just give you the option to pop out $10-$20 cartons at will.<br><br>Fuck tubes, they&#039;re gross, and filling them yourself is a waste of time.<br>If you&#039;re going to roll your own, roll them.

Make damn sure that every single customer you work with posts something about you on either facebook or next-door and puts your phone number out there.

Anyone else have a wife that makes a lot more money than them? What is life like? Anons it is getting to be an insane disparity for me. I work in engineering in the Midwest USA meaning basically that at a country level I make shit pay. I make like $70k which is middling and I don&#039;t want to go into management. I met my wife like 5 years ago pre-covid. She is a programmer and once WFH happened she could work &#039;anywhere&#039; and her earning potential exploded. She now works for a tech company on the west coast and makes triple my salary. She has been promoted once already and she has been told she might become management and we still won&#039;t even have to move so it&#039;s probably going to be quadruple my salary soon. Anyone else in a marriage like this? I feel like I&#039;m dead weight holding us as a couple back. I&#039;m not even sure why I work any more. My engineering degree has been a huge bust. I&#039;m just wondering at what point is she going to realize I&#039;m a loser with no prospects and dragging her down instead of being with someone who makes comparable pay? As a couple she could easily be almost a millionaire with someone in a similar position to her. Also she&#039;s not bad with money per se but she is falling hard for lifestyle creep. She makes exponentially more money than either me or her former self and we don&#039;t even own a home or property. I try to save my meager wage and she keeps buying more things instead of saving her increases in pay. I don&#039;t know how to tell her to save money for a house without sounding like a bossy leech.

Bandwidth is well the width of the frequency band. Bandwidth also dictates how much data you can theoretically feed though a connection. Antennas rely on complex impedance. Since they aren&#039;t a straight forward conductor, rather a strange hybrid between resistor, capacitor and inductor. Well this amalgam of all three can be fed a certain amount of power at a given frequency, and depending on the complex impedance measurements the antenna will either radiate most, some or none of that energy in to the either. There&#039;s is a lot to antenna theory but this is a very plastic explanation.<br><br>Building a transmitter you&#039;ll need to get a handle on modulation and demodulation.

So rip the cane completely out of one and see if it has holes or a groove. Order the supplies and have at it, expect a chair or two to be failures before you get the technique down. If you are weaving then I would get a book, having those nice color photos well arranged with descriptions of the process well arranged and laid out for you to reference while you work will be very helpful. Most libraries should have a caning book or a chair making/repair book or a canoe making book (canoes often have woven cane seats so your butt can dry out). Videos will suck for this since you will find you need to jump back and fourth a lot.

A mass of iron needed for a wood stove was out of the reach of anyone except the very rich before the industrial revolution, and the metal piping needed to take the exhaust outside. The modern fireplace was invented in the medieval era using cheap, affordable materials like stone and brick, could be integrated easily into a building, and removal of the exhaust was implicit and effecient. You could also build larger fires in a hearth, wood stoves are limited in size, because of the complexity and cost of casting large amounts of iron. <br>A wood stove has two uses: radiant heat, and cooking. A fireplace has more uses, like providing a source of light for a room/hall. People were also using masonry to build ovens in northern Europe for heat/cooking. <br><br>So why did they keep building them, autist? Because they had more use and were more efficient, and being able to scale the fireplace to the space, unlike an expensive, hard scale cast iron piece.

I started out in residential, because of my father getting me a job and doing side work since I was 12 or so, and trying to learn the code with out ever seeing a transformer, main distribution panel, running conduit and shit like that, it was hard to understand what all the codes were even talking about. Got my journeyman, quit residential and went commercial. Then 2008 happened and commercial shut down in my area. Had to go back to residential and work for a dipshit, who I think sucked a LOT of dicks to get where he was at. That pissed me off enough to get my contractors and start my own company. I do high end remodel now. Have to use my brain troubleshooting and planning and I enjoy that.

When I had to change alb valve, brake disks, pads etc. on my car, i bought the parts and took the car to a small repair shop near me.

The substance would be radiating light over top of the printed surfaces. This is a much different effect than shining a light on a reflective surface. It would be more akin to the glare of light on a monitor, where-in the monitor is trying to emit light, but the surface of the screen is reflecting light in front of the monitor&#039;s light. It would wash out the printed letters on the keyboard and make them unreadable.<br>Perhaps that is okay, if you are a touch-typist and not trying to read the keyboard. But if that were the case, why would you be asking for a lighting solution? The keyboard appears to already have the usual tactile markers for hand placement.<br>But I think you&#039;d get a much better effect by just detail painting in the accents you need lighted, like the printed letters on each key.<br><br>Furthermore, luminescent materials are not &quot;free energy.&quot; They do require something to power them.<br>Some do retain the charge imparted by exposure to UV light and release it gradually after being removed, but the effect of relying on the very limited energy capacity of the coating will likely be underwhelming.<br>There are radio-luminescent materials like tritium paint. You will pay accordingly for the quality, but these do last several years.<br>But, ultimately the most DIY feasible solution is just to apply phosphorescent paint that reacts to UV light, and then use a UV light to illuminate it.

So here&#039;s my question to you. First define &quot;mid career&quot; in term of years. Second, does 130k-150k matter irregardless of living cost in the area? Your 130k-150k sounds useless af if you live in a high cost area like So. CA. <br><br>One last advice, try to aim for the power systems or utility industry. A lot of those old fucks are retiring anyway and needs replacement (That&#039;s why I&#039;m in my company)", "time": 1671386632, "resto": 2523464}, {"no": 2524641, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)17:05:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thank you to everyone who replied.

Lead batteries are better for emergencies, as a backup power source. Lithium batteries (there are many kinds) can be placed in parallel in order to form a power bank, but they are much more expensive and fragile. You would need to either constantly monitor the voltage and current of the batteries in order to avoid overcharging, drawing too much current, etc. There are systems you can buy for this, but they are expensive. Solar creates DC, but you would need a device to regulate the amount of charge it delivers to the battery to avoid overcharging. The wind turbine and Sterling engine create AC, which has to be converted to DC with a rectifier in order to charge the batteries (again, device needed to protect battery from overcharging). When you&#039;re ready to use your stored power, you need a power inverter to convert DC to AC so you may use it in your home. As for the bicycle, many people have used alternators to generate electricity, but once again, it creates an irregular AC signal which has to be converted to DC and then fed into a voltage regulator that can stabilize the output voltage and charge the batteries.", "time": 1670908789, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520819, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:21:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why would I want to live off the grid unless I were a schizo who thinks the government is out to get me", "time": 1670908896, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520822, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:24:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cooling</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3b<wbr>JnKmeNJY", "time": 1670909040, "resto": 2519243}, {"no": 2520838, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)00:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2520817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2520817</a><br>Let me correct myself: alternators create DC, not AC, so you can skip the rectifier, but you would still need a voltage regulator or some sort of charge controller that can reliably stabilize the output of the alternator and protect the batteries.

On a (clean) textured PEI sheet it&#039;s not an issue for most prints, but large parts with warp/detachment-prone geometry may peel without measures like a brim.

I have a rough idea of the most sensible sequence in which things need to be done. A new water heater is on the list, but it&#039;s waiting on an electrical overhaul, which in turn is waiting on other things. Unfortunately, the regulator on my water heater seems to have begun to leak gas into my kitchen, and I don&#039;t think I want to spend $200 (the price of a new regulator) to repair a unit I plan on throwing away as soon as possible. I&#039;m therefore faced with installing a water heater before my electrical system is ready for it.<br><br>I want to replace my 40 gallon gas water heater with a tankless electric one. I want it to be electric precisely so that it can&#039;t malfunction and leak explosive gas into my kitchen, and tankless because there&#039;s not a good location for a water heater in my house, which was built without closets. It&#039;s currently in the corner of the kitchen, where it&#039;s a major eyesore. Another reason to go with an electric heater is that I&#039;d like to perform as much of the installation as possible myself and to be able to service it myself moving forward, and I am much more comfortable working with electricity than with gas.<br><br>A 27 kW water heater calls for 3 x 40 A breakers and pulls up to 112.5 A. A have a 200 A main panel with room for those breakers. Unfortunately, the typical load on that panel is pretty high thanks to my reliance on resistive heating (electric radiators - no ductwork yet) and to the fact that it supplies not only a large-ish house but also a large-ish workshop. I&#039;m probably using 80 - 100 amps for heat, and I can see myself using 25 A for other stuff if I&#039;m working in the shop. If, say, two other people are using hot water at the same time, I can see that 200 amp capacity being exceeded.<br><br>The worst that can happen is that I flip my main breaker, right?
