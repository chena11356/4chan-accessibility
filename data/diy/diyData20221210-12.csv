It has torsion bar suspension and the torsion bar is shot out. Obviously I am trying to make as big of profit as possible so I would like to use only materials I already have. Recently I acquired a bunch of iron, &gt;&gt;/2517030 thread related, on another deal. As you can see, there is a perfect piece square tubing to make a leaf spring axle with. That did not come in deal, there are 2 3&#039; pieces on the rack 3x1/8&quot; on the rack that did come with the deal. So my question is, what, if there is one, would be the strongest and safest way to splice them together? I was thinking of sleeving in a piece of square stock or tube, I have either. OR cutting the joining ends at 45° and fish plating it. If both are equally as strong, which would be less time consuming and or easier? There is also a 3rd option of converting it from torsion bar to coil springs, but that&#039;s a whole other kettle of rotten fish. <br><span class=""quote"">&gt;picrel, the project.</span>', 'filename': 'Screenshot_20221209-183739', 'ext': '.png', 'w': 720, 'h': 1600, 'tn_w': 56, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670646397647282, 'time': 1670646397, 'md5': '1tVMKl6/uBHBEBdbRCJ/Iw==', 'fsize': 1162304, 'resto': 2514868}, {'no': 2518680, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)23:32:27', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p2518676"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;2518676</a><br>Here is my last project trailer, wish I still had the pictures of when I bought it.

44,2516237,,,12/05/22(Mon)21:24:16,Anonymous,Muddy river filtration,"I&#039;ve been having problems with muddy water in my ponds, when it rains it gets even worse. I get the water from a small river through gravity, the pipe is just submersed in it so there isn&#039;t any kind of filtration whatsoever. I am wondering if placing a layer of rock, clay pebbles or anything that would let the water through while keeping solids out would be a solution to this.<br><br>I know of the chemical treatments I could use to settle these solids but I don&#039;t want to use them, I&#039;ve also been to fisheries that use huge sedimentation tanks to solve this. The setup I am thinking about doing is a dam with 3 walls which one would be porous and would filter the water that the pipe would then discharge in my ponds, the overflow would let branches and other debris continue down the river. Would the water still be muddy after this? I also know this works for people that make a series of filtration layers (rock, sand, charcoal, etc) for drinking water but the flow I need is considerable, so I can&#039;t have a trickle.<br><br>If it did work I would imagine I would need to clean it periodically but that wouldn&#039;t be a problem.",collection of water from muddy river,.png,1078,578,250,134,1670293456705813,1670293456,0p8rdS099JDF986UGO1hnw==,39126,0,,muddy-river-filtration,4,0,"[{'no': 2516270, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)22:03:34', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Is this for drinking, or something like irrigation/fish ponds?<br>Sediments are picked up as the water moves quickly, and settle when the water slows down.

The reviews are good, the core/insulation measurements match or even outmatch the specs but you&#039;ll always get some retards in the reviews saying that this is not real tinned copper and that it&#039;s aluminium, silver, brass or whatever. But what if those retards are actually the smart ones and all the others got fooled?<br><br>Here is what I&#039;ve done so far:<br>-Burned the shit out of some strands. Nothing gets brittle. Only thing that melts is the end of some of the strands, once they&#039;re cooled down they form a small ball at the end of the strand. Overall after many burns the conductor hasn&#039;t lost its thickness whatsoever.<br>-The burning definitely reveals some orange colors on the strands. You also get some yellowish and even greenish/blueish tints sometimes. Will post some shitty pics bellow.<br>-Scrapping strands with a knife doesn&#039;t reveal shit because they&#039;re just too small.<br>-Checked with my multimeter and I get 000.1Ω from one 5m wire but from what I understand this doesn&#039;t necessarily mean anything. Ideally you need a &quot;4-wire measurement&quot; thingy and I don&#039;t have one.<br>-Not the main subject but it&#039;s definitely silicone insulation, smells like shit out of the box and hasn&#039;t melted one bit from all my burning tests.<br><br>Overall it seems legit but I&#039;m just asking you smarter autists just to be sure.

150,2514194,,,12/02/22(Fri)19:11:05,Anonymous,12v DC generator with 12 solar controller?,So i&#039;m working on a micro hydro/wind project and i have 12v DC permanent magnet motors. I know most hydro/wind generators need a specific charge controller because they need a dump load and are 2 or 3 phase AC. <br><br>However if i use 12v permanent magnet motors as the imput for a small 12v solar charge controller will it work? It is a permanent magnet motor so it shouldn&#039;t fly apart with no resistance and 12v DC is 12V DC so the controller should handle it just fine as long as the total wattage doesn&#039;t exceed capacity right?,1616468447005,.jpg,225,225,225,225,1670026265223301,1670026265,S5cB3a4V7n2+RS6aoCj0Sg==,10078,0,,12v-dc-generator-with-12-solar-controller,3,1,"[{'no': 2515621, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)21:43:35', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'bumpu', 'time': 1670208215, 'resto': 2514194}, {'no': 2515805, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)07:07:44', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p2514194"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;2514194</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;12v DC is 12V DC</span><br><br>yes if it&#039;s a brushed motor and you drive it at a precise speed.', 'filename': 'Screenshot_2022-12-05_07-06-37', 'ext': '.png', 'w': 533, 'h': 515, 'tn_w': 125, 'tn_h': 120, 'tim': 1670242064072041, 'time': 1670242064, 'md5': 'NqdlrbW0/SnUVLdTk+sQTQ==', 'fsize': 19226, 'resto': 2514194}, {'no': 2516060, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)16:25:54', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p2515805"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;2515805</a><br>Feeding it through a charge controller that is designed to take variable imput and convert it to a steady charging voltage is the whole point anon.', 'time': 1670275554, 'resto': 2514194}]",1670275554,0.0,0.0,,
