In my experience touchscreens are always worse than just the basic blue LCD with the little wheel, because the touch sensor sucks and the firmware is really limited compared to the Marlin you can run on the older style printers. For example on my Ender 3 with ABL I can start a print from my computer and then tune the z offset up or down while it lays out the skirt before starting the first layer, to make sure I get perfect adhesion. On my Ender 5, I have to start a print, cancel, adjust the z offset in increments of 0.1 (which is asinine because for perfect adhesion and quality without elephant&#039;s foot you want to be within 0.02 of the correct height), and if I need to tune it more I have to start and stop the print again. Based on the picture it doesn&#039;t even look like they&#039;ve added a second print cooling fan, it&#039;s still just blowing from one direction, it just has an ugly plastic cover over the print head instead of the plain black metal one on the old Ender.

Recently I bought a light tower trailer with a Kubota D905 and 6kW gen head and have been cleaning it up. The idea is to ditch the 6kW head and upgrade, while installing the Kubota D1105T in place. Had a few questions for anyone who knows these engines pretty well, or had this type of idea. Both of the engines above come from different applications. The Kubota D905 engine has a mfg sticker mentioning &#039;constant speed only&#039;. I&#039;ve disassembled the engine far enough to compare the governor assemblies and I&#039;m stuck scratching my head. Both engines seem to have the exact same assemblies from what I can tell. Seemingly the only factors keeping the smaller engine at a &quot;constant speed&quot; are the throttle control screws on the outside of the engine. If my plan is to put the D1105T (variable speed) in the trailer, and maybe down the line throw the D905 (constant speed) in a utv build, am I going to have to change any internal governor components in either engine?", "filename": "BTP64MH", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1704, "h": 2272, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670812457471806, "time": 1670812457, "md5": "Ff12si4qLEpzT4nLK5o8vg==", "fsize": 164322, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "retrofitting-a-light-tower-trailer-generator", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 2520101, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)22:09:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Load will determine the final rpm.

Assuming it&#039;s still in stock, I plan on using the TPW1R306PL MOSFET by Toshiba, it&#039;s rated at 100A continuous, though in reality that&#039;s a function of heat-sinking. It&#039;s a real modern part with the ability to strap a heat-sink directly on top of it, that can operate up to 175C. Assuming 25C ambient, that&#039;s \u2206T=150C, and it has 0.93C/W thermal resistance to a heat-sink atop it. I plan on using 6 of them (BLDC) with a 1C/W heat-sink, so that&#039;s 6C/W when split up, 7C/W total when including the FET itself, meaning maximum of 21W. The FET&#039;s gate resistance gets up to 2m\u03a9 at 175C, so through P = R*I^2 we get I = \u221a(P/R) = \u221a(21/0.002) = 102A.

No, very most liekely not.<br>Will it taste like a good and proper dark beer? Hell yes, it will, because the malt will already contribute 90% of the flavor.<br>The only distinction that I allow in this discussion is that bakers yeast tends to not settle into a compact sediment-cake at the bottom after fermentation is done but will stay in a loosely, floaty state at the bottom of the fermenter, but that has nothing to do with the flavor.<br><br>Fun fact: Most breweries fucking 1000 years ago in the Germanic/Bohemian regions got their yeast from surrounding bakeries.

If you don&#039;t have enough sugar in your brew, you won&#039;t reach 15%, no matter the yeast. For 15% ABV you&#039;ll need around 290g sugar per liter. Depending on quality and time of the year, honey can have around 80g - 90g sugar per 100g honey, so 300g honey per liter is what you&#039;d want to use. As for additives, you&#039;d need yeast nutrients, since honey is very low in nutrients that yeast can use, also you need to shake in a lot of air before pitching the yeast.

Even a cheap, inaccurate hydrometer will do, since the hydrometer is in essence not a tool that delivers an accurate value of X in a single measurement. It&#039;s rather a tool to measure differences and change over time. If your hydrometer is cheap and inaccurate, you might not be able to accurately calculate your ABV and you might be off by +/- 1%, but what it can do is track a value of X today and a value of &lt;X next week which tells you that fermentation is still ongoing and it&#039;s too soon to bottle.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there a recommended recipe with more exact amounts that can be split or doubled as needed?</span><br>There is a ton out there.

For costs, a 33cm x 33cm rectangle plate costs about 15\u20ac in material costs, the groin plate has this size. thats 9 + 9 patches of the heavy a d light glass filament. 1m2 can be cut into 9 patches. 1m2 of glass weave costs about 3-5\u20ac, so about 3 for the light and 5 for the heavy, 8\u20ac total for the weave. Epoxy resin can be expensive, cheapest I found was 11\u20ac per kg. for a 33cmx33cm plate with 18 layers of mixed weaves I needed 750g of epoxy, so about 7-9\u20ac or something. Now you got a basic plate for what 15-20\u20ac. Porcelain is the best worst ceramic for balistic protection, you can source that for free. Add another glass weave for spalling protection above that to stop porcelain fragments from flying everywhere and boom you got a decent plate I&#039;d say. 25\u20ac max.", "time": 1669366984, "resto": 2509339}, {"no": 2509753, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)04:28:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2509750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2509750</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAg<wbr>fHkocU2g<br><br>I imagine you can just scan your face and fit it to you personally with cad programs.

This is in a mobile home, and nothing is fucking standard in these shitheaps. I had a hell of a time tracking down a new shutoff that fit the pipe coming up through the floor (the old one was leaking) and then just couldn&#039;t find a supply line that actually fit it. At the advice of someone in a hardware store I bought an adapter that went between the odd-sized shutoff and a regular ol&#039; faucet supply line.<br><br>As it turns out, for some reason the adapter just wasn&#039;t making contact with the gasket. I don&#039;t know if it was too thin and just went around it or what. I ended up sticking in a thicker gasket and then it made contact and everything sealed up tight.

Everyone had a backpack, one person brought the coal, one person the grill, one person cuttlery and dishes, etc. I wanted to make a leather case for the cutlery to put into, so I planned it and bought leather, only to realize that handsewing leather is not that easy. My mother saw me struggle and together we finished handsewing it. Nice memories.<br>A year ago I lost a lot of weight and as a result my clothes didn&#039;t fit me anymore. I tried tailoring by hand, but it all looked like ass. When my grandmother died and we sold her stuff, I got her sewing machine, so since then I do minor fitting of clothes on it when I just bought them. Pretty fun. I should probably put more effort in learning more though.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;any advice to beginners?</span><br>Get a basic sewing kit, it&#039;s cheap as fuck. Different colors of thread, different needles, one or two thimbles and one of those wire tools to help thread the thread through the needle and you can get started. <br>A running stitch, backstitch and ladder stitch are enough for basic fixing of most textiles, and take a total of 5-10 minutes to learn.<br>Apart from that, just get started.", "time": 1667680974, "resto": 2469395}, {"no": 2497753, "now": "11/06/22(Sun)12:13:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any tips on sewing stretch or knit fabric on an old domestic machine?

It is not a microcontroller. It does have some I/O pins, but the OS mostly gets in the way of using them. And you have to deal with it like a full computer, keeping the OS running, etc.<br>A microcontroller has nothing but maybe a bootloader. Any OS is built into your project. And there is usually nothing like a file system or network ports.<br><br>It&#039;s also that much more to throw out when (not if) something gets zapped. I was making a chip reader with a blue pill, and accidentally touched a +12 wire to an I/O pin, and now the thing runs hot because of the blown pin. I knew what I was doing, and was being careful, and still zapped it. I&#039;m kind of surprised that&#039;s the only time, there were other times I thought I had, and was wrong. But I started with a bag of twenty for $40 including shipping, seven-ish years ago, and most are still in the bag. And even then, it&#039;s only the main chip. I have some lower-spec ST chips that should drop right in.<br>The main thing you want when playing around with microcontrollers is to have identical spares around. You still want to be careful whenever you hook it up to something, but when it happens you need to be able to pull out another one and get back to work. If you had to change chip type, you would have to fuck with your build configuration. Also it lets you keep more than one project in progress at the same time. Blue pill is about as chink as you can get and still be able to get more.<br><br>The thing about micro:bit is that it already has a few useful things on the board (like the LED matrix), so you can do stuff without hooking it up anything, and it has the &quot;better&quot; I/O pins brought out to big holes you can clip to.

Also no clue how to program it since I&#039;m a brainlet, same goes for the ESP8266 dev-board I&#039;ve got here.<br><br>Looking at the linear algebra, both transforms can be converted into a single 3x3 matrix. All with positives and negatives, so using 2&#039;s compliment. So that&#039;s 9 multiplications (2 cycles each) and 6 additions (1 cycle each) per transform, not sure to what extent I need load instructions or if I can directly act on my registers. I also need to use a sine lookup table, probably also a cosine lookup table, which I&#039;m guessing takes a clock cycle or two to fetch a value from. So minimum 30 cycles per double transform, probably more like 33-42. The PI controller is not something I&#039;m sure how to implement live in an MCU, though I think it&#039;s just a Z-transform-based thing that has Out(n+1) be a function only of In(n), In(n+1), and Out(n). So I&#039;m guessing maybe 12-20 cycles each. Then another pair of additions, then the inverse matrix, then the inverter. For the inverter I&#039;ll just be feeding the values into three CMP registers of a timer&#039;s PWM. So it comes out to ~90-130 cycles, maybe more.<br><br>At 16MHz that&#039;s 5.6-8.1\u00b5s, 177-123kHz maximum calculation rate. At peak speed the motor needs to cycle at 42kHz, so I&#039;d be getting a really choppy sine at that speed. 52MHz from an ESP8266 is somewhat better (yields to 400kHz calculation rate).

On the downside, the passable results still required manual re-gluing with an iron about 70% of the time, maybe down to 50% after I got the hang of the required speed and consistency of feeding. Still, it was a massive pain in the ass to do some 40 meters of edging this way. I also didn&#039;t have a very good setup for trimming edges with a router, did a lot of it manually with a chisel.

It was also completely impossible to use it for banding thicker than 1mm, even 1mm was difficult. 0.5-0.7mm was alright.<br>This is what I then bought https://www.aliexpress.com/item/400<wbr>0569137844.html and first tests went well. It&#039;s pretty fast, the bond it leaves is really strong as it applies glue on both the ABS strip and the wood, and thanks to all the big rollers you can squeeze the edge on hard, even 2mm strips stuck just fine. Will see how it holds up next time I actually have a larger amount of edges to glue. Also I will definitely build a swiveling router mount for cutting the banding, I&#039;ve had it with chisels. <br>The steel frame was an extra layer of complication, if I had to build the same thing again, I&#039;d either go with thinner material or just use chipboard for the whole structure.

Find yourself an old back saw from before the thin plate came into vogue, file it rip, put in some set and then stone out almost all of the set and you will get wonderfully smooth miters in hardwoods. Stoning out the set instead of putting in very little set will give just enough fleam (functionally the same as fleam but not really fleam) on the outside of the tooth to give a smooth cut in even many softwoods. The old saws were not thicker because they could not make thin plates, they were thicker because it made it easier to get a smooth cut, the old guys knew what they were doing, sure it cut a tiny bit slower but it meant little to no fine tuning after the cut.

But it is hard to find a good one, honestly still looking the good one broke after several years and the new versions aren&#039;t as good. Lots of them now have hollow handles for storage, but that really weakens it as the handle bends and sometimes even breaks in my hand when I grip too hard, the old metal ones never did that. Reason I still like them is I have had projects where I drive in hundreds and hundreds of screws by hand. I had bits wear out which lead to other problems. By switch to fresh bits as I go I didn&#039;t have to keep buying screw drivers which cost more then a box of bits. It also lets me change to other types as the job had 8 screw types, so finding a comfy handle each item was annoying.

A properly sized solar system will power all your non-heat loads in winter, and in summer will give ample power for cooling.<br>You can go full /diy/ on this, you can buy everything brand new, or anything in between. If you use LiFePo4 batteries, the thing that will fail the soonest is the inverter-charger-controller. A system made with quality components can easily work for 20 years without problems, and longer if you buy some spares.<br>For backup power, a diesel generator. They will run off of all kinds of fuel, and are pretty easy to fix.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Water</span><br>This greatly depends on your area. In my locale (Western PA), you could live off of catchment water alone. Other places will need a well or desalination method.<br>For storage, it&#039;s hard to beat a massive cistern in the ground. The water should be somewhat filtered before going in, and filtered again when coming out. You pump the water up into a tank in the attic to give you pressure. This pump can be powered by anything - solar, wind, a horse, you, etc.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heating</span><br>Wood/coal/straw/poo fired boiler heating a giant insulated hot water tank, which acts as heat storage. Traditional wood stove as a secondary/backup. Optional ground source heat pump can handle all your heating (and cooling) needs when there&#039;s enough solar power, allowing you to save your fuel for those very cold and dark days.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cooling</span><br>Proper location and passive construction will help with this. Building partly underground/into a hill will allow you to leverage the earth&#039;s constant temperature for a source of cool in the summer, and heat in the winter. No matter what you build, insulation is a must. Ground source heat pump is the best method of active cooling.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Septic</span><br>Septic tank is ez, or you can treat it yourself by aerating the sewage in multiple stages.

The substance would be radiating light over top of the printed surfaces. This is a much different effect than shining a light on a reflective surface.

You will pay accordingly for the quality, but these do last several years.<br>But, ultimately the most DIY feasible solution is just to apply phosphorescent paint that reacts to UV light, and then use a UV light to illuminate it. You will obviously need to power the UV light source, but this is not a difficult DIY problem to solve.

OP here. I&#039;ve been spending the night the last 3 nights on my farm staking out the fuel tanks. It&#039;s not an every night occurrence you dimwits. I might have to be here for a month before they decide to show back up again. Road in has a cable across it and is locked. Tanks are locked. <br><br>First time they dropped an old gate a ways down the fence and drove in and stole a 4 wheeler, some gas cans, a couple batteries out of my excavator, and then cut a cable wrapped around the fuel filler handle and stole fuel from me. I&#039;m sure they fueled up their own vehicle as well as filling my own gas cans that they took. <br><br>So I then cabled up that old gate so that it is no longer a viable entrance, put a new chain and lock on the fuel filler handle, put up a game camera, and added a kill switch that kills power at a junction box that powers both my diesel pump and my gas pump on my bulk tanks. <br><br>Second incident they walked in with gas cans, broke the fuel filler handle to get the chain off, and figured out where the kill switch was and somehow managed to avoid getting caught by the game camera. (They have a limited range at night)<br><br>So now I have re-chained up the fuel handle and locked it differently, still have the kill switch at the junction box, still have the game camera, and additionally I pulled the breaker for the fuel pumps at the circuit breaker panel. Also added a couple motion detector driveway alarms that alert me in my hiding spot that someone or something has walked or driven by. <br><br>When I catch them I will citizen&#039;s arrest them unless they do something that makes me fear for my life, and in that case I will do what is necessary to protect myself. They WILL fess up to where my 4-wheeler and other items are before I call the sheriff to come collect them. <br><br>We&#039;re actually past the point of a tainted fuel can by now, but I might leave a bait can out in case there are any future fuel theft incidents.", "time": 1669401717, "resto": 2508083}, {"no": 2509926, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)13:46:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And for the other Anons that have provided useful advice, thank you, I will be reviewing your suggestions and trying a few things to see what I can come up with for future bait gas cans.

Thiickness is part of that calculation and affects the ratio of mass to cooling surface area, which is why they&#039;re thin to begin with.<br>If you stack three discs you&#039;ve cut down that exposed cooling surface on the outer discs by 1/2 and by 100% on the middle one. <br>Put another way, you&#039;ve tripled the kerf width/material removed, tripled the mass of the cutting tool, but still only have the same number of exposed disc sides to bleed the heat off.<br>On top of that, since that mass isn&#039;t one homogenous piece the heat in the center 1/3 can&#039;t dissipate as readily and is effectively insulated against maximum heat transfer by the gaps between it and the outer discs.<br>So the center disc will heat up more and faster and lose rigidity, and the outer discs

Quads are very dependant on actively flying the throttle, so learn to feather it in quick little blips to maintain the trajectory you are trying to fly.

The ender 3&#039;s and some other printers have a Z Axis screw on one side of the bed and mere rollers on the other side so it just kinda hangs or sags, which isn&#039;t so bad cause your bed levelling will compensate for it being out of square (not really but your layers can still be parallel with the bed because you&#039;ve levelled the bed to be parallel with your gantry arm in all its sagging out of square glory).

This is a big deal unless your laying down some thicc .5 mm layer heights with a big phat nozzle. Occasionally stubborn z movements on normal layer heights will ruin your repeatability and causing poor adhesion sometimes but not others.

But it&#039;s realistically a tear-down. You&#039;re basically rebuilding the house at this point, I guarantee that it needs all new plumbing, wiring, septic, etc. So you&#039;re replacing everything. How much is too much, for your budget? When/if do you plan to live in it? What&#039;s the neighborhood like, for potential rental income? <br>I mean, with some study and going slowly, you might get some of it done. You want professionals dealing with the roof, and electrical/plumbing. <br>This has every red flag for being a complete money pit. To what end? What is your final plan for the house? What is your realistic potential here? <br>If you plan to live in it, that&#039;s one thing.

Could be a big toilet you flush a big chunk of your paycheck into every month, for little or no return. <br><br>Like another anon said, get an inspector in there. Go over every inch of the house. Then get estimates from electricians, plumbers, and hvac for what they consider to be legal/recommended upgrades, while you get the shell of the house repaired. Maybe call around local contractors and see if they&#039;d be willing to consult and just sit down and write you out a general plan, and throw them some of the work, like the roof. <br>Get the foundation checked first, like other anons have said.

It took me about 2-3 years to get to this point but I can easily make a grand a week now with relatively little stress on my own time. The same could be said of any field. You could set up security systems for old people and if you are persistent you will find a niche and clientele. One thing I would recommend with the building trades is not getting into the heavy labor side. You can market yourself as a custom &quot;anything&quot; (fence, cabinet, entryway ect). Once you get there you can charge alot more. Never Never Never equate what constitutes a high price in your eyes with your customers view of things. People have given me 8 hundred dollar tips on 4 day jobs because my bid was way too low. Never be affraid to start a bid high. If they like you, they will ushually pay you. Sometimes you have to lose a day to make them happy. If a customer loves you they will almost certainly talk to their friends about you and then it is game over.

First off, that roof is as crooked as a dog&#039;s hind leg. And those windows are fogged up worse than my old truck in the morning. The front door is hanging on by a thread, just like my patience with Bobby sometimes. And that yard is a mess - there are weeds everywhere. It&#039;s just not a very good-looking house at all.<br><br>You know what I&#039;d do if I were in your shoes? I&#039;d tear that old house down and start fresh. It ain&#039;t worth the time and effort to try and fix it up. And you&#039;ll save yourself a lot of headaches if you just start over. Who knows, you might even end up with a better house in the end. It&#039;s definitely worth considering. So go ahead and give it some thought - you might be surprised at how much better off you&#039;ll be without that old, awful house.<br><br>And when you build that new house, make sure you power it entirely with propane. You know, propane is the ultimate energy source. It&#039;s clean, it&#039;s reliable, and it&#039;s affordable. Plus, you don&#039;t need no fancy electricity to run your appliances and lights. Just beautiful, clean propane for everything. You&#039;ll save money on your utility bills and you&#039;ll be doing your part to help the environment. So go ahead and make the switch to propane - you won&#039;t regret it.<br><br>Peggy, have I told you about my idea for an all-propane house? Think about it - no more expensive electricity bills, no more worrying about power outages. Just beautiful, clean propane for everything. It&#039;s not like we need all those fancy electrical gadgets anyway. I mean, what did we do before we had electricity? We managed just fine. So let&#039;s do it - let&#039;s build an all-propane house and make the switch to a simpler, more efficient way of living.<br><br>We should do it Peggy, we could make it real.
