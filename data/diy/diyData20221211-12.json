Bought a 30gal compressor a few years back with the same goal of running my impact + some other automotive tools - not great, nigh unusable. Got a cordless 1/2&quot; impact and it&#039;s been great. The cost of setting up a truly good air compressor and running hoses all over your workshop is in all likelihood not worth it, and if you cheap out on anything you&#039;ll be sorely dissapointed. Go with electric if you just want to run a few tools, corded or cordless based on what you are doing.", "time": 1670370786, "resto": 2516717}], "last_modified": 1670370786}]
