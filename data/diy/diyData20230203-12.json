Copper is expensive, but turning it into pipe is relatively cheap, because it is a soft material. <br>Stainless is cheaper, but... Making anything out of stainless is hard. Seamed tube (which has to be welded/brazed as pro-press won&#039;t work that well with it due to the seam) is about the same price of copper in the end. Seamless pipe - lol.<br>Joining stainless is also tricky. Soldering stainless? Idk maybe it would cause galvanic corrosion, and soldering to stainless is hard. Welding? Copper-sized tubes would be hard to weld as wall thickness is 0.8-1.2 mm, plus it would require you purging a line with argon so pipe doesn&#039;t sugar on the inside. Black iron pipe sized stainless pipe? Yes, it can be welded, even with stick, maybe you can get around the sugaring problem with some sort of flux instead of argon... But man it gets expensive.<br>Thus pro-press, flared and compression fittings are usable.<br>But then industry invented plastics. All sorts.

I&#039;ve made a few beanies and there are some that are worked in the round like amigurumi and some where you just make a rectangle and sew it together (these can look good if you only work in one loop of the stitch so it looks ribbed like knit)</span><br>A beanie is probably the safest option. I&#039;d love to make some cat or bear ears on his beanie but I know he&#039;d never ever use it if I did that... So I&#039;d say a round amigurumi-esque beanie is the thing I&#039;ll be making and it has to be navy blue apparently so yeah that&#039;s pretty much it!

Even if you go for a cutlass bearing, you&#039;ll still likely be unable to prevent water ingress, even one of those spiral shaft bearings that actively purge water would only work until a certain (probably shallow) depth. So I&#039;d look at motors used in those hydroplane electric surfboards, which I think have been designed with water flowing inside the housing with bearings that can handle that.<br>The other option (as Hyperspace Pirate alluded to in his submarine kayak video) is to have a way of equalising internal and external pressure, if just into the section where the motor is stored. He suggests using something like a balloon with far more inflated volume than the motor, such that as water pressure crushes the balloon it keeps the motor pressure the same as the outside pressure. That way the bearings don&#039;t need to hold back the pressure of the water, which is particularly important for him using brushed motors. Potential downsides include instability; you have more buoyancy when at a shallower depth than at a deep depth, giving hysteresis / positive feedback. If you need sufficient ballast to descend when on the surface with full balloons, then you&#039;ll need to dump quite a lot of that when you&#039;re deep underwater with crushed balloons. Maybe there&#039;s an easy way of cancelling this out, but I can&#039;t think of one.<br><br><a href=\"#p2554939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554939</a><br>CH341 or FT232", "time": 1675370918, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554992, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:51:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554972</a><br><a href=\"#p2554974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554974</a><br><a href=\"#p2554989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554989</a><br>Trash.", "time": 1675371089, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554994, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:54:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554992</a><br>tell me the right and true answer, oh wise one.", "filename": "1640258812507", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 278, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1675371279797223, "time": 1675371279, "md5": "8midA0vIA5IQR4Qu3HXVqw==", "fsize": 2733979, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554997, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554992</a><br>raspee peeko lmao", "time": 1675371401, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554999, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:57:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554994</a><br>I don&#039;t know, which is why I&#039;m asking.", "time": 1675371470, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2555000, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:58:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554999</a><br>There is no answer.

They have an insane amount of static pressure so they are amazing for pushing air through tight ducts. And they move more air through their 40mm opening in a second than woman talking all day through their 40mm opening could. The ones i got draw more 15.22W each at full power.

Worked just fine, the grit in the sandstone was not very even in grain but it cut fast enough, the clay brick was very fine and it took some time to polish after the sandstone but I only used the sand stone when I needed to repair damage or the like, learned to hone often on the clay and keep things sharp. <br><a href=\"#p2550213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2550213</a><br>It is great stuff when you use it for what it is good for.<br><a href=\"#p2550354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2550354</a><br>Sandpaper is great for reshaping a blade/fixing damage if you lack a grinding wheel. 80 grit belt sander belt cut open and taped down to something reasonably flat with carpet tape makes short work of it especially if you have a honing guide, having 2 or 3 feet of length to work down is a huge improvement over any stone as far as speed is concerned. Cheap enough for that occasional damaged blade. The very fine diamond stones are easily damaged but work well, with the DMT stones their extra-fine is that way, they fine and coarse are fantastic, extra coarse is eh. <br><a href=\"#p2550358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2550358</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but on the backside of a chisel they think going from 80 to 500 is a good idea</span><br>It is not exactly a bad idea, just slow.

At 1&quot; thickness depth of hardness will be about 3/16&quot;, at chisel size the quench is more efficient and goes deeper but lets go with 3/16&quot;, that is 3/16&quot; from all sides so most old chisels and all plane blades are actually through hardened with 1/2&quot; and up mortise chisels being the exception but even my old Stanley 1/8&quot; got twisted during a particularly deep mortise. <br><br>Irregularity in hardness along length comes more from tempering but you pretty much have to go to pre industrial revolution to see that and even then it is not the rule and depends on the markers method for tempering. Most everyone switched to ovens since it made tempering far more controllable and easier to do for large quantities. The cause of this irregularity in hardness was from applying the heat at the ass end of the blade and watching the color change down the blade, this left the ass end softer. But that is one off type work, before ovens the standard way was on a plate of steel over a fire, the plate evens the heat and allows you to do many at once with ease, but you still needed to watch it. <br><br>You seem to have swallowed every bit of marketing on steel that the tool manufactures throw out there.", "time": 1675033710, "resto": 2547519}, {"no": 2552313, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:47:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2552239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2552239</a><br><br>Yeah, I know.

Energy transfer is more efficient when magnetic, but steel will become non-magnetic when sufficiently heated.

I probably don&#039;t have any advice, but I&#039;m interested in learning everything from the ground up.

I feel pretty lame using a store-bought hair-dryer and an extension cord hooked up to a braker hooked up to a power pole hooked up to a power plant burning coal to enable me to get the charcoal I purchased from the store for $15 to burn hot enough to melt aluminum cans in a silicon-graphite crucible I purchased off of amazon <br><br>rehashing that: maybe I can get a billows? idk when the system goes down, what should my blowing power be anyways? a good billows sounds cool.<br>I&#039;d like a pyrolysis chamber to turn wood into charcoal. it&#039;s energy inefficient but that&#039;s what energy is. as long as it&#039;s metal time, you break out the charcoal.<br>I want to make a kiln. bonus points if this can be done in conjunction with the bucket furnace.<br>I saw a video also from king of random for refining clay. cool.

You shouldn&#039;t be seeing blue with just the fuel on, you also don&#039;t have to make a huge acetylene flame before lighting the oxy, I&#039;d say once the flame has volume and is putting out thick black smoke then you&#039;re good for the oxy. When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

The more I study this the less I&#039;m convinced the sensations are entirely independent. Bitter taste receptors are complex. The primary way I control these two is to grind finer to remove sourness. Most of my astringent cups have been offensively sour. The FP tolerates grinds that are too fine.

I worked at a tea store for 8 years. We made Tea&#039;s / Coffee&#039;s frappacino&#039;s , Tai tea. All sorts of shit. Now the absolute most powerful way to brew anything..<br><br>First you need to start with ultra high quality water. No horse shit tap water. No bottled water from the single use bottles the water quality in those is still shit. Get yourself a 5 gallon Jug of water with a tap on it. You can get it from water stores. You want double reverse Osmosis water. Now what you&#039;ll want to do is get your coffee bean. I recommend a good kind like 100% Arabica. Some broke fags prefer Guatamalan which is decent. Now what you need to do is grind it into a powder put it in a tea bag or a diffuser and put your diffuser in your coffee pot. And then put the pot of coffee in the fridge for 48-72 hours. This is called cold brew. And it&#039;s potent as fuck. Now once you&#039;ve got your ultra dank cold brew. Pour it into your cup and dilute that shit with milk and brown sugar add a little bit of cinnamon even add a little bit of chocalate flakes and whipped cream if you want to be extra fancy. And that&#039;s how you have a kick ass cup of coffee. It&#039;s expensive at first. Buying the water jug will set you back about $50. But if you&#039;re a serious coffee drinker it&#039;ll be worth it.

Create systems that can sustain themselves and make sure that your external inputs are only for the business/ making money. Being extremely thrifty and saving money is well worth it. Saving a dollar also saves you on the extra taxes and time. <br>#2 pastured poultry and especially right now eggs on Pasture can be competitive with conventional eggs, just DO NOT EVER buy major brand feed, especially Purina. There&#039;s even been rumors of feed being tainted to interfere with people home chickens but do your own research. If you check out Joel Salatin&#039;s work you&#039;ll see that the eggs and poultry are very scalable and doable on little land in chicken tractors. I would reccomend selling shares upfront so as to protect yourself from unexpected disaster. You can also make more on more exotic poultry like duck and goose. <br>#3 make content. Honestly it seems like there is no shortage of interest and growing in that kind of lifestyle and its popping off.<br>#4 sheep and goats. You mentioned dairy goats and yes thats good, you can also turn that into a land clearing business where people pay you to have your goats/ sheep graze/ browse their properties to maintain and improve their land and you get to then sell the meat/ milk/ offspring for extra profit. Check mosques and Hilal/ kosher communities to guarantee meat sales on sheep/ goats.<br>#5 agritainment. Set up some &quot;glamping&quot; sites or air other domiciles and sell the experience of living on a small piece of land to come and see how a homestead works and touch taste and smell what it is. you can also host small school groups think homeschooling co-ops/ Waldorf style groups. You can even end up with what is free labor for pay. Part of this too i think would be you&#039;pick style things like berry patches, pumpkins, sunflowers, asparagus,etc. Mostly perennial style crops that people pay to pick themselves and then you have the customer on site to upsell to. <br><br>Hope this helps", "time": 1675038236, "resto": 2550036}, {"no": 2552367, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2551824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2551824</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;ll be ready to kill each other in a month.</span><br>Yeah, two weeks in my wife gets on my nerves but I just learn to adjust - it wasn&#039;t THAT bad<br>I had to spend all of COVID with my wife and I loved it", "time": 1675043351, "resto": 2550036}, {"no": 2552379, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)21:02:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;wife tends the livestock and gardens full time</span><br>It would make more sense to have her tend to OnlyFans full time.", "time": 1675044151, "resto": 2550036}, {"no": 2552393, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)21:22:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2552379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2552379</a><br>kill yourself you money hungry freak", "time": 1675045353, "resto": 2550036}, {"no": 2554855, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)12:09:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Short answer.

You will be lucky to make enough animal or animal byproduct sales to cover feed and maintenance costs of having those animals. Even if you are successful and begin making profits, it won&#039;t be consistent. Everything has a season...

It was the world&#039;s top producer of steel. It was of such strategic importance that the US Army set up an entire anti-ballistic missile system around the area, because it was assumed that it would be a prime target in any war.<br><br>Then, in the 1980s, the western world decided that manufacturing shit was lame, and we could just have Japan (later China/Vietnam/etc) do it instead. More profitable to build new factories in countries with none of those silly &quot;environmental protections&quot; or &quot;workers rights&quot;. So, all but *one* of the steel mills closed in the Pittsburgh area.<br><br>With the literal foundation of the area&#039;s economy removed overnight, work dried up left and right. It was basically as bad as the Great Depression. With no way to make a living, people left in droves. The neighborhoods where the mill workers and their families lived became empty shells. House values plummeted, and people were literally just abandoning their houses because the outstanding balance on their mortage was for more than the house was worth.<br>So you&#039;ve got these neighborhoods that have literally no jobs, very few people living there, and shit public services now that there&#039;s no revenue - but now tons of extra houses. This made rents ridiculously low, and the &quot;usual suspects&quot; moved in - the kinds of people who enjoy 9mm handguns and aren&#039;t concerned about working a job. Crime subsequently skyrocketed in those areas, preventing any significant investment or repopulation.<br><br>1/2", "time": 1674663708, "resto": 2549648}, {"no": 2549700, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:22:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2549698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2549698</a><br>2/2<br><br>It&#039;s now the late 90s, and Pittsburgh manages to make a miraculous economic recovery. The many universities and the city&#039;s extensive medical sector lead the way to it becoming an education/medicine/robotics type hub.<br>Other cities (e.g. Gary, Detroit, etc) didn&#039;t fare so well.<br>Fast forward to today. More young people are moving to Pittsburgh, and the young people born/raised there quit fleeing. The population still is on a very slight decline, since there is a massive population of old boomers which are dying off. This means that many of those houses that were abandoned in the 80&#039;s still haven&#039;t had any attention, and 40 years of neglect will really take a toll on any building.<br><br>As for /diy/ potential: Yes. Make sure you pick the right neighborhoods. The typical shitty &quot;house-flipper&quot; approach won&#039;t work very well, since there is no shortage of nicer homes for people with some money to move into.<br>You can buy properties that are currently very shitty for extremely low sums. If you put the work in to make them liveable (not &quot;fancy&quot;), they will absolutely sell/rent. Real /diy/ is required though, since they will probably need major work done.

Not exactly fix and flip but first home type stuff, I currently live with my parents and work a basic warehouse job, and can make the same wages over there, with much easier access to property. Everything around me is like 900 minimum for rent and 250k for livable real estate (about an hour west of Philly). Dunno if it&#039;s just a pipe dream and I should go back to college for a career, or if it&#039;s worth moving somewhere cheaper and staying in the same $20-27/hr wage bracket. Honestly most the people I know who got a degree aren&#039;t making more than 80k annually, most are 60-80, a few are 100k+ but those are the super lucrative careers that&#039;re closer to the city and are highly competitive and frankly I just don&#039;t care to live that way.

Blew my mind.<br><br>Anyway I&#039;d be interested to hear some real opinions on this because everyone where I live made their fortune in law or marketing or some fancy pedigreed career path, and when I talk about how confused I am they honestly don&#039;t know what to say. On the one hand I feel privileged for growing up in a nice area, on the other I feel totally screwed in economic mobility.

The wine gets (similar to the &quot;corker&quot;) a so-called off-tone, so an unpleasant aroma. The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;).

The &quot;B\u00f6ckser&quot; is one of the reduction aromas that occur in the absence of air and is caused by the presence of sulfurous substances in the wine. These are formed by yeasts during fermentation, mainly from sulfur-containing amino acids and from sulfites and sulfates. Excessive sulfurization, residues of pesticides, a fermentation temperature that is too high or incorrect pH values can all contribute.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In order to avoid the B\u00f6ckser, it is advisable to remove the lees in good time.

Orange blossom honey is notorious for a slow fermentation, depending on the region it might even get stuck and restart on it&#039;s own, really temperamental.

It&#039;s just not a good question.<br><br>It seems to be asking which is made from a denser material, but it&#039;s worded badly. &quot;Heavier&quot; just isn&#039;t useful when talking about buoyancy; weight is just downward force. An air craft carrier weighs over 90 thousand metric tons, it&#039;s made of metal, and it (should) float because it&#039;s less dense than the water surrounding it. It&#039;s more complicated than this with water displacement etc, but the long and short of it is that if you made coins out of the same metal as an air craft carrier, they&#039;d sink despite being a tiny fraction of its weight. You can make something that is &quot;made of heavier material&quot; float by making it hollow or into a foam or something and thus less dense overall.<br><br>B is apparently smaller by volume and appears to be sinking, while A is larger by volume and appears to be floating.

I was having a somewhat similar error and if I remember correctly the issue was that the microSD card was fried. The ESP32 module worked fine when I removed or replaced the microSD card. I doubt this is the case though since if your code uses a microSD card then it would probably halt and not send the serial data that it&#039;s sending, and if it doesn&#039;t use it then chances are you wouldn&#039;t have one inside.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe it&#039;s a permission issue with your USB.

Chickens can be really fun to keep and watch and they do not need a lot of effort to keep happy.<br><br>Some pointers:<br>6-8 is a lot, if you are just looking to have fun pets and supply your family with eggs. I would recommend going for 3-4 hens, not more. That would give you a steady 3 eggs every day and I can tell you from experience that the novelty of having fresh eggs every day wears off rather fast and it can be hard to find people to give them away to at that quantity. Maybe look into getting a breed that is bred for looks and not so much for laying quantity, so you don&#039;t get swamped in eggs you cant use. Also chickens will tear the hell out of your yard. A good rule of thumb is about 10sqm (am eurofag) per bird if you want to keep the grass. If you plan on keeping them in an enclosed run then this will turn into a wasteland guaranteed, so preferably you would be able to let them have the run of your property and only keep them in an enclosed run when you are away for a time.<br><br>As for the coop:<br>You dont need to go for something overly large. The chickens will only use it to sleep and to lay eggs. Make it large enough that its easy to clean out. Keep the nesting boxes on the same height, you dont need one box for every hen, they will usually have a favourite and take turns laying. Also the roosting bar should be large enough for all of them, so there is no fighting about the best sleeping spot and put a large removable board under it, where the majority of shit lands on - makes cleaning so much easier.<br><br>Securing the run:<br>The main predator for chickens here in Europe is a type of mink. They can squeeze through pretty much everything that is larger than chicken wire, so that would be your go to material.

Compliant mechanisms where the 3D-printed spring bends along layer lines are possibly strong enough, but that generally means the spring is printed horizontally even though the mags are printed vertically, which looked like a pain to get printed properly. Plus it would have to be quite large in the scope of things, like a 3cm+ long spar with a nub on the end, and there&#039;s no guarantees that the nub would last a lot of cycles.<br><br>For my magazine latch I think I&#039;ve decided on using a piece of spring-steel harvested from a vacuum cleaner retraction spring. Just needs to protrude from the magwell at an angle to catch on a small hollow in the mag itself. To release it, you either have a shim that&#039;s pushed between the spring and the mag, or something else to pull the spring-steel back away from the mag. Done well you could have the springiness of the release button come from the same piece of spring-steel, and still not have it fall out when not in use.<br><br>Would also be pretty doable to have a springy protrusion into the magazine that works like those spring-latch mechanisms This Old Tony machined in that one video. Using spring-steel instead of compliant printed plastic you&#039;d glue a little printed follower on the end of the spring-steel, using a plastic spring you&#039;d have to print it separately to have sufficient grain strength. Theoretically you&#039;d only need a thin channel in the side of the mag for this to engage with, and could get away with a relatively long compliant spring for minimum plastic deformation.<br><br>Are you also making an edgy 18650 holder for your handheld electronics projects?", "time": 1674951111, "resto": 2550365}, {"no": 2551583, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2551544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2551544</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is your first layer underextruded on the left and overextruded on the right?</span><br>if you were to ask me that outside of this context i&#039;d say &quot;no&quot;, but i haven&#039;t printed anything all that large. <br>there might not even be a problem with it, i just don&#039;t like that the rod wobbles when the Z axis goes up. i feel like it shouldn&#039;t. it would be a real effort to find out exactly what the problem is. like, i guess i could take the rods out and roll them and see if they&#039;re bent, then maybe swap the stepper motors with each other and see if the wobble changes to the other side, etc. i just don&#039;t want that to be the case and i was hoping someone would be like &quot;oh just fuckin turn the collar holding the screw upside down and that fixes it&quot;.", "time": 1674953192, "resto": 2550365}, {"no": 2551593, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2551569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2551569</a><br>Yeah I was thinking more of a way to avoid doing a spring hatch design for the magwell and instead do something like this, would be mounted on top of the magazine and into the magwell.<br>Also yes, I might add an electronic system for the lasgun, not sure yet.", "filename": "a1wvy7nfxjiducx26d0df6e8w1ni_1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 516, "h": 1058, "tn_w": 60, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674954085122792, "time": 1674954085, "md5": "H/rNrNDXU7L3CRVIKkB+dw==", "fsize": 34696, "resto": 2550365}, {"no": 2551600, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:13:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2551593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2551593</a><br>lmao i was literally doing this like two days ago for a sten mag.<br>I went with a paddle release since it&#039;s going to be more rigid than a printed side release. you could also try something like how a glock spring works. you push a button to move a bit of spring wire to the side. <br><br>it depends on the geometry of your magazine, how you want to do it. a sten mag has a slot cut in the back of it, so this lever would tilt forward and keep the magazine from coming down. you push the lever and the mag can drop free.<br>since you have that knob on the side, you could put a lever that engages underneath it. <br>i planned to hollow out a slot on the back of the lever, and put a torsion spring inside, pinned in place with a dowel pin which is also holding the lever.

Likewise if it grinds loudly against the left side it is not sensitive enough. Go to Configuration / Advanced / TMC Drivers / Sensorless Homing. Go to the axis you need to tweak (X or Y). If your X axis stops before hitting the left side you are too sensitive on X. So lower the X value by 5 and retry homing. If your X grinds too much for instance on the left side, you are sensitive enough so raise the X value by 5. Use the same process for Y if it has issues.

Everything is there and you have comments that give a bit of context in case it&#039;s not very clear what each setting does.<br>Now when setting up klipper, just like with marlin, you&#039;re going to start configuring based on templates made for your printer. Except only the bare minimum of settings are mentioned there so any additional functionality is not listed. You don&#039;t know if it can do abl, you don&#039;t know if it can do dual independent Z, you don&#039;t even know if it has thermal runaway. Of course, all of this is there, but you have to go digging through the scattered bits of documentation on github to begin to piece together what you&#039;re supposed to write in the config file to make it work.<br>And this is for features you want to enable. Klipper has a mountain of stuff that is enabled by default that&#039;s not listed in the config. For example, klipper&#039;s config reference page mentions that pausing a print is possible if you add [pause_resume] to the config. But there is no mention of the fact that there is a limit to how much the printer will wait. Only the reference docs on github will tell you. And that limit by default is 10 minutes, after which the klipper cancels the print job. So if you want to pause a print to insert some nuts or something else you might come to the printer and find a cold bed and an error message in octoprint if you don&#039;t do the job in those 10 minutes.<br>There&#039;s also a maximum extrusion volume per move. Again, shit not mentioned anywhere but on github. It is a calculated value based on nozzle size and some other factors. The standard value calculated for 0.4 nozzles is enough for printing with 0.4 and 0.6 nozzles, but with 0.8 it&#039;s easy to reach the limit.

Ammonia cleaner<br><br>Mix the iron and sulfur powder together until they are a fine, uniform mixture. Put the powder on some sort of stone you don&#039;t care about, and light it. This reaction gets very hot, something like thermite, and will melt through metal, so be careful and do it outdoors. Once it has cooled, chip and scrape off whatever pieces of the result that you can. This is iron sulfide. Mixing iron sulfide with an acid will produce hydrogen sulfide gas, which is responsible for the smell of rotten eggs. You can hide a bottle acid in the ceiling, drop the FeS chunks in, and run away, or you can go the optional, slower release route. Make the hydrogen sulfide, and bubble it through the ammonia solution. This will create ammonium sulfide, which degrades back to hydrogen sulfide over time. You can put this liquid in a bottle and set it up to slowly drip over time, releasing hydrogen sulfide as it drips. As <a href=\"#p2548488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2548488</a> said, this gas, being a sulfur compound, is toxic, and is around the same level as hydrogen cyanide gas.
