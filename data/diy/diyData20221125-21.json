What could a person theoretically put into a gas can that will fuck everything in a fuel system up? Something clear and not obvious, can mix with gasoline and still smell like gasoline. Muriatic acid? Drain cleaner lye?

OP here. I&#039;ve been spending the night the last 3 nights on my farm staking out the fuel tanks. It&#039;s not an every night occurrence you dimwits. I might have to be here for a month before they decide to show back up again. Road in has a cable across it and is locked. Tanks are locked. <br><br>First time they dropped an old gate a ways down the fence and drove in and stole a 4 wheeler, some gas cans, a couple batteries out of my excavator, and then cut a cable wrapped around the fuel filler handle and stole fuel from me. I&#039;m sure they fueled up their own vehicle as well as filling my own gas cans that they took. <br><br>So I then cabled up that old gate so that it is no longer a viable entrance, put a new chain and lock on the fuel filler handle, put up a game camera, and added a kill switch that kills power at a junction box that powers both my diesel pump and my gas pump on my bulk tanks. <br><br>Second incident they walked in with gas cans, broke the fuel filler handle to get the chain off, and figured out where the kill switch was and somehow managed to avoid getting caught by the game camera. (They have a limited range at night)<br><br>So now I have re-chained up the fuel handle and locked it differently, still have the kill switch at the junction box, still have the game camera, and additionally I pulled the breaker for the fuel pumps at the circuit breaker panel. Also added a couple motion detector driveway alarms that alert me in my hiding spot that someone or something has walked or driven by. <br><br>When I catch them I will citizen&#039;s arrest them unless they do something that makes me fear for my life, and in that case I will do what is necessary to protect myself. They WILL fess up to where my 4-wheeler and other items are before I call the sheriff to come collect them. <br><br>We&#039;re actually past the point of a tainted fuel can by now, but I might leave a bait can out in case there are any future fuel theft incidents.", "time": 1669401717, "resto": 2508083}, {"no": 2509926, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)13:46:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And for the other Anons that have provided useful advice, thank you, I will be reviewing your suggestions and trying a few things to see what I can come up with for future bait gas cans.

They are not exactly rare but nor are they common, but they are niche enough to keep prices from getting ridiculous or making you have to wait excessively long periods to get one. Generally they run from $60-$100 depending on condition, fair chance you would have to find one in the US to buy, but that has the positive side effect that it is probably worth twice the price in Europe and you will be able to sell it at a profit without much effort if it turns out to not be something you like to use. They take a bit to learn to sharpen well and use but once you get the hang of it there are few tools (if any) as good at dealing with tight inside radii, once you get the hang of it it will leave a finish ready surface and can deal with the complex curves which are a headache with most tools.

They are simple to make and can be made with convex, concave or flat soles and you can often find them on the used market for not terribly much.

Furniture maker Jeff Miller built a mini-bench that elevates workpieces to a more comfortable height.<br><br>Extraction woodworking benches are designed to place a workpiece at a height that\u2019s ideal for handplaning. But the perfect height for planing often is too low for other common bench tasks. For example, when routing, carving, cutting dovetails, or doing layout, I frequently have found myself bent over at an uncomfortable angle so that I could see clearly and work effectively. When performing these tasks, I like to have a workpiece positioned 6 in. to 10 in. above my waist level.<br><br>To bring a workpiece to my ideal height range, I made a small workbench that mounts quickly to my regular bench. When extra height is needed, the minibench effectively raises the work-surface to my comfort zone.

Bad side is that they had to make huge roof over hanger to avoid wetness from rain. They painted the wall yearly again as protection.<br>An other, more geometrical method: Look up japanese cob wall installations.
