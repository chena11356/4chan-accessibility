This is because many adhesives, including super glue, are not specifically designed for use with plastic and may not provide a strong or long-lasting bond.<br><br>Instead, you may want to try using a plastic welding adhesive, which is specifically designed for bonding plastic parts together. These adhesives typically come in two parts that must be mixed together before use, and they often have a longer working time than super glue, which can give you more time to adjust the fit of the parts as you are bonding them together.<br><br>Additionally, you may want to consider using some plastic reinforcement, such as plastic welding rods, to help provide additional strength to the repair. This can help to ensure that the repaired area is strong enough to withstand normal use of the printer.<br><br>Overall, it is important to make sure that the repair is performed carefully and that the adhesive is allowed to cure fully before using the printer again. This will help to ensure that the repair is strong and will last for a long time.", "time": 1670539236, "resto": 2517522}, {"no": 2517987, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)17:41:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m trying to fix my wired Xbox 360 controller.

The vertical one I built might&#039;ve been passable after some further improvements for small pieces, like the sides of drawers, but it was really hard to handle larger parts, like the top plate. It was also completely impossible to use it for banding thicker than 1mm, even 1mm was difficult. 0.5-0.7mm was alright.<br>This is what I then bought https://www.aliexpress.com/item/400<wbr>0569137844.html and first tests went well. It&#039;s pretty fast, the bond it leaves is really strong as it applies glue on both the ABS strip and the wood, and thanks to all the big rollers you can squeeze the edge on hard, even 2mm strips stuck just fine.

Find yourself an old back saw from before the thin plate came into vogue, file it rip, put in some set and then stone out almost all of the set and you will get wonderfully smooth miters in hardwoods. Stoning out the set instead of putting in very little set will give just enough fleam (functionally the same as fleam but not really fleam) on the outside of the tooth to give a smooth cut in even many softwoods. The old saws were not thicker because they could not make thin plates, they were thicker because it made it easier to get a smooth cut, the old guys knew what they were doing, sure it cut a tiny bit slower but it meant little to no fine tuning after the cut. Ultimately, such thin plates only benefit you when cutting dovetails, everywhere else it makes things more difficult.<br><br>With my old Spear and Jackson or Marples backsaws I can cut wonderfully smooth miters all day long in beech, I can manage it with my LN saws but I have to go slower and it would be a chore with the cross cut carcass saw of theirs I have, blade is too flexible and it is thicker than the Veritas.", "time": 1671019449, "resto": 2514390}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2518936, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)10:42:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So once and for all, should you be using fabric softeners in your laundry?<br>Some say it protects the fibers, others say it only damages them through unnecessary chemical exposure.

OP here. I&#039;ve been spending the night the last 3 nights on my farm staking out the fuel tanks. It&#039;s not an every night occurrence you dimwits. I might have to be here for a month before they decide to show back up again. Road in has a cable across it and is locked. Tanks are locked. <br><br>First time they dropped an old gate a ways down the fence and drove in and stole a 4 wheeler, some gas cans, a couple batteries out of my excavator, and then cut a cable wrapped around the fuel filler handle and stole fuel from me. I&#039;m sure they fueled up their own vehicle as well as filling my own gas cans that they took. <br><br>So I then cabled up that old gate so that it is no longer a viable entrance, put a new chain and lock on the fuel filler handle, put up a game camera, and added a kill switch that kills power at a junction box that powers both my diesel pump and my gas pump on my bulk tanks. <br><br>Second incident they walked in with gas cans, broke the fuel filler handle to get the chain off, and figured out where the kill switch was and somehow managed to avoid getting caught by the game camera. (They have a limited range at night)<br><br>So now I have re-chained up the fuel handle and locked it differently, still have the kill switch at the junction box, still have the game camera, and additionally I pulled the breaker for the fuel pumps at the circuit breaker panel. Also added a couple motion detector driveway alarms that alert me in my hiding spot that someone or something has walked or driven by. <br><br>When I catch them I will citizen&#039;s arrest them unless they do something that makes me fear for my life, and in that case I will do what is necessary to protect myself. They WILL fess up to where my 4-wheeler and other items are before I call the sheriff to come collect them. <br><br>We&#039;re actually past the point of a tainted fuel can by now, but I might leave a bait can out in case there are any future fuel theft incidents.", "time": 1669401717, "resto": 2508083}, {"no": 2509926, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)13:46:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And for the other Anons that have provided useful advice, thank you, I will be reviewing your suggestions and trying a few things to see what I can come up with for future bait gas cans.

On my Ender 5, I have to start a print, cancel, adjust the z offset in increments of 0.1 (which is asinine because for perfect adhesion and quality without elephant&#039;s foot you want to be within 0.02 of the correct height), and if I need to tune it more I have to start and stop the print again.

Assuming it&#039;s still in stock, I plan on using the TPW1R306PL MOSFET by Toshiba, it&#039;s rated at 100A continuous, though in reality that&#039;s a function of heat-sinking. It&#039;s a real modern part with the ability to strap a heat-sink directly on top of it, that can operate up to 175C. Assuming 25C ambient, that&#039;s \u2206T=150C, and it has 0.93C/W thermal resistance to a heat-sink atop it. I plan on using 6 of them (BLDC) with a 1C/W heat-sink, so that&#039;s 6C/W when split up, 7C/W total when including the FET itself, meaning maximum of 21W. The FET&#039;s gate resistance gets up to 2m\u03a9 at 175C, so through P = R*I^2 we get I = \u221a(P/R) = \u221a(21/0.002) = 102A.

No, very most liekely not.<br>Will it taste like a good and proper dark beer? Hell yes, it will, because the malt will already contribute 90% of the flavor.<br>The only distinction that I allow in this discussion is that bakers yeast tends to not settle into a compact sediment-cake at the bottom after fermentation is done but will stay in a loosely, floaty state at the bottom of the fermenter, but that has nothing to do with the flavor.<br><br>Fun fact: Most breweries fucking 1000 years ago in the Germanic/Bohemian regions got their yeast from surrounding bakeries.

The ender 3&#039;s and some other printers have a Z Axis screw on one side of the bed and mere rollers on the other side so it just kinda hangs or sags, which isn&#039;t so bad cause your bed levelling will compensate for it being out of square (not really but your layers can still be parallel with the bed because you&#039;ve levelled the bed to be parallel with your gantry arm in all its sagging out of square glory).

This is a big deal unless your laying down some thicc .5 mm layer heights with a big phat nozzle. Occasionally stubborn z movements on normal layer heights will ruin your repeatability and causing poor adhesion sometimes but not others.

It is not a microcontroller. It does have some I/O pins, but the OS mostly gets in the way of using them. And you have to deal with it like a full computer, keeping the OS running, etc.<br>A microcontroller has nothing but maybe a bootloader. Any OS is built into your project. And there is usually nothing like a file system or network ports.<br><br>It&#039;s also that much more to throw out when (not if) something gets zapped. I was making a chip reader with a blue pill, and accidentally touched a +12 wire to an I/O pin, and now the thing runs hot because of the blown pin. I knew what I was doing, and was being careful, and still zapped it. I&#039;m kind of surprised that&#039;s the only time, there were other times I thought I had, and was wrong. But I started with a bag of twenty for $40 including shipping, seven-ish years ago, and most are still in the bag. And even then, it&#039;s only the main chip. I have some lower-spec ST chips that should drop right in.<br>The main thing you want when playing around with microcontrollers is to have identical spares around. You still want to be careful whenever you hook it up to something, but when it happens you need to be able to pull out another one and get back to work. If you had to change chip type, you would have to fuck with your build configuration. Also it lets you keep more than one project in progress at the same time. Blue pill is about as chink as you can get and still be able to get more.<br><br>The thing about micro:bit is that it already has a few useful things on the board (like the LED matrix), so you can do stuff without hooking it up anything, and it has the &quot;better&quot; I/O pins brought out to big holes you can clip to.

But it&#039;s realistically a tear-down. You&#039;re basically rebuilding the house at this point, I guarantee that it needs all new plumbing, wiring, septic, etc. So you&#039;re replacing everything. How much is too much, for your budget? When/if do you plan to live in it? What&#039;s the neighborhood like, for potential rental income? <br>I mean, with some study and going slowly, you might get some of it done. You want professionals dealing with the roof, and electrical/plumbing. <br>This has every red flag for being a complete money pit. To what end? What is your final plan for the house? What is your realistic potential here? <br>If you plan to live in it, that&#039;s one thing. But if you want to fix it up to flip it, you could put a bunch of money into it, but won&#039;t be able to sell it for what it&#039;s now worth, if prices are lower in that area. <br>Your time, your money. Could be a big toilet you flush a big chunk of your paycheck into every month, for little or no return. <br><br>Like another anon said, get an inspector in there. Go over every inch of the house. Then get estimates from electricians, plumbers, and hvac for what they consider to be legal/recommended upgrades, while you get the shell of the house repaired. Maybe call around local contractors and see if they&#039;d be willing to consult and just sit down and write you out a general plan, and throw them some of the work, like the roof. <br>Get the foundation checked first, like other anons have said.

The substance would be radiating light over top of the printed surfaces. This is a much different effect than shining a light on a reflective surface. It would be more akin to the glare of light on a monitor, where-in the monitor is trying to emit light, but the surface of the screen is reflecting light in front of the monitor&#039;s light. It would wash out the printed letters on the keyboard and make them unreadable.<br>Perhaps that is okay, if you are a touch-typist and not trying to read the keyboard. But if that were the case, why would you be asking for a lighting solution? The keyboard appears to already have the usual tactile markers for hand placement.<br>But I think you&#039;d get a much better effect by just detail painting in the accents you need lighted, like the printed letters on each key.<br><br>Furthermore, luminescent materials are not &quot;free energy.&quot; They do require something to power them.<br>Some do retain the charge imparted by exposure to UV light and release it gradually after being removed, but the effect of relying on the very limited energy capacity of the coating will likely be underwhelming.<br>There are radio-luminescent materials like tritium paint. You will pay accordingly for the quality, but these do last several years.<br>But, ultimately the most DIY feasible solution is just to apply phosphorescent paint that reacts to UV light, and then use a UV light to illuminate it. You will obviously need to power the UV light source, but this is not a difficult DIY problem to solve.

I work at a science museum, so a lot of what I generate is the actual content, vs a fine art museum where art handling and conversation is more emphasized over making stuff. I don&#039;t work at this museum, but Exploratorium in SF has a lot of info about their exhibits and development on their website, if you wanna poke around: https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhib<wbr>its/exhibit-making<br><br>The big draw is being able to &quot;make cool stuff,&quot; which starts with getting stuff paid for. Museums have shoestring budgets and there&#039;s a whole team to secure donations and grants and the like. This means what we get to do is guided by who is willing to pay to have their name on it, and then informed by what the educators and scientists want to have on the floor. I like working within these constraints; I think its easier to be creative with limitations.<br><br>Maintenance and repair is a big part of my job, since the general public will destroy your shit very efficiently. When something new goes out on the floor usually I learn what I forgot to reenforce or what misuse case I forgot to consider almost instantly. It&#039;s not the public&#039;s fault, they paid for this experience and they are just trying to have fun. Repairing museum exhibits is a lot of creative problem solving since every piece is super custom. I end up learn shit like pool repair, and then apply it to the water table exhibit piece. I also end up with a ton of different trade tools in my workshop, since sometimes I&#039;m doing woodworking, welding, plumbing, electrical, lighting, masonry and painting. This isn&#039;t the kind of job where you can just lock in a single trade and be good at it forever.

You could set up security systems for old people and if you are persistent you will find a niche and clientele. One thing I would recommend with the building trades is not getting into the heavy labor side. You can market yourself as a custom &quot;anything&quot; (fence, cabinet, entryway ect). Once you get there you can charge alot more. Never Never Never equate what constitutes a high price in your eyes with your customers view of things. People have given me 8 hundred dollar tips on 4 day jobs because my bid was way too low. Never be affraid to start a bid high. If they like you, they will ushually pay you. Sometimes you have to lose a day to make them happy. If a customer loves you they will almost certainly talk to their friends about you and then it is game over.

Recently I bought a light tower trailer with a Kubota D905 and 6kW gen head and have been cleaning it up. The idea is to ditch the 6kW head and upgrade, while installing the Kubota D1105T in place. Had a few questions for anyone who knows these engines pretty well, or had this type of idea. Both of the engines above come from different applications. The Kubota D905 engine has a mfg sticker mentioning &#039;constant speed only&#039;. I&#039;ve disassembled the engine far enough to compare the governor assemblies and I&#039;m stuck scratching my head. Both engines seem to have the exact same assemblies from what I can tell. Seemingly the only factors keeping the smaller engine at a &quot;constant speed&quot; are the throttle control screws on the outside of the engine. If my plan is to put the D1105T (variable speed) in the trailer, and maybe down the line throw the D905 (constant speed) in a utv build, am I going to have to change any internal governor components in either engine?", "filename": "BTP64MH", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1704, "h": 2272, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670812457471806, "time": 1670812457, "md5": "Ff12si4qLEpzT4nLK5o8vg==", "fsize": 164322, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "retrofitting-a-light-tower-trailer-generator", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 2520101, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)22:09:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Load will determine the final rpm.

But it is hard to find a good one, honestly still looking the good one broke after several years and the new versions aren&#039;t as good. Lots of them now have hollow handles for storage, but that really weakens it as the handle bends and sometimes even breaks in my hand when I grip too hard, the old metal ones never did that. Reason I still like them is I have had projects where I drive in hundreds and hundreds of screws by hand. I had bits wear out which lead to other problems. By switch to fresh bits as I go I didn&#039;t have to keep buying screw drivers which cost more then a box of bits. It also lets me change to other types as the job had 8 screw types, so finding a comfy handle each item was annoying.

They have a crappy plastic &#039;bolt&#039; with a u-channel like in the picture. The bolt passes a wire through the channel and the bolt itself secures the earpiece with the actual driver to the rest of the headphone frame. The fact that its a bolt allows it to rotate so it can fit someone&#039;s head. Unfortuantely this shitty plastic bolt broke (I should clarify the plastic bolt isn&#039;t threaded). An easy fix would be to replace the broken plastic bolt with a threaded bolt (which I can then fix to the headphones with a corresponding nut).

It has torsion bar suspension and the torsion bar is shot out. Obviously I am trying to make as big of profit as possible so I would like to use only materials I already have. Recently I acquired a bunch of iron, &gt;&gt;/2517030 thread related, on another deal. As you can see, there is a perfect piece square tubing to make a leaf spring axle with. That did not come in deal, there are 2 3&#039; pieces on the rack 3x1/8&quot; on the rack that did come with the deal. So my question is, what, if there is one, would be the strongest and safest way to splice them together? I was thinking of sleeving in a piece of square stock or tube, I have either. OR cutting the joining ends at 45\u00b0 and fish plating it. If both are equally as strong, which would be less time consuming and or easier? There is also a 3rd option of converting it from torsion bar to coil springs, but that&#039;s a whole other kettle of rotten fish. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;picrel, the project.</span>", "filename": "Screenshot_20221209-183739", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670646397647282, "time": 1670646397, "md5": "1tVMKl6/uBHBEBdbRCJ/Iw==", "fsize": 1162304, "resto": 2514868}, {"no": 2518680, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)23:32:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2518676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2518676</a><br>Here is my last project trailer, wish I still had the pictures of when I bought it.
