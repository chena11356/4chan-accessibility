The tooth geometry is ultimately square as far as the wood is concerned, the gullets may change in shape depending on how they were cut but this has no effect on how the blade cuts since the gullets do not carry dust/shavings away like in a saw tooth or a file tooth, the blade just does not cut where the gullets are. <br><br>Toothing plane almost certainly goes back to at least the 1600s, it was fairly common by the mid 1700s, unlikely it came into existence and got widespread use in a few decades.

But few cabinet makers would have had need of a toothing plane, the things it is used for are the things only the richest could afford back then.", "time": 1675942913, "resto": 2557534}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2547392, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:09:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there any land here with affordable land where you don&#039;t have to deal with no property codes or zoning boomers?", "filename": "USA-Topo-Map", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1944, "h": 1154, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 148, "tim": 1674338952038574, "time": 1674338952, "md5": "n74BnpULqjkfqEGWbLH2cw==", "fsize": 395570, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-there-any-land-here-with-affordable-land-where", "replies": 188, "images": 25, "unique_ips": 89}, {"no": 2547395, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:11:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you don&#039;t want to be around other people, you need to be able to survive living in a place where nobody else wants to be.", "time": 1674339096, "resto": 2547392}, {"no": 2547399, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:14:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2547392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2547392</a><br>alaska", "time": 1674339256, "resto": 2547392}, {"no": 2547401, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2547395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2547395</a><br>I just want a place to live where I don&#039;t have to deal with people threatening to throw me out because I don&#039;t have this or that not up to code", "time": 1674339336, "resto": 2547392}, {"no": 2547403, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:16:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2547392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2547392</a><br>you know that codes are there to literally keep people from doing dumb and dangerous stuff that will kill someone sooner or later?<br><br>they don&#039;t make up codes for shits and giggles", "time": 1674339418, "resto": 2547392}, {"no": 2547406, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:20:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2547403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2547403</a><br>fuck off kike.

You&#039;ve identified HPMC as a rate controlling polymer, which is further than 90% of people would get (nice work!), but you have a lot of planning to do before you even hit the formulations stage.<br>You need to figure out how you plan on creating a homogeneous dry blend without a V-blender, also how will you test content uniformity of your tablets? Chromatography seems like it&#039;s off the table, but if you have an analytical balance you can do it by weight if your blend uniformity is good and your tablet weight and API amount are high enough. <br>How you will test dissolution of your tablets for the rate of release without a dissolution apparatus and chromatographic equipment? Getting an HPMC + API blend into tablet form isn&#039;t your biggest hurdle, it&#039;s making sure that the product doesn&#039;t dump API into your system too quickly and cause you to OD, or take 48 hours to release entirely. You have to know this information alongside having tested for proper distribution before you go munching your Kitchen Crank ER\u2122 Tablets (the force you compress the tablets with will also affect the release rate so it&#039;s not a single variable equation).<br>You haven&#039;t mentioned what API you are working with yet (do you have a CoA for it or know the purity?). You need to verify that there are no interactions between your API and excipients, which is usually conducted using IR spectroscopy, but you might be able to find literature on this pertaining to your specific API compound.<br>Even if you&#039;re successful with making a rate controlled tablet (which isn&#039;t impossible, but you have a ton of prep work to do) there are additional tests and variables that factor into your production process.<br><br>Very interesting thread, curious to see where it ends up, but I don&#039;t blame you if you choose not to pursue the project.

When the main house is finished, the detached garage will be used as a remote work office.<br><br>The garage does not have power or any wiring, I was thinking instead of bothering with hooking it up to the main house, I would put in solar. That way:<br><br>1. We don&#039;t have to wait for the power company or electrician to hook anything and can move in immediately<br><br>2. Can avoid having to learn and deal with all the intricacies of a solar system. <br>This is double edged, I want to learn solar systems, but just don&#039;t necessarily have the time to dedicate to it with my main house renovation. Ecoflow cuts all that out for better or worse<br><br>3. Future office is now backed up and and has its own dedicated power, dont have to worry about outages.<br><br>Heating is all wood, so its basically only going to power some lights, computer, a few other smaller things. <br><br>So thoughts on the ecoflow system with solar as a main source for a detached garage? I have no plans to hook it up to the main house, and it gives me peace of mind having a power backup if I need it. Should I just suck it up and learn solar, its cheaper and easier to fix etc. Im pretty torn, costco has a cheap ecoflow package going this month and It would be nice having power set up at the garage literally next week.", "filename": "ef pro", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 225, "tn_h": 225, "tim": 1675764695784372, "time": 1675764695, "md5": "36KDb8E9mjWLsT7y8Zr2xg==", "fsize": 5103, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ecoflow-solar-solution", "replies": 24, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 2558153, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)11:54:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2557978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2557978</a><br>4000 bucks for something you could build for 750 and an afternoon worth of fab and learning.

I don&#039;t understand what you&#039;re supposed to melt steel in inside of an electrically-charged-----<br><br>well, see, I thought I did understand it a minute ago inside of an induction furnace. it&#039;s like a different principle. since the electrical current flows through the material inside, the material and the crucibkle are heated equally. the material inside might practically heat the crucible. cool. nonetheless.

You shouldn&#039;t be seeing blue with just the fuel on, you also don&#039;t have to make a huge acetylene flame before lighting the oxy, I&#039;d say once the flame has volume and is putting out thick black smoke then you&#039;re good for the oxy. When you&#039;re tuning the flame people talk about a neutral flame but it&#039;s kinda hard for a beginner to grasp what that means, basically you watch the little flame needle (or needles depending on your nozzle) sticking out the hole (or holes) in the nozzle tip, you want that needle to be as long as possible without the flame flickering or changing color, the base of the flame should be blue with the yellow and orange further out, if you try to make the needles too long the flame will become a bright white and jet out of the nozzle in a sort of thin beam so that&#039;s a good way to tell you that you went too far. Sometimes gauges are weird so I can&#039;t really help you there, used to have a gauge at the shop that would correctly read the oxygen psi at the pressures we needed but the needle would never drop below 20 psi even when we turned it off. Make sure you have a welding/brazing tip and use good filler, keep the filler shielded by the outer flame not the the inner needle and don&#039;t dip that needle into the puddle, that&#039;s pretty much it for mild steel, it&#039;s kinda like tig when you start going.", "time": 1671544653, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2527285, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2525666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2525666</a><br>Why not just use a pencil lead attached to the wall outlet?", "time": 1671742705, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524105</a><br>I really like that trick.", "time": 1671914097, "resto": 2477759}, {"no": 2528515, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:48:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2524823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2524823</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 don&#039;t weld with it</span><br><br>Whoever told you that was a moron.

No bottled water from the single use bottles the water quality in those is still shit. Get yourself a 5 gallon Jug of water with a tap on it. You can get it from water stores. You want double reverse Osmosis water. Now what you&#039;ll want to do is get your coffee bean. I recommend a good kind like 100% Arabica. Some broke fags prefer Guatamalan which is decent. Now what you need to do is grind it into a powder put it in a tea bag or a diffuser and put your diffuser in your coffee pot. And then put the pot of coffee in the fridge for 48-72 hours. This is called cold brew. And it&#039;s potent as fuck. Now once you&#039;ve got your ultra dank cold brew. Pour it into your cup and dilute that shit with milk and brown sugar add a little bit of cinnamon even add a little bit of chocalate flakes and whipped cream if you want to be extra fancy. And that&#039;s how you have a kick ass cup of coffee. It&#039;s expensive at first. Buying the water jug will set you back about $50. But if you&#039;re a serious coffee drinker it&#039;ll be worth it.

Copper-sized tubes would be hard to weld as wall thickness is 0.8-1.2 mm, plus it would require you purging a line with argon so pipe doesn&#039;t sugar on the inside. Black iron pipe sized stainless pipe? Yes, it can be welded, even with stick, maybe you can get around the sugaring problem with some sort of flux instead of argon...

The wine gets (similar to the &quot;corker&quot;) a so-called off-tone, so an unpleasant aroma. The smell can be reminiscent of garlic, onions, cooked cabbage or rottenness, especially rotten eggs (&quot;H2S-B\u00f6ckser&quot;). Sometimes a goat-like odor is spoken of, which is why the name B\u00f6ckser is derived from &quot;buck&quot;.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B\u00f6ckser can develop as a result of improper production or incorrect storage and is more common in young wines. The &quot;B\u00f6ckser&quot; is one of the reduction aromas that occur in the absence of air and is caused by the presence of sulfurous substances in the wine. These are formed by yeasts during fermentation, mainly from sulfur-containing amino acids and from sulfites and sulfates.

Also driving an inductive load directly is a good way to accidently chuck bigass voltage transients back into the chip that it is not designed to handle.<br><br>You could kind of draw a parallel to designing primitive USB peripherals. Modern high power mode negotiation aside, USB isn&#039;t meant to deliver very much current, but if you average out your power demands over time, then it&#039;s entirely reasonable to use to, say, power a small audio amplifier where you&#039;d expect large transient demands for like kick drums or really loud sections, but well within the ability of the bus to power over the length of a song. So obviously what you wind up doing is chucking some appropriately sized capacitors in the power section to be able to take up the slack when more instantaneous current than USB can supply is required. But what happens when you plug in those empty capacitors? Bam it&#039;s basically a sustained short circuit from the perspective of the USB controller, so you have to put in reistors inline before them so that even if it were a short past the resistor it still wouldn&#039;t sink enough current to cause a problem. And that way the capacitors will slowly top themselves up as possible.<br><br>Ideally the H bridge would also take care of voltage spikes from an inductive load, but protection diodes (e.g. a zener after your input reisitors) might be enough beltt and suspenders without worrying about using an approrpiate choike or T/pi filter in line with the resistor.

Otherwise you just built a radiator without any fins and a useless hose coming out the top. Presumably an intake on the bottom and an exhsut on top would let convection do its thing.<br><br>But here&#039;s the trick. A hose run through a pile of sand isn&#039;t a terribly great heat exchanger (you want to use a metal hose obviously, rather than something that would insulate the air in the hose from the warm sand. So basically you need a heat exchanger inside the pot to do the same job that fins on the outside of the pot did if you were using external convection instead of internal convection. Now, you might or might get decent results just coiling the tube all around in there. A typical, say, gas fired forced air furnace uses something much more like a car&#039;s radiator full of lots of channels and fins so that the air moving through the furnace has maximum surface area exposure to the heat of the flame. So if you have an old car radiator or intercooler or whatever then that might be a a substantial upgrade. I would also suggest keeping the diameter of the hose not very big so that once the convection gets going you&#039;ll have a reasonable velocity of air to act in a siphon-like fashion, since air, unlike water, is compressable and won&#039;t siphon as intensely based on a low pressure differential. A fan could cure this, but you can experiment with that as a later step.<br><br>In theory it should work, but you might need to mess around to get it to work well. I suspect you might have better results with water, since it stores and conducts heat relatively well, and all you&#039;d need to do is put a pressure relief valve on top in case you start boiling it. But there&#039;s no harm in trying sand (or even wet sand!) and not worry about venting pressure just to see. Substantially venting vapor then you know you have an inefficient heat exchange and need more velocity or surface area", "time": 1675802605, "resto": 2548172}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 2556621, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)00:15:01", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "DIY Bottle Cap", "com": "So I have some 5 gallon jugs, and they fell in the truck bed and broke the caps<br>I wanted to know if you guys had any ideas for this kind of stuff, because I want to see if I can make new caps out of something simple", "filename": "jugss", "ext": ".png", "w": 932, "h": 445, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1675574101525807, "time": 1675574101, "md5": "WeHSb08WTMBF1x4c88qBvQ==", "fsize": 591440, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "diy-bottle-cap", "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 2556675, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)02:43:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2556621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2556621</a><br>use a potato", "time": 1675582983, "resto": 2556621}, {"no": 2556679, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)03:11:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2556621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2556621</a><br>Cork", "time": 1675584682, "resto": 2556621}, {"no": 2556683, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)03:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2556621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2556621</a><br>What do you want to keep in it? <br>How will they be stored?<br>Will they be transported?

My job is cool because it&#039;s like truly neutral. I look after kids and play vidya with them which is like &quot;feminine&quot; stuff combined with &quot;masculine&quot; stuff and I have both male and female colleagues and the kids I have in my groups are not just boys but there are also girls so this thing shows how idiotic it is to think about stuff in some absolute binary thing instead of pretty neutral things that culture has assigned some labels but the labels are really pretty arbitrary or come from some old stuff that&#039;s not relevant anymore like how good wives would sew and knit and crochet and stuff and then the idea of those as something girly is blocking you guys from even trying. Idk I could build stuff too if I&#039;d practice and somehow got stronger but I honestly hated all the woodwork stuff we did at school because I hardly could use any tools and it took me ages to saw through stuff and the machines scared me (but painting the products was fun!) and my creations were bad...

If it is blended into the food (eg. milkshake) or exposed to cooking heat, then it looses its impact. This is all just in my own opinion of course... I&#039;m sure others probably disagree with me.

Even if you go for a cutlass bearing, you&#039;ll still likely be unable to prevent water ingress, even one of those spiral shaft bearings that actively purge water would only work until a certain (probably shallow) depth. So I&#039;d look at motors used in those hydroplane electric surfboards, which I think have been designed with water flowing inside the housing with bearings that can handle that.<br>The other option (as Hyperspace Pirate alluded to in his submarine kayak video) is to have a way of equalising internal and external pressure, if just into the section where the motor is stored. He suggests using something like a balloon with far more inflated volume than the motor, such that as water pressure crushes the balloon it keeps the motor pressure the same as the outside pressure. That way the bearings don&#039;t need to hold back the pressure of the water, which is particularly important for him using brushed motors. Potential downsides include instability; you have more buoyancy when at a shallower depth than at a deep depth, giving hysteresis / positive feedback. If you need sufficient ballast to descend when on the surface with full balloons, then you&#039;ll need to dump quite a lot of that when you&#039;re deep underwater with crushed balloons. Maybe there&#039;s an easy way of cancelling this out, but I can&#039;t think of one.<br><br><a href=\"#p2554939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554939</a><br>CH341 or FT232", "time": 1675370918, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554992, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:51:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554972</a><br><a href=\"#p2554974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554974</a><br><a href=\"#p2554989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554989</a><br>Trash.", "time": 1675371089, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554994, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:54:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554992</a><br>tell me the right and true answer, oh wise one.", "filename": "1640258812507", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 278, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1675371279797223, "time": 1675371279, "md5": "8midA0vIA5IQR4Qu3HXVqw==", "fsize": 2733979, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554997, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554992</a><br>raspee peeko lmao", "time": 1675371401, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2554999, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:57:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554994</a><br>I don&#039;t know, which is why I&#039;m asking.", "time": 1675371470, "resto": 2553754}, {"no": 2555000, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)15:58:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p2554999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2554999</a><br>There is no answer.

He had them in the wrong folder and i uploaded them not realizing the program numbers were off, so I made a duplicate part with a wrong hole location (about 2 lbs of steel). I got sent home early for that and another of my trainers told me I wasn&#039;t cut out for this. I brought this up with my boss and he said he was inclined to agree. I asked to move to a different area with different trainers (I was about to go Private Pyle on these mfs) and he obliged.

Type-A personalities do horribly at teaching, in my experience. You want someone who can make the objectives of your work clear and then show you a pathway to execute confidently; throwing a fit over using the wrong kind of brush on a part is a prime example of nit-picking to destroy your students confidence in what they&#039;re doing. When it comes to explaining, there is a point where step-by-step information starts becoming a useless tangent. The things that you called &quot;big incidents&quot; were really rookie mistakes that are to be expected from anyone who&#039;s new to manufacturing.

Once fruit is set it no longer needs to get cold at night until you have harvested all the mushrooms and want to initiate another crop from the substrate. Blue oysters like it colder at night, I believe their magic temp is closer to 60 but do not recall.
