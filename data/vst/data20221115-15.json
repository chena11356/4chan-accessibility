Low level, decentralized societies (Iron age-early medieval, continues in some marginal places like Ireland) had militaries centred around the minority of warrior aristocrats and their retinues. They are small in number, mobile and can wage war without supply penalties because they loot, forage and command enough supplies to wage war over a long period of time. However they have little incentive to go to war for campaigns lasting more than a few months outside the spring and summer and automatically disband after their short term goal is achieved, because they have to tend to their own livestock and crops and peasants. If for some reason your armies continue to wage war at this stage into the winter you will not suffer resource debuffs (the peasants are still on the farm sewing and harvesting crops; it&#039;s only the aristocrats who fight) but you should suffer from some administrative debuff from having your realm&#039;s law and order away fighting wars, and the potential for rebellion/instability from the nobles themselves.<br><br>When warfare starts to grow more large scale like in high-late medieval periods, your armies are composed of a core of men at arms and a mass of peasant levies. These armies also require loot and foraging to keep themselves supplied but a consequence of taking your peasants away from sewing and harvesting seasons is that you will suffer from food shortages, peasant unrest and even famine. This leads to the logical conclusion of warfare in the late medieval ages, which is to rely on mercenary companies who also require loot and forage and are exorbitantly expensive to maintain, but you won&#039;t suffer from food shortages and poor harvests. Your population by this time will be much greater and you should have less incentive to rely on levies.", "time": 1668531286, "resto": 1260782}, {"no": 1261803, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)12:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1260782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1260782</a><br>Only Rimworld even tries.", "time": 1668532536, "resto": 1260782}, {"no": 1261827, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)12:45:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1260842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1260842</a><br>I don\u2019t remember that in GayTranny: the video game", "time": 1668534316, "resto": 1260782}], "last_modified": 1668534316}, {"no": 1223440, "now": "10/16/22(Sun)16:45:23", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Amazing Cultivation Simulator", "com": "Amazing Cultivation Simulator thread.<br><br>Let&#039;s say that you&#039;ve personally cultivated and you&#039;ve become a god, few if any can challenge your might and the chaosverse is at your fingertips.<br>What do you do with your unlimited cosmic power?<br><br>Me?

These usually have a higher unit cap, along with shared resource gathering/consumption. One aspect that I like spherical RTS over flat RTS, is that is gives the players an unintentional fog-of-war when viewing the battlefield from a casual strategic level (you can only see one half of a planet). It pushes for players on a team to focus on handling specific skirmishes at the low level occurring over the course of the big battle, since they have the most current situational awareness. It&#039;s a nice touch and I like the level of autonomy that happens during these shared control pvp matches.<br><br>I kinda wish there was a more popular RTS that had a shared-control and shared-resource army on bigger maps/solar system scale to incentivize players to split off into expeditionary branches of the main force for handling specific fronts.<br><br>Zero-K kind of has this system, where players tend to specialize in a certain type of army, but I hate how everyone in that game wants to forfeit after the slightest sign of not having overwhelming odds of winning. What&#039;s the point of having all these cool ass weapons if you don&#039;t get to wreck the enemy team with them. I like watching the absolute destruction of the enemy team, and I&#039;m cool with trying to struggle to get back on top as the disadvantaged side. There&#039;s been plenty of matches in various RTS games where I thought we were losing, but after some extremely decisive blows to the enemy we ended up winning.

Nod is where Cain went after he killed his brother Abel.<br>Kane can be maimed, injured, and even briefly &quot;killed&quot; but he is cursed by God and no matter how badly hurt, he will slowly but surely regenerate.<br>In my mind he spent long periods of history uninterested in human affairs, but occasionally he sees glimpses of a future in which he might escape his curse or settling for less, rule Humankind.<br>Kane was largely uninterested in human affairs most recently until the emergence of Tiberium. Before he even saw Tiberium himself or knew what it was, he started to have visions of the future again--strange and weird visions of a future Earth changed, a biosphere he couldn&#039;t recognize, and an outside agent from offworld. A future in which he was both freed from his curse and ruled Earth. And with that he steps forward and slowly emerges from the shadows with his new socio-political-religious movement and starts to influence things. He never sees future clearly and it&#039;s often very confusing and muddy visions that he catches. Kane completely believes he will be free from his curse and while he enjoys his power and ability to control the affairs of man, he really wants to die one day. He also believes he sees the only way for mankind to survive, as a species, into a very difficult future. He really believes his way is the only way forward. He&#039;s not your typical &quot;bad guy&quot;--but he is definitely pathological. He does everything that he does with righteous purpose and feels the ends justify the means. Keep in mind that while Kane has no empathy for others, he is fond of human race in general, and curious to see what becomes of it. He is especially intrigued by advanced sciences, medicine, electronics, and artificial intelligence.<br><br>Brett Sperry", "time": 1668088577, "resto": 1243367}, {"no": 1260591, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)22:53:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1243367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1243367</a><br>kane should be in an epic rap battle video", "time": 1668398001, "resto": 1243367}, {"no": 1260615, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)23:48:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1257665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1257665</a><br>Vampire: The Masquerade, much?", "time": 1668401291, "resto": 1243367}, {"no": 1260671, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)01:47:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1260615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1260615</a><br>White Wolf wishes their &quot;metaplot&quot; were half as good as Westwood C&amp;C games.", "time": 1668408455, "resto": 1243367}], "last_modified": 1668408455}, {"no": 1258780, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)19:09:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are there any other multiplayer business games worth playing?", "filename": "games", "ext": ".png", "w": 460, "h": 428, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 232, "tim": 1668211787529636, "time": 1668211787, "md5": "g7HipZSB9+xfQGyfcCsbLw==", "fsize": 399422, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "are-there-any-other-multiplayer-business-games", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 13, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 8, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1260616, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)23:49:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1258780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1258780</a><br>I really liked this game, I don&#039;t know why i got burnt out on it so quickly.
