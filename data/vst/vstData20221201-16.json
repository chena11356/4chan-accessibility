Vicky 2 is summed up by &quot;great concept, terrible execution&quot; and that mantra holds true for basically every aspect of the game - from the Scramble for Africa to the Crisis system. <br>Most PDX games, the gimmick is that you start small and gradually build up. In CK2, players are told that characters above emperor are &quot;pointless&quot; to play, for example. But with Vicky, the game isn&#039;t worth playing unless you are one of the ~12 powers who is a GP or can easily become one (Japan, China, Mexico, CSA, Netherlands, Spain, etc.). Nations that are less powerful than that simply have so little control that you are at the mercy of AI superpowers. The game isn&#039;t long enough for a small nation like, say, Afghanistan to work its way up to the global superpower. <br>The main appeal of Vicky 2 is that it&#039;s a &quot;simulator&quot; for the 19th century. You&#039;re playing an alternate history, that sort of thing. However, the AI isn&#039;t good enough to do anything interesting most times. In reality, the Victorian era had many. many close calls where different powers nearly got colonies in weird places (Russia tried to colonize Hawaii, Belgium tried to colonize Texas after it beat Mexico, Russia tried to colonize Djibouti, etc.). You will never see Russian Hawaii even though it&#039;s actually historically plausible. <br>The game is overly rigid due to the limitations of the events/decision system for railroading. Like, powers regularly sold territory to one another at the time, but there is no system for dynamic sales.

Rome\u2019s issue also is that it\u2019s not different enough. Your best bet for more flavor is Invictus, and even that has its own issues but if you like the gameplay you can still get a few campaigns out of it. Honestly though the biggest issue with imperator is the lack of identity. The game has characters, but CK does it better. It has POPs but vic2 does it better. It has blobbing but EU arguably does it better. Couple that with the fact that there\u2019s maybe like 5 actually interesting nations to play, and then only a handful of meme countries, and you realize that the game just has no replayability. It\u2019s still fun though, if only for a couple campaigns.
