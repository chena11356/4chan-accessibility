Every other mission in the game is between 30 seconds to four minutes and can be heavily reduced with just a few science minions. In EG2 the equivalent &#039;schemes&#039; stretch way beyond any of that. EG2 merges the passive actions for the World map used to get money, with the progression/loot-gain missions from EG1. Money is teleported directly into the vault, so no one is carrying briefcases back and forth. As the devs want the game to have similar pacing to the first one(and seemingly for players to have even less control over that pacing), it means the naturally-occurring wait times of EG1 are translated into EG2 as extended timers. <br><br>Research in EG1 requires science minions to survey the base in their spare-time(they need time not doing anything else for this to happen), where they check-off a list of items as potential candidates. What you build in your base determines the possibilities. They feed these candidates into the research machine and the player chooses which to investigate and using what science equipment. The machine dispenses sample bottles which a science minion collects and uses to take samples from the object before bringing it back to the lab to use on the selected equipment. This will then succeed or fail depending on player choices and whether the minions were able to complete the jobs. This takes time, often a long time unless you have a lot of science minions, but it&#039;s long because those minions have to take an inventory object to a number of base objects and interact with them. <br><br>In EG2, it&#039;s long because it was long in EG1.

Lets start off with the Recon. Scouts and Recce are fine except for them having MMG Carrier (which in real life would only carry a machine gun team), the Humber Mk.3 having any transport capacity and them having the Daimler AC. In reality they had a mixture of Humber LRC III, Humber IV and some Humber IIIs.<br>Next the Infantry. It&#039;s mostly fine as its a loried rifle regiment. They are missing their universal carrier platoon which gives them a mobile force and they don&#039;t have their 2 inch mortar although they have that as a bren carrier instead. They are completely missing their pioneers who could be mounted in light trucks or lorries like the rest of the division. <br>Moving onto their tanks they should have a mix of Stuart IVs and Vs they currently only have Stuart IIIs. Their Churchill selection is okay but they should have Churchill III in the mix as well. They shouldn&#039;t have A30 Challengers or Sherman Vs I don&#039;t even know where they come from.<br>If we look at support and anti-tank now they don&#039;t have Dingos. They had more PIAT teams in reality and more 6pdrs and 17pdrs - the transport for them is also off with the 6pdrs using the Loyd Carrier only and the 17pdrs using a mix of M3 halftracks and Crusader gun tractors. The major flaw here is that they have M10 Wolverines only and should have at minimum a 50/50 ratio of Achilles.<br>Anti-air is a mess. They should have Bofors, Crusader AA Mk. 1 &amp; 2 and Bofors SP. Remove the Humber AA, Tri-polsten, CMP polsten and increase the rest significantly <br>Artillery is fine for the most part. All that needs to be added is Sexton and availability increased overall.<br>If you didn&#039;t have MUH DIVISIONS you could make a fairly decent approximation of the actual divison with the units in game.
