give you key units for a long time and I never cared about the nelfs as much as the other races. It&#039;s also annoying that the game will deny you key heroes in other campaigns like the horde not getting blademaster, which is really huge for them. It&#039;s also frustrating when you&#039;re forced to play late game as horde which is a faction with zero strong lategame units (tauren are trash).<br>That said, overall it&#039;s fantastic. The story isn&#039;t amazing but Arthas&#039; downfall is one of the best character arcs I&#039;ve seen in a video game. His decisions all make sense and it isn&#039;t until Northrend that he really goes too far but it&#039;s not difficult to see why he wanted to: he was so close to his goal and had sacrificed everything for it. The inventory and level system gives a sense of progression through the campaign and also rewards side objectives and exploration well.<br>TFT is more hero focused and I like that but it&#039;s clear that parts of it were rushed a bit.

I will do some basic &#039;how does the game function&#039; before going into detail. The basics of the game&#039;s format is:<br>1. Hex Grid<br>2. You control a small squad rather than one character, between 4 and 24 individuals<br>3. Your overall character points are split between all individuals (XP amount per battle being static then distributed between all there), so you can have 4 very strong guys or many weak guys<br><br>Here are some of just the general thoughts I had:<br>1. A character is not defined by a class, but is instead defined by a set of attributes. These attributes being:<br>Bulk, Nerve, Coordination, Reflex, and Memory<br>2. Characters are also defined by a number of perks, these are either acquired via trainers or via usage of related tools. Using a long rifle will eventually unlock marksman. Being the nozzle holder of a chemical lance eventually unlocks steely nerves.<br>3. All of a character&#039;s actual abilities come from equipment, if you have a sword equipped it has a number of abilities that are part of that sword. You are expected to have equipment that supply abilities in almost every slot.<br>4. Equipment has attribute requirements, and some have perk requirements in addition (higher end and specialized equipment)<br><br>The above is all pretty basic, the ideas I have to try an separate things are:<br>5. Linked equipment, meaning a single piece of equipment used by two individuals. Examples being a Rotary Gun, A Hog&#039;s Head Chemical Lance, etc.<br>6. Multiple individual units equip the pieces, then stand together and form a single &#039;Linked Unit&#039; (the guy holding the barrel of the chemical lance and the guy holding the sprayer). Once linked they move as a single larger unit taking up multiple hexes.<br>7. Different pieces of a linked equipment can have different requirements. Hog&#039;s Head chemical lance needs a high Bulk character to carry the barrel and a high Coordination and Nerve character to operate the sprayer.<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1668650122, "resto": 1262581}, {"no": 1262949, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)20:57:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1262948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1262948</a><br>8. Some linked equipment is too large to be carried in pieces, these are Deployable Equipment. An example being Heivel&#039;s Breath Cannon, a Rotary Gun, or a Ovic Blemish Sow. These are deployed in a location and units must go to it and then link together.<br>9. Because of how important larger Deployable Equipment and Linked Units are, encounters can be made harder/easier by limiting deploy locations and spacing out your own unit&#039;s deployment zones.<br>10. The game assumes you unequip/equip items depending on the situation and do so regularly in combat (inventory space per character is important)<br>11. The exception to this is grafted equipment, which can only be equipped/unequipped by a surgeon literally grafting/removing things from you. This are more powerful at the cost of being stuck in the slot.<br>12. It isn&#039;t only your weapon that will have abilities. A Herbalist&#039;s pouch will have abilities when equipped, same for a firearm, and etc. Some items have limited activations (a potion box has limited potions) and have refill actions. A Firearm is fairly simple to refill where as a potion box requires an action that can&#039;t be preformed in combat to refill. This makes someone carrying multiple potion boxes a viable option.<br><br>These are my thoughts on a tactical grid based RPG. Linked Equipment is meant to encourage multiple characters via allowing them to operate larger things despite being individually weaker. Singular characters are encouraged by high end equipment only being able to be used at high stats.
