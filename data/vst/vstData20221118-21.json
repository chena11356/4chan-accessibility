You can extend very quickly but you get a noticeable bandwidth malus for overcolonizing so pick your systems fairly carefully - in the beginning you should look for useful new places to hack from. Watch out for making a distant hack right at the start, especially if you play on spirals because pirates can spawn and trace it back to you. Try to hack from backdoors because you can make use of accelerator hacks from the get go in addition to putting them on the target. You can get the resources from special nodes by placing a beacon on them, but each one costs more than the last. This can be a HUGE early game buff if you can find industry or science - 50 extra on turn 3 or 4 is stupid desu (I like influence too because I can spam praise the minor factions to assimilate fast). Speaking of, assimilating minor factions replaces their colonies with sanctuaries which can be important new places to hack from. Pirates will be probably be the only ones who can see you and get you discovered so making friends with them can be a good idea. Also it&#039;s useful to try and get the academy fleet just so other empires can&#039;t use its lvl 3 detection to find you. Supremacy is very possible and very fast against the AI unless you play with 15 opponents or something - just get a sanctuary on their capitol. If you ever build something other than a probe ship against the AI, you&#039;re doing it wrong.

You soon get a feel for what hacks are possible so it becomes very rare to get traced back - and cancelling a hack is painful but often better imo. They can hack your sanctuaries to remove them but they have to have a target to hack, so it&#039;s not an option if they don&#039;t know you&#039;re there (unless they&#039;re also UC and are trying to settle a system you already have sanctuaries on in which case they find you). This means you don&#039;t need defence programs if you&#039;re sneaky enough unless you want to annoy people who are trying to hack past you or defend an allied system from hacks.

I will do some basic &#039;how does the game function&#039; before going into detail. The basics of the game&#039;s format is:<br>1. Hex Grid<br>2. You control a small squad rather than one character, between 4 and 24 individuals<br>3. Your overall character points are split between all individuals (XP amount per battle being static then distributed between all there), so you can have 4 very strong guys or many weak guys<br><br>Here are some of just the general thoughts I had:<br>1. A character is not defined by a class, but is instead defined by a set of attributes. These attributes being:<br>Bulk, Nerve, Coordination, Reflex, and Memory<br>2. Characters are also defined by a number of perks, these are either acquired via trainers or via usage of related tools. Using a long rifle will eventually unlock marksman. Being the nozzle holder of a chemical lance eventually unlocks steely nerves.<br>3. All of a character&#039;s actual abilities come from equipment, if you have a sword equipped it has a number of abilities that are part of that sword. You are expected to have equipment that supply abilities in almost every slot.<br>4. Equipment has attribute requirements, and some have perk requirements in addition (higher end and specialized equipment)<br><br>The above is all pretty basic, the ideas I have to try an separate things are:<br>5. Linked equipment, meaning a single piece of equipment used by two individuals. Examples being a Rotary Gun, A Hog&#039;s Head Chemical Lance, etc.<br>6. Multiple individual units equip the pieces, then stand together and form a single &#039;Linked Unit&#039; (the guy holding the barrel of the chemical lance and the guy holding the sprayer). Once linked they move as a single larger unit taking up multiple hexes.<br>7. Different pieces of a linked equipment can have different requirements. Hog&#039;s Head chemical lance needs a high Bulk character to carry the barrel and a high Coordination and Nerve character to operate the sprayer.<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1668650122, "resto": 1262581}, {"no": 1262949, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)20:57:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1262948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1262948</a><br>8. Some linked equipment is too large to be carried in pieces, these are Deployable Equipment. An example being Heivel&#039;s Breath Cannon, a Rotary Gun, or a Ovic Blemish Sow. These are deployed in a location and units must go to it and then link together.<br>9. Because of how important larger Deployable Equipment and Linked Units are, encounters can be made harder/easier by limiting deploy locations and spacing out your own unit&#039;s deployment zones.<br>10. The game assumes you unequip/equip items depending on the situation and do so regularly in combat (inventory space per character is important)<br>11. The exception to this is grafted equipment, which can only be equipped/unequipped by a surgeon literally grafting/removing things from you. This are more powerful at the cost of being stuck in the slot.<br>12. It isn&#039;t only your weapon that will have abilities. A Herbalist&#039;s pouch will have abilities when equipped, same for a firearm, and etc. Some items have limited activations (a potion box has limited potions) and have refill actions. A Firearm is fairly simple to refill where as a potion box requires an action that can&#039;t be preformed in combat to refill. This makes someone carrying multiple potion boxes a viable option.<br><br>These are my thoughts on a tactical grid based RPG. Linked Equipment is meant to encourage multiple characters via allowing them to operate larger things despite being individually weaker. Singular characters are encouraged by high end equipment only being able to be used at high stats. Both playstyles are viable.", "time": 1668650228, "resto": 1262581}, {"no": 1262955, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)21:19:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "IS IT MULTIPLAYER OR SINGLEPLAYER", "time": 1668651570, "resto": 1262581}, {"no": 1262958, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)21:28:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1262955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1262955</a><br>ARE YA CHINESE OR JAPANESE", "time": 1668652086, "resto": 1262581}, {"no": 1264056, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)05:27:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1262581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1262581</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/vg/catalog#s=agdg\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/vg/agdg</a>", "time": 1668767266, "resto": 1262581}], "last_modified": 1668767266}, {"no": 1263844, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)22:02:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why did it fail", "filename": "old-world-preinstalled-steamrip", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668740528193994, "time": 1668740528, "md5": "/9GsDDMFAEWbUkpepA4YYQ==", "fsize": 52691, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-did-it-fail", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 11, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 1263950, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)02:44:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1263844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1263844</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Limited exclusive on Epic</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mediocre game</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Absurd price for what it is</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Absurd price for 2 yo game</span>", "filename": "vlcsnap-2017-01-06-23h52m21s559", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 536, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1668757473140630, "time": 1668757473, "md5": "s4b0GRzw/eqazty7B7UuiQ==", "fsize": 461148, "resto": 1263844}, {"no": 1263973, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)03:34:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1263886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1263886</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not always intermarrying</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;her mother was Egyptian</span><br>Why would you lie about something anyone can check very easily?", "filename": "Ptolemies", "ext": ".png", "w": 783, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1668760491913835, "time": 1668760491, "md5": "yjvZUi427OjK376RrFbb4A==", "fsize": 30605, "resto": 1263844}, {"no": 1263982, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)03:52:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1263886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1263886</a><br><a href=\"#p1263973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1263973</a><br>kek. joined their dickskord and it&#039;s actually there", "time": 1668761555, "resto": 1263844}, {"no": 1263992, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)04:21:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1263844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1263844</a><br>Main issue is civs are just tiny differences between their family traits and 2 unique units.

Look at what paths you have (elements) and see what&#039;s good. Spells are relatively easy to evaluate, since mostly you just need some badass effects and then counters for whatever your enemy is fielding \u2013 but most spells are situational and chances are AI won&#039;t field anything that means you need those spells. You can ask here or on /domg/ what your bread and butter spells for a given nation are likely to be.<br><br>Mind you, you also ought to be good at building a pretender but that&#039;s a lot more in-depth and you kind of have to know what the nation is like.
