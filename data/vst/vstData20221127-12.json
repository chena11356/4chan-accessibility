A good grand strat UI, like Victoria 2&#039;s, actually puts a ton of information in front of the player, especially the topbar. This might seem bad, but it&#039;s actually really good. The thing is, all this information is required information. The player&#039;s going to have to learn and use it at some point, so the question is whether it will be easily accessible but very front-loaded, or if it will be buried deep in some sub-menu, hard to access, but there&#039;s less on screen at any point in time.<br><br>So if you go the latter option, yeah, it&#039;ll be a bit less intimidating to a new player, but it&#039;ll also be harder for them to learn because information is hidden, and it will be tremendously frustrating to use when the player wants information.

Consider the population button. 9.01M(4.32k) isn&#039;t really descriptive to glance at and not friendly for a new player. But once you know it means total pops and pop growth this month, it&#039;s really convenient and easy to read. You don&#039;t need a label saying that it&#039;s the population and growth, which would just take up space and, while useful for a new player, would be useless for most of the time a player is playing the game.

All workplaces provide all classes of jobs (except high tech due to a bug, get the fix, it may not be the only bugged blackhole). You simply cannot make everyone rich or middle class even if you somehow only have CO and I-HT.<br>If you were to gentrify &quot;too hard&quot;, you&#039;d need to have multiple cities and some tax fiddling to discourage/encourage where the gentry live and where the poors do.<br>Your main concern is that the gentry probably won&#039;t pay for education spam on their own, but that won&#039;t necessarily matter. High education just affects manufacturing/high-tech demand unless guides and wikis are lying. All you need is land value for R$$ and R$$$ to put down roots, which elementary schools help with if you care not for parks, but I don&#039;t know what medium and high density &quot;require&quot; if it&#039;s not simply more land value.<br><br>Again, you may simply just struggle for tax.

Every other mission in the game is between 30 seconds to four minutes and can be heavily reduced with just a few science minions. In EG2 the equivalent &#039;schemes&#039; stretch way beyond any of that. EG2 merges the passive actions for the World map used to get money, with the progression/loot-gain missions from EG1. Money is teleported directly into the vault, so no one is carrying briefcases back and forth. As the devs want the game to have similar pacing to the first one(and seemingly for players to have even less control over that pacing), it means the naturally-occurring wait times of EG1 are translated into EG2 as extended timers. <br><br>Research in EG1 requires science minions to survey the base in their spare-time(they need time not doing anything else for this to happen), where they check-off a list of items as potential candidates. What you build in your base determines the possibilities. They feed these candidates into the research machine and the player chooses which to investigate and using what science equipment. The machine dispenses sample bottles which a science minion collects and uses to take samples from the object before bringing it back to the lab to use on the selected equipment. This will then succeed or fail depending on player choices and whether the minions were able to complete the jobs. This takes time, often a long time unless you have a lot of science minions, but it&#039;s long because those minions have to take an inventory object to a number of base objects and interact with them. <br><br>In EG2, it&#039;s long because it was long in EG1.
