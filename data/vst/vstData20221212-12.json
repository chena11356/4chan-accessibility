The UC can kite endlessly with proper micro to stay out of range of fausts and, if upgraded with an mg or flamethrower, will require an ambush from shreks or be forced back by an AT gun. AP ammo isn&#039;t available until vet 1, so unless you are face charging into mgs it shouldn&#039;t even be an issue, and using it means axis has fewer munitions for snares or weapon upgrades which are the only things keeping grens viable when compared to allied inf. Unless the wher player is opting to start with double mgs and pioneers, you should at most be facing 1 pioneer, 1 gren, and a mg 42 team at the start of the round. All of them are fairly fragile if caught out of position and will likely arrive after you if you rush fuel.
