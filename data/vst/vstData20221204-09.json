Vicky 2 is summed up by &quot;great concept, terrible execution&quot; and that mantra holds true for basically every aspect of the game - from the Scramble for Africa to the Crisis system. <br>Most PDX games, the gimmick is that you start small and gradually build up. In CK2, players are told that characters above emperor are &quot;pointless&quot; to play, for example. But with Vicky, the game isn&#039;t worth playing unless you are one of the ~12 powers who is a GP or can easily become one (Japan, China, Mexico, CSA, Netherlands, Spain, etc.). Nations that are less powerful than that simply have so little control that you are at the mercy of AI superpowers. The game isn&#039;t long enough for a small nation like, say, Afghanistan to work its way up to the global superpower. <br>The main appeal of Vicky 2 is that it&#039;s a &quot;simulator&quot; for the 19th century. You&#039;re playing an alternate history, that sort of thing. However, the AI isn&#039;t good enough to do anything interesting most times. In reality, the Victorian era had many. many close calls where different powers nearly got colonies in weird places (Russia tried to colonize Hawaii, Belgium tried to colonize Texas after it beat Mexico, Russia tried to colonize Djibouti, etc.). You will never see Russian Hawaii even though it&#039;s actually historically plausible. <br>The game is overly rigid due to the limitations of the events/decision system for railroading. Like, powers regularly sold territory to one another at the time, but there is no system for dynamic sales. Instead, it&#039;s a handful of railroaded ones that occurred historically, like the Alaskan Purchase.<br>Great concept, terrible execution.", "time": 1669826745, "resto": 1264462}, {"no": 1273510, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)11:46:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1264467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1264467</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh history</span><br>Bro there are literally 4 or 5 max African nations in the base-game.", "time": 1669826811, "resto": 1264462}, {"no": 1273516, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)11:51:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1273510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1273510</a><br>You say that like it&#039;s a bad thing", "time": 1669827095, "resto": 1264462}, {"no": 1273601, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)14:22:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "well, there it is folks", "filename": "redditors", "ext": ".png", "w": 905, "h": 126, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 17, "tim": 1669836146512385, "time": 1669836146, "md5": "5VddEEVQZdtYFH9eR1P5RQ==", "fsize": 15532, "resto": 1264462}, {"no": 1273616, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)14:44:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1273601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1273601</a><br>Damn we live rent free in their heads", "time": 1669837499, "resto": 1264462}], "last_modified": 1669837499}]}, {"page": 10, "threads": [{"no": 1261958, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Laissez Faire isn\u2019t garba\u2026", "com": "Oh\u2026.
