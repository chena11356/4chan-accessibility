You can also use the map feature (the compose under the minimap), to see what political parties own which provinces. Parties can only own whole provinces (unless you only control part of one, in which case they own all that you own there).

You can&#039;t even build diagonal streets in the unmodded game, though you can build roads. Buildings don&#039;t grow in at angles, either, not unless you download ones that do.
