Once you have about 12 or more LS there is no way he can wall you out and you can just take out his production buildings.

It&#039;s about preventing migration.<br>Say you have a factory in state A. Capitalists will insist on expanding factory if it is profitable and reached at least 75% of employment. You can&#039;t axe such expansion, because that would require axing the whole factory. As a result, you have bigger factory which will soak extra workers and make goods. Great, right?<br>Except you have next to it state B, which could use some extra population from overcrowded state A. So you - or even capitalists themselves - build there factory. It soaks all the local population...<br>... but since state A is on essentially auto-expand, you will never get migration from it, since everything will be soaked by local factories, directly re-hiring from local RGO. You will never have actual unemployment due to the way how RGO size is calculated, either.<br>So in the end of the day, population is pretty much static, because even immigrants will choose a big, populous state first, joining local workforce. State B just won&#039;t gain population thanks to capitalist &quot;help&quot;.<br>This becomes especially an issue if you are playing as some big pop country, like China or (semi)unified India.
