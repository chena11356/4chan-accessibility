Gym numbers are just misleading cause in the real world you have to move the object as far as it needs to be moved. You are not moving it until your knees go below parallel. You are not moving it until you lockout. You are moving it to its destination and setting it down gently. I can tell you from moving anvils, generators, fire hydrants etc. that 200 lbs that does not want to be carried is much harder on your body than moving double that on a deadlift. Even for just the lift if we exclude the walk and carry. I&#039;ve strict pressed 185 overhead on a log bar. I got no sold by a ~120 lbs fire hydrant going overhead even with leg drive. <br><br>Also think about your scenarios. How many nattys do you see moving 600+ on squat and 450+ on bench lol. Pretty much everyone I&#039;ve worked with has also done gym lifts btw lol. How do you think I got this opinion? We compare gym numbers and then compare strength at work side by side. I get outdeadlifted pretty often. Those guys still can&#039;t pick up a 200+ lbs generator while I&#039;m walking with it.

Finasteride and Minoxidil.<br><br>Finasteride is a 5ar inhibitor. It&#039;s the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the hormone that kills your hair. DHT is useful in puberty but not really after that. The side effects come from the fact that you will have an excess of T (since less of it is being converted into DHT), so that T MIGHT aromatize into estrogen (woman hormone). However, 99% of healthy male bodies will simply adjust T production.<br><br>Minoxidil is a vasodilator. We don&#039;t really understand how it works, but it simulates hair growth. Topical is approved for hair growth, DO NOT take oral minoxidil.<br><br>Imagine hair loss is like a leaky bucket with a hole in the bottom. Finasteride covers the hole. Minoxidil pours in more water. Any other retard gay shit like scalp massages or peppermint oil is the equivalent of painting the bucket.<br><br>Feel free to ask me anything.

I did and I&#039;ve had to work quite hard at fixing it and making it sound better.<br>Otherwise it could just be that people feel like you are too intense for a first encounter. It&#039;s one of those things everyone just expects you to randomly know and understand but will never mention it. In order to come off as more laid-back, one of the first things you should do is literally lean back. I think a lot of the time if you concentrate on e.g. maintaining eye contact and being engaged, you might lean forward and cramp their space making them feel uncomfortable (even if you are still a good distance away from them). I think if you maintain eye contact but appear more relaxed it could be helpful. Also, perhaps try for fewer (or sparser) questions. By that I mean that your script seems to be predominantly questions. While people (girls especially) love to talk about themselves, they don&#039;t want it to feel like an interrogation. I&#039;ve found that by mentioning something brief about myself and then either asking her a question or letting her interject, it makes her more willing to participate. It might be good to update your script to include a couple tidbits about yourself that you can mention.<br>Another thing that I do is to think about good conversationalists whom I know and think about the way they talk. I try to channel them when I talk and I&#039;ve honestly found it is helpful. I think it will put you in a mindset that is more amicable and by having your mind in that place, you will exhibit this to others.<br><br>Of course, I am only guessing, but if any of these are pertinent to you, then I hope it comes in handy.", "time": 1671359777, "resto": 69281810}, {"no": 69296155, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:43:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69281810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69281810</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; join gym</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; notice the gym rapist immediately</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; notices that i am also a gym rapist</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; biggest looking guys there</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; greet one another, nod as we pass</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; say our farewells</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; never speak a word otherwise</span><br>It&#039;s been like this for the last five months, how do I break the ice", "time": 1671363817, "resto": 69281810}, {"no": 69296216, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69281837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69281837</a><br>was too self hating for any homecoming shit<br>skipped prom to hit on a girl who was getting her ged and mcdonalds with me.<br>i miss her alot", "time": 1671364436, "resto": 69281810}, {"no": 69296231, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:57:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69296155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69296155</a><br>Rape him before he rapes you.

Glucose is a sugar, and sugar due to it&#039;s reactiveness and simplicity can form a chain. Now, said chain can be formed in two possible ways, stable and unstable. The stable way is really fucking tough, to the point it forms resilient structures, kinda like keratins, which are really tough. These structures are called fibers, and are so stable they need a special enzyme to be broken down in it&#039;s smaller glucoses. The unstable way of stacking glucose is glucogen. It&#039;s a single chain of glucoses, all stacked in a way which strips them of being tpugh but makes them more readily availible. Can also be stacked as starch, which is formed like branches.<br>Now, I bet you are familiar with the notion that excess sugar is transformed into saturated lipidic acids which are then stored under the skin. The cow, gorilla, and every herbivore does the same thing as the human does but with a different source of sugar. Now, breaking down plant fibers is no easy task and it takes a lot of time and energy, due to it being so stable. Cows are also called rumiants, because they have this sack in their mouths to store half eaten pasture to chewing on it to break it down as much as possible so it&#039;s more easily digestible. They take hours chewing on that shit, that&#039;s how hard is to metabolically extract glucose from plant fibers.", "time": 1671359238, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295654, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:27:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69295626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69295626</a><br>post body", "time": 1671359266, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295665, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:30:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition states that &#039;vegan diets have generally been discouraged during complementary feeding&#039; because &#039;the risks of failing to follow advice [for supplementation] are severe, including irreversible cognitive damage from vitamin B12 deficiency, and death&#039;</span><br>https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Fullt<wbr>ext/2017/01000/Complementary_Feedin<wbr>g__A_Position_Paper_by_the.21.aspx", "time": 1671359407, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295666, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69295066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69295066</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;has a saggital crest bone in their skull which looks like a Mohawk which ligaments and muscles attach to for a protective layer around the top of their skull and a bite force of 2000lbs</span>", "time": 1671359421, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295669, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:31:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The German Nutrition Society &#039;does not recommend a vegan diet for pregnant women, lactating women, infants, children or adolescents&#039; as it is &#039;difficult or impossible to attain an adequate supply of some nutrients&#039;</span><br>https://www.ernaehrungs-umschau.de/<wbr>fileadmin/Ernaehrungs-Umschau/pdfs/<wbr>pdf_2016/04_16/EU04_2016_Special_DG<wbr>E_eng_final.pdf", "time": 1671359471, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295679, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:32:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The German society for Pediatrics and Nutrition Science states that &#039;a vegan diet is disadvised during all periods with intense growth and development&#039; and warns that &#039;children on pure vegan diet need ongoing elaborate dietary strategies and continuous supplementation at any age, similar to nutritional management in children with metabolic disorders&#039;</span><br>https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/<wbr>29471576", "time": 1671359532, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295694, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:34:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Swiss Federal Commission for Nutrition does not recommend a vegan diet for pregant and lactating women infants, toddlers, adolescents, and elderly or people with debilitating diseases</span><br>https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/en/hom<wbr>e/das-blv/organisation/kommissionen<wbr>/eek/vor-und-nachteile-vegane-ernae<wbr>hrung.html", "time": 1671359656, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295701, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:35:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69295640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69295640</a><br>Yes it is, and the 0.05% is not the actual converstion rate<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/129<wbr>36959/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2-5% for DHA</span><br>and this study says<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/963<wbr>7947/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.8% for DHA</span><br>So it depends, so yes the post <a href=\"#p69295595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69295595</a> is correct", "time": 1671359710, "resto": 69295066}, {"no": 69295703, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)05:35:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Belgian Superior Health Council warns for a risk of various nutrient deficiencies (protein, EPA/DHA, vit D and B12, Fe, Zn, I, Ca), increasing with dietary restrictiveness.

Their lack of core moral strength thus produces a competition in not &#039;being&#039; something but &#039;having&#039; something. Even the badges they put on themselves, as in musician, DJ, skater, filmmaker, sporty person are somehow claimed with a fierceness as if they are an end product that must align with the general idea of what that lifestyle is, not as something that is to be enjoyed for the sake of itself and explored because it brings inner peace..As if a personaity itself is a tool in achieving more material possessions and a higher standing in society. I am generalizing here but I am afraid it is like that, Shallownes indeed idk. Life is a walk in the park for them yet they are completely oblivious to all but self. This world and this way of operating is not sustainable.

I went from your exact weight and down to 75. However it took me two years, it could have been done in a much shorter timespan but the hardest part is being disciplined. <br><br>What is important for you to understand is the math. 1 kg of fat is 7700 calories. For every day you fast, you lose around 2000 calories worth of fat. That means in a week, if you don&#039;t exercise, your loss is 2 kg of fat. You can lose 36 kg of fat in that time. You currently have 52 kg of fat if we assume your BMI is 45. Imo it is higher than 50. Somewhere between 52-55. You should be at around 50-55 kg when you are lean-ish. The ultimate goal should be to lose 55-60 kg. I know it sounds low, but it is true.<br><br>To answer your question: No, it is not possible for you to lose that weight by 3-4 day rolling fasts without exercise in 18 weeks. You have to change your way of thinking, it took you a lot of time to gain all of this weight. <br><br>50 kg is 385.000 calories. If you are in a 1000 calorie deficit a day, you can lose that weight in a year. That is a more realistic and OPTIMISTIC time-frame. You need new habits, fasting will be a very useful tool for you, but you need to move your body as well. Fasting is tough, you can manage 3-4 days, be happy, and then you binge on crap because &quot;I earned the deficit&quot;. Then you fall into a slump, get back on the fasting-train, and the cycle repeats itself. Start moving. The act of fasting is incredibly boring if you are not active. Sitting at home all day is torture while fasting, and often we eat because we are bored. Do you see the pattern? You need to fill the void with something else. <br><br>Also, I think it would be healthy for you to realize the work required to exercise away 500 calories. A 100g bar of Snickers is 500 calories. 2 McDonalds plain cheeseburgers are 600 calories (265 per 100g, 300 in one).Tomorrow, go for a walk. 6.5 kilometers in 90 min is your goal.

Yesterday I moved about ~7km in a 12 hour shift. Which doesn&#039;t include moving, lifting and rolling ~64kg+ of weight around. I had a very light shift, when most days it&#039;s ~13km. <br><br>The problem is, I only do this 3 days a week. I don&#039;t like eating during those days because I do have either a fibre problem, or IBS which makes me gassy. So there&#039;s normally going to be a fast between Thursday starting at midnight to Monday or Tuesday. Sadly, I broke that today because of my weak will. <br><br>I do agree with you, I need to get better hobbies during my days off, but I&#039;m also thinking of adding another day consistently to my schedule to keep my mind going. I&#039;m pretty much a NEET 4/7 days of the week that jerks off online. I am trying to fill my off days with things to move and do, but I have a problem figuring out what to do. Like I know I could be walking my dogs a lot more too to add movement in. I do eventually want to be able to keep a consistent ~15km/day as my normal though with my rest days as Saturday only. <br><br>My diet from now on is mostly-strictly Keto, and today as a cheat day I regretted as soon as I started eating. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be doing that again any time soon. I actually hurt my stomach Wednesday because of how quickly I ate after the 3 day fast! <br><br>The mindset I&#039;m trying to achieve right now is, &quot;I only have to maintain this strict regime for 6 months, then I will be free. What is 6 months when I have another hopefully 60 years to live?&quot;<br><br>50kg is the lowest I think before it gets too low for my height. I&#039;m also a man, which I wouldn&#039;t be apposed to, but I set ~60kg as a decent starting point to even get to that. <br><br>I do want to start going to the gym, but I have no foundation... Or even friends to go with to teach me... I know the biggest part is to just go and mess around. Rowing seems really cool.

Those days contribute a massive amount to your weight-loss and general health. I think you touched on something important, walking your dogs. Walking them does something great for the both of you. Start with doing something you don&#039;t want to do on those 4/7 days. You can jerk off all day, BUT only if you walk them for an hour. The rest of the day you can be a degenerate with a clean conscience. Try to do it early in the day, often this will snowball you into doing other things. <br><br>Don&#039;t think too much about the gym just yet, I recommend getting a kettle-bell. You can do a lot of things with that to learn basic lifts such as squats and deadlifts. Bench-pressing is pointless, do push-ups. For core-strength you can do planks. If you have something to hang a pull-up bar from at home, get one. Combined you have a complete work-out hitting everything you need. I went to the gym for ages, but quit and now these items + a yoga mat and gym-rings give me everything I need. It is every easy to fall into the &quot;I just need...&quot; mentality, I am a frequent victim of it myself. &quot;Oh I need need to do xxx, then I can start...&quot;.

You seem like you got everything you need to conquer this challenge brother, I believe in you, remember, it isn&#039;t a sprint, it is a daily marathon.

The only final tip I can give is that there will be days or weeks where you want to give up and slip back into the former lifestyle. This will happen, no way around it, so find a way to make this the 1# priority, no matter what. So even when you fall off the wagon for a few days or weeks, you dont give up. It is a setback, but not a loss. For me it went periodically. I did the first 20 kilos with great motivation, then it became a slugfest for a while from 97-90. (it is often a lot of motivation in getting below a big 10&#039; kg, and now you see a new 9 staring at you, and you get stuck there for a while).I got stuck at 87-89 for a while due to a injury. The next 10 kilos came in 3 months down to 79. In this whole time I hiked 3 times a week, for 15 km, 1 calories each time.

I presented with significantly raised ketones (should be below 2, mine were 7.1) and blood sugars of 26.8 (should be between 4 and 7). So I was in hospital for about a week on IV Insulin, Potassium, Saline, Dextrose etc. Potassium was depleted by the insulin therapy so I was at high risk of heart attack that whole time too. <br><br>I was diagnosed with Diabetes (unknown type, still awaiting antibody test result) but I was apparently producing a LOT of C-peptide still so its probably type 2 especially since its rare to be diagnosed with type 1 at age 31 but they cant confirm until antibody result. I was prescribed insulin (Levemir - basal dose 20u 2x a day 12hr gap; NovoRapid - 10u per meal) for the time being until they know which &#039;beetus I have. <br><br>Rather than the full shebang prescribed to me, I have been closely monitoring my blood glucose and taking a bit less (usually 18u Levemir a time and 6u NovoRapid per meal) especially when I know I am hardly eating any carbs, as I don&#039;t want to increase my insulin resistance if I can avoid it.<br><br>So here&#039;s the thing. Since getting back from hospital I have completely changed my diet. I avoid carbs as much as possible (always less than 100g a day, but often less than 50g) - I eat only whole cuts of meat (steak, chicken, turkey, pork etc) and fish (mackrel, salmon, sardines, cod) and TONS of vegetables. I eat cheese like Baybybel and Olives and some occasional fruit and dark chocate never less than 85% cocoa. <br><br>I&#039;ve also lost 15kg (Mostly in hospital and the acidosis which literally melted fat off me in realtime) + more active<br><br>Literally every time I take my blood sugar now, it is completely normal.<br><br>But, I also have had about 4 days since diagnosis where I have ate like I used to before diabetes and ITS EXACTLY THE SAME.
