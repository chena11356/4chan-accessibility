Her rugby sized forearms finally collide with her biceps at a 60 degree angle.

Even healthy foods like chicken and nuts have small amounts of saturated fat, though much less than the amounts found in beef, cheese, and ice cream. Saturated fat is mainly found in animal foods, but a few plant foods are also high in saturated fats, such as coconut, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Though decades of dietary advice (13, 14) suggested saturated fat was harmful, in recent years that idea has begun to evolve. Several studies suggest that eating diets high in saturated fat do not raise the risk of heart disease, with one report analyzing the findings of 21 studies that followed 350,000 people for up to 23 years.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The overarching message is that cutting back on saturated fat can be good for health if people replace saturated fat with good fats, especially, polyunsaturated fats. (1, 15, 22) Eating good fats in place of saturated fat lowers the \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, and it improves the ratio of total cholesterol to \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, lowering the risk of heart disease.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eating good fats in place of saturated fat can also help prevent insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. (16) So while saturated fat may not be as harmful as once thought, evidence clearly shows that unsaturated fat remains the healthiest type of fat.</span><br>Why is eating food so fucking confusing?!", "filename": "311155699_195767522822545_5388992225984920112_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 914, "tn_w": 196, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1669628182625000, "time": 1669628182, "md5": "pidRNtZtamViRTFdWebmqw==", "fsize": 44872, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "all-foods-containing-fat-have-a-mix-of-specific", "replies": 16, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 11, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 69089367, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)05:21:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69089318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69089318</a><br>Get lean cuts.<br><br><a href=\"#p69089327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69089327</a><br>Ruminants hydrogenate fats in their stomach, unlike chicken and pigs.<br>So the elevation of PUFA in cow fat is minor even on a corn diet.<br>So if you&#039;re a poorfag it&#039;s still better to get non-grass fed than chicken or pork.", "time": 1669630865, "resto": 69089163}, {"no": 69089372, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)05:22:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69089327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69089327</a><br>like anywhere.

This is why men, especially successful ones tend to lean conservative because its an entire mindset of fuck you I don&#039;t need anyone else. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Quit fuckin whining, life is hard and sucks for a bit but the reward at the end is what makes it all worth it. Treat others how you want to be treated. Help others. Lend a hand to a friend. Work your ass off, not necessarily at work since there is political crap there and it can be a waste of time but maximize your time and work on improving your home, your body, making more money. Really being fit, rich, and not being a complete autist is all you need to be succesful. If you don&#039;t desire a family that thats fine but don&#039;t be a douchebag. Make sure your home is taken care of you are making money and travelling and still having steady sex. Integrity is about being a good person and doing the right thing when no one else is around. You really need to look at society like a video game or something and say I&#039;m not going to lose. You need to have a compteitive spirit to be better than everyone else. That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean having the biggest house and all that but just have your shit together and have a good reputation is a high character individual who is a fun guy and takes care of his family. Be the man the women talk about as ideal. Try to learn something and get better every day at life. Don&#039;t engage in social media, don&#039;t watch degenerate porn like trannys and pee pee, don&#039;t be completely a cheap fuck but don&#039;t piss your money away. Make wise investments, help your neighbor, learn to cook and clean and fix shit. Go hunting and fishing. Those days where you&#039;re tired and unmotivated FORCE yourself to go to the gym and do 10 miles/40 minutes on the bike. Really you just have to take the no excuses I&#039;m gunna be the best attitude.", "time": 1669644824, "resto": 69090018}, {"no": 69090609, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)09:14:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69090018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69090018</a><br>Let me give you some personal insight on the matter.<br><br>I&#039;ve been with my wife for 10 years now. We met in high school, and I got her pregnant.<br>She is and always has been a lazy person and a shit cook. I wouldn&#039;t even mind eating shit food if she at least made it on time. But she rarely did.<br><br>We&#039;d get into screaming arguments constantly about how lazy and worthless she was. I felt like an asshole for it, but goddamn she was a real piece of work. The only reason I dealt with all this was for the kids, and also because the sex is great.<br><br>But one night, I got fed up. Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it.
