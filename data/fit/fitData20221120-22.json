Try to stick to lean protein and green vegetables.<br>Eat a lot of protein. 0.72g per lb of goal lean body mass.<br>Doing cardio, even just walking, will improve your health. There is no such thing as a healthy fat heart, but you can offset the risks.<br>Lifting weights will keep and gain muscle mass and burn fat much quicker.

A lot of what goes into dog food is meat from the livestock industry that is diseased, rancid, rotting or otherwise unfit for human consumption, which is subsequently sterilized at high heat and turned into a homogeneous mass that has many names, including &quot;meal&quot;. Think meat with tumors, meat riddled with pus and cysts, rotting meat that cannot be sold for human consumption, or animals/body parts that don&#039;t really have a market among human consumers, like horses and bodyparts like the colon. You might just be getting a significant percentage of normal muscle meat that was simply too infected, small, cancerous, diseased, or rotten to sell to humans--- you have no guarantee you&#039;re actually getting much organ meat.<br><br>And then you have fillers that couldn&#039;t be included in more-regulated human foods, which CAN be used for less-regulated animal food and extend the product while having higher contaminants/ poor nutrition / no nutritional value at all, and which wreak havoc on your body and digestive tract. In fact, many industrially-produced dog foods like this notoriously make dogs constipated or give them digestive issues because the filler doesn&#039;t absorb and it makes them have to poop a lot more than they would with their natural diet. And because they don&#039;t have much nutritional value, dogs get hungry a lot faster after eating than if you just fed them whole meats/foods. <br><br>It&#039;s dog food because it is lower quality in pretty much every conceivable axis of consideration--- contaminants, fillers, quality of the input meat, nutritional value, etc. I know you&#039;re trolling with this post but if you weren&#039;t, you&#039;d probably just be hilariously pranking yourself and dying a lot younger", "time": 1668997250, "resto": 69014804}, {"no": 69017969, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:52:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69014824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69014824</a><br>Fpbp", "time": 1668999172, "resto": 69014804}], "last_modified": 1668999172}, {"no": 69012793, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)12:02:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it a good idea to lift if the body is still kinda sore from the last session?

During the Battle of Monte Cassino, Wojtek helped his unit to convey ammunition by carrying 100-pound (45 kg) crates of 25-pound artillery shells, never dropping any of them.
