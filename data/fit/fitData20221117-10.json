All of the hard work/money spent in the gym and on improving my looks, I\u2019ve gone from a 2 to 3, possibly a 4. I am a subhuman, my facial bones are recessed due to a mix of genetics and poor childhood lifestyle.

But i wont lie, the primary reason i began this journey was to increase my SMV and find myself a female. The results simply are not there. I am still invisible to women, and i still occasionally get those stink-eyed looks that you get when you\u2019re a shit ugly guy. I\u2019m still unfuckable. I dont blame women for not wanting me, I wouldn\u2019t want me if i were a women who could do better. It\u2019s beyond that, it\u2019s fine that you don\u2019t find me attractive, but the majority young women will treat you as if you\u2019re less than human when you\u2019re an ugly guy, you are treated with hostility if you even attempt to speak to them.
