The answer is probably yes, but I was still gravitated towards 4chan because it fulfilled so many social needs.<br>My only advice to young men on this board is to leave this place or at least severely cut the amount of time you spend here. 4chan is a worse type of mind-poison than tiktok or twitter in how it corrupts your perception of reality", "time": 1670950965, "resto": 69241043}, {"no": 69245544, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:03:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69245371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69245371</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blood somehow comes from fat in this retard&#039;s mind</span><br>anon truly you could use some blood flow to the brain, I suggest you fatten up a little bit.

Figure out what the recommended dosage is for the strain your going to pick up is, first and foremost. Psychedelic mushrooms are usually not rough in my experience but I&#039;ve always been recommended to be in a good mindset when you take them, as your mental state can alter the effects(happy drunk vs sad drunk). Take a recommended dose, especially to start off with. I don&#039;t recommend for your first time mixing it with any other mind altering effects( alcohol or marijuana). Have a safe area to be in since you may not be in your right mind most likely. I would recommend having an at least mostly sober person with you or to do this as a group activity with a babysitter.

Set referring to mindset and setting referring to the location/time of day/company. You do not seem to be in a great mindset, psychedelics will only enhance this and it will most likely give you a bad trip. As for setting if you feel trapped in your room that feeling will also only be enhanced by the truffles. I know this first hand, truffles fucked me up for almost two years because I did them while very stressed and depressed. I won\u2019t say you cannot ever do them or that they won\u2019t help you in some way. I am just saying this is maybe not the right time. Try to fix these things first, you don\u2019t have to completely fix them just make it so you feel good enough to take them.

My kids are pretty young (4, 3, and 1) and so we were hanging out near the kiddie pool, but my oldest knows how to swim so we were going in the bigger pool for little bits at a time. On this day in particular the bigger pool was pretty deserted. He had a little pool ball we were tossing around and playing with. When we got out we left the toys in the pool since we were going to go back in and could collect them later. Two swarthy teenagers with dreadlocks come wandering in and hop into the pool which surprised me at first, they were pretty confident about jumping in there but I realized later it was only because they knew that end of the pool was shallow enough to stand.<br><br>So they pick up the ball we had left in the pool and start tossing it back and forth. I think alright, no harm in that, it&#039;s just floating in there, but I keep an eye on them so they don&#039;t...you know...leave with it or &quot;borrow&quot; it (permanently) as their kind like to say. Eventually they toss it and it tips off the one kid&#039;s hand and goes flying into the center of the deep end. The kids start arguing about whose fault it was and hop out of the pool. They walk over to the edge of the deep end but they&#039;re scared to go in the water. I start chuckling to myself as I realize that this whole time they&#039;ve been unable to swim (at a pool without a lifeguard on duty which is consistent with what I&#039;ve noted of their race&#039;s risk vs reward and danger assessment abilities). So they start splashing around at it, trying to get it to drift over to the side but it&#039;s going nowhere.<br><br>After a few minutes I got up with my 4 year old, walked over and told him to hop in and grab our ball. Blackies watched as a blonde/blue eyed white 4 year old without a second thought took a running leap into the water, swam with ease out to the ball, and returned to the ladder.", "time": 1670996956, "resto": 69251791}, {"no": 69252198, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:16:16", "name": "I hate women", "com": "<a href=\"#p69252031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69252031</a><br>not a word", "time": 1670998576, "resto": 69251791}, {"no": 69252377, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:54:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69251809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69251809</a><br><br>KEK based", "filename": "Bearland", "ext": ".png", "w": 1500, "h": 1647, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671000872549803, "time": 1671000872, "md5": "z9FJyD+RRHxTOZM23RnZig==", "fsize": 1709866, "resto": 69251791}, {"no": 69252384, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:56:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69251791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69251791</a><br>Reminder than black guys look like that naturally, its their DYEL.

But with women it really fucks them up in how collagen is produced it seems. I think because of the differences in collagen formulation between the sexes. In men it&#039;s like criss-cross in how it forms, in women more like straight lines.

Then I start to kiss her ass and just like my hands, I start to circle the crack, led by my tongue. She knows what\u2019s coming next but cannot wait any further. With haste she reaches around with both hands and pulls her ass cheeks apart showing off her pink little stink-hole. I have a quick sniff of the aroma then I slurp the hole and taste her most intimate part. I feel the pink anus pucker for me as she begs my tongue to go deeper. I fuck her ass with my tongue until she cums and her anus is clean. Then, we lie next to each other, kissing each other while smelling and tasting her butt on my lips.", "time": 1671014602, "resto": 69250226}, {"no": 69253604, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:44:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69253590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69253590</a><br>It&#039;s not word salad, retard.

All these cycles, not really maintenance, gave something new visually. It just builds on top of each other and becomes real.

We either do what Reactionaries want and go back int time and devolve technologically or we choose the Third Political Position (Fascism was Third Position, but this time a new Third Position doesn&#039;t have to be Fascism). We apply Eugenics. We apply different standards to medicine and how to save a life. Not life itself should be valued, but the quality of life. We allow full screenings of the embryo, before birth and educate parents on their choices. Allow free terminations and financial compensation for degenerate life. Humane forms of ending a suffering dysgenic life through euthanasia.<br><br>Also very important is to stop the dynamic of women being able to access a replacement-husband through the collective or still having the right to access a man&#039;s resources without his consent (like through alimony and divorce).<br>So the best way to do this is to keep the current life partnerships like we have, but in addition to that offer a &quot;traditional marriage&quot;.

If it stems from being insecure about being a woman, make sure she knows that there are things only women can do and that being able to depend on men is a privilege. There is absolutely no shame in being the home caretaker. In fact that role should be celebrated. As a priority avoid anything that might overload the competitive tick that tomboys already have. Have fun and avoid having her exposed to mockery for lacking in male traits like strength, a high paying career, etc. This is where I find tomboys always get pushed over the edge into feeling they need to be men to compete.<br><br>I&#039;ve had one FtM tomboy recover with the process above. Basically getting her to realize that being a woman is a win in its own ways and she can have fun doing activities with guys without feeling she needs to be a man. Having sex also helps if you can get to the relationship route. But &quot;I can fix her&quot; is a dangerous mindset too.

In the US, the bottom-tier is a joke and the top-tier shits on the rest of the world. Part of the issue in the US is that everyone goes to university, even people who really shouldn&#039;t and are too dumb, and that dumbs down the experience and level. At top US schools, your peers are all from the top ~10th percentile, and so the level is immediately higher. That makes a big difference.
