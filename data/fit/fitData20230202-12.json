Usually involves clenching PC muscles right at the point of orgasm to avoid ejaculation. The idea is that you will still &quot;orgasm&quot; but not &quot;cum&quot;, so you&#039;ll still be hard and can go another round.

Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it.

Most likely you have a weak core like other anons have already said if there&#039;s no bump, so your surrounding muscles and flexors are required to take the slack which creates strain and tightens the muscle. This is worsened by any muscular asymmetry which you probably have. I found that a few things worked:<br>1. Rest. You need to leave the muscle alone. I wasted more than a year thinking the solution was to just wait until the pain went away before working on tbe muscle to strengthen it. Even after the pain goes away, it will return if you haven&#039;t resolved the root causes.<br>2. Asymmetry. If you have one foot flatter than the other, one knee more knocked, one leg more loose at the hip, it will result in your core working overtime to stabilise. Be aware of this when lifting and correct it.<br>3. Surrounding tissue. Work your obliques and other surrounding muscle, this added strength will lessen the strength required from the point of pain.<br>4. Go slow. Finally you can work on strengthening the abs so they don&#039;t strain again. It&#039;s a touch and go process, start light with planks and see how you feel the next day. If it hurts, do less.

We studied two explanations for this apparent resistance to diet--low total energy expenditure and underreporting of caloric intake--in 224 consecutive obese subjects presenting for treatment. Group 1 consisted of nine women and one man with a history of diet resistance in whom we evaluated total energy expenditure and its main thermogenic components and actual energy intake for 14 days by indirect calorimetry and analysis of body composition.

Low energy expenditure was thus excluded as a mechanism of self-reported diet resistance. In contrast, the subjects in group 1 underreported their actual food intake by an average (+/- SD) of 47 +/- 16 percent and overreported their physical activity by 51 +/- 75 percent. Although the subjects in group 1 had no distinct psychopathologic characteristics, they perceived a genetic cause for their obesity, used thyroid medication at a high frequency, and described their eating behavior as relatively normal (all P &lt; 0.05 as compared with group 2).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conclusions: The failure of some obese subjects to lose weight while eating a diet they report as low in calories is due to an energy intake substantially higher than reported and an overestimation of physical activity, not to an abnormality in thermogenesis.</span>", "time": 1675193245, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69796043, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)14:27:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Believing women what women say.. lol you always keep falling for it retard.

For everyone that doesn&#039;t know, TDEE isn&#039;t static. It&#039;s dynamic. Most of your calorie burning comes from your thermogenesis. That is the #1 way that calories are burned in the body. After that, you have a few other noteworthy processes such as your level of thinking and the amount of movement that you do, but compared to keeping your body at the right temperature, these processes are near negligible. If you consume less calories than your maintenance, you will burn less calories as a result if you continue to restrict calories. This will make you lethargic and far less twitchy, significantly or entirely eliminating the calories burned from movement if you feel like such shit that you don&#039;t even want to get up and move around. Most calories are not burned by movement though. If you restrict your calories and you do it long enough, your core body temperature will fall and you will be unable to feel warm even if you are in multiple layers of clothing in the summer. The amount of calories you cut is directly proportional to the amount of TDEE you lose. Cutting at 50% will reduce TDEE by 50% if you do it long enough. The hormones affect how drastic of a cut on your TDEE your body does. For a young healthy virile male, you may not lose any TDEE at all and you may continue to burn the same amount of calories as you were consuming before. If you&#039;re an unhealthy old hag, you might fuck yourself up from doing calorie restriction too hard and reduce your metabolic activity by 50% to compensate. Unironically, the answer to this dilemma is to fast. It literally works for everyone and solves all of the hormonal issues associated with calorie restriction that people face while still consuming food. It&#039;s mostly an insulin and sexual hormone issue. 2 things that are fucked up in nearly every single person in the West due to diet and life choices", "filename": "MegaChad here, contacting you through carrier pigeon", "ext": ".png", "w": 503, "h": 337, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675215447450850, "time": 1675215447, "md5": "z3ym8A/bicPHSMtmoiJbXw==", "fsize": 299827, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800166, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:40:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69798825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69798825</a><br>could be water", "time": 1675215614, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800215, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:45:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800143</a><br>tldr: CICO is a lie<br>eat less and move more is a lie", "time": 1675215927, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800224, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800215</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CICO is a lie</span><br>impossible<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eat less and move more is a lie</span><br>gotta be more specific than that for that statement to have any meaning", "time": 1675215981, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800232, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:46:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800224</a><br><a href=\"#p69800143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800143</a>", "time": 1675216012, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800252, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:47:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800232</a><br>Same person, dingus", "filename": "It&#039;s Me, Retard", "ext": ".png", "w": 443, "h": 104, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 29, "tim": 1675216079887222, "time": 1675216079, "md5": "s207mngFlZqoEmpGYiGkIQ==", "fsize": 4973, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800302, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:53:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800113</a><br>180cm 98kg atm", "time": 1675216395, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800833, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:40:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800302</a><br>180cm and 87kg here, I can&#039;t lose weight at all.<br><br>I ate 1500 calories total (3 boiled eggs/day) in the last week and lost nothing.", "time": 1675219250, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800841, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:41:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "When your metabolism slows that much, sure.

On February 14th, I am going to start the old school diet of 36 eggs a day, for 8 weeks. According to vince gironda, an old school bodybuilder, and the lifters that he took under his wing back in the day, eating 36 eggs a day gives you the same effect as a cycle of Dianabol (Metandienone). I will be getting blood work done before and after to see what happens to my test levels. Also gonna get my lipids checked before and after, to see if eating all these eggs has any effect on my cholesterol. <br><br>I will be treating this as a steroid cycle. I will be buying some aromasin from my buddy just in the absolute worst case that doing this brings the same side effects as Dianabol. If I have any sides such as spicy nipples, lactation, bloating, high bp, etc. i will get my e2 and prolactin checked (results come back in less than 24 hours) and then deploy the aromasin accordingly. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t get to this stage, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. I took some physique pics and I\u2019ll continue to document my progress during and after this experiment. Let me reiterate, this is a WORST CASE SCENARIO. I\u2019m not gonna be taking asin from the get go. <br><br>I will still eat carbs for energy in training.
