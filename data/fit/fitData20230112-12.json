I&#039;d recommend switching to a 4 day per week program and using a totally different rep range. If you&#039;ve been using good old 8-12 you&#039;ll be really sensitive to high reps as an example.

If so can you recommend a ratio? Thanks.</span><br>Not inherently for the 19nor, I am not familiar with the DHT/Prolactin interaction because I myself never have prolactin related issues. I would assume it offers some benefit but that is a total guess. I personally run a DHT derivative because it allows me to push test a little higher once added in, without needing a true AI. I can go from about 1g test/wk without AI with no mast in a stack, and after adding mast can bump that to 1.2-1.4 without issue. Trying to run 1.2-1.4 test otherwise gives me god awful side effects. As for ratios, I don&#039;t think ratios are as important as guys make them out to be. Actually let me rephrase that, they are important, but the individual variability is so wild with ratios that some guys might be fine running low test crazy high 19nor, others might have the worst time of their life. My advice for adding anything is always to start reasonably low (for yoru stack, lets say 200 or 300mg) and work up. <br><a href=\"#p69561206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69561206</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bruh what&#039;s your bf?</span><br>in offseason I try to keep around 17% tops, I put on weight pretty easily in general so I run my bodyfat a little higher than most guys like to keep it around 15% or else I tend to cut my offseason too short.

Usually wraps her legs around me and says \u201cfuck a baby into me\u201d or \u201cmake me pregnant you little bitch\u201d. We have done everything under the sun with each other. Fuck in public, handjobs foot jobs titjobs, anal, facial, make her squirt, watch each other masterbate, finger her asshole, lick assholes, suck on her tits for like 38 minutes, milk me mommy, use toys, etc. nothing better than cumming in a woman\u2019s pussy or mouth and she keeps sucking. Feeling your cock just explode inside her. <br><br>I honestly probably Jack off 2x a day and if I don\u2019t I feel like I\u2019m going to kill someone. She doesn\u2019t need it as bad as me but still enjoys it. I still watch porn. I like big boobies like Angela White, Gianna, and Brandi Taylor. Sally D\u2019Angelo, Deauxma. Those old fake titted cougars really get me going. Remind me of the missus. No fap is a meme. I wake up at 445 every day and run 4 miles and then lift during lunch break. Again I have 3 kids so I\u2019m taking care of them throughout the day. Usually Jack off at work or while I\u2019m showering. Wife and I do the majority of our fucking between 8-10PM or when Nana and Papa are watching the crotch goblin terrorist midgets", "time": 1673523796, "resto": 69564501}, {"no": 69569016, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)06:58:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69568944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69568944</a><br>Good stuff bro, much of the same here, but with your father.", "time": 1673524704, "resto": 69564501}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 69568993, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)06:54:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;yfw he lifts weights instead of doin calis</span>", "filename": "tyson3432446", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 369, "h": 280, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 189, "tim": 1673524444415734, "time": 1673524444, "md5": "jRqeYykDt74GBhkEVdVM9A==", "fsize": 16593, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "yfw-he-lifts-weights-instead-of-doin-calis", "replies": 1, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 69569013, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)06:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69568993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69568993</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw he lifts weights instead of having sex</span>", "filename": "1672778273645633", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673524681158464, "time": 1673524681, "md5": "xiK2bF57l0PlQ8Ke572Bbg==", "fsize": 27045, "resto": 69568993}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 69568241, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:41:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Looks to me like the seedoil thing is more of a meme than actual science<br><br>https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/h<wbr>sph-in-the-news/scientists-debunk-s<wbr>eed-oil-health-risks/", "filename": "Screenshot_20230112_224010_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 2400, "tn_w": 112, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673516480973418, "time": 1673516480, "md5": "acaiVYwUzjNhf4REQ2MTng==", "fsize": 752337, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "looks-to-me-like-the-seedoil-thing-is-more-of-a", "replies": 25, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 20}, {"no": 69568246, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:42:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69568241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69568241</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;soientists defend soi</span><br>Big surprise.", "time": 1673516565, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568258, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:44:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69568241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69568241</a><br>Yeah no shit Sherlock <br>Retards here look for any excuse they can get to justify why the don\u2019t get anywhere in life", "time": 1673516642, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568277, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "into the trash it goes", "filename": "Screenshot_2023-01-12-16-47-07-980-edit_com.android.chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1765, "tn_w": 76, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673516867611635, "time": 1673516867, "md5": "OAoe+UH+h/buVJ57NbeU6A==", "fsize": 856255, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568290, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:49:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "OH GOD IM DEBOOOONKING", "time": 1673516976, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568311, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:53:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;harvard</span><br>dropped instantly", "time": 1673517188, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568391, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)05:10:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69568241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69568241</a><br>He is &quot;right&quot;, omega 6 is actually less harmful than omega 3.", "time": 1673518205, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568406, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)05:14:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69568241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69568241</a><br>\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd", "time": 1673518443, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568418, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)05:16:50", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "noshno (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673518610282255, "time": 1673518610, "md5": "Q912XgGrDymkmabLCV2D1Q==", "fsize": 8014, "resto": 69568241}, {"no": 69568436, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)05:20:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I got my degree in nutrition almost 10 years ago and Harvard t.

Eat mostly whole foods and track what you eat with a calorie counter app like Chronometer or Fatsecret.

Plenty of variety to keep you from getting bored and very hypertrophy focused. Very little equipment or machines needed and every gym around the world should be able to accommodate this. If you want to swap out an exercise you can. It&#039;s easily modified. Like if you wanted to do barbell bench instead of a chest press machine, or maybe a back squat instead of a leg press, it won&#039;t affect the program negatively and you&#039;ll still make progress at the rate you should. If you want to add deadlifts I&#039;d recommend doing them on Monday and only doing them once that week. They take a lot to recover from. Also don&#039;t do them for high reps.

Look up zone 2 heart rate zone/training (your watch might calculate it for you, the 220-your age formula isn&#039;t great but it isn&#039;t trash, the Maffetone 180 formula is my favourite desu. Ideally use all three to get a rough idea, they should overlap consistently). Find your range (for example mine is 130-140).<br><br>Don&#039;t suddenly go hard when you start. You need to warm up into it. You need to maintain a solid cadence throughout (I go for 120 rpm on the elliptical, 90 if cycling). After five minutes I will start to increase the resistance (typically go straight to five), then on each minute mark will increase the resistance until I am in my heart rate zone (around the end of my workout I often have to reduce the resistance). <br><br>Then hold in that zone for a set period of time (watch a TV show, listen to a pod cast, etc...) check your heart rate on the minute and adjust resistance to make sure you&#039;re still in your zone.<br><br>As a beginner doing this 4 times a week for 10 minutes (not including warm up or cool down) is fine, but look to increase the duration, each month increase the time.

They go to the gym to get fit males to look at their asses. However, dudes have recently stopped giving a shit about thots thotting their thot asses around the weights. They only talk to other dudes and train, they don&#039;t give women attention anymore.<br>So, what do the brilliant women think?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hmm, let&#039;s gather all women in one place, make it an all-woman-exclusive thing. Then let&#039;s be very obvious about it and tell the dudes about our super-duper-exclusive-all-woman-clu<wbr>b so we can bait them in coming over here to give us attention. Since there will be more women than men, there will be too few dudes to just talk with one another, they will HAVE to look at our asses at some point. And if they still decide to not talk to us, we can kick them out because &quot;all female, ur not allowed&quot;, and make room for a dude who will talk to us.</span><br>The problem is that women can&#039;t in2logic, and they don&#039;t understand that if the sign says &quot;no men allowed&quot;, then no men will go in. And since women only go to the gym to get attention from men, there are no women going to that gym either.<br>So now, instead of revising the tactic, this chick picks the most obvious woman choice and doubles down. Instead of trying to bait men into coming to this spot where all the women are supposedly &quot;hiding&quot;, she&#039;s now outright shaming men as some sort of reverse-psychology thing<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ooooh ur butthurt, look at how butthurt you are that I made an all female gym!
