If you pass as a woman then you&#039;re a woman. It&#039;s not waterproof but it&#039;s the best option out of all of them. To be critical of the left: Self-identification isn&#039;t good enough. Someone can identify with something but if the world doesn&#039;t see them as that then every conversation with or about them is underpinned by the subtext, &#039;I&#039;m going to call you by something which I don&#039;t really see you as but which you&#039;d like to be seen as.

In a social context, a trans woman who passes IS a woman IMO because to refer to them otherwise is impractical. Like seeing a trans woman who passes in a restaurant, &#039;Look at that guy, over there, no over at that table, with the dress and the long brown hair, that dude&#039; - You&#039;re just confusing people at that point where the purpose of language is to overcome confusion. Clarification: If we&#039;re in a doctor&#039;s office, or a sporting context, we go by sex terms because it doesn&#039;t matter if a trans woman passes or not when it comes to medical stuff or competitive sports.<br>My way of looking at this is never going to win out though because neither side would compromise on this.

At the start of the week, I was 173kg. I rectified this by buying a new scale and confirming its accuracy via my roommate&#039;s scale and my parent&#039;s scale. <br><br>I had 2 days where i &quot;broke&quot; my fast however, did not binge or go over my calories. On a re-feed day my brother brought me over some drinks I had (altogether around 400 cals) and today my mother insisted I eat some of her food (500 cals). Not bad, not great.<br><br>The good:<br><br>Down approx 3kg for the week to begin with, which was great. Currently at 170. <br><br>Increased the distance I can walk exponentially, so I should be burning more cals during my walking sessions. <br><br>The focus for next week:<br><br>I plan on correcting all my mistakes this week by only going to my parent&#039;s house when I am certain there is no food, or on a re-feed day.<br><br>Will focus on being as strict as possible on my fasting to speed up weightloss as well. Overall however I am happy with the outcome of this week.<br><br>Questions answered from some anons:<br><br>How did you get this big?<br><br>I broke both legs in a serious work accident which required 3 surgeries, months of rehab.

Been a virgin obviously, never even considered myself someone that could talk to a girl, let alone date one.<br><br>Over those 4 years I&#039;ve managed to fix so much and yet every time I progress I discover new fucked up psychological problems I didn&#039;t know I had. I&#039;m fit now, not really big but that was never my goal, got visible abs thought and people have commented positively on my muscles. Made friends, socialized, basically faked it until I made it. To the outside world I may seem like a normie with above average appearance.<br><br>Then I guess my brain finally figured out I might be attractive to the opposite sex. Developed a huge crush on a female friend. Fell in love, really. She was somewhat attracted to me as well and agreed to date, but nothing beyond that. Needless to say I fucked it up completely and in the process I realized I had also destroyed my mind with porn because I didn&#039;t even have the desire to have sex with her. It happened eventually so at the very least I can say I&#039;m not a virgin anymore, but it wasn&#039;t even enjoyable. I realized I have so much anxiety about fucking, it&#039;s insane. And she was not interested in taking it slow or in any kind of intimacy beyond sex, so no chance to ease into it.<br><br>It feels like at some point you might just be unfixable.

Deadlifting 2x a week seems unnecessary. I would suggest doing SSB squats instead of zercher squats and deadlifts. SSB squats will make you very strong, with lighter weights, so its easier to recover from. Also i would do the rowing chest supported, since your lower back already has a lot of volume. In general your program lacks volume for the upper back, as it recovers pretty fast.<br>Here is what i would change:<br>4 sets of SSB squats on squat day and 2 sets SSB good morning, instead of zercher squats and deadlifts. No ssb bar? Do fronts squats and normal good mornings.<br>You can also do some high bar pause squats or box squats on deadlift day, focusing on power. These will prime you for deadlifting.<br>Farmer walks on deadlift day, if possible. This will give you a very strong grip, and is imo better than shrugs.<br>Lat pulldown, 8x8 30 sec rest 50% 1rm on bench day or some kind of seal row supersetted with the bench press.<br>Hip thrust is ok, but i think 45 degree back extension is better, check out pete rubish back raises. You already have plenty of glute volume, so i would probably remove it, and do some more sets of other exercises.<br>Hamstring isolation. Glute ham raises, or leg curls<br>Some sort of lower trap/rear delt exercise, IYT raises will do this (very important)<br>Remove the shrugs, if you do the farmer walks.<br>Also, you do 3 sets for every exercise, feel free to play around with amount of sets. Instead of progressing weight, you can progress volume each week.<br>Also would add some 1 arm lat pulldowns on squat day.

The first was a study of colon polyps, the precancerous growths that greatly increase the likelihood of developing colon cancer. Almost 1,900 subjects with a recent history of having a polyp removed were divided into a control group that ate their usual diet and a group following a diet characterized by significant decreases in total fat, red, and processed meat along with increases in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes (Schatzkin et al., 2000). Participants were followed for 3 years and at the end of that time, the recurrence of colon polyps was identical in both diet groups. It is possible that the precancerous stage may not have been the proper time for dietary intervention. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative, therefore, studied a low-fat diet, achieved in large part by reducing red- and processed-meat consumption, among almost 49,000 women (Beresford et al., 2006); about 30,000 followed their normal diets and almost 20,000 were assigned to low-fat diets. After 9 years, the rate of colon cancer was almost identical in the low-fat and control-diet groups. These studies strongly suggest that the observational studies are not supported by dietary intervention studies at either the precancerous or malignant tumor stages of colon cancer.</span><br>https://doi.org/10.1093/af/vfy009", "time": 1673133030, "resto": 69513197}, {"no": 69515615, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)18:12:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69515599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69515599</a><br>Posting doubt is not proving the dont cause csncer", "time": 1673133136, "resto": 69513197}, {"no": 69515620, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)18:13:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69515599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69515599</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it is possible</span><br>Leprechauns are possible.

I like samurai stuff so learning the reasons behind a lot of things they are portrayed doing was cool, like the stances or the angle/height in which they hold the blade. The teachers were a couple of japs. Older one was a cool boomer with a faded scar on one of his eyes and an easygoing way, younger one was a cunt. Guy couldn\u2019t go two minutes without talking shit to one of the students, no matter if they were veterans or complete newbs going for a free lesson like me. He didn\u2019t have a lick of patience and seemed more interested on posturing than on teaching. Anyway, it\u2019s a very good workout for your calves and hips, although I was a little disappointed by how light it went on cardio. I didn\u2019t run out of breath or had my heart rate spike even once, but maybe I\u2019m just spoiled from running and ending up my boxing lessons back in the day feeling I was gonna colapse. All in all it was a cool experience, but I don\u2019t plan on going back. Also, if you wanna spar you\u2019re probably get frustrated. It seems like you need to be training for about a year before reaching that point, although I\u2019m not 100% sure.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There&#039;s a nice small boxing gym run by a former high level competitor near me, my only fear with boxing is that I&#039;m fucking massive for my height (roidlet bb competitor) and my weight would slow me down or limit my range/flexibility drastically.

I have to work at 4 so plenty of time to recover but feeling like quite the bum today. On top of that last night after we were done playing a couple of my friends and I went to get some food and we\u2019re just hanging out and one of them made a comment about me being significantly older then them, 25 vs 20. Which I had known before and not thought much of because I have a younger brother that age and really enjoy spending time with him, so I didn\u2019t find the age gap that wierd. I don\u2019t think they do either it was an off handed comment but it got me thinking and I think I\u2019m going to have to decline on any outside sports hang out events.
