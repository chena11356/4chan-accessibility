I did (we met at church) but then she said I have to ask her dad to have a &#039;courtship&#039; as she wasn&#039;t allowed to date and it needed to be supervised. I thought that was pretty weird despite her being 19, but I respected her and her families wishes. I would be very shocked if she was riding dick while that was happening. My father in law was a former marine and doesn&#039;t play games. He complimented me that I got out of my car and rang the doorbell and shook his hand like a man and met him before taking her out. He also complimented that I walked her to the door, where he was waiting with his shotgun after our first date. I know for a fact I took her virginity, since there was blood all over my penis from her hymen. I have since been impregnating her ever since. Luckily, she has gotten more promiscious as time has went on. Although I told her that was my biggest reservation before we got married, that she was inexperienced and prude, and she promised to explore more. Just recently, she let me tit fuck her for the first time, and then sent me a video of her playing with herself with a &#039;rose vibrator&#039; this week.

The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry. Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poop -molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky poop/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch!

Unfortunately, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks.

For isolations dynamic double progression is the best for noobs/intermediates (look up alexander bromleys explanation on youtube). Basically you have a rep range of 8-12 for your 4 sets. If you hit 12 reps on the first set, you increase the weight for next time. Lets say next time with the increased weight you get 10 reps.

Great bit of technology but they have their limitations.<br>You will struggle to get to 12% on a DEXA scan but it&#039;s not impossible. The thing is they measure visceral as well as subcutaneous fat as the same thing. Subcutaneous is probably the one we are mostly concerned about visually. That&#039;s the fat that is under the skin. Visceral is within the body between organs. Because of this what a lot of people think is 12% visually is closer to 14 or 15 on a technical level. <br>When I was at Uni we had a guy who was cut up. We&#039;re talking striated muscle fibers and full chiselled abs (I suspect he was on DNP or something but didn&#039;t know him that well). Anyway lowest I ever saw him was 12.4%. So it is possible to get to 12% but visually he was easily sub-10.<br>My advice is to still get them done but focus more on the fat mass index and lean mass index numbers as these will give a better idea of body composition than raw bf%.

I&#039;ve been a cringy loner my entire life and lacked self awareness and still do in some aspects. But when I was 17 it was brutal. I got my first gym membership at a 24 hour gym and that became my life, I didn&#039;t go to school or work during this time, i was just a NEET who lifted and played video games. However I knew nothing about working out. All I knew is that I had to eat and lift. I cringe looking back at my form on everything. I remember when I got those beginner gains and then thought I was big and badass. I was *that* guy at the gym and i feel shameful looking back on it but im greatful i realized what i was and took steps to change it. I went out and bought a skin tight compression shirt and short shorts and wore it to the gym during peak hours, I remember thinking I was the toughest guy in the gym and I would stare at people because I wanted to assert dominance. I remember people would laugh at me and shit and I would just tell myself &quot;they&#039;re too scared to say it to my face&quot;. One time I deadlifted 315lbs for 1 rep with back breaking form and then dropped it at the top and the entire gym floor shook and I turned around to see if anyone saw and literally no one gave a shit. I&#039;d Bench Press with awful range of motion. I&#039;d cheat Curl. I rarely trained Legs because I hated it and only cared about a big upperbody. There were 2 guys who trained the same time as me, one of them was a muscular dude who looked like he knew what he was doing and was strong, his buddy was dyel and he was clearly being trained, but the dyel buddy was cocky as hell and would always stare at me and smirk and look over at his friend and whisper things to him. His buddy never made eye contact with me and seemed chill, like he didn&#039;t give a shit about anything around him. But me and this dyel would have epic autistic staredowns every fucking day.

I just want to not give a fuck.<br>When it comes to excercise i want to read at least Solitary Fitness by Bronson.<br>And for social skills - any book about being less autistic in small talk and flirting - do you recommend something? Not sure if How to Win Friends is worth reading.<br>Also finish at least 2 technical books to read (security and concurrent programming) at most until end of february. Also some novels, like Gargantua and Pantagruel, Naked Lunch and Steppenwolf", "time": 1673280536, "resto": 69533629}, {"no": 69535501, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)11:13:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69534486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69534486</a><br>It&#039;s certainly a possibility but not an option", "time": 1673280784, "resto": 69533629}, {"no": 69535555, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)11:16:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69534331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69534331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also I am gonna try to finally get driver licence, I am 27 years old but never tried it before.</span><br>good luck anon. i don&#039;t know where you live, but here in the US the test itself is pretty lenient. i think the best way to get better is to drive every day, even if you circle the block for five minutes. eventually it will be like second nature to you", "time": 1673281015, "resto": 69533629}, {"no": 69535671, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)11:26:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69535465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69535465</a><br>I had this phase 2 years ago, very interesting stuff indeed.

Nobody choses to live the way they do, they just do. <br>The reason why I believe is that all your prospects shrink as you grow older, no matter what do you, with execption of one: suicide. That&#039;s why it&#039;s tempting. I have this chart of suicide rates for men &amp; women. I saved it like 3 days ago, because I know what causes it.<br>Men have a rapidly rising tendency to commit suicide starting from ages greater than 15, untill it becomes and holds steady at around 20-30. Then once they hit forty, the dread sets in (as it will for everbody; nobody likes knowing their time is behind them), and the rate increases again. Fun fact, my dad almost killed himself, because my mom was sleeping around, and then abused the court system to steal everything he had (no prenup) Luckily, he had the fortitude not to do that.<br>Women seem to have comparitivly low rates of suicide. Although it is remarkable that there is a steady increase, almost as if the rates for suicide in females is directly proprtional to their age.<br>This conforms to my theory that men get blackpilled, and are unhappy early (because they are incels). And women can enjoy their lives because they are the selectors. Then the attraction, the thing that makes women attractive: youth, dries up. They become desperate, and want to find the person that will provide and sometimes comfort (less good-looking than Chad).<br>Oh, you know, It&#039;s 00:46 GMT, and I really need to go to bed.

When I go on the leg extension machine, I pop in a rep, then I hold it for a long time, and during that time, because it&#039;s one of those open-back leg extension machines, I can sort of like lean back and even do side flexions on the abs and stuff.

Deficit RDLs are just Romanian deadlifts where you are elevated so you can go lower without the plates touching the floor, and thereby get a greater hamstring stretch. It&#039;s the natural continuation of the regular RDL because over time as you go do reps to the maximum length your hamstrings will stretch to your hamstrings will get more flexible over time, eventually leading to the issue that despite having your knees behind your toes and your back neutral/arched you can no longer fully stretch the hamstrings without the plates touching the ground. At this point you need to add a deficit, or widen the grip (I&#039;m currently doing both as I can&#039;t go deeper without crushing my toes lmao). Doing RDLs down to below your kneecap like most people just ends up being an ego-lifting exercise unless you&#039;re just starting to do them and don&#039;t ahve the flexibility yet because most people can easily go a lot lower if they actually tried, and therefore won&#039;t need to use anywhere near as much weight which needlessly fatigues you for no benefit.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyways do you think what I&#039;m doing is helping and is it similar in a way to nordic curl?</span><br>I have no idea because I can&#039;t see what you&#039;re doing exactly but if it feels like it&#039;s doing something positive, keep doing it.", "time": 1673329382, "resto": 69537653}, {"no": 69543550, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)00:44:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69543428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69543428</a><br><a href=\"#p69543447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69543447</a><br><a href=\"#p69543542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69543542</a><br>Forgot to mention, I also pause at the bottom now (literally just started doing this today actually), simply because spending more time in the stretched position is both good for improving flexibility (duh) and hypertrophy.
