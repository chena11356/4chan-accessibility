Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it.

I&#039;ve been a cringy loner my entire life and lacked self awareness and still do in some aspects. But when I was 17 it was brutal. I got my first gym membership at a 24 hour gym and that became my life, I didn&#039;t go to school or work during this time, i was just a NEET who lifted and played video games. However I knew nothing about working out. All I knew is that I had to eat and lift. I cringe looking back at my form on everything. I remember when I got those beginner gains and then thought I was big and badass. I was *that* guy at the gym and i feel shameful looking back on it but im greatful i realized what i was and took steps to change it. I went out and bought a skin tight compression shirt and short shorts and wore it to the gym during peak hours, I remember thinking I was the toughest guy in the gym and I would stare at people because I wanted to assert dominance. I remember people would laugh at me and shit and I would just tell myself &quot;they&#039;re too scared to say it to my face&quot;. One time I deadlifted 315lbs for 1 rep with back breaking form and then dropped it at the top and the entire gym floor shook and I turned around to see if anyone saw and literally no one gave a shit. I&#039;d Bench Press with awful range of motion. I&#039;d cheat Curl. I rarely trained Legs because I hated it and only cared about a big upperbody. There were 2 guys who trained the same time as me, one of them was a muscular dude who looked like he knew what he was doing and was strong, his buddy was dyel and he was clearly being trained, but the dyel buddy was cocky as hell and would always stare at me and smirk and look over at his friend and whisper things to him. His buddy never made eye contact with me and seemed chill, like he didn&#039;t give a shit about anything around him. But me and this dyel would have epic autistic staredowns every fucking day.

The problem is they had abusive relationships, or didn&#039;t get what they wanted out of them. They were sold on ideas like all men are pigs and bad and evil and feminist propaganda permeated their brains until their hatred of men essentially drove them to reject men as romantic partners.

Then let&#039;s be very obvious about it and tell the dudes about our super-duper-exclusive-all-woman-clu<wbr>b so we can bait them in coming over here to give us attention. Since there will be more women than men, there will be too few dudes to just talk with one another, they will HAVE to look at our asses at some point. And if they still decide to not talk to us, we can kick them out because &quot;all female, ur not allowed&quot;, and make room for a dude who will talk to us.</span><br>The problem is that women can&#039;t in2logic, and they don&#039;t understand that if the sign says &quot;no men allowed&quot;, then no men will go in.

I have one hip flexor that&#039;s sort of set in, as in concentrically moves by nature, the foot flicks in you know when we move, but its almost to a 90 degree angle laterally, like I barely clear distance with that foot, almost like the hip just rocks side to side in the socket within. Then the other foot, is the one who like stretches out, also concentrically but it shoots out like a hitler salute, I want to say at about a 120 degree angle then rotates back in, so it&#039;s slightly eccentric with the flick, then it rolls back in. So this is sort of like the default position of my hips, not just walking. <br>I&#039;ve been trying to get my &#039;&#039;lateral&#039;&#039; hip to have more of a wide mobility, since it barely has any depth of projection, like it sort of stuck in.

I was wondering if there is a hip joint guru up in here that can tell me how they&#039;re supposed to be, and what to do. My hips is low key the weakest link in my joint chain although my knees are weak too. But with my knees the problem is sort of even both sides.

She was decent, you could tell she thought she was hot, but she was only a 6/10 imho. Keep in mind, I&#039;m married, and I have 3 children under 4 years old. I don&#039;t sleep very often, and I really really value my time at the gym. I am already exhausted and pissed off due to every day life, constantly picking up toys and doing chores, not having any time to myself, so my patience level lately is at an all time low. <br><br>So this dumb bitch catches me on a bad day--she was doing some retarded shoulder exercise I&#039;ve never seen before she probably saw some fuckhead zoomer do on youtube. I got some dumbells and started going through my routine. She looked at me and said &quot;Hey you&#039;re in my shot&quot;. I replied &quot;huh&quot; and she said I&#039;m filming myself working out for my tik tok, could get you out of the shot. Now, I could have gotten out of the shot, and went somewhere else, but I said &quot;No, I don&#039;t think I will, move your camera phone&quot;. She was like &quot;wow you&#039;re a fucking dick dude&quot; and I looked at her and said &quot;I literally do not give a a fuck about whatever verbal diarhea is pouring out of your cunt mouth. No one tells me what to do&quot;. She ended up getting her phone and leaving 5 minutes later.<br><br>Luckily my gym has no one manning it. It is 24/7/365 key fob access. So she would have to write a letter to the gym owner, who would then have to review the tape, figure out who I was amongst the 11 other people in there, and then email me and reprimand me. And for what? Because I wouldn&#039;t move while I&#039;M working out<br><br>So sick of entitled zoomers and women. I just don&#039;t give a fuck anymore.

So, I suggest you try that for a bit. Help at a shelter, tutor some kids, volunteer for beach clean up, say something nice online, anything.<br>Bettering mind and body is essential; as essential as helping others. Find purpose. And also, stay away from drugs. At least for a little while. Look up brain development and the ages when it finishes for humans, you&#039;re killing yourself and your future by frying your brain with drugs it&#039;s not even ready for yet.<br>I&#039;m rooting for you, kid.

Pushing us to do it more is a sneaky way to subvert natural human behavior, encourage us to devalue the precious gift of water, and constantly fret over social perception even though we have near 0 control over how others view us. Which big businesses gladly encourage with all this extra shit to &quot;smell good&quot; etc. It&#039;s just a false sense of control and daily+ shower people almost always freak the fuck out if they can&#039;t shower for a couple days. That is NOT a healthy response. <br><br>unless you work hard enough to sweat on the daily, you&#039;ll be healthier and calmer if you max around 3x a week, preferably less. And you should only wash your hair maybe once every 7-10 days. Going without for much longer then that isn&#039;t good for your mind.", "time": 1673392294, "resto": 69546298}, {"no": 69552249, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)18:13:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69552217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69552217</a><br>That makes sence, but many of people here mention only going to gym if even that, and doing twice a day.", "time": 1673392407, "resto": 69546298}, {"no": 69552309, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)18:17:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69552249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69552249</a><br>I didn&#039;t read the thread but if they are doing that then yeah it&#039;s dumb no point in washing if you aren&#039;t smelling or post work out.", "time": 1673392674, "resto": 69546298}, {"no": 69552356, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)18:22:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Twice a week, I don&#039;t really go outside too much", "time": 1673392937, "resto": 69546298}, {"no": 69552432, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)18:29:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69552206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69552206</a><br>We both know you already read it, you fake ass bitch.", "time": 1673393374, "resto": 69546298}, {"no": 69552441, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)18:31:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Shower avg every 3 days or after working outside/sports.

For the body to digest + absorb protein, it must be broken down into its constituent amino acids first in order to pass into your intestinal endothelium. Cooking kick-starts this process by denaturing the protein structures and reducing the amount of work that your digestive enzymes need to do in order to cleave the protein down to individual amino acids or dipeptides. Cooking your protein is essentially pre-digesting it before it even gets to your mouth.<br>If you cook certain protein forms for an extended period of time (hours, not minutes), then you can certainly form some unfavourable peptide bonds and protein aggregates that are less digestible than less-cooked forms, but the gains in digestibility generally outweigh the losses.

Full props to any other anons actually trying to help this man. I&#039;ll do my best to help you.<br><br>There&#039;s about 3500kcal per pound of fat on your body. Meaning if you have 33 pounds to lose (roughly 20kg) then that&#039;s a pound of fat per day lost and a 3500kcal deficit. Even if you had a month to do it it&#039;s not happening unless you stopped eating and did a ton of cardio. We can do about 10kg in a month though. You can absolutely fraud a 5kg fat difference with the right clothes. Assuming you maintain your weight at 2500kcal per day that leaves you with the 200kcals you&#039;ve been eating (2300kcal deficit), so we need to get your calories up. For a man we can&#039;t have you going below 1500kcal per day for extended periods without shit like hair loss, severe drops in libido, and other stuff like that happening. Since you&#039;ll be on such low calories we should consider low impact exercise to be king. Get on a treadmill, set it to a 5% incline, and walk for an hour and a half each morning and night at 5km/hour for the month. That&#039;ll burn off that 1300kcal for a 81kg man. For the 1500kcal food-wise you absolutely need potatoes with tons of salt on them. It&#039;s an electrolyte bomb and keeps you very full. Most baking potatoes have about 220kcal in them each. Have 3 a day over 2-3 meals. Add in green vegetables like broccoli, spinach, romaine, and other high fiber, high volume vegetables with a good amount of nutrients to keep you full. Eat 4 cups of dense greens like broccoli or cauliflower or 10 cups of leafy greens like spinach per day. Mix and match for variety. Plenty of salt on them too. Get in 1 avocado or 2.5 tablespoons of olive oil each day to make sure you&#039;re eating enough fat. After that fill the remaining calories with lean protein. 2 pounds of fish or chicken breasts per day. Again don&#039;t forget the salt.", "time": 1673412822, "resto": 69554603}, {"no": 69554961, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:56:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69554943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69554943</a><br>Don&#039;t forget plenty of water, coffee, and tea too.

For beginners I usually recommend focusing on form rather than effort, a lot of people assume effort is what makes you succeed but it isn&#039;t. You should watch some videos on front crawl/freestyle form, they will tell you to focus on trying to glide through the water with one arm outstretched, as the other arm comes over to meet it you then use your leading arm to pull yourself through the water as if you were pulling yourself up a rock face or along a rope.
