To be perfectly honest, bald people illicit disgust in me too. I can&#039;t even look them in the eye because I&#039;m hyperfocused on their receding hairline, their transparent scalp hair, the way their greasy forehead is coated in a layer of stinky grease.<br><br>I think all bald men know this deep down. They have been relegated to background characters in the game of life. They look on people with hair with envious eyes and find places in threads like this, like crabs in a bucket pulling people with the time and resources to save their hair back down to their level. They are driven on a primal genetic level to not let other men succeed where they have failed. Everyone must be as ugly and rotten as they appear. <br><br>It truly frightens me /fit/.

While women try to shape the world according to their subjective perception (&quot;my truth&quot;, &quot;my interpretation&quot;) there still is this thing called OBJECTIVE TRUTH. It doesn&#039;t matter how much you &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;interpret&quot; that 2+2=5, it can never be objective truth. And for the truth about the concept of honor we just have to look into actual sciences, behavioral biology and anthropology. Go dry your nails while you read this, you might just learn something today.<br>Mankind is still 99% driven by instincts, baser feelings. Hunger, sex drive, sense of danger, and so on. And for men, one of these instincts is a sense of honor.<br>Back in the stone age, males had to cooperate for the sake of the tribe. Hunting with no tools is not a one man job. They had to work towards the well-being of not just a certain group of people, but as tribes grew in size towards the well-being of an abstract concept of what would later become society. So males that showed a certain reliability towards working for the tribe as a whole were at an evolutionary advantage compared to the males who would only think about themselves, so bestowing them with communal resources was a safe investment. Even if they were not able to articulate it at the time, stone age males started to rely on inarticulate codes of conduct, like helping an injured other male back to camp and spending resources to try and patch him up. Males who would not show reliability towards the tribe would in turn not receive help from the other members when in need themselves. <br>This of course includes actual self-sacrificial behavior. Jumping between a strange kid and a lion endangers yourself, but the kid will live and guarantee one more member of the next tribe generation. Letting the kid die is a setback to the entire tribe, so humans evolved to perceive such an act as disgusting. <br>cont", "filename": "cc5ce9bf-b6c1-4092-9fe7-2a4284ab23a5", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 285, "h": 208, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1676115689853847, "time": 1676115689, "md5": "CZ7SX6MUDNn0gQBTELBaGw==", "fsize": 9514, "resto": 69913546}, {"no": 69922097, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)06:42:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69922092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69922092</a><br>What happens in a normal humans brain when feeling disgust? It stimulates the brain regions for the sense of cleanliness and anger. This is not up for debate. So as your miserable ancestors settled down and started to give this hole &quot;agriculture&quot; thing a try, the males already had a very strong sense of what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior towards the village. Even if it wasn&#039;t an action towards the village itself like assaulting a group of travelers, this would cause problems for your own village, so men still wouldn&#039;t do it just because they could. Instead they started to strive to being valuable assets to the village/society as a whole, and voila, the concept of honor as social currency was eventually written down and codified for future generations.<br>Now women on the other hand have a different brain structure in that regard. Women don&#039;t interact with each other based on cooperation, it&#039;s competition. Until very recently a female would permanently be pregnant and with at least two or three small children. The stone age females would huddle together for mutual protection, but in this group the female that had all eyes on her was the safest from harm. So women started to develop a sense and desire for attention. And unlike men, who evolved to develop a sense for community well-being, women had the much more baser role of protecting both their pregnant bellies and their own kids. In old times resources like food or shelter were a zero sum game for a bunch of pregnant females, so it was not evolutionary advantageous to be altruistic, quite the opposite. So simply put, men evolved to have a sense of being a contributing factor to society, whereas women evolved to be selfish attention whores. <br>cont", "filename": "6vScT", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 717, "h": 880, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676115755617247, "time": 1676115755, "md5": "rsOUbCsjJw4CzxQPzkkL3w==", "fsize": 144266, "resto": 69913546}, {"no": 69922105, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)06:43:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69922097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69922097</a><br>Sure, women can form mutually beneficial relationships and even actual friendships, but ever notice how women will shower the fat ugly neighbor with compliments, but slag off the fit pretty 20 year old two doors over?

Obviously not every detail, but how they tried to advance the human understanding of the world and help mankind forward. Women, who generally lack any sense of community welfare or drive to work towards a greater good BECAUSE THEY ARE PHYSIOLOGICALLY UNABLE TO (stray exceptions still apply obviously) simply cannot understand this. Just look at the recent &quot;why are they blowing money into space&quot; and &quot;toxic masculinity space penis&quot; bullshit when Bezos launched a rocket, which mainly is perpetrated by women and fags. These people simply cannot understand the concept. It&#039;s like trying to explain to them that men do in fact not need attention in the same way they need water or food, it&#039;s literally impossible for them to even entertain the thought, no matter how hard they try. <br>Your &quot;interpretation&quot; has zero meaning, go get a degree in actual sciences.

Almost 6 feet tall, blonde, amazing body and face, she could sing and dance. An all around amazing performer. She got a scholarship to an acting school in NYC. This was a huge deal for someone from our little red neck school. She did well at college and went out to LA after she graduated because that\u2019s where all the good actors and actresses go to try and make it. A couple of years after college I talked to her on the phone and we caught up. I asked her how Hollywood was treating her and she said she gave that up and decided to become a personal trainer. I was shocked and asked her why she would do that. Then she told me how Hollywood works. <br><br>She bounced around doing small parts in commercials and posing as a model for fitness magazines and she finally auditioned for a big role. This would be the one to catapult her into stardom. She made it through all the auditions and it was down to her and one other girl. The casting director called them in for their last audition and told my friend, \u201cWe love you and you\u2019re perfect for this part, but there\u2019s one more thing I need you to do.\u201d She very innocently asked him what that was. He replied, \u201cI need you to suck my dick.\u201d Mind you, this girl was a virgin when we graduated high school. She came from a very religious small-town family. So she asked him what happens if she says no. He told her, \u201cYou see that girl out in the hall waiting? If you don\u2019t do it, she will. And she\u2019ll be the one who gets the part. That\u2019s just how it works in Hollywood.\u201d She politely declined and walked out of the casting room and immediately gave up.", "time": 1676083747, "resto": 69915624}, {"no": 69919061, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:51:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69919052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69919052</a><br>My conversation with her happened in 2004 and I\u2019ve realized how corrupt Hollywood was ever since.

You need to think of your future self. Let me put things in perspective for you:<br><br>Say you meet a great woman tomorrow and start a serious relationship. Even if you love her a lot, the fastest you can reasonably allow yourself to move towards marriage would be like 1.5 years to pop the question. Now you are almost 23 if we are in fast mode. Generally people are engaged for like 9-15 months to plan a wedding, send invites, make sure you aren&#039;t making a mistake, etc. Now you are almost 25 on FAST MODE.<br><br>How long do you want to be married before you have kids? Generally people start trying 18-30 months after marriage. On fast mode, you start trying for your first child as you are coming up on 27 which I would say is a pretty well adjust age for your FIRST child. How many do you want? 2? 3? How far apart in age? 2-3 years is the typical gap. Your first will be born as you are approaching 28. Assume your woman is the same age as you. After 30, the fertility of women diminishes and the background risk of complication/disability increases. Do you have any idea how fucked it is to raise sick children? Really have a hard think about it. In reality the risk doesn&#039;t get TOO bad until you are looking at 35, but remember we are on FAST MODE and you meet your girl TOMORROW in this scenario. <br><br>Put off relationship seeking at your peril. If you are going to shirk the responsibility of living you will be forced to go after younger women in crowds you don&#039;t fit easily into. Most of the best women are picked up in college.

Get more friends, spend more time around women in general whatever way you can, and the biggest and most important thing: do not care. Do not worry if you can&#039;t get laid. If you are trying to fuck a woman do not treat her like she&#039;s your only hope for getting pussy in your life. Treat her like you kind of like her and you&#039;re horny. Don&#039;t be afraid to tease her or even outright make fun of her to her face (do not do this through text). The last thing women want is a man who&#039;s psychologically dependent on them somehow and has no other options. If you&#039;re speaking to her make sure to seem like you&#039;re really interested in learning about her and who she is and what she thinks, and only do this if you genuinely want to learn more about her and who she is and what she thinks. Women can sense that all men are just sucking up to them because they just want to fuck and they do not like it, they also don&#039;t like a man who&#039;s purely cerebral/verbal and uncomfortable in his physical sexuality and desires. Be visibly attracted and intrigued by her but also don&#039;t take her really seriously ever, even if she&#039;s crying in front of you. I&#039;m fucking drunk right now does this make sense?

The main thing that gave this away for me was the taste, I&#039;d add it to 32oz of water and it would have an inconsistent taste from serving to serving, most often tasting SUPER salty to the point where it was hard to drink (this was unflavored ReLyte, btw).

If you\u2019re not paying careful attention, it\u2019ll get drowned out by other things, like how uncomfortable or tired you are. I recommend against touching your dick, as it\u2019s too distracting. Any method of stimulation that requires a lot of work on your part, can also be too distracting. I recommend against any toys that require you to hold them for this reason.<br><br>People who get frustrated will start pounding their prostate too hard. The goal of prostate stimulation is to build up fluid in the prostate; the pressure of that fluid is what makes it feels good. Pressing too hard will squeeze the fluid right out of the prostate, potentially setting you back an hour of work. Press very lightly and slowly, then ease up at the first non-pleasurable feelings. Press it down a very small amount, then completely let off so it can \u2018refill\u2019, like a sponge. Sensations from the prostate can often be delayed, and going too quickly can make it difficult to tell what is and isn\u2019t working.<br><br>If you\u2019re not feeling anything from prostate stimulation, there&#039;s a good chance you haven\u2019t practiced enough to identify what it feels like. While you\u2019re really relaxed and horny, gently poke around and just think about what you\u2019re feeling. You\u2019ve probably looked up diagrams of where your prostate is, but your prostate can easily be off centre or in a slightly different position to the norm. It usually manifests as a light tingling feeling inside your tummy. If it feels like an itch you can&#039;t scratch, that&#039;s really good. Don&#039;t try and scratch it, keep tickling it and making it itchy. If you\u2019re not feeling anything, don\u2019t start pounding away.<br><br>If you do all this correctly, you should be feeling a pleasant tingling in your tummy that can (if you\u2019re lucky) spread throughout your body. With practice, you can make this tingling reach a climax, and experience a dry prostate orgasm.", "time": 1676008157, "resto": 69905479}, {"no": 69908841, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)00:50:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69908830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69908830</a><br>Once the prostate is full to bursting with fluid, you can end the session with a wet, ejaculating orgasm. Simply press a bit harder, still taking care not to drain it or lose concentration. I prefer to lie on my front for this part, since it provides a wall for you to press the prostate against. You should start getting sensations that remind you of a regular penile orgasm, except you\u2019ll feel them in your prostate. Chase those sensations the same way as you do with penile masturbation, and you can create a wet orgasm.<br><br>After a dry prostate orgasm, I typically find that I feel very \u2018cuddly\u2019, for lack of a better word. It doesn\u2019t have the same sudden drop in happiness that characterizes a penile orgasm, and I\u2019ve taken to using a body pillow mainly so I have something to squeeze afterwards. For what might be similar reasons, I find that really romantic porn is a lot more effective for prostate sessions.<br><br>Bear in mind this all takes a LOT of practice, experimentation, and the right tools.
