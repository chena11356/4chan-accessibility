It&#039;s basically a slave trade deal with european youths going to other countries in exchange for a nice vacation. Most farms they give you lodging, you can sleep and eat there.

It isn&#039;t something that happens overnight like flipping a light switch. It&#039;s years of choosing comfort and refusing to subject yourself to an additional stressor (exercise or dieting). Being full feels good. Eating increasingly large portions of fried, processed, greasy, sugary &quot;comfort food&quot; goyslop makes them feel good. Physical inactivity feels &quot;good&quot; to them, activity is strenuous and only becomes more so by the day as they get weaker and heavier. They have little energy, and are emotionally dependent on food and inactivity to cope with the other more unavoidable activities in their day.<br><br>The hardest habits for most people to form are also those which don&#039;t have an immediate reward. If you&#039;re fat and you diet for a day and aren&#039;t instantly skinny, their weak minds start writhing in agony and questioning what the point of depriving themselves for a single day was. It may take days, weeks, months, or years to reverse the damage they&#039;ve caused, and for most people hitting any form of obstacle and discomfort is enough to make them turn tail and run. Same goes for working out. I know plenty of 40-something skinny-fats who aren&#039;t necessarily lazy and gluttonous, but are putting on weight because of their inactivity and metabolic changes. They&#039;ve never exercised, never been to a gym, hate the feeling of physical exertion and will do pretty much anything to avoid it.<br><br>There is a point of no return in my opinion. Either you&#039;ve developed healthy habits and are in shape by the time you&#039;re 40, or you never will be. Sure there are probably exceptions, but good luck building baseline muscle over age 40. Good luck reversing half a lifetime&#039;s worth of bad habits over age 40.

They have near absolute mind control abilities.

The demons are gnostics. They tell you to be your own god, and to seek self enlightenment. They are the serpent who told eve to eat the fruit of knowledge. That knowledge I assume was the knowledge of physical incarnation. It taught us ego, selfishness, and suffering. They tell you things to stroke your ego like you&#039;re special, or you&#039;re chosen, and the suffering they inflict on you is helping you grow spiritually. Don&#039;t believe them.

The symptoms point to another diagnosis\u2014that the bullet, together with the particles of cloth and bone, caused an abscess of the lung. As long as this abscess was sealed off, it would produce fever and pain in the chest. The abscess would spread gradually, the fever rise, and chills and fever would alternate with profuse sweating. Finally, the pressure of the abscess and the digestive power of the pus would cause a perforation into a bronchial tube. Through this opening the pus would drain and be coughed up with blood. The severe strain of the coughing and the sudden emptying of the abscess cavity would leave the patient feeling faint and exhausted, but soon afterward the fever would drop and he would feel relieved.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A period of relative well-being for Jackson would follow, lasting as long as the connection between the abscess and the bronchial tube remained patent and draining. Then the only discomfort would be caused by intermittent coughing spells which brought up bloodstained mucus.

Weight loss is 95% diet, and lifting during weight loss is preferable because it burns calories easier, and if you build any muscle (which is possible to do in a caloric deficit with enough protein) it will raise metabolic rate while it naturally declines with the decrease in weight, so it&#039;s the best of all worlds. Cardio just makes you hungry and gives you better physical endurance.", "time": 1675449020, "resto": 69825979}, {"no": 69832978, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:40:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69832836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69832836</a><br>I did this and hers mogs mine now.
