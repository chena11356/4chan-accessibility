We either do what Reactionaries want and go back int time and devolve technologically or we choose the Third Political Position (Fascism was Third Position, but this time a new Third Position doesn&#039;t have to be Fascism). We apply Eugenics. We apply different standards to medicine and how to save a life. Not life itself should be valued, but the quality of life. We allow full screenings of the embryo, before birth and educate parents on their choices. Allow free terminations and financial compensation for degenerate life. Humane forms of ending a suffering dysgenic life through euthanasia.<br><br>Also very important is to stop the dynamic of women being able to access a replacement-husband through the collective or still having the right to access a man&#039;s resources without his consent (like through alimony and divorce).<br>So the best way to do this is to keep the current life partnerships like we have, but in addition to that offer a &quot;traditional marriage&quot;.

But with women it really fucks them up in how collagen is produced it seems. I think because of the differences in collagen formulation between the sexes. In men it&#039;s like criss-cross in how it forms, in women more like straight lines.

If it stems from being insecure about being a woman, make sure she knows that there are things only women can do and that being able to depend on men is a privilege. There is absolutely no shame in being the home caretaker. In fact that role should be celebrated. As a priority avoid anything that might overload the competitive tick that tomboys already have. Have fun and avoid having her exposed to mockery for lacking in male traits like strength, a high paying career, etc. This is where I find tomboys always get pushed over the edge into feeling they need to be men to compete.<br><br>I&#039;ve had one FtM tomboy recover with the process above.

I am the first guy you replied to, ignore the other shitposter <br><br>Here is some info on it <br>What are the risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea?<br><br>Certain anatomical characteristics are associated with an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea. They include:<br><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neck circumference larger than 17 inches (43 cm) for men</span><br><br> and 16 inches (40.5 cm) for women<br> Structural changes that prevent smooth airflow through the nose, such as a deviated septum<br> Certain variations of facial anatomy such as a short/recessed jaw, or an enlarged tongue or tonsils<br><br>Weight: A body mass index (BMI) exceeding 35 confers a significantly increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea, although people with a BMI below this level can still have the condition.<br><br>Age &amp; Sex: The highest incidence of sleep apnea occurs beginning in middle age. Men are at higher risk than women, at least until women go through menopause.<br><br>High Blood Pressure: those with obstructive sleep apnea are more likely to have high blood pressure. This is because untreated sleep apnea itself can cause high blood pressure.<br><br>Family history: If one or more of your parents have sleep apnea, that increases your risk for developing it. You inherit some of your facial and other anatomical features.<br><br>Drugs &amp; Medicines: Other things that can exacerbate sleep apnea include alcohol use and other sedating drugs or medicines. These can cause increased relaxation of the tissues that contribute to airway collapse, and also make the brain less sensitive to the signals that would normally cause someone to wake up and breathe.<br><br>https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blo<wbr>g/a-basic-guide-to-sleep-apnea/", "time": 1670991406, "resto": 69250790}, {"no": 69251437, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:18:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69251396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69251396</a><br>A big chest is also a factor.

A better idea would be to stand some distance away from a lightning rod, thereby ensuring that the lightning strikes the rod and not you.<br><br>Now onto the main point.

Ask the recruiter if you need to pass a prerequisite physical test before getting a ranger contract and shipping out to basic. Test yourself now and see what areas you need to improve on, don&#039;t settle for bare minimum scores, you need to be as close to max as possible so you have enough of a buffer when you&#039;re being tested.

Except that Ronnie had better genetics, muscle shape, insertions, small joints, muscle separation, small waist etc. which made him look more impressive at similar sizes. And overall better genetics for gaining muscle naturally, probably one of the best ever known. His top 99.999% genetic ability to gain muscle naturally is what allowed him to be superior to every other pro bodybuilder once he started taking the same drugs they did after he competed natural at the 1992 Mr Olympia. He surpassed them all easily within the space of 5 years, and dominated the Mr Olympia for 8 years to become the best bodybuilder in the history of mankind. <br><br>This is freak outlier genetics. Once in a lifetime. Most other bodybuilders once they reach the Olympia stage are already maxed out and don&#039;t really change all that much from year to year. Whereas Ronnie piled on at least 70 more pounds of lean tissue AFTER his first Olympia in 1992 where he competed naturally. This is unheard of at the Olympia level, and indicated subsequent commencement of muscle building steroids and growth hormones after the 1992 Mr Olympia in which he was a natural athlete.<br><br>Just a reminder that Ronnie got to the Mr Olympia stage in 1992 naturally.

You all have worth and value. We all keep expecting to be something and become somebody. And it never feels right. Those goals don&#039;t get met. It leads to depression, rejection, stress, and sadly suicide. So why do we keep trying to be someone, when you&#039;re already you? It&#039;s vital to stop trying to be something that&#039;s loved and start loving yourselves. If you met yourself, wouldn&#039;t you get along? You love the same things. Have the same sense of humor. Have the same upbringing and outlook. You have a heart. You&#039;re not bad people at all. So stop trying to be something you&#039;re not and love the person you are. If you need guidance, follow the things you love. It may not lead to riches and things, but you love this stuff for a reason because it&#039;s simply part of you and uplifts you. That&#039;s a life, living in what you love. And I truly believe love is a little peek into heaven and God. And following what you love is your destiny. It&#039;s why it&#039;s in you to begin with.
