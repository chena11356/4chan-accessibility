I read one of those books once on a whim in my college library, and the reasoning literally was &quot;thin people can eat what they want and still stay thin, so it&#039;s muh genetics&quot;. Fatties fail to realize that thin people&#039;s &quot;eating as much as you want&quot; is still less than 20% of what a fatty eats when she spends a day eating what she wants&quot;. Thin people don&#039;t have an unhealthy relationship with food. Thin people don&#039;t eat to feel better after a rough day, or when feeling lonely, or when being unhappy that they have diabetes at 30. Thin people don&#039;t start fantasizing about which lunch they are gonna get at 11am, but fatties do all of these things. So they just blame outside factors and claim weight is the same as a fucking eye colour and they claim forces outside of their control (comically enough there is a very large overlap of &quot;my fat is because of genetics&quot; and &quot;but gender is a social construct though&quot;), which means they are not doing anything wrong and can just continue to eat as they want<br>Also look at the fatty reasoning when they want to tear down fit people &quot;oh man, they must be missing out on so much good food in their life!&quot;. They literally equate all the worlds joys to sitting on your ass and stuffing your face, just passively having your sense of taste tickled. They are junkies, plain and simple.

You need to stack you hands over your elbows, straight wrist, like your fist is punching upward toward the ceiling. I cannot even begin to describe the wrist and forearm problems this is going to cause you over time (pinched nerves, tendinopathy, muscular imbalances in forearm), and biomechanically its not optimal at all. This level of instability generally is also really not good. The question is: what do you want from lifting? Do you want to claim you can lift the most weight by any means even if you&#039;re doing it in a way that WILL seriously hurt you eventually? Or do you want to actually train your whole body by taking form seriously and doing this lift in a stable way? Do you want to build muscle and proper strength throughout the whole movement? Do you want to train stability?<br><br>On top of all this, you do not have the shoulder mobility to be doing this. Look at how your low back arches to get your arms overhead. This is a sign that your shoulder joints aren&#039;t able to extend to 180 degrees (overhead) and you&#039;re making up for it by arching/leaning your back. Not only are you gonna seriously hurt yourself over time (herniate/slip a disk, pull muscles) when you do this you lose all the brace you should be having in your core, which is probably one reason why you&#039;re so fucking unstable in this press.<br><br>Do butchers blocks to build shoulder mobility, and for god&#039;s sake stop the ego lifting--- cut the weight to 1/4 that and do it slowly with control to build strength and stability throughout the whole movement.

The consumption of carbs and very high amounts of protein leads to significant insulin spikes to send your body into survival mode, which forces it to use glucose for all of its needs. This is not ideal, as it also disables your body&#039;s autophagy (protein recycling and dead/zombie/extra cell cleanup) and diminishes your body&#039;s ability to repair itself by allowing atrophy from lack of proper recycling. The high blood glucose also leads to glycation, which means your veins and the cells connected get a nice dusting of sweetness (blood had carbohydrate-bindable spots on it&#039;s outer walls that get taken up by excess glucose, leading to disfunction. Insulin spikes also lead to insulin resistance and diminished glucagon, which means your body&#039;s ability to tap into itself for energy is greatly impaired. Over time, this leads to metabolic disease (type 2&amp;3 diabetes), which causes most of the leading causes of death. It&#039;s quite amazing how the advent of the calorimeter lead to the pushing of sugary garbage all because the Atwater system declared falsely that the human body is better suited to consuming lower calories, which means fats (which are classified as being more energy rich despite being less dense) were demonized and carbohydrates, especially the white, toxic, addictive, evil sugar, were suggested instead based on this arbitrary measurement. These recommendations were made BEFORE insulin was discovered. It&#039;s archaic and false to count calories and it has lead to the obesity epidemic and most modern illnesses, with the rest being from consuming plant and manufactured toxins. Humans were big game hunters until recently. Our prey has massive fat stores and we have 4 organs dedicated to fat consumption. You cannot digest more fat than your body produces bile for.

So I simply told her that she has plenty of tools available if she\u2019s serious about it and she has plenty of time to make significant progress. Without hesitation, she said she\u2019s not interested in using any of that equipment and she just wants to dance to lose weight because that\u2019s what\u2019s fun to her. So I asked her what is supposed to be fine about losing weight, and if that\u2019s the case it sounds like she\u2019s not very serious and she\u2019s just complaining to hear herself talk.

They worship niggers like Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson and the late Mike Tyson while attacking the whites who actually built their country before niggers took over. Their movies are filled with niggers and their music charts are topped by niggers. They send niggers to the Olympics and celebrate when the niggers win because those niggers are true red blooded american niggers. They watch nigger porn to a point where &quot;BBC&quot; does not make them think of an international media company but about nigger penises instead.

Never did hear that name much. His and my great grandpappy worked together on a plantation back in &#039;64. Grandpappy kept a journal about &#039;ol Shaw. Shaw could carry a week&#039;s worth of cotton to the market every Friday and he came back with 5-6 bucks. Grandpappy handled the financials of it all, what with the business end and such. Shaw just loved using his brute strength. In a particularly hot June around this time back then the slaves started getting mighty ornery under this fella by the name of Big Tariq. Big Tariq was the meanest sumbitch you never did see, 6&#039;5 and weighed heavier than his silverback cousins. Stronger too. Didn&#039;t care much for the master nor the breaker. We sent Big John out to deal with him, as he approached the slave quarters he could hear a mighty big party going on. Big Tariq had stolen a few white flour cakes and decided to have hisself a little ol shindig to tease John. John didn&#039;t take too kindly to this. They got to tussling and as John went for the Suplex-Cock to finally break this buck, Tariq had something different in store. In a flash with great negroid strength he flipped John over and went to town. Big John never did break wind after that. Shaw was on the porch sippin tea when he see John coming up limpin harder than a cripple. Grandpappy didn&#039;t hear nun what was said but he saw that Shaw was livid. Figures John told him what happened. Shaw flew into a blind rage. Shaw must&#039;ve flipped 5 or 6 full cotton carts. Grandpappy says he could&#039;ve cleaned out all of Chiraq, he was so &#039;ornery. Shaw started running off to the Slave Quarters, muttering &quot;Niggers gotta learn he place, can&#039;t do that what for to a good honest white man. It&#039;s time to be great.&quot; Shaw come to call big Tariq out. Tariq laughin and hollerin but big Shaw didn&#039;t find nothin funny. Shaw tackled him. Picked him up and must&#039;ve thrown him 20 feet in the air. When he landed Shaw jumped right on him.

Tariq didn&#039;t believe him, afterall he was the pride of the negros. Big Tariq got to usin his thunder arms what to wrestle Shaw off but the most particular look came across he face when he musta realized Shaw couldn&#039;t be beat. Looked like a man who&#039;d just seen a premonition of his own death. Shaw forced his head in the dirt and got to tearin heself and Tariq&#039;s clothes off. Grandpappy told him not to be too rough, Big Tariq could work 10 fields of cotton in a day. Big Shaw say &quot;Niggers need to learn, you done raped your last white man boy, it&#039;s time for a Double-Decker-Shaw-Classic dunk.&quot; Shaw reached down and snapped Tariqs legs. He went on squealing and screaming in pain. Shaw got up hard as a rock and ran back about 100 yards. He come a runnin like a train, must&#039;ve been a mile a minute. Shaw jumped up when was 20 yards out and in mid air got his cock good and straight. Tariq scrambled away like a madman trying to get away but Shaw was too fast. He came down like a Cannonball. He broke that buck so hard that Tariq&#039;s pelvis shattered into a million pieces. Never did look a white man in the eye again. I suppose Shaw&#039;s just keepin the family name in style.

When Wheels went to do a quick set of deadlifts, Shaw sneaked behind him carrying the bar. You&#039;d never seen a 400-pound man move so quietly.
