I just wanted to take a moment to talk to you about the importance of exercise and how it can positively impact your life.<br><br>Exercise is not only great for physical health, but it also has many mental and emotional benefits. When you exercise, you release endorphins that can help improve your mood and reduce stress levels. Additionally, exercising regularly can increase energy levels, improve sleep, and boost self-confidence.<br><br>In addition to these benefits, exercise can also help improve your physical appearance. Regular exercise can tone and shape your muscles, give you a healthier and more youthful appearance, and even improve the appearance of your skin.<br><br>I know that finding the motivation to exercise can be difficult, but I believe in you and know that you have what it takes to make it a part of your daily routine. Whether it&#039;s a morning walk, a yoga class, or a dance session, there are so many fun and enjoyable ways to get active.<br><br>I encourage you to give it a try and see how it can transform your life for the better. I&#039;m here for you and will support you every step of the way.<br><br>Take care and stay active!<br><br>With love,<br>[Your name", "time": 1676330721, "resto": 69948273}, {"no": 69949064, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:59:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69948372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69948372</a><br>I don&#039;t actually have a gf anon, I am just trying to prepare for if I get one.", "time": 1676332796, "resto": 69948273}, {"no": 69949098, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)19:02:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69948527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69948527</a><br>Trans &quot;women&quot; are men with a mental illness", "time": 1676332963, "resto": 69948273}, {"no": 69949121, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)19:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hey, you know they say you can tell if a girl is gonna turn fat based off what her mother looks like?

Sand or gravel is cheap or free. Use that for things like lap and load, bear hug carries and zercher squats.

Weighted levitation crunches on one of those big fucking uhh yoga balls?? is gonna let you really extend the abs and slowly control contractions.

Anything good is a fight against entropy. Just imagine a building - to build, say, an elaborate gothic cathedral takes thousands of hours of work by hundreds of dedicated people. On the other hand, to make it collapse, you only need to wait. If it isn&#039;t maintained, it&#039;ll eventually just crumble on its own. Or a plant - it takes a highly complicated chain of chemical and biological reactions and lots of energy input to grow a tree, but it&#039;ll rot and turn back into earth on its own. <br><br>There&#039;s only one single law of nature that goes against entropy, and that&#039;s evolution. It is the other side of the medal that is entropy. Only through evolution, systems that aren&#039;t degenerative can arise and something that isn&#039;t just the path of least resistance.<br><br>But humans don&#039;t like evolution, because it&#039;s a painful thing - it doesn&#039;t improve the world by creating good things, but by forcing bad things to either adapt or be destroyed. And we don&#039;t like it when people get destroyed through evolution. So we&#039;ve invented medicine, welfare, industrial farming etc. to functionally disable evolution in our midst. We have now reached a point where nobody is affected by evolution anymore in industrialized societies. So much so, that people don&#039;t realize that it is still there, beyond the safe walls of our guarded civilization to tear us apart when it can. To start selecting us into the good, adaptable people and the bad ones who can&#039;t adapt. So it&#039;s easy to tell someone who isn&#039;t affected by evolution to just ignore its threat, to give in to entropy - until we&#039;ve degenerated so much that shit hits the fan, society finally collapses and those who didn&#039;t fight the entropy before will now meet its evil twin brother evolution and be selected, whether they like it or not.", "time": 1676301282, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69943895, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:18:19", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "sad swing", "ext": ".gif", "w": 399, "h": 233, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1676301499985698, "time": 1676301499, "md5": "jQKeqlshUqE03NbzpZGSag==", "fsize": 1831106, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69943918, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:20:11", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "fat kid fighting", "ext": ".gif", "w": 450, "h": 337, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676301611958781, "time": 1676301611, "md5": "9GwLhm2ABpOnJVa5zRG+ig==", "fsize": 1382638, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69943921, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:20:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69943726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69943726</a><br>w-where are the toes", "time": 1676301624, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69943955, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:24:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69943921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69943921</a><br>in a jar in a closet in some doctor&#039;s house", "time": 1676301874, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69944082, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:36:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69943208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69943208</a><br>She would be a 10/10 if she were only 200 lbs lighter.", "time": 1676302602, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69944142, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:42:44", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "moving is hard 1", "ext": ".gif", "w": 320, "h": 180, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676302964439502, "time": 1676302964, "md5": "J/UZ/GG6bRD7QOl+1CJ/Rg==", "fsize": 968876, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69944150, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69944142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69944142</a>", "filename": "moving is hard 2", "ext": ".gif", "w": 320, "h": 180, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676303031418437, "time": 1676303031, "md5": "omRVEzpQHliUp8hNficMNg==", "fsize": 736396, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69944161, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:45:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69944150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69944150</a>", "filename": "moving is hard 3", "ext": ".gif", "w": 320, "h": 180, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676303114360686, "time": 1676303114, "md5": "pXkfw1+Oqo8RAKIas+wYlw==", "fsize": 991831, "resto": 69941614}, {"no": 69944173, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69943208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69943208</a><br>This picture&#039;s gotta be like 10 years old now.

No doubt it worked great for Mike because he had the drive to make the program work. The most important thing for amateur lifters is finding a program that works for them. Unless you are competing at an elite level it doesn&#039;t matter if you find a program that&#039;s 5% or 10% better than another.

Then my gf of 3 years left me because I just wasn&#039;t ambitious enough. She was way out of my league and I was a fat Manchild. Became unattracted to me and fell out of love. I stopped being a neet retard and got a real job after that but it took a couple years to realize that pretty much everything that went wrong in that relationship and with my life so far has been from me being a lazy shithead. Didn&#039;t like my body, my fault. Couldn&#039;t find a job, was my fault. Didn&#039;t go to college, my fault. It was one of those moments that kind of breaks you.

A man has to bust his ass to get good in life. He gets married and gains what exactly? A woman who doesn\u2019t cook or clean or bring him any value beyond occasional sex? It opened my eyes, it makes a ton of sense to date multiple women and either they work to show you they\u2019re worth it or they can leave or you dump them, ultimately decide which is most worth spending your life with.

She ended up seeing a therapist who convinced her that all of her emotional problems were because of her unfulfilling life. Apparently her loving husband and two great daughters were somehow the root cause of her suffering. The therapist talked her into thinking that the only way to feel better was to &quot;find herself&quot; and the best way to do this was to play the field. My buddy came home one day to find her getting fucked on the hood of her car by some guy, right in front of their house. They ended up getting a divorce. It really messed up the kids, and my friend was fucked in the head for a while. Fortunately, he coped by lifting, got jacked as hell, and ended up pulling a hotter wife who he&#039;s been with for 15 years.
