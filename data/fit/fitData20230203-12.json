For upper body my compounds are typically calisthenics. Usually stuff on the gymnastic rings. For isolations I do prefer weights because it\u00b4s just a bit easier, that said I fucking LOVE pelican curls and also tricep extensions. They light my arms on fire. I\u00b4ve been trying to pistol squat the past 3 months but I\u00b4m getting kind of bored of trying, as a tallfag it\u00b4s particularly hard so I might ditch pistols. At the moment I\u00b4m just trying to put on more mass but come April or so my goal is to start training for the OAC.<br><br>BTW literally the only people who complain about calisthenics on /fit/ are powersharter lardass faggots.

Bench press is pronated grip slightly internal rotation of the humerus and a protracted scapula. If you bias your musculature to stabilize in this movement pattern, you are going to reduce your ability to externally rotate your humerus and retract your scapula. While you will have developed your pecs to deal with a large amount of load in a bench press position, you will not have the same amount of strength in a dip position as it pertains to a retracted scapula and externally rotated humerus, so your primary mover is able to produce a significantly larger amount of force while the secondary and tertiary muscles do not have the stability to brace against that force, which leads to injury. This is usually how people snap their back, they have a large amount of frontal plane strength which then has significant transfer into the saggital plane but they don&#039;t have the accompanying secondary and tertiary saggital plane stabilizers so they turn and lift and snap their shit.<br><br>I don&#039;t exactly know what you mean by &#039;bad form&#039; on dips, you obviously don&#039;t have the knowledge to understand the underlying biomechanics of the dip to elaborate any further.<br><br>Core strength is not the basis for lifting unless you actually specifically do exercises in a way to train your core as well. If you do any sort of sitting bicep or OHP work, you are not training your core and if you do standing bicep work, you must do bilateral exercise to bias your core. To bias your core in pulling movements, you must bend over to do reverse flyes or to do bent over work.

It seems complicated but is actually straight forward once you familiarize yourself with the neurochemistry and molecular biology. Simply put, A Niacin deficiency causes low tryptophan, because your body uses (through a very inefficient pathway) tryptophan to make NAD when niacin is absent. When your tryptophan is low you end up with insufficient brain serotonin levels. The result of low serotonin in the brain? Dopamine hyperactivity: characterized by poor impulse control, impaired decision making, and increased susceptibility to addiction. Guys, this is it, the supplement which can help us to master our impulses for good. As an added bonus Niacin also boosts HGH, test, and improves sperm quality.

My mother always used to scold my sisters for using too much of it and she was damn right. A tiny bit can make a pretty woman glow up even more, but the way young women cake themselves nowadays and ruin their skins is fucking disgusting. A girl wearing tons of makeup is an instant red flag because it hints at both insecurity and disingenuoity. A pretty girl will look pretty without any makeup and an ugly one will look like shit even if she&#039;s covered in inches of it.

Pretty much anything you do in a gym that isn&#039;t cardio will train mostly fast twitch fiber; even if you&#039;re doing 30 reps you&#039;re still challenging the muscles anaerobically, not aerobically. Slow twitch gets trained through long, sustained efforts where your muscles are working aerobically (aka CARDIO) but according to most fitness &quot;experts&quot; doing high reps somehow trains the slow twitch fibers instead of the fast twitch ones, which makes no logical sense if you think about it for more than 5 seconds.", "time": 1675387803, "resto": 69822904}, {"no": 69825168, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)20:40:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69825057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69825057</a><br>And I&#039;ve even seen people claiming that you should use both low and high reps because &quot;you need to train both the fast and slow twitch fibers for maximum muscle growth.&quot; Now obviously you should vary the rep ranges in your training because of exercise selection (eg sets of 5 on lateral raises is probably not a good idea, same for sets of 25 on deadlifts), but this claim is extremely retarded even assuming that high reps train slow twitch muscle fiber since slow twitch fiber doesn&#039;t even grow that much, it just gets a fuck ton of extra mitochondria.

At the moment my diet is pretty bad imo, not unhealthy but not conducive to fitness. My diet pretty much consists of oily vegetarian dishes with a lot of refined carbs e.g.pasta, noodles, bread, rice. Mainly pasta dishes and curries. My main protein sources are eggs &amp; whey. I want to eat less of these useless carbs because even when I eat a ton, I end up ravenously hungry again after like an hour. I&#039;m just not feeling inspired as to how to go about fixing it, can /fit/ make some recommendations? I&#039;m not opposed to adding meat into my diet, I just don&#039;t know anything about it i.e. what cuts to get, how to prepare and cook it, how much to make etc., I was raised in a vegetarian household so I never learned any of that stuff. I just want to recomp but I&#039;m finding it difficult to eat at maintenance since I&#039;m fucking starving all the time because my diet is almost all carbs", "filename": "le funny thinking face", "ext": ".gif", "w": 96, "h": 95, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1675339573585624, "time": 1675339573, "md5": "8k/Vq7QKw9DS6hyxcaXSKg==", "fsize": 52042, "resto": 69811989}, {"no": 69816860, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:08:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69815165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69815165</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my maintenance is around 1600-1800</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wouldn\u2019t i also lose muscle</span><br>If you&#039;re lifting, your TDEE would be higher.
