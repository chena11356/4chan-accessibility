It has been 25 days since I last ejaculated, and now I do not get erections passively at all, it is always flaccid, even with porn, I still can&#039;t get an erection. At least my confidence has skyrocketed and people say that I have changed for the better. Now, should I keep abstaining from masturbation until 2023 or take a crack at masturbating in a week? I am literally going insane. I have also been cutting the calories down since no doubt my weight is impacting my erections, and apart from having a smaller fat pad, nothing has changed despite dropping 10kg. I will keep cutting down to 85kg and I hope something changes.<br><br>I have also been lifting heavier weights at the gym for fewer reps and I feel way more exhausted and winded than I was prior.
