It used to be a pretty safe place compared to other prisons around the US. However with the influx of drug cartels and human traffickers across the border it quickly filled up with countless Mexican gangs. The prison quickly descended into chaos with non-stop fights and drugs somehow getting into the prison. It looked hopeless till one day Brian Shaw got arrested for carving swastikas on a gym&#039;s mirrors and throwing medicine balls at random minorities that tried entering. When we got him into the prison he looked almost happy to be there. Maybe it was the free food or free gym we thought, but that wasn&#039;t the reason. As soon as he stepped into the yard he snapped his cuffs with one pull, walked up to the biggest Mexican there by the name of Joseph, grabbed him by the throat, and slammed him through a table. We tried tackling him but he just shrugged us off and walked to the cafeteria laughing hysterically. Word got around quick and the Mexicans got together all their shanks and tried to jump him. Brian just grabbed the 5&#039;3 one by the leg and used him like a club to bash them all. It was a blood bath, we had no way of controlling him. That night he turned into Jeepers Creepers. Brian said the cafeteria didn&#039;t have enough protein so he had no choice but to eat his cellmates. He noted since they were Mexican it was spicy and zesty. The next day he had dragged all the black inmates onto the yard and proceeded to do what he called &quot;breaking the bucks&quot;. We had a meeting with the warden and put together a plan with SWAT to take him down. When we got to his cell the bars were completely broken and he had escaped.
