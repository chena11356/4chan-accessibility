CICO as a weight loss diet is bullshit because it just tells people to restrict endlessly until they reach their goals but does not take into account the effects of the type and amounts of food on metabolism throughout the body. Your body can slow, stall, and pause many processes to reduce its energy usage to very low amounts, and it can also ramp up many processes to increase energy usage to very high amounts, including the ability to simply burn off excess energy as additional body heat.<br><br>In response to this, I often hear, &quot;CICO says nothing about health! It&#039;s only a principle of weight loss!&quot; and to that I say that&#039;s exactly what makes it nothing more than a useless bullshit platitude. Your body is not a closed system nor is it static, what you eat greatly impacts how your body behaves and calories mean very little to any of it because your stomach isn&#039;t a furnace. Yes, of course you can TECHNICALLY lose weight eating low enough amounts of anything, but you&#039;ll end up wrecking your metabolism and starving yourself into weight loss. If you change what you eat you can lose weight while eating to complete satiation.

There are connotations to this term which are not intended because I\u2019m not talking specifically the Bible, believing Christfag stuff or performing those rituals associated with Christianity. The term is an attempt to describe a higher thing prone to abstraction.

Think of all of your five senses, and how we to take them all individually and at face value. We hear a song lyric in passing, we see a color with a symbolic meaning, appreciate an artwork that evokes emotion inside our soul, feel a texture that reminds us of something, a friend in passing says something off the cuff. Generally it gets thrown into our short term memories and thrown away to make room for something else. We don\u2019t think about it, because it\u2019s all \u201cjunk data.\u201d However it all adds up into one collective whole that where if you were imagining a radio, that jumble of sensation would be like tuning in to a specific frequency.", "time": 1671373622, "resto": 69285840}, {"no": 69297361, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:28:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69296665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69296665</a><br>The human mind is an antenna, capable of receiving these frequencies. Even transmit them through action and word, to the Universe at large. However it is incredibly taxing; mentally, and emotionally. Constantly worrying about it drains the batteries so to speak. Most people are tuned out and living with individual sensation and not collectively. It\u2019s just hard to do so all the time so it gets rerouted into the subconscious, manifesting negatively as mental illnesses: anxiety, depression, phobias, complexes. There is a converse to this. Being tuned in and having that full battery can result in successes, useful introspection, manifestations of desire, and downright seemingly unfair entropic manipulations, even if we aren\u2019t fully conscious to it.

In simpler terms: we fuck up and get fucked up all the time. Overthink it and run out of batteries, hamster at the noggin wheel fully exhausted. However God is not wrong, and has never been wrong, although we are blind to the greater implications and consequences of where He leads, hence hindsight being 20/20. Think of every time you messed up and went &quot;oh I shouldn\u2019t have done that&quot; but you did it anyway.

In fact this whole thing is turning into a thesis on chaos magick and I\u2019m not intending to go into it atm. I could go on forever.<br><br>This shit\u2019s getting wordy. Following signs. <br><br>When I met her, I had found a quiet place without any electronics, distractions, or anything else that would get in the way, and just spoke. Talked about whatever was on my mind from good stuff to every anxiety and fear, and asked even the air around me to give me a sign, direction, or heck I\u2019d settle for a compass. And it did, in a laughably literal way not very long afterward, and into one stupid event I follow right down to one butterfly effect. I met her from it, and her name is a pun, within a pun, and was a sign. I was tuned in and saw it immediately and said to myself this person will either be the greatest heartbreak of my life so far or the best thing that ever happened to me ever. She\u2019s still both. <br><br>From more pragmatic standpoint, good luck is opening the door when opportunity knocks and that\u2019s about 80 percent of learning anything or getting anything. I will direct you to a short article by Richard Wiseman called The Luck Factor. Just put what you want, what you NEED out there. With your voice and your actions. You don\u2019t need a gf, you don\u2019t need sex, you don\u2019t need the world to like you, be rich, famous, fucking whatever. You\u2019d be very surprised with how little might inspire you to make a massive change. You\u2019d be even more surprised by what you realize that you need.", "time": 1671373835, "resto": 69285840}, {"no": 69297409, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:33:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69296665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69296665</a><br>Okay, anyway.

Your best bet is a 3 day hypertrophy routine until you hit 1/2/3/4, you&#039;ll still see strength gains (albeit slower) and you&#039;ll pack on mass much faster than you normally would on a lower rep range strength routine. Do not fall for dogmatism and absolutism, if you want to grow a muscle isolate it. As for the diet, cut until you see your abs.

More preventive than curative.<br>- Moderate Increase in Testosterone.<br>It&#039;s a Hormone Optimizer.

Because the Wythanolides, the molecules that have the desired effects can be dosed differently.<br><br>I will personally always recommend a Full-Spectrum extract over others methods. It&#039;s better.<br>If you&#039;re after a specific effect, like for some people they take it to relax and sleep better, then you don&#039;t need a full-spectrum extract, you need one that&#039;s made specifically for that effect.<br><br>The one I use, and can recommend is the KSM-66 Extract.<br>There&#039;s 2 versions, the Full-Spectrum and the Vegan one. Go for Full-Spectrum, so avoid the KSM-66 extract tha says it&#039;s Vegan.<br><br>KSM-66 is a standardized extract.<br>It&#039;s going to be the same exact product, no matter which distributor you chose.<br>It would be the same product if you bought it in Asia or in the west. <br>So you can switch distributor and have the exact same product.<br><br>Frequency : Once a Day. Usually in the Afternoon. Or before sleeping if it&#039;s to help you sleep better.<br>Do read the label on the speciic product you bought.<br><br>Dosage : Follow the recommended dosage on the pill bottle.<br>Usually it&#039;s a single pill, once a day.<br>Usually it&#039;s 500mg or 400mg of KSM-66 extract.

I kayak and fish, I camp more often. But more than that is just an attitude of positivity and curiosity and interest. Read Mans Search for Meaning and compare it to messages in the Big Book. And the Big Book itself is lifted from mostly the New Testament. Read Matthew, especially 5-7. Read the Bhagavad Gita, read an intro to Buddhism and its 3 schools.<br><br>I think the only boring people are those without openess or curiosity and those who are negative without solutions or defences.", "time": 1671620210, "resto": 69323672}, {"no": 69327257, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)06:00:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69327098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69327098</a><br>Or, OR, just drink pommegranate juice?

Those who had diseases that progressed usually had a few years left to live, though those last 2 years I&#039;d hardly call &quot;living&quot;, it&#039;s essentially waiting in a hospital bed until your lungs or heart give out.<br>You know what all those kids had in common?<br>I never met one who was bitter about their situation. They were sad, or frustrated at times, but never bitter. They all had dreams and aspirations as any other kid would.<br>One wheelchair bound kid I was friends with for a few weeks in a facility could barely stand outside his wheelchair, but to him the important part was that he could somewhat stand, sometimes even take a few steps. So, for the short time I knew him, he tried every day. A good third of the times he&#039;d collapse, pull himself up into the wheelchair on his arms and try again.<br>These kids taught me a lot, and while I was blessed to be able to live a relatively normal life (as in I don&#039;t need a caretaker), I never quite forgot them when I am lazy or can&#039;t get the motivation to do sports.<br><br>Because how could I in good concience waste a gift that I have that these kids dream their entire life of experiencing?<br>How could I look into their eyes and tell the kid who fights daily just to be able to stand that I, who can walk up stairs, can&#039;t be bothered to exercise today because I am lazy?<br>I couldn&#039;t. And so I don&#039;t.", "time": 1671586784, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323947, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:40:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323916</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hassan</span><br><a href=\"#p69323927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323927</a><br>Shut the fuck up you ur u a gay", "filename": "1659691947005285.web", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 1040, "tn_w": 76, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671586825041628, "time": 1671586825, "md5": "nSak4SC7stXdVONEiaWAWQ==", "fsize": 1352500, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323960, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:41:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323811</a><br>I really want to fuck a younger woman I used to have a huge milf fetish<br>Only until fucking my ex a 31 year old almost about to hit the wall roastie<br>It felt like I was fucking granny", "time": 1671586905, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323967, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:42:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323941</a><br>This made me emotional<br>I hope you achieve your goals brother", "time": 1671586966, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323981, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:43:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323941</a><br>I once was in love with a girl who suffered from cystic fibrosis.

Whatever man, let&#039;s say you can completly devolop eye to hand coordination after a certain age with training(which you can&#039;t). What about speed, punching power? You cannot deny that shit is mostly genetic. Anyway, the point of this thread is, a 150 lbs fighter isn&#039;t gonna take down a 250 lbs mass monster in a street fight. No matter how much he trained. I&#039;m not against training or anything lmao obviously it&#039;s very important and it has it&#039;s benefits but THAT is just not gonna happen.", "time": 1671477880, "resto": 69307658}, {"no": 69309934, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:28:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69307658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69307658</a><br>write a movie script in which the guy on the left gets superhero powers and the guy on the right is the villain. that&#039;s pretty much the only scenario in which your absurd fantasy would be believable.", "time": 1671478118, "resto": 69307658}, {"no": 69310053, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:41:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69309934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69309934</a><br>I don&#039;t know who is the guy on the left, but skinny guys like picrel will rape all your villains.", "filename": "1652797158502", "ext": ".png", "w": 520, "h": 325, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671478871424835, "time": 1671478871, "md5": "nVdGhuB9obv/nPR43VafaQ==", "fsize": 144001, "resto": 69307658}, {"no": 69310179, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:56:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69309903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69309903</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I posted a article that proves my claim</span><br>No you didn&#039;t lmao you posted a blog by Joelle that just says &quot;children learn hand-eye coordination.&quot; In fact, it even contradicts you.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hand-eye coordination develops in children naturally over time and can be improved with practice.</span><br><br>How can one person be so delusional?

We studied two explanations for this apparent resistance to diet--low total energy expenditure and underreporting of caloric intake--in 224 consecutive obese subjects presenting for treatment. Group 1 consisted of nine women and one man with a history of diet resistance in whom we evaluated total energy expenditure and its main thermogenic components and actual energy intake for 14 days by indirect calorimetry and analysis of body composition. Group 2, subgroups of which served as controls in the various evaluations, consisted of 67 women and 13 men with no history of diet resistance.<br><br>Results: Total energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate in the subjects with diet resistance (group 1) were within 5 percent of the predicted values for body composition, and there was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in the thermic effects of food and exercise. Low energy expenditure was thus excluded as a mechanism of self-reported diet resistance. In contrast, the subjects in group 1 underreported their actual food intake by an average (+/- SD) of 47 +/- 16 percent and overreported their physical activity by 51 +/- 75 percent. Although the subjects in group 1 had no distinct psychopathologic characteristics, they perceived a genetic cause for their obesity, used thyroid medication at a high frequency, and described their eating behavior as relatively normal (all P &lt; 0.05 as compared with group 2).<br><br>Conclusions: The failure of some obese subjects to lose weight while eating a diet they report as low in calories is due to an energy intake substantially higher than reported and an overestimation of physical activity, not to an abnormality in thermogenesis.", "time": 1671475710, "resto": 69308779}, {"no": 69309565, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:49:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69308779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69308779</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;group of people with credentials write a paper together stating the sky is green</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything you have observed in others\u2019 experience and tested yourself since the the beginning of recorded history contradicts this</span>", "time": 1671475790, "resto": 69308779}, {"no": 69309579, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:51:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69309555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69309555</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fatties are delusional copers, but you\u2019re supposed to take them seriously when they discuss weight loss methods don\u2019t work</span><br>Trips confirms this", "time": 1671475911, "resto": 69308779}, {"no": 69309580, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:51:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Guys, stop replying.

Steroids are going to addict you and shut down natural test production. You don&#039;t even look bad. Your problem is you put too much focus on your body. Improve your life in other departments, while working out all the time as a supplement. Working out should be a supplement to your life, not your main hobby. Otherwise anyone who follows your way of life will end up like you - insecure and never happy with progress. If you focus on other aspects of your life while regularly working out you&#039;ll slowly, but surely build up a better body with no stress involved. It&#039;s the kind of thing that takes years, and there&#039;s many variables like height, genetic potential, limb length etc. that dictates how you look. Another important thing to consider is that it doesn&#039;t matter how you look like compared to Schwarzenegger, or some roided up TikTok star, what matters about your body is how you look like to people you hang around. You can mog average people with 1 year of progress. You can mog regular lifters with few years of progress. you&#039;ll likely never mog Schwarzenegger, but it&#039;s not like you are going to ever meet him + you can mog him in other departments of your life such as skills, job, money, fashion sense, house etc. So in general my point is that if you gymcel and do roids you&#039;ll be impressive only to other gymcels - at some point average people can&#039;t even recognize that you have this amount of muscles - you just look good and fit to them at a certain level, and after that point a normie can&#039;t tell a difference. For normies people who have many aspects of their lives developed are more impressive than some autist who engages only in one specific pursuit. It&#039;s good to have a &quot;main&quot; skill, but this skill should make you money, so you can have freedom to pursue many things at the same time. Gymcelling doesn&#039;t pay you, so don&#039;t do roids that will addict you, and shut down your test production - it&#039;s absolutely not worth it.", "time": 1671498507, "resto": 69312380}, {"no": 69312862, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)20:11:07", "name": "sage", "com": "<a href=\"#p69312380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69312380</a><br>I still want to lick your belly button and suck your dick.

Pylori and some other stuff. If you have that, they&#039;ll get you to pop some pills and you&#039;ll be home free.<br><br>2. Diet. Experiment with cutting out different foods and see if your breath is still bad. You must note each food down otherwise you won&#039;t remember shit. Don&#039;t eat a particular food for 1-2 days and see what impact it has on your breath (don&#039;t trust your own nose, consult your smell helper).<br><br>3. Water. Drink enough water throughout the day. Your pee should be yellowish/clear if you&#039;re drinking enough water.<br><br>4. Postnasal drip or dry mouth during sleep. Tape your mouth while you sleep - if your mouth is open, it dries up and stinks. Google &quot;mouth taping&quot;. For postnasal drip, just Google it, IDK much more.<br><br>5. Parasites.

From a practical standpoint, you should probably do most of your training in the rep range that allows you to get in the most hard sets per training session and per week for each exercise you use and each muscle you train. This generally coincides with a moderate intensity and rep range for most exercises and most people.<br>3.
