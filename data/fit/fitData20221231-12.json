A few takeaways I learned were that (according to the research):<br><br>1. Runners should lift weights twice a week, specifically on their hard days. So if Tuesday is track work and Friday is tempo, you lift those days.<br><br>2. Weight lifting should be done at least 3 hours after finishing the run. So run in the morning and lift in late afternoon or early evening would be the norm.<br><br>3. Warn up and cool down for 5-10 minutes of easy cardio, preferably non-impact.<br><br>4. Use 3 sets of 5-10 reps per exercise with about 60 seconds rest. Goal is to lift heavy.<br><br>5. Runners who consistently lift twice a week reduce injuries by one third. So, for example 3 injuries over a certain time period without lifting weights would have only been 2 injuries with weight lifting.<br><br>6. Lifting can improve running economy by up to 8%, but most will likely be in the middle (3-5%).<br><br>7. Try to prioritize compound exercises.<br><br>8. Upper body lifts prioritize chest, back, and shoulders for better running posture.<br><br>9. Routine should start with 1 squat, 1 hip hinge, 1 lunge, 1 push for chest, 1 pull for back, and 1 shoulder exercise. Over time, it&#039;s okay to expand the routine and do more than that, but it should at least be comprised of that.<br><br>10. During the taper, you taper weight training as well.

Essentially there are two styles of imperial power: terrestrial and thallasic, land and sea. The US and its predecessor, the British empire, are sea powers, like Carthage or Spain. This leads to a specific type of cosmopolitanism that de-emphasizes local differences between peoples and homogenizes their elites into a single class. You see this with all the obnoxious liberal indians in the UK. <br>Contrary, Germany, Russia, China are terrestrial empires. This as shared typologies as well, usually leading to a stronger central structure than the distributed ones favored by thallasic structures.<br>Rome is an interesting example because it is a pivot: they were terrestrial and greatly feared the sea in their early history, but felt enough pressure through competition/confrontation with Carthage that they ended up taking on many of its traits, with the concommitant social changes that come with it. This is one of the through lines in roman history, as the change from land to sea power leads the traditional roman Gens to lose prominence.", "time": 1672488183, "resto": 69419424}, {"no": 69425014, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)07:14:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69419438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69419438</a><br>There are no cute guys on Grindr<br><br>Even when they are there, they dont like me a lot", "filename": "1_7AzsY3GL9G53twxW9sdgMw", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 460, "h": 276, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 75, "tim": 1672488849610720, "time": 1672488849, "md5": "kL8viVe3DrA4yMQK/agjRg==", "fsize": 32634, "resto": 69419424}, {"no": 69425030, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)07:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69425014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69425014</a><br>Gay dating scene is now the opposite of the straight one bro - twinks now pair up in high school and longhaul it until one of them gets bought out by an older guy. <br>Anyone you see on apps is either a closet case who won&#039;t date or already dating someone just looking for side dick.

In addition to this mechanism, the glycocalyx is where NO, a highly potent anticoagulant, is synthesised (indeed, there are a host of anticoagulant actions which require a healthy glycocalyx to function). This means that, when damage occurs, the endothelium shifts towards a prothrombotic state", "time": 1672479447, "resto": 69424108}, {"no": 69424189, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)04:38:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69424183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69424183</a><br>It would not be possible to review all the factors involved in thrombus formation and breakdown, as this is a highly complex process. So it may be most useful to look at three important players: von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibrinogen, and Lp(a) to review their impact on thrombi.<br><br>These three factors operate in very different stages of coagulation. vWF has a key role in formation of the initial platelet plug, fibrinogen is the raw material of the final \u2018fibrin\u2019 clot, and Lp(a) is critical in thrombus breakdown or lysis.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Von Willebrand factor</span><br><br>vWF is a glycoprotein required for the formation of haemostatic \u2018plugs\u2019 and arterial thrombi. It binds to platelets, factor VIII, and collagen in the underlying artery wall.<br><br>A meta-analysis of patients admitted to hospital with major adverse CV events found that they had significantly higher vWF levels. The difference in CV risk versus those with normal levels of vWF was very nearly 50% [24].<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fibrinogen</span><br><br>Fibrinogen has a key role in the final act of thrombus formation. After the platelet/erythrocyte plug has formed, strands of fibrinogen link to form fibrin, which wraps around the plug, binding it. This is the final step in the clotting \u2018cascade\u2019.<br><br>A Scottish study of risk factors for coronary heart disease showed that high levels of fibrinogen were associated with a greatly increased CV risk, for both men and women [25].<br><br>In a more recent meta-analysis, the increased risk was independent of other CVD risk factors including lipid levels, and antithrombotic and other medications, such as aspirin. It is of interest that the risk of ASCVD was much greater in patients with type II diabetes, who have higher levels of other pro-coagulant factors [26\u25aa]\u201d.", "time": 1672479508, "resto": 69424108}, {"no": 69424194, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)04:39:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69424189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69424189</a><br>Lipoprotein(a)<br>The issue of Lp(a) is complex, but important. Lp(a) is identical to LDL, apart from the attachment of an additional protein, known as apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)).<br><br>This apparently small difference is highly significant, because apo(a) is virtually identical in structure to plasminogen. The key difference is that apo(a) has different folding structure (kringle) at one end. It is this \u2018folding\u2019 difference that turns apo(a) into, effectively, \u2018antiplasminogen\u2019.<br><br>Plasminogen is incorporated into all thrombi as they form. It is inactive until it is converted to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (TPa), which is an enzyme synthesised by endothelial cells. Once TPa has triggered this conversion plasmin lyses strands of fibrin, essential for the breakdown of thrombi.<br><br>However, if there is a higher concentration of Lp(a)/apo(a) within thrombi, this blocks the action of TPa on plasminogen, resulting in a thrombus that is highly resilient [27].<br><br>Lp(a) also binds to TFPI. Thus, Lp(a) can stimulate clot formation and make it more difficult to remove the resultant thrombi. A raised Lp(a) is associated with a tripling of CVD risk [28\u25aa\u25aa].<br><br>Why does Lp(a) have this function? Linus Pauling first hypothesised that, because humans cannot synthesise vitamin C, which plays a key role in the production of collagen, a lack of vitamin C will lead to a breakdown and \u2018cracks\u2019 in blood vessel walls.<br><br>Lp(a), which is almost exclusively found in animals that cannot synthesise vitamin C, binds very strongly to the endothelium. and the underlying arterial wall, creating thrombi that are particularly \u2018tough\u2019. This reduces blood loss, allowing the animal to survive until sufficient vitamin C can be consumed [29].<br><br>However, this protective role is a double-edged sword. As Lp(a) can also drive the formation of thrombi which are more difficult to lyse. This, in turn, results in accelerated plaque formation.", "time": 1672479570, "resto": 69424108}, {"no": 69424195, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)04:39:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is that a based AMD substack quoter I see?", "time": 1672479582, "resto": 69424108}, {"no": 69424197, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)04:40:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69424194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69424194</a><br>Haemophilia<br>To briefly examine this area from a different perspective, it is worth looking at people with haemophilia. A recent study found that the relative risk of CV events in haemophilia was around one third of predicted risk. The authors concluded that \u2018haemophilia protects against CVD\u2019 [31].<br><br>INTERFERENCE WITH REPAIR PROCESSES<br>Endothelial damage, clot formation and repair, represents a continual process. This is highlighted in people who smoke \u2013 who have a significantly higher risk of CVD. Smoking leads directly to glycocalyx damage, reduced NO production and bioavailability which, in turn, creates a pro-coagulant and inflammatory environment [32\u25aa].<br><br>This damage can, in turn, be measured by an increase in microparticles \u2013 the breakdown products of endothelial cells. However, smoking also stimulates the production and release of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which cover over areas of endothelial damage, driving the healing process [33].<br><br>Therefore, with smoking, increased damage and repair occurs simultaneously. This means that damage to the endothelium/glycocalyx does not necessarily lead to (accelerated) atherosclerotic plaque formation.<br><br>However, if the repair systems are impaired, or the damage is simply too extensive, plaque formation/growth will occur. This is probably why, as people become older, and the repair systems become less robust, a risk factor such as smoking becomes more significant [34].<br><br>The conjecture that reduced repair is as important as damage is supported by the fact that low EPC levels are an initial sign of endothelial dysfunction and represent one of the early signs of ASCVD.<br><br>Of course, EPCs do not represent the only repair system(s). But it is clear that protection against ASCVD requires a positive balance between repair and damage.

Gently, I would kiss her neck and earlobe for a few minutes to warm her up, followed by assertively pushing her onto the bed face-down. After removing whatever underwear she may or may not be wearing, I&#039;d kiss and lick up the back of her legs, starting from behind her knees all the way up to her anus. Then, I&#039;d use two fingers to scoop a generous glob of strawberry frosting from the tub, whisper to her a promise that she&#039;s going to love this, then slowly start working it up inside of her butthole with my fingers.

Finally, I&#039;d grab her wrists so as to keep her pinned down while I bury my tongue tonsil-deep into her butthole, insisting that she push the strawberry frosting out of her anus and into my mouth while I swallow as much of it as I can.

Basically a coming of age time for them where they can fuck around while they&#039;re young outside the community, see the world, do dumb shit, fuck around, find out, then decide if they want to go back. Details and terms for that vary by community. They usually do go back, which I&#039;m not surprised about because it&#039;s really smart to let the youth experience whether or not the grass really is greener.

I own a couple pairs of their 888 fit (straight tapered) and one of their 777 (slim tapered). If you&#039;re choosing between IH and Momotaro, definitely go with IH. A pair of heavier weight IH will last you for years as long as you aren&#039;t using it for your extremely dirty manual labor job (not that they couldn&#039;t handle even that). Their denim actually goes up to heavier weights such as 21 oz and 25 oz whereas Momotaro from what I&#039;ve seen only goes up to about 19 oz. The great thing about this is that since their weave has a very distinct immaculately straight and even quality to it, this gives an incredible heavy weight denim that is surprisingly soft compared to other japanese denim companies such as Momotaro which typically have more slubby, uneven weaves that result in a more rough texture. On top of all this, IH has a more traditional, western/american appearance that strays away from the more clean cut appearance that seems to be common amongst a lot of japanese denim producers. <br><br>On the note of cuffing your jeans, its entirely up to you whether you like that aesthetic or if you want to get your jeans hemmed by a professional to match the length of your legs.
