At 23 I had a college girlfriend I knew I was going to marry, I was on my way to a better job than anyone in my family had known, and I was about to graduate college. By 24 the relationship had failed, I had finished college but was working as a janitor and living with my parents, and lived in the sticks where there were no opportunities or women. I was angry. I raged every day working as a janitor; the vision of her living a fabulous life, doing the job that I encouraged her in and her family discouraged, while leaving me because my career didn&#039;t take off... I burned. I continue to have a much more practical, even bleak view of people. But it also made me see my own shortcomings. I started going after what I want with discipline that I did not have before. I got into grad school. That didn&#039;t pan out. I kept going, taking low paying jobs, saving money, applying, working out, learning to talk to women and make friends. I became strong, and fast. I was smooth. I got into medical school. Two bad relationships in a row. Finished medical school. Now working as a doctor, and with a woman I love. It&#039;s the best relationship I&#039;ll ever have. Keep going, lads.

But a true sense of fashion is built to your tastes. Your aesthetic is a combination of details of your clothes and accessories, and that can show off some of your personality. It is also reflective of non-clothing things like your hair. Personally, I hold onto some of the wannabe skater days of my youth, so I will roll up to work in business casual (collared shirt, dark wash jeans or dark chinos, and a leather wristband with slightly longer wavy hair).

The mind seeks consistency in all things, even that which it creates. The moment something is out of alignment or unexpected, it creates friction in thinking and often activates the sympathetic nervous system (fight-flight response).

Write down what you consider your most important story of the day/week. Read it again a few days later and interpret it. Look for those negative things you want to improve.

To explain it just look at your feel good hormones. Oxytocin, Serotonin and Dopamine.<br><br>When you have sex with a girl you have a deep relationship with, you feel good afterwards since you get a lot of Oxytocin, a hormone you wouldn&#039;t get with porn since you need physical intimacy with another person and a feeling of togetherness. <br><br>You also get Serotonin, another feel good hormone that you get when you manage to get a romantic partner, somebody who cherishes and enjoys your company. And it feels like you are doing something god intended for you to do so it feels even better. All you get while jerking off in this aspect is the post nut clarity regret since it isn&#039;t real.<br><br>Dopamine increase on the other hand isn&#039;t as drastic in sex as with porn since you have the coolidge effect: When a male rat mates, it will not get as aroused with the same partner as it did the first time. If you give that same male rat a new partner it will be as aroused as the first time. Your brain can&#039;t really differentiate between getting to a real orgasm or a cheap orgasm. And since you can look at different porn everytime you jerk off, you will get more dopamine then having sex with the same girl in the long run. <br><br>BUT, your other hormones will not get stimulated, meaning as time goes on your primal need for intimacy will not get quenched and while a normal relationship may experience a reduction in sex, you will still masturbate every single day, since you need the thing it would normally give you, but doesn&#039;t, officially making you an addict.<br><br>Add to that the negative side of frequent heavy dopamine releases. You thought this drug was for free? No man, it will cost you your motivation which is regulated by prolactin.

It makes them feel more worthy of taking the prize and if it comes to confrontation they are better eqiuped to handle the stressful situation.

It&#039;s borderline unnatural for a guy to &quot;approach and seduce&quot; a woman. Ironically, the male fantasy of &quot;girls finding me so hot they approach me&quot; is what women want to - she gets to choose her mate.<br><br>As much as I love modern conveniences, a lot of things we do are primal and sex is in the upper percentile. You didn&#039;t use to &quot;approach&quot; women. You either fought some other guys and took her as a prize, or you got vouched by the community you live in as a desireable guy.

Mingle with crows that have women, socialize with just about everyone using the context (school, office etc) and do mildly-dumb, attention grabbing stuff at the gatherings. Don&#039;t be afraid to make a fool of yourself - within reason - because that says you have enough going well for you to afford doing so.<br><br>If over 25, you need to treat women like girls anyway. Be mildly interested, never show too much availability (as you got better stuff than her to do, so she&#039;ll want to be in the &quot;better stuff category&quot;.

Aim to consume at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day, and focus on high-quality sources such as lean meats, eggs, dairy products, and plant-based proteins.<br><br>Engage in regular strength training: To build muscle, you need to progressively overload your muscles by lifting weights that are heavy enough to challenge them. Aim to include a variety of exercises in your workouts, such as squats, deadlifts, press, and rows, and aim to increase the weight you lift over time as your muscles adapt.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don&#039;t be a sissy and use the same weights for weeks</span><br><br>Get enough rest: In order for your muscles to grow, you need to give them time to rest and recover between workouts.

The, once my life settled down, I actually fell into a good, constant routine and actually made some decent gains. Then i had a kid and lost most of them. Now I\u2019m back at it with renewed purpose.<br><br>The point I\u2019m trying to make here is life is full of twists and turns. Me personally, I was accomplishing so much outside of just working out that I didn\u2019t seriously start lifting until I was 30, though I had already been working out on and off for ten years at that point. In that same time I had girlfriends, went from incredibly anxious and awkward to more mellow and self aware, gained confidence in myself, gained and lost friend, went to school, etc. None of these things in my life had to do with lifting in and of itself, but it was just a on and off constant I had in my life if I needed to do something right for my body and mind. Lifting isn\u2019t going to accomplish much on its own, but it does teach you how to stick with and work at something that can be incredibly difficult to do. Just keep building yourself up as a person and you\u2019ll be fine - you have time and don\u2019t get impatient and think this will all happen overnight.<br><br>Honestly, if I had your build at 18, I would have been fucking slaying left and right.

Some examples: for shoulders I do 4 hard sets of seated DB OHP (rep range anywhere from 6 to 15), some drop set shenanigan lateral raises because they give me a sick pump and 3 to 4 sets of rear delt flys. One big compound, two isolations, 11 or so hard sets total. For legs I do squats, then leg press and then whatever &quot;small&quot; exercise I feel like. If I dont feel like squatting I say fuck it and just go really hard on leg press and vice versa.<br>Chest is a good example because I do some benching, sometimes flat bb bench, sometimes incline db bench, whatever I feel like.
