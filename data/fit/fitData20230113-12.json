The spike protein is then formed in these areas.<br><br>The vaccine, if contained within the arm, could be ok. But it does not stay there, it goes all around the body, reaches the organs in some cases, tells them to produce the spike protein. The body says why is this (your organ) producing a foreign invader and thus can attack your own body then.<br><br>This isn&#039;t a difficult thing to understand.<br><br>Even worse, the virus is made of many proteins. They could have made a vaccine based on a safer protein, but no, they made it based on the most dangerous one.<br><br>Why? Because they essentially fucked up. And that is why vaccine trials and testing are required, and having an &quot;emergency use vaccine&quot; should be for that cause only AN EMERGENCY. <br><br>A case of you&#039;re gonna die with this virus, but this vaccine you have a little greater chance of living.

If you are having sex regularly with someone and never mention it until they get you pregnant, that is definitely a betrayal of trust even if you&#039;ve both agreed that she can have as many partners as she feels she needs to be comfortable.<br><br>Edit 9: FYI, taking responsibility for the child does not make me any less of a man than you, actually it makes me more, so kindly fuck off please and thank you!<br><br>Edit 10: This is Chuck&#039;s mother. Our entire family is devestated to say that he commited suicide last week in his bedroom.

I would assume it offers some benefit but that is a total guess. I personally run a DHT derivative because it allows me to push test a little higher once added in, without needing a true AI. I can go from about 1g test/wk without AI with no mast in a stack, and after adding mast can bump that to 1.2-1.4 without issue. Trying to run 1.2-1.4 test otherwise gives me god awful side effects. As for ratios, I don&#039;t think ratios are as important as guys make them out to be. Actually let me rephrase that, they are important, but the individual variability is so wild with ratios that some guys might be fine running low test crazy high 19nor, others might have the worst time of their life.

No consensus in notions that yet seem to be of vital importance.<br><br>From Day 1 of my journey in the weightlifting world, I tried to apply the following: 4 sets of 8 (or 10, or 12) reps. If I&#039;m aiming at 4*12 but I&#039;m under 6 in a specific set (whether it is the first or the last one) I deload.

When I started lifting early January after my 10-day break, I felt muscle soreness a bit but this week for example it completely faded away again (even though my training has been exactly the same in terms of intensity and volume). I feel no pain in any part of my body when I exercise, and I&#039;ve already been to gym with some experienced lifters who saw me benching and doing some exercises. I ASKED them to tell me if my form was correct, and they did say everything was okay. So I really do not understand.

I was fat as fuck and a depressed sack of shit going into 2021. My long term gf left me, I was jobless and aimlessly spinning my wheels in life. I managed to find work again and spent the next year getting fat, unhappy and drawing away from anyone in my life. I was drinking very heavily. Last summer I weighed myself for the first time in almost 2 years. I was 310 pounds, had to buy bigger clothes and was spending every night alone, miserable and eating myself to death for brief feelings of comfort. At my lowest I had set a handgun on the table loaded and stared at it for an hour wondering if it was all even worth it. Then a friend reached out to me and offered to be my gym partner as he had been going for a couple years at that point. I accepted and bought a membership that day. Since then I&#039;ve been consistent and I&#039;ve passed 1/2/3/4, stopped drinking and have lost 30 pounds. I have much more to go but my progress has put my life back on track. I found my friends again and now we&#039;re closer than ever. I&#039;ve never had an interest in running but now it feels like I&#039;m free from the prison i turned my body into. I run for a mile and a half a day now. And every day i get better. I used to not even be able to walk far without sweating like a pig. Now at the end of my cardio sessions, I find freedom in sprinting to the finish. The shackles I hung on myself feel like they have been left behind. I now am starting a business with my friends and my old clothes fit again. I&#039;m in better shape than I have been in years. My whole life is turning around thanks to heavy lifting. Now at 280 pounds I can for the first time do 3 pull-ups in a row. I&#039;m well on my way to reversing so much h of the damage I&#039;ve done to myself. The biggest help you can ever have is yourself.

The rings allow you to get a ridiculous stretch on your pecs that you can&#039;t really get anywhere else unless you have a cambered bar or a good machine chest press, and you can also fully adduct the humerus on ring pushups unlike normal ones. Though you can do deficit pushups and deep parallel bar dips I find that deep ring pushups and dips tend to feel much better on the joints due to the fact that they accomodate for your build, and for whatever reason even ignoring the joint stuff there&#039;s something about the rings that just hits different. I get insane pumps even with low reps and much greater DOMS than the fixed counterparts, and I end up being much weaker on the next press in my workout presumably due to my chest experiencing greater fatigue.<br><br>Anyway, I believe that rings are an investment. They won&#039;t be that good for hypertrophy initially because you won&#039;t be able to control them well enough, but over time as this improves they become incredibly good motions surpassing most traditional chest builders. Now looking at the pulling movements, I would say they aren&#039;t that much better than the bar versions but there&#039;s also no barrier to entry since the stability requirements are non-existent compared to the presses, so you can get a good session in on those from day one.<br><br>Besides all this, rings allow you to train your entire upper body, so they&#039;re valuable if you have periods of time where you can&#039;t go to a gym, so even with the negative points about them this alone should be reason enough for everyone to own a pair since they aren&#039;t that expensive for how much they do for you.", "time": 1673598345, "resto": 69579593}, {"no": 69579870, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:28:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69579593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69579593</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;seated good mornings are to squats what RDLs are to deadlifts</span><br>i like most of what you said but why would you do them seated", "time": 1673598495, "resto": 69579593}, {"no": 69579873, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:28:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69579609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69579609</a><br>He&#039;s is the short form of &#039;he is&#039; or &#039;he has&#039;.<br>For example: &quot;Don&#039;t be scared - he&#039;s very friendly.&quot; <br><br>His is a possessive pronoun, it is used to show something belonging to or connected with a man, boy or male animal that has just been mentioned.<br>For example: &quot;Mark just phoned to say he&#039;d left his coat behind.&quot;", "time": 1673598530, "resto": 69579593}, {"no": 69579875, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:29:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I pooped myself", "time": 1673598544, "resto": 69579593}, {"no": 69579884, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:29:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;pullovers are mandatory</span><br>Dumbbell rows are better", "time": 1673598589, "resto": 69579593}, {"no": 69579914, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:35:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69579870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69579870</a><br>Seated good mornings change the muscular emphasis from glutes and hammies to glutes and adductors, plus due to not being limited by hamstring flexibility you can go into much greater hip flexion that resembles the bottom of a squat moreso than other hinges.

I do pull-up/dip/push-up/inverted row variations for upper body. The Recommended Routine from r/bodyweight fitness is unironically good start (inb4 go back). The harder part is lower body. I do squats and deadlifts by combining a heavy kettlebell, weighted vest and heavy exercise bands. For squats you you can do 1 legged variations to nearly double the resistance you get from your weights. You can try finding a cheap 40/48kg bell. I add bands to deadlifts to increase resistance as much as I can. My bands go up to 60kg (have measured it), with a 40kg bell that&#039;s already 100kg kg in the top position, and you can double up bells and/or bands. Doing this has actually driven up my barbell deadlift during a 1 year break from them. Also, sandbags might be the cheapest option for weight. I bet you could even go 100% bands only if you use heavy enough and bands and stack them. This would be pretty cheap, versatile and very portable. The only negative I can think of is a lack of linear resistance (this is why I combine them with at least some weight), but how much this really matters is still up for argument.<br><br>Stay creative.

Apparently, the kind of hair loss that occurs with fasting can also occur with keto, calorie restriction, bariatric surgery, pregnancy, and other events that cause major weight loss, and is a type of temporary hair loss called telogen effluvium. Clumps will fall out resulting in thin patches (nothing like pattern baldness however) but apparently it comes back eventually. That being said, it gives me pause as my hair has always been my strongest physical feature and I would hate for it to fall out and have to take a million supplements to get it back almost to where it was before just because I wanted to lose weight and overall better my health with fasting. This kind bums me out, not gonna lie. If I were an older guy or suffering from genetic male pattern baldness anyway, I wouldn&#039;t really care, but I&#039;m still relatively young (30) and I am burning to finally lose this weight ASAP, get ripped, and feel good about what I see in the mirror for once in my life, as well as address some other health issues through fasting. I might be overthinking this, though, but to an insecure wizard the idea of damaging my hair does freak me out a little bit.", "time": 1673534478, "resto": 69514687}, {"no": 69570160, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)09:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69530760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69530760</a><br>You heart will explode if you won&#039;t change these numbers", "time": 1673535443, "resto": 69514687}, {"no": 69570225, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)10:05:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does OMAD decrease muscle mass?

Fructose, which is contained in sucrose, is a little bit different. It&#039;s metabolized differently from glucose. The other issue is that if you&#039;re already fat especially if you have prediabetes or something like that there&#039;s already being a huge blunting of your insulin response and likely raised levels of fasting insulin so fasting and eating a diet focused on fat and protein can overtime help bring that insulin response down. Now then if you go back to eating carbohydrates of course there&#039;s a bit of a rebound but all in all the difficulty of getting fat when you&#039;re a real Chinese peasant eating rice and whatever meat is available is the scarcity of calories not the high carbohydrate low fat content of the diet.

I am so much better than you its not even funny. I have 3 kids under 4 years old. I wake up at 445 to go to the gym or do some sort of household chore every single fucking day to take care of them before I go to work, after work, I have about an hour or 2 to spend with my kids before they go to bed, sometimes that includes bath time. The youngest is 2 months old. The oldest is 3. My wife has been pregnant for almost 4 straight years. You are a no nothing little fucking shit. You have no idea what it takes to take care of a family, to care for a pregnant woman, to care for a child. I workout as much as fucking possible. I have a standing desk at work. I walk on my lunch break. I find time to go to the gym before they get up or after they go to bed and I go fucking hard. That being said, whats more important? Looking like Brad Pitt in Troy or being a good father? Sorry, perhaps I&#039;m not as vain as you, but being a good father comes first. Don&#039;t you ever fucking imply I should put my image in front of my family. I&#039;m not the one you wanna attack. I&#039;m not even saying its okay to be a fat shit nasty slob.

You should go out there and make a movie/documentary movie anyways. Just take your camera and go somewhere and find something that means something to you. Whether its the people or the story, or the streets. Just start putting it all out on &#039;&#039;film&#039;&#039;. Like capture that essence, of all those feelings. Exorcise it as you see other people go through them, talk about them and you can show it. In the end, its all about that. About what&#039;s real, what&#039;s raw, what actually hits the soul. You can do it. Even if you just do it like as a personal gripe, out of personal spite. Just go out there and start filming shit. It&#039;s not that deep. Maybe you follow somebody&#039;s story etc. <br>Build on something that purely satisfies your ego from a creative standpoint. I get you need to make money but you can still do it on your free time. You decide if you release the videos, the movies, the doco if you make one. <br>IT really is more &#039;&#039;easy&#039;&#039; than you think if you just take it step by step, day to day.

You don&#039;t have to make money out it. But it feels to me like you&#039;ve lost the passion for it. I been demoralized too about personal or professional achievements. Many doors closed on me.
