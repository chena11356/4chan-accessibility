Meals consisted of scrambled eggs (add whatever you want, I used ham, cheese, onions and tomatoes) or sandwiches, or some combination of the two, and then a bunch of vegetables on the side: spinach, carrots, sugar snap or snow peas, tomatoes. <br><br>But that wasn&#039;t enough protein, so now I cook a bunch of chicken every weekend. Meals are chicken, hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese, and all the same vegetables as before.<br><br>Also started having a snack or two around midday, so not strictly OMAD before. Usually just plain greek yogurt with 5g of honey.<br><br>For exercise, I didn&#039;t do anything to start, other than walking dogs 30-60 minutes every day, which I have always done. Its better if you do exercise/lift, but its not strictly necessary to lose weight/fat. To me its easier to change one shit habit at a time than multiple, and I didn&#039;t mind losing muscle mass, I just wanted to get unfat first. I know how to put lean mass back on, so not really worried about it. Last couple of months I started doing pullups and hanging leg raises every day, plus adding in one of pushups, OHP+ lateral raise with kettlebells, or goblet squats. Thats mostly to ease my body into working out again before I start lifting more seriously, since I hadn&#039;t done shit for seven years.", "time": 1671807550, "resto": 69348248}, {"no": 69349197, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)10:07:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fatrell here.

I wish they would redo this study with pure cane juice and refined white sugar, but it appears that the denatured molecules of refined sugar are seeking minerals to create homeostasis and teeth are made of minerals so they just pull from whatever is near them.

I hit 33 next year, and I can honestly say the past 3 years &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all of my 20s, and I consider them the best years of my life. This is coming from someone who DID sleep around in college.<br>Sex when young sucks. It&#039;s all hormones and insecurity. Your fantasies don&#039;t play out like you think they will. Sex is messy and you are ALL up in your head about it. If you managed to have sex tomorrow, you might think the skies will turn blue and your insecurity/depression will go away, but in all honesty, it wont change how you feel about life. I know, because I did that: had sex in college, and the next day I was still insecure and depressed and socially awkward. Sex didn&#039;t change that anymore that masturbation did. I learned to fix myself and start being comfortable in my own skin. It took most of my 20s, and let me tell you my 20s sucked dick. <br>I&#039;ve been with my GF for nearly 10 years now, started off horn-dogs then it sort of fizzled out with life and stress and work. Thanks to finally being far into my career and making actual money and being comfortable in my skin (and her in her skin), we actually had a sexual renaissance recently and have been non-stop fucking like hormonal teenagers, it&#039;s actually incredible and about 10x better than our horniest, earliest selves, easily. We both constantly talk about what we want to try out in bed, what we definitely don&#039;t want to try out, what we might be open to- the budget for toys is kinda incredible. Sex is absolutely, infinitely better in my 30s, and I wouldn&#039;t miss my previous experiences at all since they pale in comparison.<br>I say this to dispel the weird notion that &quot;it&#039;s over&quot; after high school/college. You probably have this idea of balding fat dads who hate their wives as the typical 30s, but it&#039;s waaaay far from the truth.

Liver (once every few days), this one&#039;s obvious<br>2. Cow/pig/lamb/chicken hearts - massive cq10 source as well as the usual shtick<br>3. Braising meats (such as beef short ribs/chuck roasts) - you want to consume the collagen in the meat, now turned gelatin, which provides you with fantastic flavour and additional easily digestible protein, as well as helping your GI tract heal from irritation/inflammation. Make sure to drink the braising liquid or reuse for another dish. Can also be done with a slowcooker.<br>4. Ginger (either fresh slices for your tea or cooking)<br>5. Lemons/Limes - do not underestimate the role of vitamin C is collagen synthesis<br>6. Kiwi - one of the most nutrition fruits per pound there is, and vitamin K source<br>7. Banana - banana :)<br>8. Blueberries<br>9. Spices (not spicy) - look up the micros in things like cumin/cinnamon/turmeric/etc, the east knows what they&#039;re doing.

The further north of the equator you go, the less UVA and UVB radiation actually makes it to the surface any time of the year due to the angle of the atmosphere relative to the sun. This makes you need much longer time in the sun to get the same effects, which is even worse in the winter where the angle weakens the sun&#039;s radiation even further.<br><br>2. You need 15-20 minutes of direct southern summer sun with 20-25% of your skin exposed to it, which is not so easy when it&#039;s 10-20F outside all day on a &quot;warm&quot; day and you need to cover up to avoid frostbite. In the winter in the north you might need 2-3 times that amount of time (due to point 1) which means staying outside for up to an hour with no shirt on in below freezing or potentially even below-zero weather.<br><br>3. The sky is overcast almost always in the winter so it&#039;s rare to actually even get direct sunlight that isn&#039;t filtered through clouds in the first place.
