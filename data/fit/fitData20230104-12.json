That fat could have a value of its own, that fat could be, say, evil or pitying, is, of course, a joke. Absurd! For what is fat after all but an accumulation of pounds? And what are pounds? Simply an aggregate composite of cells. Can a cell be moral? Is a cell beyond good or evil? Who knows\u2014they\u2019re so small.

Age<br>For myself, I became more confident and self-assured as I grew older. Especially under 25, most people still have a ways to go in becoming a fully mature adult. <br><br>2. Get out of your comfort zone<br>I don&#039;t mean just go to the gym and work hard, or don&#039;t play video games or some shit. If you really get out of your comfort zone, it will change you. Big experiences that force you to re-evaluate your life and who you are will begin to change the way that you interact with others and the way you feel about yourself. I suppose lots of people do this through travel, seeking out new experiences, martial arts, volunteering etc.<br><br>3. Know your shit<br>When it comes to a specific circumstance. Say you&#039;re a paramedic or a firefighter - if you&#039;re brand new, you&#039;re probably not going to be very confident when you go to a really difficult emergency. But, if you&#039;ve studied a lot, you know a lot, and have plenty of experience you will be less fazed and more able to just act - it hasn&#039;t got much to do with being a confident person, that&#039;s more to do with just knowing what needs to be done at that time, and thus being able to direct other people simply because you have good suggestions. <br><br><br>A couple other things I would mention are:<br>-If you&#039;re not very social, being more social and interacting with lots of different people from all walks of life will help you. <br>-Be careful not to mistake some things for being confident. If you punch someone in the head for some reason, you might feel like a badass momentarily - but you may have unwittingly done it out of insecurity. In fact, I&#039;d guess a lot of people who take lots of risks and get in fights are often insecure.

But don&#039;t sabotage yourself by buying food upfront and &quot;plan to fail&quot;.<br>4) find rewards to give yourself for each additional day you succeed. could be a trip to the zoo, could be shopping for some cool sport-related item<br><br>also remember:<br>day 2 is when your body finishes up with eating the glycogen and switches to using your fat as fuel. don&#039;t quit when the fun has just started!!!<br>day 3 is reportedly the worst/hardest day for anyone fasting. After that you can fast indefinitely.<br><br>Lastly: if you give up early, don&#039;t worry! Fasting gets easier with practice.

Any women who actually experiences back pain should first consider the main cause is an unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle resulting from their poor choices, not something ridiculous like a failure of evolution. If you&#039;re a women with &quot;big tits&quot; who hasn&#039;t already figured out how to control men with them, you likely aren&#039;t a women with good tits t all but a fatty in denial. Breast reductions will make fat women look like they have a hormone dissembalance since the rest of their body won&#039;t match their reduced beasts.

The pro for body recomp is that you stay fit all year round.<br><br>Since noob gains are a thing it&#039;s recommended for beginners to eat at a 300-500 kcal surplus since you will be building muscle faster during the first year and those extra calories will be put to use. As you mature as a lifter you should lower your surplus all the way down to maybe 100-200 kcal surplus a day as an advanced lifter because building new muscle has slowed down significantly.

In terms of fitness I think this is gonna be a technique and maintenance phase. I might end up doing some bodybuilder routine, lots of volume but low stress per excercise. I should learn my cardio as well. <br>Until then, I will be cutting. My winter cards (starting Dec 21 2022) are the empress and the page of cups. So I&#039;ve certainly been exploring my relationships and seeking out a deeper connection to my vulnerabile side. But I do thing with the page, encouraging me to be curious about new relationships, and the empress encouraging me to be vulnerable, I may fall victim to heartbreak. So to protect myself I am going to adopt some of the more healthy coping mechanisms I had when I was younger and more socially successful. Anyway, why I am cutting: Currently 215 and wanna be 195 by valentine&#039;s, at least 200.

I was squatting 465lbs and deadlifting 405 before, and got close to those numbers a couple years after, but the back pain was always there, either a dull pain or sometimes like there was a screwdriver stuck into my spine. What finally has been working for me was stopping all lifting (maybe 1 workout of random dumbbell stuff a week, usually not) and getting into running, like 10-15 miles a week, and golfing. Just running and golfing for about 3 months or so. The past 3 or 4 months I&#039;ve started lifting again, up to 3pl8 on bench, but I only squat 135 for 2x8, and deadlift 135 for 2x8 about once a week, as I&#039;m too worried that I&#039;ll hurt my back again and get set back to square 1, constant back pain all day.<br><br>Once my back pain was mostly gone day to day, I&#039;d still get it when I did cheerleading stunts, but adding in the light squats and deadlifts has really made it feel better and stronger. I&#039;m doing some Jefferson curls with no weights now, like 3 or 4 reps once or twice a weeks and I think that&#039;s helped unlock my back again, since chronic pain tends to lock up any joint, back pain especially.<br><br>Also I stretch my glutes, which are pretty tight usually and a lot of the time that will help if my back starts to ache during the day. My favorite is the ankle on knee glute stretch, not sure of the name of it but you can google it.<br><br>Running I think is the main fix for me at least, I noticed the biggest change when I started to run instead of lift weights. Probably is something to do with the light repetitive twisting motion that happens when you run. If you have chronic back pain, I suggest getting in to running a bit. I started with just a mile, then did 1.25, then 1.5, and after about a month I was up to doing 2 or 2.5 miles at a time 3 or 4 times a week.

I found a free outdoor gym a few suburbs away so I made a habit of going there before work as often as I could. This worked well, there was an elliptical and some equipment for doing arms (I&#039;m retarded, don&#039;t know the names) and a small field. I was doing 1hr on the elliptical, a little bit of arms, then was attempting some jogging in the field.
