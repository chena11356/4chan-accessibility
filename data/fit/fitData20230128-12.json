Are you fat?<br><br><br>If you\u2019re fat, just getting lean allows you to experience a sort of form of nepotism. The world treats you better. People are more agreeable, more patient, more open to you. This is from everyone. Girls, friends, co workers, everyone everywhere.<br>You don\u2019t need money to get lean. Eat less + walk.<br>I recommend working on that. Because the world is a better place when you\u2019re lean than if you\u2019re fat. And it makes certain things not quite as bad. Example: fat retard working at Walmart vs a healthy retard working at Walmart. You\u2019d respect the healthy one more and not look down on him as hard. You then use that retail wagecuck money to get a $10/month planet fitness or youfit membership. Or perhaps you save and build a home gym with used equipment piece by piece.<br><br><br>If you\u2019re already lean then I\u2019m not sure what to tell you.

You can a job that will translate to other work if you leave after your 4 years, and also get paid starting at basic training.<br>Or look for at home work.<br>If you just opt for some job you don\u2019t wanna do like work from home customer service keep this in mind: you literally DGAF about that job. What could go wrong, you end up with a bit more money still in the same place you are now? There\u2019s nothing to be anxious over. If you fuck up who cares?

Briefly, we demonstrated that supplementing with 15 g of gelatin, 1 h before loading, resulted in an increase in whole-body collagen synthesis and increased mechanics and collagen content of human engineered ligaments (Shaw et al., 2017). These data suggest that supplementing with gelatin can increase collagen synthesis. Improving collagen synthesis in stress-shielded tendon might be important as immobilization for even short periods (10 days) has been shown to reduce tendon collagen synthesis by up to 50%, and the decline in collagen synthesis continues out to 23 days (de Boer et al., 2007). Even though the decrease in collagen synthesis was not associated with a decrease in patellar tendon cross-sectional area, the tendon did show decreased functional performance (de Boer et al., 2007), suggesting that decreased collagen synthesis is associated with impaired tendon function.<br><br>This paper presents a case study of a professional basketball player with chronic PT. The player was placed on a program that combined gelatin ingestion and stress relaxation loading as part of a rehabilitation protocol. Of note, even with an extensive playing and training schedule, the protocol significantly decreased MRI reactivity, increased the thickness of the midsubstance of the patellar tendon, and diminished pain. The loading and nutrition protocol presented here therefore could be one component of a rehabilitation protocol to improve functional outcomes in elite athletes.<br><br>https://journals.humankinetics.com/<wbr>view/journals/ijsnem/29/4/article-p<wbr>453.xml", "filename": "full-ijsnem.2018-0231figuref2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 420, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 51, "tim": 1674905109857077, "time": 1674905109, "md5": "6WCHODL6dfdn+TPskMTU/A==", "fsize": 112682, "resto": 69755795}, {"no": 69756505, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:28:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "if youre going to buy collagen make sure its from cows or real animals. not from fish bones from south east asia.", "time": 1674905339, "resto": 69755795}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 69756361, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:02:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Yep, it\u2019s time to lift for my 2D wife.", "filename": "A1E2CEE7-2E9E-4723-BA05-17E812C8941D", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 1237, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 248, "tim": 1674903757972000, "time": 1674903757, "md5": "QOizVy4XJLmHqs9eABEsiA==", "fsize": 1143979, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "yep-its-time-to-lift-for-my-2d-wife", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 69756504, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:28:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69756361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69756361</a><br>it&#039;s the only reason i have the will to do anything", "time": 1674905333, "resto": 69756361}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 69748440, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:35:08", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Natty limit", "filename": "gldbkppuvny71[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674844508515216, "time": 1674844508, "md5": "QRHFs2YXuuHCxRshNQ2EBg==", "fsize": 389223, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "natty-limit", "replies": 77, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 60}, {"no": 69748452, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:36:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748440</a><br>5&#039;4?", "time": 1674844570, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748461, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:37:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748440</a><br>Its actually not but he looks fine regardless and you have body dysmorphia.", "time": 1674844639, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748470, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:38:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748440</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Roiding for this.</span>", "time": 1674844689, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748477, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:38:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748461</a><br>he&#039;s 5&#039;6. besides his chest he&#039;s probably been working out for 3 months he should be way bigger than this", "time": 1674844718, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748489, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:39:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748440</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being natty for this</span>", "time": 1674844776, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748501, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:40:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748477</a><br>3 months isn\u2019t enough to see much progress<br>The fact that you don\u2019t know that makes me think you are a raging faggot tranny", "time": 1674844839, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748507, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:41:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748477</a><br>He is absolutely not 5&#039;6&quot; He is legit a dwarf.", "time": 1674844871, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748510, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:41:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ear", "time": 1674844889, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748517, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:42:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69748477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69748477</a><br>I&#039;m pretty sure he was talking about lifting in his old videos, but I haven&#039;t watched this guy for years. <br>But I&#039;m probably wasting my time since you&#039;re most likely a demoralization shill who tells people to give up if they don&#039;t look like this after 3 months.", "time": 1674844952, "resto": 69748440}, {"no": 69748525, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:43:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "He has been working out for years and has a degree in some meme fitness major.

When you drink little but often, the trap is that you know you should stop, but you convince yourself it&#039;s not so bad because your habit doesn&#039;t have the immediate life-ruining consequences that full-blown alcoholism does.
