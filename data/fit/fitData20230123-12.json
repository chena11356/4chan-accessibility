She had a 10/10 body and an &quot;ass like a nutcracker&quot; as they say. That&#039;s when I realized it. Women are beautiful. :) As I was sitting there imagining the fragrance I understood how badass women are. And she looked like a samurai almost, like a warrior walking like that. Man. It&#039;s like all she was missing was a sword on her back. That&#039;s when I realized how badass women are. They give birth. They workout so hard. &quot;Oh anon but they are so slutty and they party all the time!&quot; Well would they be working out so hard if they couldn&#039;t do that? Honestly we should treat women better. They deserve respect for everything they do. They bleed for us literally. We should worship them. In 1000 years women will be out of reach and we won&#039;t even be aroused looking at them, because for most of history men could just beat whatever woman they wanted and drag her into their cave and breed her. Not anymore. Now you have to earn your stripes. We should honestly give up trying to be so manly all the time and we should just worship them. Let them do all the work while we stay at home. In 1000 years, women will be stepping on us and they will be full of testosterone. And that&#039;s great. Because girls and women are angels. :) I just love women so much bros. Realize this. We should have a religion that worships women. And it will be called The Religion of Women. Give up your possessions and your life for women. A girl just smiled to me as I was writing this.

It\u2019s not just porn and fapping but it\u2019s equally disgusting. I\u2019m addicted to quick instant gratification dopamine rushes. Caffeine, nicotine, food, fapping, porn, weed, etc.<br>It is disgusting. It\u2019s not so much the urge to cum as it is boredom and the above.<br><br><br>For instance, I was once capable of reading an entire book in a day.

Porn and fapping fucks with neurotransmitters. The dopamine and thereafter prolactin cause havoc and lead to the motivation, fatigue, and anxiety compilations I\u2019ve been facing.

Important is, that I start looking towards her, till my nose touch her feet. Now, I start growning, like I have a hard time defending, but in reality, I sniff her cute little feet.

What causes food to be stored is insulin. I lost a lot of weight through calorie counting when I was 18. It literally worked based on my total daily energy expenditure what I ate and then the deficit pretty much mapped up with the number of calories and the 3500 for a pound of fat. Much later in life I had like many people put the weight back on. I tried doing the exact same thing and it did not work at all. I had my fasting insulin level tested and it was higher than many people have even after they&#039;ve eaten. So what I found was that fasting didn&#039;t work as quickly in the beginning but after a prolonged period of fasting the fasting insulin came down and I was able to lose weight basically in line with the calories in calories out. Also if you have fat in your liver or pancreas and either prediabetes or diabetes, fasting is much more efficient at taking that fat out than just eating a typical diet but fewer calories. There&#039;s numerous studies where people on fasting diets versus calorie counting diets have the same calorie deficit but the people who are fasting have lower fasting insulin on things like that. It depends what your goals are. Like if you&#039;re healthy what Arnold Schwarzenegger recommends in his book is basically you eliminate carbohydrate until you&#039;re just out of ketosis you don&#039;t want to be in ketosis but you don&#039;t want to eat more carbohydrate than normal.

During that time, she mentioned multiple times how she actually thought it was really attractive how up front I was at the first encounter. Moral of the story, don&#039;t listen to women like in OP&#039;s post who bitch about men &quot;harassing&quot; them at the gym. It is ingrained into womens&#039; evolutionary nature to be socially indirect as a means to weed out the weak men who do not have the self confidence to lead them. Your success with approaching women in the gym or in any other context is completely dependent on the balance of you meeting her immediate sexual criteria and/or whether you are undeniably confident and charming. Take a risk, shoot your shot, and have the confidence in yourself to know that you will learn from any mistakes you make through this continual process of approaching women", "time": 1674423108, "resto": 69677463}, {"no": 69690400, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:34:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69690375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69690375</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;step 1 be attractive</span><br>Actually, you just have to be average in looks<br>People with zero social skills use the lookism cope to excuse their behavior<br>Good job anon", "time": 1674423278, "resto": 69677463}, {"no": 69690414, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:35:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69677463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69677463</a><br>No you shouldnt.

I just can&#039;t imagine letting oneself get to that point. As a pretty thin person I really stuck out; I noticed a lot of men looking at me, way more than would at home. I can only attribute this to being one of the only thin youngish women on the property.<br><br>A corresponding factor I noticed -- which I never notice in my day-to-day life -- was the prevalence of very high calorie, sugary coffee drinks.

I mean honestly so gross to imagine eating that, but god does American obesity make sense now after seeing how prevalent and how damn popular those drinks are.<br><br>Finally, I will note that I was on the lookout for Disney adults, and was kind of shocked by what I saw. &quot;Disney Adults&quot; are almost all obese and seemingly low IQ.

My guess is that this person used to be terribly diabetic (and still is lol) and had to get their toes amputated because they went necrotic. After that event, it traumatized the man enough to at least start to look into his health. As for scarring, looking at amputations like the one I postulated, the surgical scars are usually more on the top of the foot. They cut down the metatarsals shorter, and then sort of pull up the skin from the &quot;crown&quot; of the foot and wrap it up top. Pic rel. I would really like to find this guy and know for sure.

The only thing you need to understand about that single set though is that it must be excruciatingly difficult and it must be continuous up to the point that you reach momentary muscle failure, whether that be technical failure, absolute failure, positive failure, or you can even go as far as positive, negative, and static failure all at once. So long as you get within 2-3 reps in reserve on a set you have essentially extracted all value that you can from the exercise, but the issue there lies within knowing how close you are to failure, which is impossible to know unless you actually go to failure. By reaching failure, by definition, there is nothing more that you can do. There is nothing left to gain by exercising more, you wouldn&#039;t be able to do more anyway<br><br>Here&#039;s a demonstration of how this is effective<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7p<wbr>H_V0NOtI<br><br>If youve ever done a set like this then you&#039;ll know just how hard it is 60-90 seconds of time under tension until failure with perfect form is optimal and very difficult. When you finish one of those sets, your muscles are fucking FRIED and you simply won&#039;t be able to perform another one. You will lose a ton of strength. Depending on how hard you go, you may immediately lose 20% strength or even more than 50% strength. If you drop the weight and keep going you might not even be able to activate your muscles if you keep going to the point of using body weight. If you&#039;re newer, you might not be able to move your muscles at all afterward. All the &#039;multiple set&#039; thing is, is one set with arbitrary breaks thrown in the middle of it. It&#039;s unnecessary and is a gimmick created by greedy cunts that has no bearing in reality. You can do em if you want, but it&#039;s not necessary.

The results between if you do that vs multiset exercise is exactly the same, the only difference being that you have a chance to overtrain if you do too many sets. Once you get past the point of being able to do 35 reps with bodyweight you&#039;ll need to add more weight somehow though. I just meant that if the lowest possible amount of weight you could move in a deltoid lateral raise for example is your arm, then you would know that you tapped out when you can&#039;t move your arm anymore, not that bodyweight is superior. If you wanted to do bench press until you couldn&#039;t press your empty arms into the air anymore then that would be an equivalent to that analogy. One major benefit of doing the single continuous set is that you same an immense amount of time.

There&#039;s next to 0% chance that you&#039;ll ever harm yourself doing 5-10 second reps with a weight you will tap out in 60-90 seconds with, which is usually around 30%-50% 1rm. Slowly approaching failure also increases your capability to exercise the muscle to a greater degree. Moving slowly allows for you to produce more muscular contractile force (not the same as force applied to joints). By moving more slowly you allow the actin and myosin filaments more time to grip onto each other and ensure that the maximum amount of filaments are being utilized. If you go really hard really fast only a few of them will grab each other, propelling you in the motion quickly, at which point momentum takes over somewhat, reducing the work done by your muscles mid rep. Doing it slower gets more actin and myosin cross-bridging over a much greater range of motion, which theoretically could prevent cases of drastic regional hypertrophy though that specific claim has not been studied yet.

That&#039;s just what the studies have shown. Maybe the subjects never actually reached the point of muscular failure in those studies and just gave up once it got too difficult. They might have just gotten tired, utilizing all of their stored ATP. If the weight is waaay too light then it is possible that they are not stressing the muscle enough to demand greater muscle recruitment. If you&#039;re doing such light weight it&#039;s possible that the slow twitch muscles are going through a cycle. They are recruited then they are fatigued. They then rest for a short period. After they have recovered (slow twitch fibers recover extremely quickly) they are put back into the rotation of recruitment. As they are performing work, other slow twitch fibers are resting. Then those burn out. The other fibers that have already recovered then are fresh again and return to work. You could Theoretically have such strong and developed muscle fibers that the slow twitch ones just continue to cycle like this without having to recruit fast twitch fibers, especially if the weight is particularly low, which appears to occur around the 35 rep mark. You would still get gains from this, but the gains would only be limited to the slow twitch fibers, which are the fibers that are least susceptible to increases in size and strength.<br><br><a href=\"#p69683690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69683690</a><br>Like this guy says.

If you do them slowly and with 0 momentum you&#039;ll notice that your joints will feel even better. The next step in growing greater muscle and protecting yourself in the long run is to analyze your frequency. For naturals, there appears to be an upward limit in protein synthesis capability, though the limit is unknown. Most people will exercise several times a week thinking that if they don&#039;t exercise all the time then they will lose their gains, but it takes 3 weeks (21 days) of inactivity in order to BEGIN to lose muscle unless you are literally bed-ridden or a limb is immobilized. One study, seemingly the first of its kind, also showed that in untrained subjects, they were continuing to see increases in muscle size and strength for up to 20 days after a single bout of exercise. The MAXIMUM that a natural should be exercising is twice per week but many people could still benefit to a comparable degree from exercising only once per week or even less. Taking 10 days off also resensitizes your body to the activation of P70S6K, which plays a direct role in myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis. Taking 10 days off every 6 weeks will resensitize you. So if you&#039;re having issues with your joints you could always do sessions less often and see the exact same gains or even better depending on where you are in your fitness progression. The bigger you become, the more absolute damage you can do to your muscles and therefore the more time you need to rest. As your ability to do damage can increase by 300%+, your ability to recover only improves slightly (around 50% bonus protein synthesis from untrained to elite), thus necessitating that the more advanced you are the more rest you need and not the other way around, which is generally what bro scientists would recommend.

If you&#039;re feeling intense burn, are getting extremely winded, are getting tired after each rep yet are continually able to keep repping, etc. then you are approaching cardio failure. It&#039;s a sort of false-failure, as your muscles are still capable of producing substantial force given a short rest. If you&#039;re experiencing Cardio failure then you should increase the weight so that you reach muscular failure first or utilize rest-pause to continue to rep if you&#039;re close enough to muscle failure that you can reach it within a few more reps.

If you look deeper into that link, there is a section that covers muscle damage. Soreness, swelling, and pain is a good indicator of muscle damage, as well as the amount of strength lost immediately following exercise. These are the two major indicators that you can rely on unless you have access to a medical facility that can check you for creatine kinase activity, c-reactive protein (the marker for inflammation), and a few other ones that I forget. If you have lost more than 50% of your strength, you are not even fully recovered until AT LEAST 7 days after you performed the exercise. If you lost around 20% of your strength and are experiencing DOMS for around 2 days, then you are not fully recovered until around 4-5 days following an exercise. This doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t make gains if you&#039;re sore, but generally that means that you shouldn&#039;t be exercising at that time, despite what other people on the internet would tell you.<br><br>Luckily, the more that you regularly expose your muscles to damage, the more resilient they become. The best way to build muscle resilience is to go to absolute negative failure. Eccentric/negative training disproportionately causes the most muscle damage compared to any other kind of training when you first implement it and studies have shown that after 3 sessions of eccentric training that the amount of damage that you experience is almost 0. By doing regular concentric training though, you&#039;ll experience next to 0 muscle damage after around 10 weeks of consistent training, such that most of your bodily resources can be allocated to new myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis rather than repair.<br><br>Joint and tendon pain should never be a part of resistance training ever at any point.

The localized cardiovascular adaptations are maximized upon reaching that burning sensation or upon failure. If you&#039;ve hit that, then you&#039;re building up as many metabolic waste products as your body can handle or produce at that time, which provides the stimulus needed in order to force an adaptation. Continuing past this point is simply willful masochism. Having more waste products than you can alleviate is all you need to do. By maximizing waste product buildup, you trigger growth of new capillaries at the target site as well as signal adaptation to the mitochondria at the cellular level. Aerobic and anaerobic differentiation don&#039;t exist on a practical level. They are real mechanisms, but at the point that you&#039;re maxing out your anaerobic potential, which always comes first in any exercise that you do, the aerobic system is being maxed out too. <br><br>For the overall systemic affect, you don&#039;t actually need to reach cardio failure to get the systemic benefits of having done cardio exercise, as this is provided by shearing forces on the capillaries and heart. As you are contracting intensely, your muscles squeeze your veins and pump blood to the heart in an extremely efficient manner. This is called the venous return mechanism. As there is a massive increase in blood flow back to the heart and capillaries through this mechanism, they are subject to extreme shear forces, which is what provides the stimulus to provide stronger cell walls to the veins themselves. The massive influx of blood also stretches the heart, as it is engorged with high volumes of blood. This stretching strengthens the heart by the same shearing forces. <br><br>I can go a little more into detail with a few things. There is more to how this works.

For some reason, when the human body does something over and over again, they become WAY more efficient at doing that one particular thing. You can maximize your cellular and systemic benefits to the moon, but if you want to become a great runner for example, then you need to run. This is extremely specific for some reason though. A guy that chops logs all day won&#039;t carry over the specific beneficial cardio adaptations to fighting for example. Why this occurs? I don&#039;t think we have an answer for that just yet, all we know is that it happens. So if you want to become elite at your sport or activity, you need to perform that sport or activity to the most intense degree you can and do it often. Also, skill itself does not transfer between activities. Learned skill is exact and precise. If you get really good at swinging a weighted bat, this skill won&#039;t benefit you if you swing a standard bat. In fact, in many cases it will have a negative skill transfer, actively making you worse.<br><br><a href=\"#p69688317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69688317</a><br>Nah, I&#039;m just a guy that wanted to get into fitness, but didn&#039;t want to waste time with all the bullshit in the industry.

It&#039;s extremely difficult to make sweeping changes in policies and procedures in a university or professional organization setting, as there are extreme risks when changing anything from the norm. Academia is notoriously rigid. For perspective on how bad they are, they are having their athletes doing heavy Olympic lifting multiple times a week and their players get injured in training constantly. They also use weighted equipment such as in the case of swinging weighted bats in baseball, even though this has been proven to have either no effect on skill or at worst a significant negative skill transfer.

Most people could cut the amount of weight they do normally by over half and get the same or better stimulus by just approaching failure slowly over 60-90 seconds.", "time": 1674418265, "resto": 69678829}, {"no": 69689689, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:23:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69688469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69688469</a><br>this is dead on for my experience as well. granted, i have never tried this HIT lifting in the way that it is described, my training is conventional 2-3 sets per exercise, 6-5 exercises, lifting every other day (3-4x weekly)", "time": 1674419003, "resto": 69678829}, {"no": 69689705, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:25:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69678829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69678829</a><br>when I went to the gym on the 4th consecutive day and felt extremely tired and sleepy after the first exercise.

You can also take the exercises beyond positive failure and also do eccentrics to negative failure. Do that once or twice per week maximum for a given muscle group. Dial in your diet. Make sure to get plenty of sleep. Do 6 weeks on, 10 days off, 6 weeks on, 10 days off. If you&#039;re not making gains, add more rest days. At the point in which you need 10+ days between the same muscle group in order to see gains between exercises, you don&#039;t need to cycle 6 weeks on and 10 days off anymore. You can start by doing full body all on one day and then break it up into a split once you can&#039;t complete the entire workout anymore.<br><br>You&#039;ll get either the same or far better results than doing high volume work.

Overtraining refers to the potential to get bigger and stronger through myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis and overtraining means to inhibit that specific process. The repeated bout effect refers to many other physiological adaptations that occur in response to doing the exact same thing over and over again. People can become incredibly efficient at doing specific things if they do them long enough. The most stark example of this ever discovered was when the Hadza tribe of Africa was analyzed. They do more physical activity in a day than most Westerners do in a week, so you would expect them to burn several times more calories based on their activity level, but in actuality, they burned the exact amount of calories that you would expect them to burn based on a simple calculation of their stats such as age, height, weight, etc. This phenomenon is not currently known how it works, but it is theorized that if you perform the exact same thing over and over that the body will deprioritize other bodily process in order to send more resources to the most needed cells. The mitochondria also can become several times more efficient if they are worked continually to a seemingly damned impossible degree. It could be that your mitochondria were drastically increased in their efficiency and thus you were able to carry batteries all day despite having similar size and strength muscles. With how specific the repeated bout effect appears to be, it is unclear to what degree this transfers to other non-trained activities. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic unrelated</span>", "filename": "Golgi Tendon Organ", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 957, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1674432052893649, "time": 1674432052, "md5": "i55BgRelRD1Nw7L8bKfvkA==", "fsize": 101450, "resto": 69678829}, {"no": 69692187, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)19:54:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69690474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69690474</a><br>I had the same issue bro and took a full week of training i do not regret it.

If someone&#039;s failings are moral then all you can do is preach to them, and we know that doesn&#039;t change behaviour.<br><br>Think about logically.

But when I hate things, I research them. Malingering - genuine malingering - is pretty rare. Usually what you get is people who are pretending to malinger because that&#039;s less embarrassing than admitting that they genuinely tried and failed. If I really want to bench 100kg and I really try hard to do it, and I fail - that sucks. But if I pretend that I never cared about it in the first place? That&#039;s why you get unemployed people who say that actually they don&#039;t even want a job. That&#039;s easier to say than that they applied to 40 places and got rejected by every single one, that they&#039;re so useless and fucked up that they literally can&#039;t even get paid labour digging ditches.<br><br>Not all malingering is like this. There is genuine malingering, of course. But open your mind to the possibility that character failings are actually a relatively rare cause of failure. And that&#039;s a good thing. Because if the reason your sister was a fuck up was because of circumstance or experience - we can fix that. If it&#039;s because she was just a bad person, that&#039;s much harder to fix. It&#039;s GOOD that people aren&#039;t bad.

Wicked shin splints, not very fast, the works\u2014I had 4 years of powerlifting with very little running, so my shins and heart were just not up to the task. At one point, I could hardly walk because of how fucked up my shins were.<br><br>Anyway, there&#039;s a few things that worked for me. I went to a dedicated running store where they filmed my running style in slow motion. They found that I tend towards overpronation when I land, so they recommended a few different shoes to solve the problem. Being as I am a big bastard, I opted for a shoe with more cushioning (specific model is the Hoka Arahi 5). This made the shin splints less debilitating, but they were still there.<br><br>I still had shin splints for about a year after this, but there&#039;s a few things I did to mitigate them. For me, massaging my soleus before and after running (mostly before) helped a lot, as did stretching my hamstrings before running. To solve the issue entirely, you need more time on feet, as this will make your bones stronger. I HIGHLY recommend getting a heart rate monitor (preferably a chest heart rate monitor) and running no faster than your max aerobic heart rate (180-your age to find it for yourself). Very slowly build up to 90 minutes of running in 2 sessions per week, then add another day in. You&#039;ll probably need to walk sometimes. If you&#039;re doing 15 miles per week and lifting weights, you will be in good shape in the future.

Doesn&#039;t seem to have to do with lifestyle; I sleep enough, eat right, I&#039;m not fat, I&#039;m physically active, I don&#039;t have any deficiencies etc. It was just that I started feeling worse and worse over a period of multiple years, lack of energy, sleepiness, ED, loss in strength despite working out etc. My wife eventually begged me to finally go to the doctor, thinking that I might have some serious illness. I didn&#039;t think it was a testosterone deficiency, because I had had a relatively high T value in my youth (was measured at ~ 800 ng/dL in my early 20s). Turns out I indeed had it. <br><br>My doctor recommended me not to take TRT because it sometimes causes testicular atrophy and my wife and I were<br>trying for a second child back then (surprisingly enough, my sperm count was - and is - okay and I&#039;m fertile despite my T deficiency). So instead, he prescribed me HCG. <br><br>That stuff does wonders; I inject 250 iu every two days and my T levels have returned to ~600 ng/dL. Still not very high, but well within normal range and I feel normal again. I have fathered two more children since then, so my fertility is decent as well. <br><br>As long as HCG exists, I see little reason to take testosterone at replacement levels. You will achieve pretty much the same result but at the expense of risking testicular atrophy and being permanently dependent on it because you can&#039;t produce any testosterone naturally anymore.

I took 12 wet grams of pasture shrooms (before I grew them) and I ended up laying on my front porch balcony for hours trying to bite the concrete. I know how stupid that sounds but I just wanted to feel it between my teeth. Concrete on a balcony is flat, so I never succeeded in getting to bite it.
