Picture the S axis of a healthy spine. Your swayback must over-project backwards and at a height (high upper body), to counter for the weight pulling you front-ward/down in your legs. <br>You must develop your glutes/hamstrings. I suppose your quads are the over-developed part of your body? Supposing you are fit/have muscle. Otherwise it might be your pot belly or beer gut, who knows or your fat meaty thighs. <br><br>Regardless try and straighten up the weight front to back, upper to lower. <br><br>The Simple way to explain the principle for the solution, the formula is : <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;identify which part of your muscle chain is under-developed/over-developed. Where is the weight causing you to lean back located? If it is not extra weight, is it lack of weight to balance out a harmonious development in another area. Say well developed quads, but no glutes/hammies? </span><br>Then work on building it up to balance, and adjust your posture accordingly, feel for where the loss of balance happens, where in the body does the weight start to topple you fro or back.

My biggest concern is that my forearm will just get stronger instead of my bicep and my bicep will stay not defined and a bit flat as opposed to my right bicep which has always been more hard and round. What i try to do with the 8kg dumbbells is the same amount of reps on my right arm as my left arm because i dont want my right bicep getting bigger while my left arm doesnt.", "time": 1673943394, "resto": 69605756}, {"no": 69626911, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:19:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can some bro give me some pussy eating tips?

If a woman acts on the temptation by seeking a man\u2019s attention who is obviously unsuitable (i.e. a \u201cbad boy\u201d) and actually wants to date him, she may not be ready to sustain a \u201cboring\u201d monogamous relationship with a devout Orthodox man where the household revolves around serving God instead of her emotional feelings.<br><br>In other words, congrats for fucking a whore.", "time": 1673908626, "resto": 69619682}, {"no": 69622263, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)17:39:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69622071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69622071</a><br>Why is Christianity so fucking reddit holy shit", "time": 1673908772, "resto": 69619682}, {"no": 69622265, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)17:39:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69622210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69622210</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cucked version</span><br>Are you some kind of heretic that promotes premarital sex? what did i say that is degenerate?", "time": 1673908775, "resto": 69619682}, {"no": 69622272, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)17:40:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I think one of the trainers is circling my gf <br>and I think my gf likes him too<br>and it doesn&#039;t seem even in a sexual way<br>it looks more like it&#039;s actually some deep romantic feelings shit...like I&#039;ve spotted him look at her all sad and sighing. <br>Don&#039;t know how to feel about this. <br>Meanwhile for the past six months, she&#039;s been acting all moody telling me I don&#039;t give her enough affection and physical affection, constantly begging for me to touch her...<br><br>I dunno I have a pretty low libido to be fair<br>and I am not all lovey dovey it&#039;s true<br>but you&#039;d think she could put that aside.<br><br>Anyways that guy who is definitely married by the way...he&#039;s definitely fixing to do something stupid.

Getting rid of a porn addiction is one thing, everything from softcore videos of european models, to videos of 18 year olds getting facefucked and rimming strange men, this can be resisted with enough mental fortitude, no matter how horny you are. I even had trouble with popular onlyfans models, looking up the free megas of their leaked content. These are model-tier women, doing porn now because it&#039;s so lucrative to do so. They can be resisted. But guys, onlyfans may seriously be my breaking point. I know 5 girls personally who are on onlyfans, that I&#039;m aware of, and each one is cute and I think I&#039;ve crushed on each at different points in time. How am I supposed to quit jerking off when I have a custom jerk-off instruction video from this beautiful girl I was in love with in college? How can I quit looking at porn when I have a requested video of my friends hot little sister spreading her asshole for the camera telling me (the camera) to taste it? They both actually did this shit? Nice girls with good families. It is literally impossible to not look at porn in these conditions. There is no escape. Humans were not meant to live in such times. The temptation is too powerful. I&#039;m a Dostoevsky character but a million times more pathetic. This may end in suicide.

Eat your fruit<br>Fruits contain compounds that help you digest the sugar (its meant to rot on the ground after all) and it&#039;s mixed forms of sugar as well instead of it just being straight up sucrose or something. The fiber also helps regulate blood sugar when eating the fruit on top of those compounds.

The people drinking the juice had better hormonal responses to the juice than the sugar water even without the fiber there to further offset how much sugar is in it. When I&#039;ve seen studies testing fruit against other carb and sugar sources it almost always wins.

You have a stronger neuromuscular connection with it, so you can activate it better, and it feels like you are working it.

You need to do a movement that isolates knee extension. Sissy squats and reverse nordics are probably the best option because they hit the rectus femoris in the lengthened position, but both of them are very hard on your knees (I&#039;d favor the sissy squat as the reverse nordic seems to be even harder on the knees) so you shouldn&#039;t use that much volume (which is fine anyway because 3 sets is more than enough to fuck up your rec fem). Other than that leg extensions work too, but you&#039;ll need to do a lot more volume as they&#039;re the most challenging in the shortened position which is generally less stimulative (Use intensity techniques like partials, drop sets, myo reps etc on these so you don&#039;t have to do as many).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;forearm training is very important for aesthetics, large upper arm but small lower arm looks very unaesthetic</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reverse curls?</span><br>Reverse curls are money, they&#039;re the most bang for your buck forearm exercise.

Plus especially on bent over flyes the hardest position is the contracted position, there is very little tension in the bottom position. On powell raises there is no tension in the contracted position, but there is tension in the stretched position. Anyway, you would need to do a lot more of reverse pec deck to get the same stimulus as powell raises, but if you prefer it then by all means do it, just know that you will have to accrue a lot more volume to get the same effect.

And besides this most &quot;accessory&quot; lifts tend to be 1 exercise for each major muscle group involved in a compound lift (as an example for bench, pec flies for chest, front raises for front delts, pushdowns for triceps), typically done something along the lines of 5x10 or 3x12 (big sandbagging due to static rep ranges, and because they&#039;re &quot;accessories&quot; people don&#039;t push them hard anyway, and they wonder why their arms are shit 4 years later). This also means that many small muscles that are both vitally important for injury prevention and aesthetics get entirely neglected (The most forearm work you&#039;ll find in a strength program is some grip work, which is mediocore for forearms at best due to its isometric nature and the fact that it only targets 1 part of the forearm. You&#039;re lucky to find rear delt work at all, and external rotator work is much much rarer still. Nothing for the lower traps, or thoracic erectors, both very important for a thick back. Upper traps is more common but still not that common. Adductor work is rare but becoming less rare as people realize how important adductor work is for preventing tweaks when squatting. Calf work is almost never present either but if it is there isn&#039;t much volume and it&#039;s half-assed. Abs are either skipped entirely or are trained very lazily because muh squatz and deadz are enough right guys?? Upper chest is there sometimes but not all the time, and biceps tend to be an afterthought since they don&#039;t contribute at all to the big 3.

The problem lies in the fact that the earlier sets in a static rep range are much easier, while the ones later are much harder. Rep ranges are better because you can use consistent effort, for example if you&#039;re doing a 5x5 on squats your first set could be 4 reps from failure, second 3 reps, third 2 reps, fourth 1, fifth 0.5 (could do same reps with a little more weight). Numbers are just an example but you get the point. Meanwhile on a 4x8-12, you might get 11, 10, 9, 9 but every set could be roughly 1 rep from failure give or take a little for example. If you tried to go to failure on your first set on a 5x5, you wouldn&#039;t be able to get 5 reps on the next set, so you will always be quite a few reps from failure on that first set.
