I start by doing 10 sets of an exercise (40-60 second rest period between sets), and switch to 8 sets with an increased number of reps before rotating back to 10 sets. Gains are starting to come fast and my level of endurance continuously surprises me. I think doing low intensity cardio before every workout has really helped. I will begin cutting down to 170 pounds when summer begins and hopefully at that weight my lower abs and obliques will be showing.

Have other people in the family who simply refused to give up their carbs which is something you end up doing during fasting it doesn&#039;t have to be forever. Carbohydrate is not biologically necessary and it spikes insulin far more than protein or fat. As you point out weight loss comes from low insulin.

I spent 2 months fucking around with unweighted calisthenics and occasionally doing some biceps curls with 15ib dumbbells.

I start by doing 10 sets of an exercise (40-60 second rest period between sets), and switch to 8 sets with an increased number of reps before rotating back to 10 sets. Gains are starting to come fast and my level of endurance continuously surprises me. I think doing low intensity cardio before every workout has really helped. Some auxillary exercises I save for rest days because I don&#039;t always have time or am not in the mood. I will begin cutting down to 170 pounds when summer begins and hopefully at that weight my lower abs and obliques will be showing.

Congrats man, you&#039;ve logically deduced the most basic thing about fitness that makes 0 sense but people keep trying to shill it to confuse you and sell you their programs and solutions. RIR and RPE and all that shit is useless because you literally are incapable of knowing how many you could have gotten without actually reaching failure. The only thing you can really know about where your RPE is at is if you&#039;re at either 0 (rest) or 10 (failure). Anything between those two is a complete mystery and literally cannot be used to make a basis for a consistent approach with training.<br><br>Good thing you don&#039;t need that shit anyway. Just hit failure. Once is enough. Anywhere between 5-35 reps until you fail. Approach it very slowly with 5 seconds up, 5 seconds down, and short pauses at the bottom and the top. Fail within 60-90 seconds of beginning the lift. Only use enough weight to get to failure within that timeframe. Only add more when your times start to go above that range. One set, per session per muscle group, twice per week maximum unless you roid.<br><br>Train to failure, rest enough to recover, rest even more to grow. <br><br>Do this and you will get the same fucking results as doing 5-10 sets and you will have 0 risk of overtraining or undertraining. Everything else is either a scam or under/misinformed people trying to help even though they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing and they are just parroting someone else that also does not know what they are doing. You&#039;ll save a shitload of time and never be confused if you do this. It&#039;s safer since you&#039;re going slow and using lighter weights as a result and is also consistent. There&#039;s literally no reason to do anything else, unless you just like training another way.

I start by doing 10 sets of an exercise (40-60 second rest period between sets), and switch to 8 sets with an increased number of reps before rotating back to 10 sets. Gains are starting to come fast and my level of endurance continuously surprises me. I think doing low intensity cardio before every workout has really helped. I will begin cutting down to 170 pounds when summer begins and hopefully at that weight my lower abs and obliques will be showing.

When you&#039;re hungry, your body is expending energy, burning fat, and making you thinner. It&#039;s important to let your body use your stored resources (aka fat) instead of eating.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What should I eat?</span><br>It&#039;s important to remember that what you eat is SECOND to how much you&#039;re eating, yet they are both important. Don&#039;t overthinks, overthink your calorie intake.<br><br>You could eat a big burger thats 1450 everyday as your only meal but also the best results will always come with a balanced diet. Eating rice/chicken has been proven to be filling and a good mix of macros. You&#039;ll see more progress eating healthy and lean, rather than trying to squeeze junk into your calorie limits.<br><br>Ultimately though. 1450 calories is 1450 calories. However you chose to get to that amount is up to you.<br>Also remember 1450 is my number. Every persons. Every person has their own specific TDEE.
