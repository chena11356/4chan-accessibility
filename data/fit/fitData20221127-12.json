The only reason to strength train is to get bigger and stronger. Recovering faster so you can train more simply for the sake of training more is counterproductive. Train, recover, supercompensate, then train again once the gains have been milked. You&#039;re probably training too much already if you go more 3x a week or more on the same body part. You want to be in top physical condition? 2x a week on the same body part OR LESS (if you&#039;re not on steroids) with far more rest than you think is necessary. If you&#039;re not getting stronger in every single workout then you need to rest more. Stop training 10 days before whatever event you&#039;re doing in order to be fully recovered and at peak physical condition at that specific time. Cycle with 6-8 weeks of training, followed by 10 days of rest (no exercise whatsoever on any body part), followed by 6-8 more weeks of training and repeat. Expect 15%-20% increases in size and strength over a 6 week cycle if you train 3x per week. Gains are going to be roughly the same or slightly better if you do less.<br><br>On days that you do skill specific sport training, don&#039;t incorporate any lifts. When you do sport training, only practice the skills that you will need to use in order to perform the sport. Skill doesn&#039;t transfer. You have to do the exact movements that you would in sport to get the neurological muscle memory benefits of having practiced.<br><br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>e/2PACX-1vRLVvEbt6ynpuBei0AIC0uMtq0<wbr>v-sOna7FxSOpQ8ZvS2GDyVqlFdeQ7WROKap<wbr>2VSv67qQOq_8g1XYCP/pub", "time": 1669569522, "resto": 69081663}, {"no": 69081977, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:26:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69081912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69081912</a><br>I&#039;ll give that a read, I intend to train 3x per weak each body part, yes.
