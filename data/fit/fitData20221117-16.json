Meat: preferably on the bone and cooked properly(TL;DR: juicy meat is not only the most delicious, it&#039;s also the more bioavailable nutritionally)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Organs: Eat from nose to tail. Bone broths are also a way to get collagen, minerals and other good nutrition from the entire animal.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Fresh: organic, seasonal and local fruits and (some) vegetables, are packed with nutrition. Fresh Raw milk and its derivatives( butter and cheeses) are also gold.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. Fermented and Sprouted: It&#039;s true that some plants create poisons to not be eaten, but the tradition solution is not to avoid them, it&#039;s to bypass the poison, for that fermentation and sprouting are necessary. I would amplify this point to all cooking procedures that detoxify foods, like cooking a potato properly. Fermentation also adds new nutrition, not only to plants, but to animal products as well, fermented cheeses and yogurts are GOAT&#039;s.</span><br>Other points:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No seed oils, avoid like the plague</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Carbs need to be owned. Keep to less than 100g if you are sedentary(not keto, only low carb). Eat more to fuel your activities, but don&#039;t overdo it..</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Healthy should equals delicious. You crave delicious food, and traditionally that was also the more nutritious food. Only recently we have abundance and technologies/additives to break this rule. So you should learn to differentiate the good delicious from the bad delicious.

You can build both a chinning bar and a pair of parallel dip bars for a total cost of only a few dollars, and those two exercises, chins and dips, if properly performed, will stimulate muscular growth in your upper body and arms that will eventually lead to muscular size and strength that is very close to your potential.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adding full squats, eventually leading up to one-legged full squats, and one-legged calf raises, will do much the same thing for your legs and hips.

Or, instead, you can do what many thousands of others are now doing and piss away thousands of dollars and years of largely wasted effort while producing far less results. The choice is yours.
