I don&#039;t believe this is inherently nihilist. I&#039;m a Christian, I see beauty in life but still agree with this, and this is a similar question I&#039;ve been asking lately of politics: 1. if institutions try from a young age to sway us, as we can provably see with leftist institutions 2. If our worldview is shaped by loved experiences including who we&#039;re born unto and what circumstances 3. If we acknowledge that most voters vote selfishly in their perceived interests 4. Are we really making a statement by doing anything but voting in our perceived interests as well? Childish notion of mine that my political leaning will empower others too, I will drop that, it&#039;s incorrect. 5. If we can agree that worldview and political leaning is shaped partially by external factors then is it with ever arguing a political position? 6. Have you ever convinced a die hard leftist of their position? Hugboxes exist for both sides and while the left is probably evil, they can exist in a world that shields them from that, a world that exists alongside our own, a separate reality. 7. If talk doesn&#039;t help then I&#039;m inclined to believe might makes right, but we can&#039;t exercise this might without the state protecting the weak and criminal classes, police now exist to serve criminals, we all see it and it happened fast. 8. Democracy and all representative government are collective, all collective entities allow the weak to collectively shackle the strong in order to create stability. 9. If we are being groomed to be weak and subservient, again discussing politics seems to be a waste of time, it leads me to believe the accelerationists are right 10.

We studied two explanations for this apparent resistance to diet--low total energy expenditure and underreporting of caloric intake--in 224 consecutive obese subjects presenting for treatment. Group 1 consisted of nine women and one man with a history of diet resistance in whom we evaluated total energy expenditure and its main thermogenic components and actual energy intake for 14 days by indirect calorimetry and analysis of body composition. Group 2, subgroups of which served as controls in the various evaluations, consisted of 67 women and 13 men with no history of diet resistance.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Results: Total energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate in the subjects with diet resistance (group 1) were within 5 percent of the predicted values for body composition, and there was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in the thermic effects of food and exercise. Low energy expenditure was thus excluded as a mechanism of self-reported diet resistance. In contrast, the subjects in group 1 underreported their actual food intake by an average (+/- SD) of 47 +/- 16 percent and overreported their physical activity by 51 +/- 75 percent.

For everyone that doesn&#039;t know, TDEE isn&#039;t static. It&#039;s dynamic. Most of your calorie burning comes from your thermogenesis. That is the #1 way that calories are burned in the body. After that, you have a few other noteworthy processes such as your level of thinking and the amount of movement that you do, but compared to keeping your body at the right temperature, these processes are near negligible. If you consume less calories than your maintenance, you will burn less calories as a result if you continue to restrict calories. This will make you lethargic and far less twitchy, significantly or entirely eliminating the calories burned from movement if you feel like such shit that you don&#039;t even want to get up and move around. Most calories are not burned by movement though. If you restrict your calories and you do it long enough, your core body temperature will fall and you will be unable to feel warm even if you are in multiple layers of clothing in the summer. The amount of calories you cut is directly proportional to the amount of TDEE you lose. Cutting at 50% will reduce TDEE by 50% if you do it long enough. The hormones affect how drastic of a cut on your TDEE your body does. For a young healthy virile male, you may not lose any TDEE at all and you may continue to burn the same amount of calories as you were consuming before. If you&#039;re an unhealthy old hag, you might fuck yourself up from doing calorie restriction too hard and reduce your metabolic activity by 50% to compensate. Unironically, the answer to this dilemma is to fast. It literally works for everyone and solves all of the hormonal issues associated with calorie restriction that people face while still consuming food. It&#039;s mostly an insulin and sexual hormone issue. 2 things that are fucked up in nearly every single person in the West due to diet and life choices", "filename": "MegaChad here, contacting you through carrier pigeon", "ext": ".png", "w": 503, "h": 337, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675215447450850, "time": 1675215447, "md5": "z3ym8A/bicPHSMtmoiJbXw==", "fsize": 299827, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800166, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:40:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69798825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69798825</a><br>could be water", "time": 1675215614, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800215, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:45:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800143</a><br>tldr: CICO is a lie<br>eat less and move more is a lie", "time": 1675215927, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800224, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800215</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CICO is a lie</span><br>impossible<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eat less and move more is a lie</span><br>gotta be more specific than that for that statement to have any meaning", "time": 1675215981, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800232, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:46:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800224</a><br><a href=\"#p69800143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800143</a>", "time": 1675216012, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800252, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:47:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800232</a><br>Same person, dingus", "filename": "It&#039;s Me, Retard", "ext": ".png", "w": 443, "h": 104, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 29, "tim": 1675216079887222, "time": 1675216079, "md5": "s207mngFlZqoEmpGYiGkIQ==", "fsize": 4973, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800302, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:53:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800113</a><br>180cm 98kg atm", "time": 1675216395, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800833, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:40:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69800302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69800302</a><br>180cm and 87kg here, I can&#039;t lose weight at all.<br><br>I ate 1500 calories total (3 boiled eggs/day) in the last week and lost nothing.", "time": 1675219250, "resto": 69795660}, {"no": 69800841, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:41:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "When your metabolism slows that much, sure.

This translates to enjoying the little things in life more, to caring more about lifting, to wanting to study harder, and to completing any task that isn&#039;t the usual high stimuli/low reward.

There are many who believe that the oxytocin released during sex with someone you love counteracts the harmful effects of dopamine and prolactin release in the brain that comes with any orgasm. It should also be obvious, but if you&#039;re single, you will be burning absolute holes in women&#039;s skulls with your eye-contact, and your newfound masculinity makes it virtually inevitable that a woman will service your parts at some point. Whether you want to hunt for PAWGs, or fully retain your nut is up to you.

My most recent ex had 6 previous partners by contrast, and they were all with men she wanted to date, but they exploited her, so funny enough I consider her less trashy. If I had to pick now though, I probably wouldn&#039;t settle for above 1-2 guy notch count from LTRs.

Never &quot;give in to temptation&quot; as in you plan to fast, but end up binging instead or even the other way around. It&#039;s way better to give in immediately than to try to fight something just to give in to the temptation in the end, you&#039;re just teaching yourself to annoy yourself until you end up getting what you want. Fast for, lets say, 2 days and then eat whatever you want for a day really binge to your heart&#039;s content, then fast 2 days again and repeat. It&#039;s better than planning to fast for 7 days, giving in on day 3 and binge eating for a couple days and then get into fasting again, again trying for 7 days etc. You&#039;re reinforcing failure, not success. You can&#039;t trust your own plans/agreements with yourself since you don&#039;t stick to them. Once you can do the plan which includes binge eating you can start to modify it until it suits your needs, lets say 72s with one plentiful meal in between, now with full confidence that you can do it and you aren&#039;t fooling yourself with false promises.<br><br>A solid plan, even if it includes degenerate things like binging is better than always fighting and ending up doing the thing anyway.

I&#039;m not 100% sure what you mean by man handle but the first and most important step is to join a club for a grappling sport, such as wrestling, BJJ or judo and do that as much you can whilst eating and putting on as much weight as you can. In between grappling training, you should commence your first strength phase. Starting with endurance and flexibility, moving on to high rep bodybuilding, then finally getting strong (3-5 sets of 3-5 reps) at the &quot;classic compounds&quot; and variations thereof. Hard to put a specific timescale on this but you can find rough &quot;strength standards&quot; to give you an idea. When you have met these strength standards, or your progression slows I would then introduce a &quot;power phase&quot; (you still want to be lifting for strength) but do much more jumping and throwing movements.

Just sleeping till 7AM Mon-Fri and then sleeping till 1PM on weekends doesn&#039;t work too well.", "filename": "onassis gun", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1653, "h": 1903, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675249299250676, "time": 1675249299, "md5": "0alRIDR/rSw6dKholmLOAQ==", "fsize": 665931, "resto": 69798557}, {"no": 69804378, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)06:04:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69803622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69803622</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blames everyone but himself</span><br>Literally billions of people are capable of good sleep.

On February 14th, I am going to start the old school diet of 36 eggs a day, for 8 weeks. According to vince gironda, an old school bodybuilder, and the lifters that he took under his wing back in the day, eating 36 eggs a day gives you the same effect as a cycle of Dianabol (Metandienone). I will be getting blood work done before and after to see what happens to my test levels. Also gonna get my lipids checked before and after, to see if eating all these eggs has any effect on my cholesterol. <br><br>I will be treating this as a steroid cycle. I will be buying some aromasin from my buddy just in the absolute worst case that doing this brings the same side effects as Dianabol. If I have any sides such as spicy nipples, lactation, bloating, high bp, etc. i will get my e2 and prolactin checked (results come back in less than 24 hours) and then deploy the aromasin accordingly. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t get to this stage, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. I took some physique pics and I\u2019ll continue to document my progress during and after this experiment. Let me reiterate, this is a WORST CASE SCENARIO. I\u2019m not gonna be taking asin from the get go. <br><br>I will still eat carbs for energy in training. For me, going to the gym with high carbs is pretty much a night and day difference as opposed to eating no carbs or training on an empty stomach.

Yet even with this support, black athletes don&#039;t &quot;dominate&quot; the NFL. <br><br>58% of all players are black, which isn&#039;t a shockingly high number. Furthermore, black NFL players are predominantely seen in more in &quot;simpler&quot; positions that don&#039;t require extremely complex training and are more reactionary in strategy (e.g. cornerbacks, safety&#039;s, running backs). The offensive line is near equal in white-black percentage while quarterbacks and special teams are overwhelming white. <br><br>The fact is that blacks only &quot;dominate&quot; the NFL in the positions that require the least amount of technical knowledge and specialized training to play. Again, this is because they simply won&#039;t have the financial means to spend 3-4 days a week at 16 filming themselves with 3 different cameras so they can master a special team strategy. Any jackass from the track team can take the ball and forward through a gap the O-line created. <br><br>https://www.statista.com/statistics<wbr>/1154691/nfl-racial-diversity/<br><br>https://andscape.com/features/the-n<wbr>fls-racial-divide/", "time": 1675232954, "resto": 69797019}, {"no": 69802877, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:52:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69797428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69797428</a><br>her little brother is a very good basketballer, one of the strongest players in the NBA", "filename": "adams3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 745, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675234366319502, "time": 1675234366, "md5": "EK+jJCROpGcLOP0kWaFMTg==", "fsize": 113519, "resto": 69797019}, {"no": 69802888, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:54:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69797019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69797019</a><br>too flee from slavers", "time": 1675234474, "resto": 69797019}, {"no": 69802904, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69797019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69797019</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why are they so fast?</span><br>Steroids.

Excess flexibility on its own can result in you getting injured, but generally this is because you don&#039;t have strength in those positions. If you instead become strong in those end ranges of motion, you&#039;ll be even more resistant to injury than if you were simply inflexible since if something forces you into those positions, you&#039;ll be able to enter them and also be strong in them, instead of just one or the other. As an example, instead of having inflexible hamstrings, or flexible but weak hamstrings, having flexible hamstrings that are very strong even in their end range position would be the most optimal way to reduce your injury risk. This is why I believe that doing movements that take muscles through their full range of motion are generally the best for developing flexibility, since they give you not just the flexibility but also the strength to be protected in those positions, while also making you jacked in the process due to stretch mediated hypertrophy.", "time": 1675209276, "resto": 69759836}, {"no": 69799038, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)18:58:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69785643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69785643</a><br>Those grip devices train all of the muscles of the forearm I think.

To put it one way, strength athletes will use those values to produce the most amount of strength possible, and the amount of each will depend on the sport (EG powerlifting puts more into neurological ability, while olympic weightlifting puts more into technical ability, because the olympic lifts are much more technical than the big 3). Meanwhile bodybuilders will put only as much into technical and neurological ability as is required, and the rest into putting on more muscle mass. This is very easy to see in most (good) bodybuilding programs, they generally don&#039;t have super high frequencies for compound lifts (ironically you&#039;ll probably see certain isolation lifts get higher frequencies such as lateral raises), and they also don&#039;t have much (if any) work in the 1-5 rep range; the vast majority of it takes place in higher rep ranges.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s why &quot;inefficient&quot; exercises were recommended for hypertrophy.

But obviously a lot of them are also selected due to the low technical requirements, since the lower the technical requirement of an exercise is, the more you can do it without suffering technical breakdown. And you won&#039;t have to do super high frequencies to keep drilling the technique to the point where you can actually get a good stimulus either.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If neurological adaptation plateaus quickly, that leaves muscle size to be what gets trained in these exercises.</span><br>Technical adaptation, not neurological, neurological is from training with a high % of 1RM.

After years and years of powerlifting I just got bored, and shifted to less frequent strength training while exploring BJJ. My physique is still enough to get recognition as a &quot;strong big guy&quot; by normies, but anyone lifting seriously can see that I&#039;ve not been strength training seriously for some time. This includes myself, so I&#039;m getting stuck back in with strength training. <br><br>I train six days a week in a PPL manner; push, pull, legs, push, pull, legs, rest day. The days are a bit like this:<br>A: 5x5-8 vertical push/pull/squat<br>B: 5x8-12 horisontal push/pull/deadlift<br>C: some relevant accessory/isolation<br>D: heavy abs (crunch/rotation/static)<br>In addition to this, I do a dedicated pullup program 6 days a week. Tough on the pull days, but usually goes fine.<br><br>The sessions are quite time effective, and as I get more weeks into it I plan on adding some 531-style accessories and conditioning, time and recovery allowing.

Slant board and some yoga stuff for stretching and mobility. <br><br>Am I gonna make it? <br><br>I am pretty certain my legs aren&#039;t getting back to their peak in this fashion, but I honestly don&#039;t care much; they&#039;ve always been big and they&#039;re prohibitively big for certain BJJ moves. In terms of resistance for legs, I&#039;ve got the material to eventually progress to a 64kg pistol squat, and heavy, high-volume kettlebell swings are a banger. I&#039;m around 95kg, so generally there&#039;s plenty of resistance even in the bodyweight exercises, especially with the exercises I&#039;m doing.

GLA/EPA is anti inflammatory, and compete with cellular machinery with AA cascades. AA is pro inflammatory. If you eat exceedingly large amounts of w-6 (please note that both w-6 and w-3 are PUFAs), they can contribute to AA cascade generation of inflammatories like pgf, and to a lesser extent 9-HODE and other oxidized species can do so (also via oxidized GLA). However, when we compare a saturated fat rich diet to a PUFA rich diet even heavily skewed towards w-6, SFAs stimulate TLR2/4 receptors on immune macrophages and gut microbiota, which induce direct cRP signalling inflammation which is arguably much worse since it occurs at your liver. So, in order of what to be increasing in your diet: w-3s first, GLA (one type of w6), then w-9s, then w-6s, and finally SFAs (with a skew towards stearic acid), and this should increase w3:w6 ratios.", "time": 1675221120, "resto": 69787120}, {"no": 69801501, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)22:46:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "71sbO+WB0tL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1326, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 110, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675223200398556, "time": 1675223200, "md5": "ZygKwtBKBob5Maq+pKau7A==", "fsize": 164894, "resto": 69787120}, {"no": 69801699, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:06:59", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "41CvmjyX-EL._AC_SY580_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 234, "h": 458, "tn_w": 63, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675224419965172, "time": 1675224419, "md5": "l0hfLT2gPvuMgrdSfrfSqQ==", "fsize": 18087, "resto": 69787120}, {"no": 69802635, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:11:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69787120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69787120</a>", "filename": "prostitute_2183530k-2353195705", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 858, "h": 536, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1675231866517184, "time": 1675231866, "md5": "7VSyrd/ITB3br7KKNqvYKQ==", "fsize": 72969, "resto": 69787120}, {"no": 69802662, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:15:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69790723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69790723</a><br>I am not proud about it.
