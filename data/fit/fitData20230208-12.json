It took me a while to figure out what made this happen, but here are my understanding:<br>1. you been using your hand to jerk off for too long, and your dick head is not sensitive enough to cum to real pussy feeling. (been grip too hard)<br>2. watching porn have changed what your trigger to cum to.( more amount of serotonin needed to reach cum state)<br>3. you are not relaxed enough when you are with her. (psychological block)<br>4. check condom. (condom too tight, too thick, foreskin not properly rolled around condom)<br>---------------------<br>do not worry, here is what I did:<br>1. need to recondition your dick to learn to enjoy how real pussy feel, the soft, wet, and warmly wraps around your dick feeling. You need to learn to enjoy that feeling. So, stop jerking with your hands, if you want to practice, get a lose flashlight (the kind that you can adjust tightness), use enough lube, wear condom (further train your sensation), close your eyes and use your imagination. <br>2. learn what makes your hard when you play with her. You said, kissing makes you hard, then kiss her a lot, and while kissing her, try to get your dick inside her, and keep on kissing her. find what makes you hard and keep doing them while you are with her, so you don&#039;t lose erection while inside her. <br>3. talk to her about it, saying it&#039;s not you don&#039;t find her attractive, it&#039;s just you been alone for many years, and you need to learn your way around her body first, need some getting to know each other period. <br>4. learn that cumming is not important, but having fun with sex is. The longer you last, means more things to try together. You have to change your mindset about it. <br>----------------<br>end of the day, friend, sex is like working out, you have to practice your technique, talk to your partner, and have fun.

So understand you&#039;re already doing well. A lot of men struggle to get erections on demand.<br><br>A couple of things could be te root cause so I&#039;ll just go off from what I know.<br><br>Firstly : Porn has probably desensitized you. You&#039;re used to an overload of visual stimulation. So you are going to have to work on that problem.<br>My recommendation for you and all young men, is to learn to fap NoPorn.<br>Visualize using your imagination. This is easier in your bed in the dark but that&#039;s optionnal.<br>Learning this gives you more control over erections and orgasms. You&#039;re able to stimulate yourself on demand, and either speed up or slow down dependingon the situation.<br><br>Myself I get off from my partner&#039;s pleasure.<br>As a man, I put her orgasm before mine, litteraly and figuratively. She has to have her needs met before I do, because as soon as I orgasm, the sexual intercourse ends.<br>So for me to get aroused, I just need to give pleasure to my partner and that will always get me hard, and easier to achieve orgasm that way.<br><br>So that&#039;s my preference.<br>Only you yourself will know what your own preference is.

I realised last night when I was thinking about what I wanted to do that I want a base structure on which I can hang stuff on, with multiple methods of progression and a cardio component. So I&#039;ll going to pick time for rounds or rounds for time. Each round is an amount of cardio and a strength movement. The gym layout means I&#039;m limited to dumbbell or kettlebell at the moment.<br><br>Tried it out today with 20 minutes max rounds of 20 cal skierg / 5 DB snatch each hand.<br><br>Managed 7 rounds, which seems like a decent start. I think initially I&#039;m going to stick with this basic structure and cycle through some different strength movements; DB snatch, DB clean and press, ABCs, front rack carries. I might throw burpees in there too even though I hate them. Once I&#039;ve cycled through once I can progress on overall time or weight or push for an extra round; today I forgot to put chalk on my hands first for eg and had to wait for it to dry, lost maybe a minute there...<br><br>Anyway, nothing ground breaking, but I feel like this is sustainable and changes enough to not become boring and makes me work hard for a decent period of time.<br><br>Onto clearing bramble at a nature reserve today and W2D3 of BtM tomorrow.

You can always incorporate junk food into your diet. So if you know you like snacking and drinking, just count those calories to fit your TDEE, instead of giving yourself a cheat day every week and making slow progress. It doesn&#039;t take much to ruin a week of dieting. A cheat weekend can easily invalidate a week&#039;s worth of effort and actually make you gain weight, and a cheat day can invalidate 2 to 3 days worth of dieting.

Forget about any named diets, the only thing that matters is caloric deficit while being reasonably satiated. Drinking wouldn&#039;t be a problem if she could forgo snacking and would work it off afterwards.<br><br>Your best gameplan is to reduce sweets, garbage meals etc and make more salads and fatty meals. If she likes her snacks, try going every other day without one. Ideally you would reduce this to as low as possible, but you have to take baby steps to form habits. If you can identify what she eats that could be considered &quot;unnecessary&quot; calories, you should first start and reduce or remove them.

The perfect solution would be cardio and some weight training 2x per week each for faster results, but only you can get her to do it, if at all.

Maybe make it a goal together, reward her for following along.<br><br>At the end of the day you are trying to manipulate her into becoming a better person. Let&#039;s not beat around the bush here. If she joins you in any physical activity you need to praise her. If she follows along with diet restrictions and is losing any sort of weight, tell her how much better she looks.

That&#039;s kind of the point.<br><br>Most Arno Brecker sculptures are like a northern European interpretation of the classical ideal. Compared to old Roman or Renaissance statues most Brecker pieces have much narrower hips, they&#039;re taller with Nordic spear chucker looking limbs, broader shoulders + some more muscle mass typically. It doesn&#039;t matter what of these you prefer, the point is that such depictions of heroes and athletes are somewhat attainable to athletic guys with decent genetics once they get lean and fill out with muscle. Classical interpretations from like Romans and later Brecker are simply better looking to everyone instinctively imo because men like that actually have existed in nature. <br><br>But with superheroes everything about them is so beyond human, it&#039;s comical to think about trying to look like this. It took guys like Arnold and Lou lifelong dedication and they only somewhat resemble these cartoons, but with all kinds of imbalances and nowhere near as &quot;perfect&quot;. If you take a guy with bone structure similar to a comic book superhero, even blasting roids he will still look more like a Brecker or old Roman sculpture than these depictions of batman and superman. Dolph Lindgren was living life as a stress free NEET, training all day making b movie kino, blasting roids, some ebony singer was bringing back art hoes for him to fuck daily, he had access to the best food and lifestyle and even with years of training and blasting roids he never once looked like this superman, he looked more like pic rel.

A little puppy he was such a little scaredy-cat when we brought him home first, hiding under the couch, looked frightened out his mind. All this time later I feel bad when I realize he must have been taken from his mother, but that&#039;s what happens all non-rescue dogs people get. He was like this for days, just so scared and quiet, would hardly move at all, such a timid little creature, we were like what the hell is wrong with this dog, should we take him back, he doesn&#039;t seem suitable for what we wanted at all, and he wasn&#039;t just after been born, he was a few weeks old. <br><br>But over time, he gradually got to know the place, and he got a little bit better every day. Over the next few months he got to know us all and would jump wildly around the place, play with us and so on. As he got older still, he freaking took over, I remember being around 12 years old and unable to go to the fridge because he had a bone and literally wouldn&#039;t let me, he growled so hard any time I even tried coming close. He would attack anyone that entered the house, he was ok with our postman for some reason but the postwoman left a note saying she would only leave the post outside our gate from then on because she was afraid of the dog kek. And anyone that got too close too quickly, he would snap or bite them. There was talk of getting rid of him and he tore part of the jacket off of the man that came to have a look at him as the man tried to escape back through the door, that was the best thing ever, vet&#039;s assistant also. He bit even most of the family at some point due to being pissed off in some way, he was wild, but in the best way. <br> <br>Wait, what were we talking about... oh yeah, so OP you are basically like my dog was who hid under the couch, the timidest most pathetic little creature, but in a few years you could be taking over and not accepting any shit from anyone, unrecognizable from how you were.", "time": 1675838308, "resto": 69886235}, {"no": 69886525, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)01:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "just fucking lift you&#039;ll get over it", "time": 1675838581, "resto": 69886235}, {"no": 69886534, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)01:44:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69886235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69886235</a><br>Norhing outrageous about your experience, you&#039;ll just get used to it(if you keep going)", "time": 1675838669, "resto": 69886235}, {"no": 69887328, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:31:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69886235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69886235</a><br>This is what happens when youre born post y2k and were isolated for 3 years without social contacts during puberty", "time": 1675848670, "resto": 69886235}, {"no": 69887337, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:33:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are people so fucking weak ...just do it!", "time": 1675848802, "resto": 69886235}, {"no": 69887406, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:46:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69886235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69886235</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;today was my first day</span><br>Don&#039;t give up after being uncomfortable after just one try.
