He had big, air stealing nostrils, monstrous, boot lips, muscles that rippled under his cobalt skin so it\u2019d look like a nest\u2019a snakes as he\u2019d be twisting here and yonder. T\u2019was an older gentleman, the owner d\u2019ye ken?, that had hired me to break this particular buck. Was some half-dozen breakers what had tried and failed! I tracked this moon cricket, this big-assed baboon, by fallerin\u2019 the sounds of his impressive proud buttocks, clapping as he capered to and fro on the western half of yon gentleman\u2019s land. There he be, proud as a damn peacock, black slave\u2019s body framed by yon settin\u2019 sun, just begging to be broke. I approached from the east, heading westerly way. Took him unawares as he were sat alone out front a shack, mending a loincloth or some such. Knocking him to his glistening buttocks produced a thund\u2019rus CLAP, and I mounted from the front. I tell ye boy, but that buck began to FIGHT! This unbroken, proud negro was ornery I tell ye, but I ain&#039;t ne&#039;er been denied, d&#039;ya ken it? I had my cock out in an instant as he scrambled onto his black belly and began ta\u2019 wrigglin\u2019 this way and that. And bucko did he began to wail! As loud as prairie lightning he were. This buck could tell the breaking was coming, could tell his time was up, and I tell ye, he did BUCK. This obstinate cur could turn on a dime and give ye some change! I tell ye as the winds were my witness, he were a right sunfish, struggling and flopping as he did, gyrating his unbroken black anus and dodging my breaker man\u2019s meat. But he broke, and I finished the job. D\u2019ye ken? That buck broke. Say sorry, boy. But they all break.

Either eat nothing at all or eat at maintenance. Fasting puts you in the proper hormonal state to be able to successfully fast while losing only fat, but the hormonal state will only persist so long as you eat nothing. Even a few hundred calories a day could fuck up your hormonal state. In a 10 day fast, you&#039;ll lose around 13-15 lbs of body weight. 40% of that is pure fat. 60% is lean soft organ tissue that regenerates after you begin eating again. Your muscles are already being fed in that time and your HGH is cranked through the roof, allowing you to maintain muscles and even gain strength while eating nothing. If you continue to eat but you also cut calories, you won&#039;t have the benefits of the HGH increase or access to your organ tissues as a source of food and you&#039;ll break down muscle.

These sites grossly overestimate exercise and it&#039;s a good habit to lose weight even at rest, at least for most people. Once you figure out your TDEE, subtract 500 calories minimum from it and a maximum of 750 (1000 if you&#039;re really fat/obese). This is now your calorie goal day-to-day until you hit your goal.

I don&#039;t care if it takes me longer to get strong, and I am already enourmous (I&#039;m so broad shouldered I look like like bad CGI) so don&#039;t care about growth in the slightest. <br><br>If I can still continue to make gains, even if slower, and get in shape doing SL twice a week with kettlebells, that&#039;ll do. <br><br>If I&#039;m going to fuck myself up, make progressing dangerous on the barbell stuff, or some other mission critical issue, then I will have to find an alternative.<br><br>Or, is there a barbell program based on lifting twice a week anyone can recommend?<br><br>Very thankful for your input thus far anon", "time": 1676425432, "resto": 69953277}, {"no": 69961864, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)20:52:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69961783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69961783</a><br>Read the other post I responded to regarding weight management, you can&#039;t outlift a bad diet. <br><br>And any amount of lifting is better than none.

I&#039;ve never been on any of the dating apps nor have I ever had a girlfriend, but I&#039;ve occasionally used the website called photofeeler to get validation from women. feeling up for it, I took a picture of myself and put it on photofeeler. I waited about an hour to see my results coming in. I open up my browser with 8 votes and noticed my scores were much lower than they used to be. I went on my external hard drive and dug up past results. I came across a picture of myself that I took three years ago when I still had hair which was rated at a 9/10 by 91 female voters on the website. it was then that I decided to do an experiment. I took a better picture of myself bald trying to emulate the same lighting and facial expression of my hair picture, uploaded it to the site, and waited until I got the same amount of votes as the photo with hair did. <br><br>well, picrel is the results. went from literally a 9/10 to a 5.2 becoming bald. if that&#039;s not a kick to the balls, I don&#039;t know what is. moral of the story, try to hold on to your hair as long as you can guys.

HIT may or may not be an incredibly efficient way to work out, but it all hinges on the requirement that you have an insane discipline (and sometimes access to a spotter or certain machines) to go until true failure. No doubt it worked great for Mike because he had the drive to make the program work. The most important thing for amateur lifters is finding a program that works for them. Unless you are competing at an elite level it doesn&#039;t matter if you find a program that&#039;s 5% or 10% better than another. I like HIT because the workouts are very time efficient, and while repeatedly doing exercises to complete failure can suck ass if you&#039;re not feeling it (bad sleep, haven&#039;t eaten properly, tired after work etc) the pump you can get from a properly executed HIT failure set is sickening, and as challenging/stimulating mentally as it is physically.", "time": 1676317779, "resto": 69945822}, {"no": 69946576, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:00:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69946393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69946393</a><br>It was revealed to me in a dream.", "filename": "1676215585975814", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1190, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676318416490479, "time": 1676318416, "md5": "PzZ7YeGPeodP3UjfaFbbIA==", "fsize": 134806, "resto": 69945822}, {"no": 69946606, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:03:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69946576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69946576</a><br>figures", "time": 1676318594, "resto": 69945822}, {"no": 69947426, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:31:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69945822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69945822</a><br>Can even one person who shills HIT post body?", "time": 1676323892, "resto": 69945822}, {"no": 69947956, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)17:17:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69945837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69945837</a><br>Multiple sets?

Almost the entire panel of experts were vegetarians or vegans happy to ignore evidence<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most importantly for the IARC report, two major dietary intervention studies that should have contributed to the assessment of the claimed relationship of red meat and cancer were not considered. The first was a study of colon polyps, the precancerous growths that greatly increase the likelihood of developing colon cancer. Almost 1,900 subjects with a recent history of having a polyp removed were divided into a control group that ate their usual diet and a group following a diet characterized by significant decreases in total fat, red, and processed meat along with increases in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes (Schatzkin et al., 2000). Participants were followed for 3 years and at the end of that time, the recurrence of colon polyps was identical in both diet groups. It is possible that the precancerous stage may not have been the proper time for dietary intervention. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative, therefore, studied a low-fat diet, achieved in large part by reducing red- and processed-meat consumption, among almost 49,000 women (Beresford et al., 2006); about 30,000 followed their normal diets and almost 20,000 were assigned to low-fat diets. After 9 years, the rate of colon cancer was almost identical in the low-fat and control-diet groups. These studies strongly suggest that the observational studies are not supported by dietary intervention studies at either the precancerous or malignant tumor stages of colon cancer.</span>", "time": 1676426252, "resto": 69961335}, {"no": 69961916, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)20:58:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I eat 1 lb of ground bison, once per week.
