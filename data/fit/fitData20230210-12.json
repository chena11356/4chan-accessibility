Try pause benching or spoto bench press. These help you feel the pecs better, since you\u2019re not bouncing the weight and actually have to lift the weight up with your muscles. For pause bench, lower the weight to your chest under control, pause for at least 1 full second, then bench. For spoto press, hold the weight 1/2 inch off the chest for 1 second, then press. You will need to lower the weight to do these variations, possibly by a lot if you are weak.<br>2. Are you tight when you bench? Basically, is your body planted firmly in place while you are benching, or are you loose and/or moving around when you bench? You can look up how to arch, leg drive, and brace if you are uncertain of how to do this.<br>3. Squeeze the bar when you are benching. This makes your muscles contract harder when benching.<br>4. You can use isolation exercises to feel the muscles you want to feel working, then see if you can contract those muscles when benching.", "time": 1676032211, "resto": 69891326}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 69911171, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)07:06:58", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Healthmaxxing", "com": "What are some foods, supplements, activities for PERFECT health?<br>Right now my diet consists mostly of eggs, meat, fish, potatoes, pasta and bread.

This <a href=\"#p69910855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69910855</a> guy is also right, most I&#039;ve seen was \u201cdead eyes\u201c. They are soulless, and you can tell who has been through shit and who is larping by looking at their faces. That&#039;s why a lot of cops who are good at their jobs can easily identify who is a criminal and who is not.<br><a href=\"#p69910092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69910092</a><br>Now every \u201cthug\u201c is LARPing here and there but the important part is who can backup that shit and get their hands dirty. The more you do, the more credit you are going to get from people. But of course it comes with many risks and it destroys your life.

When you as you said spend &quot;three to four hours&quot; masturbating, yes that is a serious problem addiction and needs to be cut off, just like alcohol or drug addiction needs to be cut out. And if not masturbating gets you very sexually charged and actually makes you go out and socialize with people including women, then of course that is a big positive. <br><br>But it seems to be doing the opposite for you. You say it&#039;s getting you legitimately angry, you&#039;re unable to focus on tasks, you&#039;re pacing around your room muttering to yourself. It sounds like you may be placing to blame for that on no-fap, which should allow you to recognize that maybe it&#039;s having a not so good effect on you. You also said you have no semblance of a life and don&#039;t even know how to talk to women when you are out in public, so my question is exactly what benefit is this providing you? It isn&#039;t helping you to get sex (which is the main purpose of it), it is making to lose focus, it&#039;s making you angry because all your sexual energy has no release. <br><br>I&#039;m not saying to not do no-fap, but maybe after a few weeks which you say is your record already, maybe you should try to masturbate even just using your imagination and see if the few weeks of progress can hold once you do it once. Because I&#039;ll tell you from experience, not masturbating but also not having sex at the same time long-term is really not a tenable scenario. Maybe you&#039;ll have wet dreams that will mean you &quot;technically&quot; didn&#039;t break no-fap but can actually help relax you so that would be good, but personally I find wet dreams to be annoying and a hassle so I try to avoid them", "time": 1676011064, "resto": 69904596}, {"no": 69909194, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:42:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69909168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69909168</a><br>Going cold turkey when he used to be full coomer isn&#039;t easy.

Just sit here and go months without masturbating but also never having sex since you have no social skills? Eventually you&#039;re going to be forced to release the semen buildup through a wet dream whether you like it or not. I guess that can help you see if a non-porn-masturbation semen release will keep you with the no-fap &quot;benefits&quot; (that I think are bullshit but if the placebo work for you then great) or if everything gets lost, but I think the next best option would be to masturbate once after two weeks now and see if you are able to go right back into not masturbating or if you immediately fall back into addiction. If you fall back into it, well I guess then you&#039;ll truly have to just not masturbate for months and hope your brain doesn&#039;t melt down worse than it already is with your anger and loss of focus.", "time": 1676011712, "resto": 69904596}, {"no": 69909301, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:01:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69909226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69909226</a><br>I don&#039;t prescribe some magical benefits to nofap, but 2 weeks is a sweet spot for me to feel aggression levels and confidence rise from burning balls which I can directly observe as a result of nofap.<br><br>But, as you said, if he was spending hours masturbating and now he&#039;s angry and unfocused, it&#039;s a problem already.

For example, when studying the pharmacokinetics of hMG, one group (Dobbs et al., 1994) confirmed correct placement of the needle\u2014and thus the site of drug deposition\u2014by using electromyography. These authors noticed that it was often necessary to insert the needle considerably further than 4 cm (1.5 in) to reach the muscle layer. Undoubtedly, the relative obesity of their subjects contributed to the depth of needle placement required to reach this depth. Nevertheless, it was possible that some of these intended i.m. injections were given subcutaneously, even in women of normal body stature, thereby diluting any possible difference between the two routes of administration. During injection in the present study, the needle was confirmed\u2014using ultrasound guidance\u2014to be correctly placed in the muscle layer. Moreover, the women were used as their own control, so that any difference in drug bioavailability was attributable to absorption from the injection site rather than to inter\u2010individual variation. </span><br><br>B T F O", "time": 1675967681, "resto": 69892088}, {"no": 69903079, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)14:01:14", "name": "cruisebro", "com": "<a href=\"#p69902750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69902750</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;e-every study before ours was done incorrectly w-we&#039;re not just whoring for funding by purposely presenting different findings we swear!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the needle was confirmed\u2014using ultrasound guidance\u2014to be correctly placed in the muscle layer.

The harder it is for a food to digest, the more bile is required. Cholesterol-rich foods can, in people with susceptible genetics, trigger an expression that results in an excess of these cholesterol stones, which eventually grow large, accumulate environmental toxins and parasites, causing toxemia and weakening the individual significantly.

I lost some weight, but couldn&#039;t fix the issues and felt extremely miserable. Then I did various elimination diets like paleo, 80-10-10, pescetarian, eventually landing on an extremely low fat vegan diet.<br><br>With that diet I saw the most improvements, but my digestion was still shit, I was always bloated, I was depressed as fuck and didn&#039;t enjoy my meals at all. I still convinced myself it was the best diet, because it had all this research backing it.<br><br>I convinced myself that heart disease, cancer, and obesity were caused by excessive fat and meat intake, even though the most rigorous studies only showed an increased cancer risk of 20%, very modest.<br><br>It wasn&#039;t until I came across studies on the Amish showing they have no cancer, obesity, heart disease, or any of our modern illnesses, despite eating extremely high fat, high carb diets. I came to realize that the problem was something deeper, beyond just meat, plants, carbs, and fat.<br><br>So I tried eating fat again, and again, I got sick. It was a wake up call because it triggered a gallbladder attack. It was here that I began to learn about the liver and how it regulates digestion, and through digestion literally every aspect of the human body and health. Then I learned how most Westerners have gallstones, and subsequently, most Westerners are pot-bellied and obese. I did a liver cleanse and shat out THOUSANDS of stones.

Then she adds more weight to see if she can manage it even though she didnt even properly started making gains in the related part. To successfully pull this new weight, body instinctively creates a form that adds more muscle groups into the mix to manage to pull this new weight. Gal sees that she can also pull this new weight and adds more, and body readjusts to add more muscle groups in it. At this point in webm she is getting catapulted into the air lmao theres about no more muscle groups left to add, by the help of that guy she is adding leg press with the black pad into the mix to do the pull lol. next step would be to glue her ass on the ground to add the viscidity of the glue into the mix I guess.", "time": 1675965520, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902408, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:01:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69898222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69898222</a><br>she could&#039;ve achieved the same result doing face pulls on the lat pulldown machine, or just standing like everyone else.", "filename": "8Ul5lWVrb_lIvWqQfwJgot-0TImeUaGViLi8qAcCExg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675965696086231, "time": 1675965696, "md5": "okaXeRw7tmpqiUQWC6/wsg==", "fsize": 19344, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902463, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:07:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69898532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69898532</a>", "filename": "1607835796969", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 664, "h": 802, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675966051242771, "time": 1675966051, "md5": "Ls3F98WHtuAzeJQoiJ7J9w==", "fsize": 437314, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902639, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:25:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69901802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69901802</a><br>hey asian bro, just get jacked like the lads in physical 100, and you&#039;re golden. you got this, dont sweat it man", "time": 1675967145, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902643, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:26:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69901761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69901761</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personally I&#039;m smart enough and I would&#039;ve done a leg lock to the machine.</span><br>ftfy", "time": 1675967163, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902672, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69898237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69898237</a><br>Never began for ricecels", "time": 1675967321, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902747, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:34:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69902285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69902285</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;having to convince yourself roasties are good and moral just to get laid</span><br>Imagine blaming all women for being a loser in an anime forum.", "filename": "BDD1321E-F64E-4466-A60B-84A0D31C2B0C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 816, "tn_w": 114, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675967653507119, "time": 1675967653, "md5": "x2x/m2MApWJoxL4C3IlJ2Q==", "fsize": 107198, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902756, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:34:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69898305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69898305</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meanwhile she has zero intuition that, say, a dryer has to vent to the OUTDOORS rather than inside the same room.</span><br>kek", "time": 1675967699, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69902795, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:37:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69898360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69898360</a><br>millennial woman logic<br>You probably also think huge glasses hide your ssri eyes", "time": 1675967871, "resto": 69898222}, {"no": 69904273, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)15:49:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69899741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69899741</a><br>Go fuck yourself.

If you\u2019re not paying careful attention, it\u2019ll get drowned out by other things, like how uncomfortable or tired you are. I recommend against touching your dick, as it\u2019s too distracting. Any method of stimulation that requires a lot of work on your part, can also be too distracting. I recommend against any toys that require you to hold them for this reason.<br><br>People who get frustrated will start pounding their prostate too hard. The goal of prostate stimulation is to build up fluid in the prostate; the pressure of that fluid is what makes it feels good. Pressing too hard will squeeze the fluid right out of the prostate, potentially setting you back an hour of work. Press very lightly and slowly, then ease up at the first non-pleasurable feelings. Press it down a very small amount, then completely let off so it can \u2018refill\u2019, like a sponge. Sensations from the prostate can often be delayed, and going too quickly can make it difficult to tell what is and isn\u2019t working.<br><br>If you\u2019re not feeling anything from prostate stimulation, there&#039;s a good chance you haven\u2019t practiced enough to identify what it feels like. While you\u2019re really relaxed and horny, gently poke around and just think about what you\u2019re feeling. You\u2019ve probably looked up diagrams of where your prostate is, but your prostate can easily be off centre or in a slightly different position to the norm. It usually manifests as a light tingling feeling inside your tummy. If it feels like an itch you can&#039;t scratch, that&#039;s really good. Don&#039;t try and scratch it, keep tickling it and making it itchy. If you\u2019re not feeling anything, don\u2019t start pounding away.<br><br>If you do all this correctly, you should be feeling a pleasant tingling in your tummy that can (if you\u2019re lucky) spread throughout your body. With practice, you can make this tingling reach a climax, and experience a dry prostate orgasm.", "time": 1676008157, "resto": 69905479}, {"no": 69908841, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)00:50:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69908830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69908830</a><br>Once the prostate is full to bursting with fluid, you can end the session with a wet, ejaculating orgasm. Simply press a bit harder, still taking care not to drain it or lose concentration. I prefer to lie on my front for this part, since it provides a wall for you to press the prostate against. You should start getting sensations that remind you of a regular penile orgasm, except you\u2019ll feel them in your prostate. Chase those sensations the same way as you do with penile masturbation, and you can create a wet orgasm.<br><br>After a dry prostate orgasm, I typically find that I feel very \u2018cuddly\u2019, for lack of a better word. It doesn\u2019t have the same sudden drop in happiness that characterizes a penile orgasm, and I\u2019ve taken to using a body pillow mainly so I have something to squeeze afterwards. For what might be similar reasons, I find that really romantic porn is a lot more effective for prostate sessions.<br><br>Bear in mind this all takes a LOT of practice, experimentation, and the right tools.

If dropping sets noticeable gave them more gains, they would instantly notice, and would therefore keep dropping sets until they reach 1 set per muscle group.

People will argue over how much or how little you need to, but generally 10-20% is a good range. Meaning, if you can bench 100kg for 10 reps when you&#039;re fresh, by the end of the session you should only be able to bench 80-90kg for 10 reps due to fatigue. Remember, local fatigue and stimulus are the exact same thing, so saying that &quot;each set beyond the first set is useless&quot; is laughable because while yes you&#039;re generating more local fatigue, you&#039;re also generating more stimulus, since they&#039;re literally the exact same thing. You simply need to do enough to damage the baseline by 10-20%, then you&#039;re done on that musclegroup.

Training to failure is good in the sense that there is no ambiguity like with RIR, you know that you&#039;ve given it your all. That being said training to failure does generate a lot of fatigue so doing it all the time on highly fatiguing movements (squats, deadlifts, etc) may not be the best idea, so in that case you should probably use RIR.

The only thing that is needed to grow a muscle is to stimulate it, feed it, rest it, and let it recover and then subsequently pack on more muscle. That&#039;s the basic formula for muscle growth.<br><br>The thing nobody gets right is the stimulus portion. You have to place a demand on the body that it is not currently equipped to handle or otherwise it would have no reason to grow. Therefore you have to exercise it. Volume training does work, but the issue is ambiguity. When do you stop? The answer is when the muscle is properly stimulated. But when do you know if the muscle is stimulated? The answer is when you have placed a demand on it such that it is not able to overcome it and it reasonably believes that it needs to grow in order to keep its host organism alive (I know I&#039;m anthropomorphizing muscle, but still), which would ultimately place failure as the single most meaningful stimulus you can relate to the muscle. <br><br>Using RIR, RPE, multiple sets etc does not make sense because muscles can&#039;t count and also this tends to lead to overtraining. Do you know exactly when you have properly stimulated your muscle to grow within your 3-10 sets? On which rep does the signal get sent? Nobody knows. It&#039;s ambiguous. Nobody can know if they&#039;re at RPE 5 or 7. The only thing you can know for a fact is RPE 0 and 10. Everything else is theoretical. If you go to failure though, the answer is very clear. You get the stimulus when you hit failure. No more and no less is needed. Exactly at failure in a single set is when you have properly exercised. The only thing about training like this though is that it puts enormous fatigue on your system (that&#039;s the point), so you have to exercise far less than volumefags. It&#039;s useful in that it is clear on how to do it. It&#039;s not going to magically make you put on a shit ton of muscle. That is purely genetic.

If HIT, instead of being this single set done once every fortnight type of thing, if it was just a regular structure, training each body part roughly twice a week, with 2 sets per exercise &amp; a couple of exercises per body part, (3 for shoulders &amp; back), a shitload of people would make tremendous gains off that. HIT is just way off the Overton window for intensity/volume/frequency setups which tends to work in real life.

Like, 15 training sessions a week seriously. Then I burned out of that and I did my first competition about a year later, training out of a nearby non-uni rowing club with 3 old guys (50/60/70 years old) and 3 uni students. We all shared 1 bench. Sometimes we&#039;d have 8 or 10 people benching together, men, women, equipped. We&#039;d go from 45kg to 220kg. Good times.

Doesn&#039;t need to be some protracted thing though - It&#039;ll start ramping up somewhere between 12 and 24 hours, so if your a bit lucky in the genes, skipping breakfast and not snacking after dinner could be enough to get some results. On paper, the longer you go, the more pronounced the effect gets overall, but long fasts can be pretty difficult.<br><br>Its also not going to target just fat cells, but any spare connective tissues and such, including muscle - exercise will mitigate most if not all of that though.
