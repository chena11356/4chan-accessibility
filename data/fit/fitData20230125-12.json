If not then I guess people will have to stick with the existing &quot;get reasonably strong and then cut once you&#039;re not a pathetic weakling&quot; paradigm.

This is not an \u201cI hate my mom\u201d post in ANY regard, I am just finally recognizing that what works for her doesn\u2019t work for me.<br><br>After my last weight loss and gaining it all back plus more, I really reached an F-it moment and have given up EVERYTHING related to what I knew about dieting, and have been eating anything I want in any quantity for months. I stopped counting calories and exercising obsessively which I think are good actions, but I have not been eating intuitively or seeking out enjoyable activity as the workbook suggests. <br><br>Reading Intuitive Eating felt like the book was written just for me, it spoke directly to my heart. I am working through the workbook currently and have loved it so far.<br><br>I made the realization that I would rather remain at my current (higher) weight forever and have a healthy relationship with food than lose weight again and be absolutely obsessed with food like I have been my entire life.<br><br>I would consider myself to have good self esteem, I truly believe I am beautiful and do my best not to let any exterior appearances alter how much I enjoy my life. However, one practical problem that I\u2019m facing currently is that my clothes don\u2019t fit me well and I\u2019m uncomfortable every day at work until I can come home and put my pajamas on.<br>Pic related.

I didn\u2019t see it, but people closer to her claimed that she actually lifted her ass up off the saddle before she discharged, which would have been quite a feat given her morbidly obese physique.<br><br>Everyone immediately stopped doing what they were doing. I stopped my tricep pushdown mid-rep and, like everyone else, turned to look at the cardio area.

And then picture a gigantic cloud of that smell drifting over to you, and the closer it gets, the more you feel the air around you get warmer. <br><br>Needless to say, we all shoved our faces into our whatever towel or shirt we could get our hands on and tried our best to filter blastoise\u2019s bubonic ass bubble from entering our lungs. <br><br>The funny thing is that she carried on with her cardio session, all 15 minutes of it, then left and never came back. Even funnier is that the bike she used was never used again. People simply refused to get on it, even those who weren\u2019t there when the fart occurred. It was like the bike had a curse on it. Even on busy moments like Friday evenings or Saturday mornings when there was nearly always a queue to get onto a bike or treadmill, Blitzkrieg Bob\u2019s bike would remain empty.

He\u2019s about 50 years old and really small, probably not more than 5 ft 2. The only exercises he ever does are incline bench presses and barbell calf raises. He\u2019s also very hairy, but for some reason he shaves his calves and leaves the rest of his legs looking like they belong to an orangutang. Somebody once said to me that his calves look like a baby\u2019s head coming out of a very hairy ginger vagina. Now I can\u2019t look at his stumpy little legs without having to laugh out loud.<br><br>As for his name, you know the little protein powder sachets that have a single serving in them for 1 protein shake? Well, he\u2019s always got about 5 of them in his fanny pack and before he starts lifting he\u2019ll rip one open and sprinkle protein powder onto his hands like it\u2019s chalk and then rub them together. Then he pours the rest of the sachet into his mouth and eats it raw. Obviously, half of the protein powder ends up in his beard and all caked up on his lips. And because his favourite flavour is cherry, it makes it look like half of his face is covered in blood.<br><br>Oh and the only thing he ever seems to talk about is the protein value of food. You can ask him any food in the world and he\u2019ll tell you exactly how much protein it has. Like you could walk up to him and say \u201ckidney beans?\u201d and he\u2019ll mumble to himself for a couple of seconds and then come out with the exact percentage of protein the average kidney bean

It opens doors for you; however, you need to be able to carry those situations all of the way with your wit and charm. People implicitly trust and respect you more when you are lean. People will occasionally do unsolicited favors for you. I don\u2019t think they can help it.

To be honest, it\u2019s easy not to notice how differently people treat you if you aren\u2019t especially observant. It\u2019s subtle. Women will do double takes on the street; however, it usually takes a friend to tell you \u201chey, bro, those girls really like you!\u201d When you\u2019re a man, people seldom fawn over you, even if you\u2019re exceptionally handsome.<br><br>Anyway, I wouldn\u2019t say that I feel too differently.

I also wear squatting shoes with a heel to assist in this. I am feeling sore in my quads as well, but I am surprised that I also feel it in my hamstrings. Could this just be soreness from novel stimuli since I havent lifted in at least a year?", "time": 1674560134, "resto": 69697495}, {"no": 69708091, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:44:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69708031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69708031</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one-arm row</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bent over row</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lateral raises</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;over head press</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pullover</span>", "time": 1674560697, "resto": 69697495}, {"no": 69708126, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:51:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69697495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69697495</a><br>my wife is spending 4 days in Montreal with a friend of ours to help him find an apartment for his new job.

He said he wants to drill with me, asked me to lay down on the mat. At the same time, all guys around me suddenly came to life and began to demand me to lay down and take this rare version of guard, motivating it with the fact that with me the drill will be more effective. It seemed strange to me, but I didn\u2019t want to seem non-companionable at the very first training session, so I accepted this stupid pose. But then suddenly they grabbed me by the arms and legs, pulled off the gi and started to hit my ass with belts laughing wildly at the same time.

Well, I was foolish and replied that it was all a fucking dick and stop making fun of me. He became very angry, shouting at me, saying that I had offended future winners of competitions and coaches. Then he offered me a choice - they beat the shit out me or fuck me in the ass. I began to deny, said calm down, calm down.

Think about your internal garden as the flow of life itself. Life exists as a cycle, in which things are born, thrive, and eventually die to give way for the next generation. Everything exists in an eternal cycle of starting over. Once you have understood that basic principle of accepting there is a point in which things cease to exist, at least as we once knew them, then you start to become free. I don\u00b4t mean it in a LE NOTHING MATTERS way, but in the exact opposite: EVERYTHING MATTERS. <br><br>Everything matters exactly because it can, at any point, end.

You are better off deeply stretching and rehabbing the muscle.<br>I had piriformis syndrome last year. It made my life miserable. I was able to go from not being able to put my socks on in the morning to being able to squat and deadlift again 3 months later. My routine was to focus heavily on stretching for the first month, then easy into doing good mornings.<br><br>There are a few different ways to can position yourself while stretching your piriformis, I would recommend experimenting with a few. Find one where you can get a really deep stretch and another that you can perform more easily and with less effort. For myself, I do a seated piriformis stretch for easy and frequent stretching. Pigeon pose works great for getting a really deep stretch. Make sure to stretch frequently. Try first thing in the morning, immediately after work and before bed.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yam<wbr>sq-uHP8Y<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_z<wbr>PqA65Nok<br><br>As for recovering enough to lift weights again, learn how to properly do a good morning. Learn how to hinge at your hips in a way that stretches your hamstrings and keeps your lower back in a neutral position. Start doing good mornings unweighted, then try them with an empty bar. Do not add weight to the bar until you can do 20 perfect reps. A good strength standard for good mornings is 95lbs for sets of 15, so make sure you don&#039;t get too carries away with them.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxN<wbr>uAQknYQI<br><br>Can&#039;t promise that this will work perfectly for you, but this is what worked for me. The root cause of your piriformis syndrome is likely bad form, poor posture (could be anterior pelvic tilt, that&#039;s what I had), or limited hip mobility.

There is no reason why you should arbitrarily cut the ROM short just so you can lift more weight unless you&#039;re training for strength instead of hypertrophy.<br><br>Also I don&#039;t see anything wrong with his pic at all besides the fact that there isn&#039;t much weight on the bar (which isn&#039;t an issue if he&#039;s just demonstrating what his form looks like lol)", "time": 1674344418, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69680984, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:04:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1674349463, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69682196, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)22:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;69678411</span><br>damn", "time": 1674357103, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69682757, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:19:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69676808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69676808</a><br>Most of your mental issues can be fixed by having high quality sleep.", "time": 1674361153, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69683163, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69682757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69682757</a><br>Probably true considering how sleep deprived most people are these days", "time": 1674364403, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69683646, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:35:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1674369348, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69684534, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:12:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69679757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69679757</a><br>Based", "time": 1674378724, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69686216, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)09:02:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69677460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69677460</a><br>Schizo", "time": 1674396175, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69686366, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)09:23:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bulgarian split squats with elevation for front and rear foot, to increase ROM, should replace BB back squats as default squat. <br><br>Trap bar DLor hip thrusts should replace DL as standard hinge, depending on goals.", "time": 1674397406, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69686387, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)09:25:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69676808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69676808</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;becoming flexible through resistance training is very easy</span><br>Explain nigger", "time": 1674397556, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69686410, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)09:29:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69686387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69686387</a><br>Not OP but weighted stretching is better for improving flexibility and strength so if you do exercises with a decent stretch component e.g. RDLs for hamstrings, you can become more flexible over time.", "time": 1674397746, "resto": 69676808}, {"no": 69687609, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)11:47:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69686366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69686366</a><br>Hmm while I do think that bilateral squats are fine deficit BSS would be one of the better replacements for them.
