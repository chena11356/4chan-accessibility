A wider range is usually better like 3x8-12 instead of 3x10. Once the first set hits 12 and the other reps are within the range you move up in weight.

Choosing to truly leave it behind was a process of months. I started experimenting with psychedelics, which led me to therapy, facing my inner conflict and the damage that was done to me when I was ostracized as a young lad for being &quot;weird&quot; - a mentally ill loner kid like many of us here, for which I sought comfort in escapism.

Hell Style is kinda like a fighting style you know like capoeira, aikido, krav maga etc etc I could go on but you get what I mean. its also kinda like a training philosophy to push your body and mind to its absolute limits even if it means destroying yourself in the process. I have numerous scars and injuries but I have always broken my limits. On max out days I sit in my room accumulating stress and rage for 6 hours not allowing myself to show any emotion or fear, I take 2000mg ibuprofen 60 minutes before maxout, I take 400 mg caffeine pills 30 minutes before maxout, I bring dedicated weight movers to put the weights on the bar so I dont f*cking kill somebody from all of my hell rage. I then max out imagining that the fate of the world is in the balance if I dont lift the f*cking bar, sometimes i like to switch it up like if i dont lift the bar then my whole family dies or smth. I use hypnotist techniques like on youtube to make myself think its real and then I add extra danger by walking out backwards or removign the safeties. then obviously I lift it and I dont fail ever. After the lift I feel nothing, I still have excess stress and adrenaline preventing me from feeling any happiness or emotion.

I was fat as fuck and a depressed sack of shit going into 2021. My long term gf left me, I was jobless and aimlessly spinning my wheels in life. I managed to find work again and spent the next year getting fat, unhappy and drawing away from anyone in my life. I was drinking very heavily. Last summer I weighed myself for the first time in almost 2 years. I was 310 pounds, had to buy bigger clothes and was spending every night alone, miserable and eating myself to death for brief feelings of comfort. At my lowest I had set a handgun on the table loaded and stared at it for an hour wondering if it was all even worth it. Then a friend reached out to me and offered to be my gym partner as he had been going for a couple years at that point. I accepted and bought a membership that day. Since then I&#039;ve been consistent and I&#039;ve passed 1/2/3/4, stopped drinking and have lost 30 pounds. I have much more to go but my progress has put my life back on track. I found my friends again and now we&#039;re closer than ever. I&#039;ve never had an interest in running but now it feels like I&#039;m free from the prison i turned my body into. I run for a mile and a half a day now. And every day i get better. I used to not even be able to walk far without sweating like a pig. Now at the end of my cardio sessions, I find freedom in sprinting to the finish. The shackles I hung on myself feel like they have been left behind. I now am starting a business with my friends and my old clothes fit again. I&#039;m in better shape than I have been in years. My whole life is turning around thanks to heavy lifting. Now at 280 pounds I can for the first time do 3 pull-ups in a row. I&#039;m well on my way to reversing so much h of the damage I&#039;ve done to myself. The biggest help you can ever have is yourself.

She told me that I&#039;ve changed and she is starting to get back the same feelings towards me that she had when we first met. I would never want to get back to her again, she is in a relationship now as well so I cut her loose and wished all the best for her.

Either get nice flat ones or go barefoot. For deads you gotta practice the hip hinge. Bracing your core is vital as well, gotta take a good deep breath and then do as if you&#039;re trying to exhale through your mouth (both nose and it should be closed though, don&#039;t let the air out). Then you drive through with your legs as if you&#039;re trying to push the floor away from you, keeping your back straight - the knees will naturally move backwards and as you lift the bar above them your hips should thrust forward and that&#039;s that.

If so can you recommend a ratio? Thanks.</span><br>Not inherently for the 19nor, I am not familiar with the DHT/Prolactin interaction because I myself never have prolactin related issues. I would assume it offers some benefit but that is a total guess. I personally run a DHT derivative because it allows me to push test a little higher once added in, without needing a true AI. I can go from about 1g test/wk without AI with no mast in a stack, and after adding mast can bump that to 1.2-1.4 without issue. Trying to run 1.2-1.4 test otherwise gives me god awful side effects. As for ratios, I don&#039;t think ratios are as important as guys make them out to be. Actually let me rephrase that, they are important, but the individual variability is so wild with ratios that some guys might be fine running low test crazy high 19nor, others might have the worst time of their life. My advice for adding anything is always to start reasonably low (for yoru stack, lets say 200 or 300mg) and work up. <br><a href=\"#p69561206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69561206</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bruh what&#039;s your bf?</span><br>in offseason I try to keep around 17% tops, I put on weight pretty easily in general so I run my bodyfat a little higher than most guys like to keep it around 15% or else I tend to cut my offseason too short.

Gen Z is walking around bragging about being quadruble vaxxed and listening to mumble rap singles. Not even entire albums. Just sitting there all hopped up on their SSRIs they&#039;ve been on since 7th grade and sharing memes that 4chan debuted 4 years ago. They don&#039;t know how to do anything unless it gets them fake, unmonetized likes on social media, anyone of the 91 social media platforms. They have them all. They can&#039;t cook. They can&#039;t clean. They can&#039;t work. They can&#039;t hunt. They can&#039;t fish. They don&#039;t know how to write a SQL statement, they don&#039;t even know how to swap the drill bit out of their dad&#039;s Dewalt Drill. They probably couldn&#039;t even figure out a hammer and nail.

All you can do is gain weight and/or spend an absurd amount of time doing movements that will thicken up all the tendons in the hand like rockclimbers, but this won&#039;t make your hand larger, just thicker (Though gaining weight and by extension fat might make them very slightly longer/wider, it won&#039;t be that much)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wrist</span><br>Over time the tendons can thicken up from use, if you progress on forearm exercises that heavily use the tendons while making sure you don&#039;t get tendonitis this could probably speed it up. Maybe look into pinch gripping multiple plates or something 6-10 cm wide as I find that you tend to feel the tendons in your wrist a LOT when pinch gripping stuff with a more open hand. Also axle bars/fat grips tend to also use the tendons more so you can try that too. This would be a very long process but it is doable.

Don&#039;t cheat at all with your hips/back, use a slow eccentric, and don&#039;t raise your elbows, and use wrist wraps. Otherwise you may fuck up your wrists (happened to me, I learned my lesson, now I can do these with no issue). Hammer curls are also good but they won&#039;t bias the brachioradialis as much, they&#039;re more of a hybrid lift (however you can use fat grips on them without any problems so maybe do that)<br><br>Myoreps are also very good for finger curls and reverse/hammer curls so try that as well. Train forearms frequently as they recover fairly fast, and I highly recommend using supersets/giantsets whenever you can to save time as forearm exercises are not very taxing.", "time": 1673645308, "resto": 69586680}, {"no": 69586793, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)16:29:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69586700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69586700</a><br>Independent, because I get to hit mr house with a golf club and pull an uno reverso on general oliver.", "time": 1673645347, "resto": 69586680}, {"no": 69586802, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)16:29:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69586789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69586789</a><br>Shit forgot to mention, you CAN make part of your hands bigger.
