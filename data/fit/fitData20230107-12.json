Thin people are treated better in social settings than fat ones. But not every privilege is unjustified. Privilege simply means to have a special right that only applies to an individual or a group of people.

Fat people are penalized socially for their bad behavior that is damaging to society as a whole. Not only does it waste an immense amount of resources, it also cripples welfare systems and socialized healthcare, because fatties pretty much make themselves disabled on purpose and expect other people to work for their upkeep and medical bills. You also can&#039;t trust a fatty - someone who has so little self control that he mutilates himself out of hedonism certainly won&#039;t stick to concepts like loyalty, trust or morals when there&#039;s any conflict of interests.

Girls weren&#039;t interested, I wasn&#039;t good at sports, and I was always skinny fat. I also had a small dick (legit 4&quot; into high school) and a fucked up home life. I flat out accepted girls weren&#039;t into me and didn&#039;t even try, same thing with pretty much all aspects of my life.<br><br>I got to college and just got sick of it. I was sick of being bad at fucking everything. I decided to try, for once in my life actually work at something and give it my all so at least I could look back and know that I did something about it. <br><br>I hit the gym and went religiously (5-6 days a week) and started giving a shit about my appearance. I couldn&#039;t even do a pull-up or bench more than 90lbs at first, but I sucked it up and kept going. For the first time in my life I noticed progress, I actually became stronger. I realized I had a lot of bad shit instilled in me from my childhood and this was the kick I needed to overcome it. I&#039;m not sure if it was just my age or the test boost from lifting, but it was like I hit a second puberty. I started getting some hair on my chest, the fat on my face went away, started seeing abs, my dick was now hitting 7&quot;, and I felt confident talking to other people. <br><br>My life did a complete 180, I was getting hit on all the time, had my first kiss with a girl who asked me out, met my gf (also asked me out), started getting As instead of B/C&#039;s, got compliments on my appearance, and felt a lot better about myself. One that really stands out was when I was working an internship and there were pictures taken of us and someone in the office saw my pic and out loud said &quot;that kid looks like an Abercrombie model lol&quot; when looking through them.

per week)<br>- Yes, it will feel like you&#039;re going slow, you are; don&#039;t worry about setting good times for at least a couple months<br>- If you start to feel pain anywhere, stop and rest, then run a shorter distance next time or walk<br>- Don&#039;t worry about form, the human body knows how to run, just do what comes naturally<br>- Once you can comfortably run 6 mi. (10km), start thinking about a goal in terms of race distance and time, and look for a training routine for that race. This routine should typically have a long run, a few medium distance/pace runs, and a few fartlek/interval repeat workouts each week.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dynamic stretching (best to do this prior to hard efforts)</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIX<wbr>VDdH3o6g<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Couch to 5k Guide</span><br>https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exerci<wbr>se/running-and-aerobic-exercises/ge<wbr>t-running-with-couch-to-5k/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sprinters Guides</span><br>https://trackstarusa.com/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I want to run a fast 5k, 10k, half-marathon, or marathon</span><br>https://www.runningfastr.com/ (with goal times)<br>https://www.halhigdon.com/ (more planning necessary but more thorough workouts/explanations)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stretching guide</span><br>https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/tra<wbr>ining/beginners/a32172701/how-to-st<wbr>retch-post-run/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Performance calculator</span><br>https://runninglevel.com/", "filename": "how-to-find-your-optimal-running-paces", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672842596719639, "time": 1672842596, "md5": "Unr0MOtIsMl3CjoCc9nt8w==", "fsize": 75101, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "run-roon", "replies": 293, "images": 42, "unique_ips": 90, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 69473467, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)09:32:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69473448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69473448</a><br>ahhh time for the morning roon", "filename": "wX1tKtc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672842737050919, "time": 1672842737, "md5": "X0SwJr8hxKDMOIv84wZiTw==", "fsize": 159906, "resto": 69473448}, {"no": 69473509, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)09:38:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69473448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69473448</a><br>No, but I rooned yesterday.

I initially started with Greyskull LP and wanted to try to pursue some bodyweight/gymnastic progressions alongside the program, but over time, I realized that I would have benefited more from putting more of my mental focus on the barbell lifts, and could have gotten stronger faster through SSLP. I finally read through copies of Starting Strength and Practical Programming for Strength Training (which is what eventually landed me to the Baker Barbell Club). I eventually swapped to SSLP with a few modifications (swapping Power Cleans for Inverted Rows), although training had been a bit inconsistent for a while. Somewhere in late August, I finally restarted to try to recover my previous PRs on past lifts (I had hit 3x5 220lbs on the Squat in January that year).<br><br>Unfortunately, a month ago, I injured myself, straining what felt to be the left-ish part of my abs, a physical therapist identifying it as my left external obliques. I felt the pain when mimicking the deadlift movement pattern and not the squat, so I assume I likely injured myself on the deadlift. Although I was deadlifting a load that I had previously done, I had decided to move from my last squat set to my deadlifts, even if I did not feel fully rested from the set, since it had been 15 minutes. I warmed up, hoping to feel less exhausted by the time I was ready for the working set. I still felt faitgued, and decided to lift anyways, something that I now see as a mistake.

I\u2019m thinking of maybe plugging in 25-30 minutes of steady-state cardio on Wednesday, and after a month, tacking on some kind of conditioning on Friday as well (e.g. work on the Prowler). I almost wonder if my failure to be fully ready by the deadlifts are due to my poor conditioning. I used to run recreationally, but I stopped around the time I started lifting.<br>Since I have felt historically awkward benching, I thought it might be a good idea to swap the bench for the pushup, since I liked the movement better. I actually GtG\u2019d my numbers back up for the pushup since they had detrained for a bit, but eventually realized that it would be better to just refocus on the bench and add 5lbs at a time while working on form, while doing 3 sets of pushups during the night time of each session with the last set to failure, only adding two reps to each set when the set to failure was at least 4 reps higher. My plan was to just increase my bench 5lbs with the normal progression until failing, then resetting 5% and increasing with 2.5lbs. Though I wonder if it will take a while before I hit my 3x5, so I wonder if there is a more efficient way to do this, like looking for my 5RM and subtracting 10lbs and going from there instead. At 210lbs, assuming I lift 55% of my bodyweight, I have a rep max of 16 pushups, which comes out to pushing 115lbs for 16 reps. I started swapping to pushups at around 3x5 110lbs. I know there is a neural aspect to strength and some of my progress is just due to learning the movement better, which is why I think a more aggressive approach might just prevent progress in the long-run, but I thought asking for advice might be best.", "time": 1673057164, "resto": 69505966}, {"no": 69506168, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:06:37", "name": "Se\u06dean", "com": "<a href=\"#p69506148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69506148</a><br>this post is way too long, no ones going to read this shit lmao, just delete your posts and leave my general, please, im begging you", "time": 1673057197, "resto": 69505966}, {"no": 69506172, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:07:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69506162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69506162</a> (4/4)<br>My deadlift seems to have stalled at 295lbs with increasing at 10lbs every other session, and even stalls that way seemingly with 5lbs every other session.

We aimed to study the incidence of post-acute COVID-19 myocarditis and pericarditis. Retrospective cohort study of 196,992 adults after COVID-19 infection in Clalit Health Services members in Israel between March 2020 and January 2021. Inpatient myocarditis and pericarditis diagnoses were retrieved from day 10 after positive PCR. Follow-up was censored on 28 February 2021, with minimum observation of 18 days. The control cohort of 590,976 adults with at least one negative PCR and no positive PCR were age- and sex-matched. Since the Israeli vaccination program was initiated on 20 December 2020, the time-period matching of the control cohort was calculated backward from 15 December 2020. Nine post-COVID-19 patients developed myocarditis (0.0046%), and eleven patients were diagnosed with pericarditis (0.0056%). In the control cohort, 27 patients had myocarditis (0.0046%) and 52 had pericarditis (0.0088%).

This reply has some extra details in it is all</span><br>Good job so far on the weight loss dude! Squat and bench is a good baseline to start with. Put the squat first because it&#039;ll take more concentration and energy compared to the bench. I&#039;d also recommend putting in some rear delt raises/reverse pec dec after you bench. It&#039;s healthy for the shoulders. Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps for each lift. Just that little bit is okay for the first few weeks while you get used to lifting again.<br><br>If you like having a Chest/Leg day like you&#039;re doing now, then the other muscles to consider are the arms, shoulders, and back. Arnold Schwarzenegger had a split like that at one point. For the second day start with an overhead press, chinups/lat pulldown, and some rows. After that do a short circuit of lateral raises, curls, and a tricep exercise that&#039;s easy on the elbows like rope pushdowns. Same as the first day, do 3x8-12 (except for the chinups if you choose it over lat pull downs; those do to failure). Also for the lateral raises you always want to push those well past failure and get to the point where you can only squeeze out little partials. The shoulders are a muscle group that needs a lot of stimulation to grow and most compounds don&#039;t do much for the side delt. Do this day right after the first day.<br><br>After 2 weeks or so of this you can start adding more exercises to fill out the routine more. The soreness is going to come back for new muscles for you but most of your body will be good. The second day has most of what it needs already, you just have to add an extra arm exercise for both the bicep and the tricep and increase the volume of work you do for the back. It can really take a beating. The first day though you&#039;ll add Romanian deadlifts, an incline bench press, and a crazy amount of calf raises. If you want some more butt gains then also add Bulgarian split squats.", "time": 1672981897, "resto": 69489156}, {"no": 69495451, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:18:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "sorry about my noob question and ms paint doodle but does anyone know what these lines/indents on the sides of my tummy are (pink)? will they go away if i lose weight? thank you", "filename": "Untitled", "ext": ".png", "w": 258, "h": 240, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1672982283931613, "time": 1672982283, "md5": "owdPL2Mdz/sONHq1AwX/Sg==", "fsize": 4831, "resto": 69489156}, {"no": 69495485, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:22:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69493004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69493004</a><br><a href=\"#p69495416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69495416</a><br>First 2ish weeks<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schedule (fit it how you need to for your week)</span><br>Day 1<br>Day 2<br>Rest<br>Day 1<br>Day 2<br>Rest<br>Rest<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Day 1</span><br>Back Squat 3x8-12<br>Barbell Bench Press 3x8-12<br>Rear Delt Flies OR Reverse Pec Dec 3x8-12<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Day 2</span><br>Overhead Press 3x8-12<br>Chinups OR Lat Pull Down 3x8-12 (or 3xFailure if using chinups)<br>Dumbbell Rows OR Seated Cable Row (any variation of row is okay if you&#039;re limited by equipment) 3x8-12<br>GIANTSET x 3 Sets<br>Dumbbell Lateral Raises 8-12 clean reps and then 5-6 partials<br>Dumbbell Curl 8-12<br>Rope Pushdown 8-12", "time": 1672982536, "resto": 69489156}, {"no": 69495492, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:23:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69495416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69495416</a><br>You&#039;re a fucking God send bro, I mean it.

Then I resumed my diet, all good.<br><br>I don&#039;t know, for me the point of these &quot;rewards&quot; is allowing yourself to not make intelligent choices. I&#039;m already 30 years old so I already know myself well enough to not try this &quot;everything in moderation&quot; crap. I&#039;ll work out 3 days week, watch my macros, not eat a single piece of candy or fast food or soda or anything like that for 3 months straight no problem. I fasted 3 days, 5 days, 7 days last year, multiple times. That&#039;s how I lost over 25kg while gaining muscle and going on these binge drinking adventures. When I put my mind to something, I do it right. But to reward myself with a singular pizza after that? Fuck that. If I can&#039;t turn fully my brain off I&#039;d just be thinking of the white flour in the dough. It wouldn&#039;t be a reward.
