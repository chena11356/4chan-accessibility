Think of it as a FUPA that has transcended even further beyond. At this point a panniculectomy is done, which removes excess skin and stitches the disconnected portions back together; however, typically for still obese patients it&#039;s tucked further back into their stomach in a semi-fold lining their inner abdomen wall. The black lines in pic related follow what would be the usual pathing of scars as the extra skin which couldn&#039;t be removed is double layered upon itself before being stitched into place. While not a perfect solution, it does remove the protruding pouch and opens up additional benefits such as removal of waste without the involvement of heavy readjusting of prior skin obstacles.

If you\u2019re not paying careful attention, it\u2019ll get drowned out by other things, like how uncomfortable or tired you are. I recommend against touching your dick, as it\u2019s too distracting. Any method of stimulation that requires a lot of work on your part, can also be too distracting. I recommend against any toys that require you to hold them for this reason.<br><br>People who get frustrated will start pounding their prostate too hard. The goal of prostate stimulation is to build up fluid in the prostate; the pressure of that fluid is what makes it feels good. Pressing too hard will squeeze the fluid right out of the prostate, potentially setting you back an hour of work. Press very lightly and slowly, then ease up at the first non-pleasurable feelings. Press it down a very small amount, then completely let off so it can \u2018refill\u2019, like a sponge. Sensations from the prostate can often be delayed, and going too quickly can make it difficult to tell what is and isn\u2019t working.<br><br>If you\u2019re not feeling anything from prostate stimulation, there&#039;s a good chance you haven\u2019t practiced enough to identify what it feels like. While you\u2019re really relaxed and horny, gently poke around and just think about what you\u2019re feeling. You\u2019ve probably looked up diagrams of where your prostate is, but your prostate can easily be off centre or in a slightly different position to the norm. It usually manifests as a light tingling feeling inside your tummy. If it feels like an itch you can&#039;t scratch, that&#039;s really good. Don&#039;t try and scratch it, keep tickling it and making it itchy. If you\u2019re not feeling anything, don\u2019t start pounding away.<br><br>If you do all this correctly, you should be feeling a pleasant tingling in your tummy that can (if you\u2019re lucky) spread throughout your body. With practice, you can make this tingling reach a climax, and experience a dry prostate orgasm.", "time": 1676008157, "resto": 69905479}, {"no": 69908841, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)00:50:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69908830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69908830</a><br>Once the prostate is full to bursting with fluid, you can end the session with a wet, ejaculating orgasm. Simply press a bit harder, still taking care not to drain it or lose concentration. I prefer to lie on my front for this part, since it provides a wall for you to press the prostate against. You should start getting sensations that remind you of a regular penile orgasm, except you\u2019ll feel them in your prostate. Chase those sensations the same way as you do with penile masturbation, and you can create a wet orgasm.<br><br>After a dry prostate orgasm, I typically find that I feel very \u2018cuddly\u2019, for lack of a better word. It doesn\u2019t have the same sudden drop in happiness that characterizes a penile orgasm, and I\u2019ve taken to using a body pillow mainly so I have something to squeeze afterwards. For what might be similar reasons, I find that really romantic porn is a lot more effective for prostate sessions.<br><br>Bear in mind this all takes a LOT of practice, experimentation, and the right tools.

If it doesn&#039;t start as their idea I don&#039;t love the odds. I think it&#039;s a huge waste of time to talk about health benefits to young people, if they haven&#039;t always been fat you can try an angle about how people treat you better when you&#039;re not that fat. Let&#039;s say they can be convinced to start on their weight loss journey, we have the issue of you wanting to work with them. I wouldn&#039;t have expected any great insight on this topic from someone just because he wasn&#039;t fat. If they let you in understand there are a lot of ways to lose weight, I mean it&#039;s likely they want control so if they want to choose the number of meals or at what time they want to have them or go a bit slower at the start they&#039;re the ones in charge and you being autistic about what the most efficient way to do it is is just going to make them reject you. There&#039;s also shit that&#039;s awful for them but it&#039;s likely they don&#039;t want to give up, like alcohol so you have to know what you&#039;re dealing with. You also need to deal with the problem that it&#039;s easier to not think about eating when you&#039;re not talking about eating, so if you want to do some followup on how their diets are going they may get irritable because that question itself makes them hungry. They&#039;re also going to do a little cheat here and there they don&#039;t want to tell you about. If you see any physical progress don&#039;t make a big deal about it but it&#039;s something they may want to hear as long as it&#039;s sincere. Goals can be a positive thing, but every time I failed one it made me want to give up on the whole thing and checking the cronometer chart on weight over some amount of time can be enough to make them realize they&#039;re achieving something.<br><br>There&#039;s another path I&#039;m thinking about now which is making some kind of bet, if the bet&#039;s against a third person and you&#039;re putting down your money it makes it more natural to be involved in the journey.", "time": 1676128722, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69923547, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:19:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69921095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69921095</a><br>aspiring finnish femboy I hope", "time": 1676128743, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69923592, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:23:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69920776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69920776</a><br>Fatty Contest<br>BrapHog<br>211.0 lbs<br>5&#039;7&quot;<br>WAGMI", "time": 1676128992, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69923630, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fatty Contest<br>Burned Man<br>200<br>6&#039;1", "time": 1676129296, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69923731, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:37:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there anything too concerning about eating 1500-2000 cals and walking 10 miles every couple days as my primary exercise? <br>Would be 500-1500 deficit.", "time": 1676129857, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69923810, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:47:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69923731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69923731</a><br>nothing at all, unless you feel light headed and risk fainting.", "time": 1676130420, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69924085, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:15:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69920776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69920776</a><br>Im farting so much god damn lol", "time": 1676132130, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69924217, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:26:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "fattycontest<br>crisco<br><br>258.0", "time": 1676132804, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69924226, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:27:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69924085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69924085</a><br>What&#039;s your diet?", "time": 1676132860, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69924239, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:28:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Reminder that weight loss isn&#039;t possible unless you&#039;re just using it as a way to kill yourself because it&#039;s only possible to modify your behavior once in a lifetime and never again, and that modification can only do one of 3 things<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You lose weight and eventually die of skinny (because you are never again able to alter your diet so that you ever stop losing weight)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You maintain (still fat lmao)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You gain weight (even more fat lmao)</span>", "time": 1676132913, "resto": 69920776}, {"no": 69924317, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:35:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fatty Contest<br>LardChrysalid<br>186.2 lbs<br><br>This week and the next are a maintenance break.

If you&#039;re a fat lazy alcoholic retard and you decide to quit drinking cold turkey, start a 1000kcal deficit low carb diet, join a powerlifting gym and enroll into a phd program, you won&#039;t last a day. If, on the other hand, you start by getting the normal beer instead of the extra-strength one, you put erythritol and milk in your morning coffee instead of sugar and cream, you do 2 sets of push ups and 2 sets of body squats when you wake up and you walk around the block in the evening, and you read 5 pages of a book you&#039;re interested in before going to sleep, it won&#039;t feel like much. It might even feel like it&#039;s not enough and you could do more. This is important: don&#039;t. The goal is to set a new baseline for yourself. Once these things just happen as a matter of course, not because you&#039;re willing yourself to do them but because that&#039;s just what you do now, increase the difficulty of each task.

Can we have a rational discussion on the effects on nofap and the optimal way to do it? After reading a bit about it i can see that it&#039;s beneficial to do for a while since doing it every day is gonna affect your dopamine levels. I feel people when talking about this subject go into extremes, with either being full coomers or not fapping at all. I noticed that i&#039;m a coomer since i fap once every day or every 2 days. I noticed this happens because of the social medias i use. Even here on 4chan every board has a lot of coomer bait. And if i don&#039;t coom for 1 day only 1 coomer bait picture is enough to make me coom in 20 seconds if i touch my dick.<br>After realizing this and reading some stuff about testosterone i came to the conclusion that the best way to go about it is to fap maybe once/8days to your imagination. Also the strategy to achieve this is to avoid all coomerbait social medias. What do you guys think about nofap? Is it beneficial to go more than 8days and am i a coping coomer?

You need to think of your future self. Let me put things in perspective for you:<br><br>Say you meet a great woman tomorrow and start a serious relationship. Even if you love her a lot, the fastest you can reasonably allow yourself to move towards marriage would be like 1.5 years to pop the question. Now you are almost 23 if we are in fast mode. Generally people are engaged for like 9-15 months to plan a wedding, send invites, make sure you aren&#039;t making a mistake, etc. Now you are almost 25 on FAST MODE.<br><br>How long do you want to be married before you have kids? Generally people start trying 18-30 months after marriage. On fast mode, you start trying for your first child as you are coming up on 27 which I would say is a pretty well adjust age for your FIRST child. How many do you want? 2? 3? How far apart in age? 2-3 years is the typical gap. Your first will be born as you are approaching 28. Assume your woman is the same age as you. After 30, the fertility of women diminishes and the background risk of complication/disability increases. Do you have any idea how fucked it is to raise sick children? Really have a hard think about it. In reality the risk doesn&#039;t get TOO bad until you are looking at 35, but remember we are on FAST MODE and you meet your girl TOMORROW in this scenario. <br><br>Put off relationship seeking at your peril. If you are going to shirk the responsibility of living you will be forced to go after younger women in crowds you don&#039;t fit easily into. Most of the best women are picked up in college.

You should be able to talk about simple things, even if you aren&#039;t fully invested.

Learn how to give your opinion on them, and it will seem like you&#039;re well-versed in many ground level topics. For example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the weather, this one is fucking basic</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sports teams, you should maybe know what accomplishments your local team has made recently</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;entertainment news, knowing new albums or current artists is a great starting point</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;avoid politics as it can be quite polarizing, but know what powerful people have decided on recently</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;know about the outdoors and what you have explored recently, this one can be real easy to learn and cheap at the same time</span><br>...And so on. Just step it down a notch and break it down to basics. Try not to jump too hard from topic to topic and just focus on being light and courteous. It goes a long way, trust me.

I guarantee in a street fight 50% of drunk assholes are gonna put their head down and charge for a football tackle, be it right away or after the getting picked apart on the feet for a bit. Wrestling, BJJ, and even boxing have an answer to this with head positioning and footwork if your determined to not go to the ground.

BUT there are things that get in the way. Not all calories are the same. Like you can&#039;t eat 2500 calories of protein and expect your mood and body to work like you were on 2500 calories of fat or sugar. Your brain can&#039;t run on protein for one thing and your muscles can&#039;t replace glycogen with protein. Also if you ate 2500 calories of sugar, you could think and do a workout, but you&#039;d eventually crash and you&#039;d wear yourself down eventually not having protein to repair your muscles. You&#039;d also probably build up an insulen resistance making it harder on your body to burn stored fat. You&#039;d just get tired and go sit because your body doesn&#039;t want to give up the fat This would look like your body was burning fewer calories daily. <br><br>I don&#039;t know why we keep having this discussion. Really, eat at a calorie suplus or just fast if you want to burn fat. Try to keep your diet full of protein, fat and fiber. Don&#039;t eat a lot of processed food, especially shit full of white flour and cane sugar. Keep your protein intake at 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to build and maintain muscle. <br><br>I guess Europeans get pissed about this and shit up threads because they love pasta and bread not realizing Americans have to cut this shit because American bread is like a 15 inch long candy bar.", "time": 1676122324, "resto": 69921586}, {"no": 69922800, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)08:35:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69922158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69922158</a><br>Both my mom and my sister have issues with their thyroid.<br>They are both skinny, even my mom who is in her 50s<br>BECAUSE THEY DON\u2019T EAT LIKE A LANDWHALE", "time": 1676122506, "resto": 69921586}, {"no": 69922853, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)08:42:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69922373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69922373</a><br>Being thin doesn&#039;t mean you are metabolically healthy, it might actually be worse than being fat, who instead of using PUFA store it for the liver to detox later, while thin people immediatly use the pufa, wrecking havoc on the organs.
