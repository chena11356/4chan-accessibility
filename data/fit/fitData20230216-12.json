I dont know why but spring makes women horny/looking for love. Dont ask me why just trust me.<br><br>What do YOU mean when you say &quot;not being a pussy&quot;? The only real way is to keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, slowly and step by step. If you are shy or have social anxiety then the best solution is to just expose yourself to those situations. Try as much as you can and dont let it get to you when you fail and try again. Walk up to random females and talk, if someone tries to punk you then just punch them in the face. Dont worry, if he beats you back it dosent hurt until after because of the adrenaline. Getting beat up is no big deal, dont be afraid of this, it is nothing compared to the bad feelings you get when letting someone punk you. Trust me, I know. Start training martial arts, pref muay thai. After a couple of sparring sesh you will be humbled and more confident.<br><br><a href=\"#p69971326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69971326</a><br>Practice and exposure to those situations. Small steps first. Fake it until you make it. It will be hard, the easy way is to stay in the confort zone, it&#039;s only hard because you are getting out of it. Start training muay thai and your confidence will increase. After a couple of months and some sparring sesh you will see your own power and know that most normies dont even know basic selfdefence. Tap into your primal human, it&#039;s all there. The bloodthirst, the aggression, the caveman inside you, just tap into him and bring him out. Getting your ass kicked is way better than the bad feelings of letting someone punk you and make you a bitch. Getting beat up is not even that bad, adrenaline rush is nice feeling and supress pain. You make it worse in your head/imagination than it is in reality.<br><br>Sorry to both of you for ESL, I had a couple of beers.<br><br><a href=\"#p69971254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69971254</a><br>Thanks king", "time": 1676498806, "resto": 69970794}, {"no": 69971454, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:09:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Someone redpill me on epobis.", "time": 1676498952, "resto": 69970794}, {"no": 69971469, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:10:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69971326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69971326</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not being scared of confrontation?</span><br>you just realize that a part of your soul dies everytime you pussy out and let others walk over you.

I was talking to a friend when I noticed his face look to the floor on terror behind me then heard a yelp and saw a pitbull with its teeth wrapped around my dogs front right leg. I instantly grabbed the pitbull&#039;s collar and just started pounding hammer blows on the top of its skull. It didn&#039;t seem to be affected at all, I probably hit the dog about 100 times. Eventually the pitbull let go and then had a seizure and died. Had to explain to the police what happened as the wetback owner was threatening to kill me. My dogs leg had to be amputated and now he&#039;s too scared to go outside. Had to move house as well because a bunch of Mexicans would come outside window at night and shout threats at me. Didn&#039;t want to do anything in case they were in a gang. Fuck pitbull&#039;s and their degenerate owners.

Instead of going into software like I wanted I decided to go into commercial banking and get a front office role were I&#039;d be talking to/getting clients so I could get paid to improve my social skills , I started out at 56k a year and jumped to 125k in 4 years then 185k in another 2 years(USD), I lived with my parents so almost all of my money went into the stock market, mostly index funds. Eventually, I put 40k down on a house and rented it out and over the course of the next 2 years the value increased by well over 50% and the renters were basically paying off my loan. From year 2 of college till now I try to keep myself as productive as possible to keep myself from going back to jerking off to porn 3+ hours a day and drinking myself to sleep each night.", "time": 1676548143, "resto": 69974553}, {"no": 69977752, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:00:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69974553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69974553</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Did lifting get you girls?</span><br>I get girls and I don&#039;t lift anything heavier than a pair of dumbbells for lat raises.", "time": 1676548800, "resto": 69974553}, {"no": 69977796, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:06:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69975263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69975263</a><br>fuck man i tried timder and bumble but it seems like women just want to be validated i tried grindr and have a new twink/femboy a week riding my cock", "time": 1676549172, "resto": 69974553}, {"no": 69977804, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:07:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69977691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69977691</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cont </span><br>Putting effort into my life(lifting, dressing well, being well educated)gave me the confidence I needed to talk to women, take risks, and go after things I thought I could never obtain otherwise. High value people only value other high value people so if you want a high valued girl but you consider yourself a low statue beta then she&#039;ll also see you as a low statue beta, this tends to be true with job interviews as well. I&#039;ve noticed that every situation has a certain power dynamic too it and you also want to shift that power dynamic in your favor. Money is objective, you either make it, inherent it, or you don&#039;t have it but status is more about perspective, men who simp over women usually have low self esteem and because of that lack of confidence they gave the women power over them and often times they try desperately to get her attention when all they&#039;re doing is padding her bank account while she could give a fuck less about them. When I become more confident and held myself in a high regard I had a much easier time approaching women because I wasn&#039;t afraid of them rejecting me and I noticed a lot more women became attracted to me as a result of my confidence. <br><br>I guess the TL;DR take away is to work on yourself, your fitness, career, hobbies and social skills, video tape yourself in social situations or make mock social situations with your friends and video tape it so you know what social skills you need to improve. lastly, confidence is key to most things in life and part of that is not being afraid to fail, get rejected or get set back a bit because you know you&#039;ll be fine.", "time": 1676549236, "resto": 69974553}, {"no": 69977830, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:11:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69974553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69974553</a><br>No but wearing baggy underwear so people could faintly see my shlong swing back and forth as I walk did.

Simply put, the body still produces the same amount of sperm, but since your vas deferens are cut and (in my situation) one of them were soldered shut your body just reabsorbs the sperm cells anyway.<br>Goodluck anon!
