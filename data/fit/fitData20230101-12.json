If the other gym is cheaper, or has better equipment, that matters more to me<br>- the dresscode is not too restrictive. If people have to wear clothes that make exercise uncomfortable, that&#039;s too far. But some limits to the attention seeking outfits would be appreciated. This applies to both genders btw, I don&#039;t want to see your cameltoe, nor do I want to see some guys bulge.<br>Rationale is partially that it&#039;s mildly annoying/distracting, but mostly that the kind of people such a gym would keep away/attract would result in a better clientele. Less attention seeking whores, less self absorbed fuckboys, less people on their phones browsing between sets, more people who are there to lift shit and leave. <br><br>Actually I think I would prefer a gym where you aren&#039;t allowed to use your phone for anything but progress tracking/playing music.

It feels like a chore at first until you gain enough skill to start deriving reward from it. Socializing is the same. I had social anxiety and low level social skills that I had to learn from scratch, so I set little mini goals for myself each day that would gradually get more difficult, like starting a conversation with someone from class, or holding eye contact, stuff like that.

A few takeaways I learned were that (according to the research):<br><br>1. Runners should lift weights twice a week, specifically on their hard days. So if Tuesday is track work and Friday is tempo, you lift those days.<br><br>2. Weight lifting should be done at least 3 hours after finishing the run. So run in the morning and lift in late afternoon or early evening would be the norm.<br><br>3. Warn up and cool down for 5-10 minutes of easy cardio, preferably non-impact.<br><br>4. Use 3 sets of 5-10 reps per exercise with about 60 seconds rest. Goal is to lift heavy.<br><br>5. Runners who consistently lift twice a week reduce injuries by one third. So, for example 3 injuries over a certain time period without lifting weights would have only been 2 injuries with weight lifting.<br><br>6. Lifting can improve running economy by up to 8%, but most will likely be in the middle (3-5%).<br><br>7. Try to prioritize compound exercises.<br><br>8. Upper body lifts prioritize chest, back, and shoulders for better running posture.<br><br>9. Routine should start with 1 squat, 1 hip hinge, 1 lunge, 1 push for chest, 1 pull for back, and 1 shoulder exercise. Over time, it&#039;s okay to expand the routine and do more than that, but it should at least be comprised of that.<br><br>10. During the taper, you taper weight training as well.

This imbalance may increase the progression of underlying foot deformities such as bunions and hammertoes and lead to painful conditions associated with excessive pronation such as arch/ heel pain, shin splints/ posterior tibial tendonitis, and Achilles tendonitis.

Never posted here before. Did my final weigh in for the year. Went from 82.7kg (31 Dec 2021) to 75.2kg. Missed my goal weight by 3.2kg. My height is 173cm, for reference. Some of it due to travel where I slipped back into my habit of just living off potato chips. But at the same time, I went from not being able to do a single pushup to doing 50-100 pushups as a part of my warmup. I started lifting in June and crossed bodyweight DL for reps last month. I&#039;m going to increase my lifts throughout the next year. <br>Now as I have increased my lifts I have noticed is that lifting makes it impossible for me to hit the 250kcal. I get ridiculously hungry, and if I power through, I haven&#039;t recovered by the next workout. I am making sure to get 100g of protein on each day I lift, so I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the factor. One possibility is that I might be underestimating how much I burn during my workout, I have my TDEE pegged at 2600kcal on cardio days, 2400kcal on lifting focused days, and 2050kcal on off days. I try and eat a 250kcal deficit everyday. Except that I lost 0.8kg this month on my current diet and program, instead of 1.1kg I should have based on a 250kcal deficit. I do 3 days of lifting in a week and 2 days of cardio. 2 rest days. So I don&#039;t think my program is too intense. So where am I going wrong? How do I ensure that I am recovered for my next workout while still eating a deficit?", "time": 1672490190, "resto": 69413018}, {"no": 69425148, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)07:37:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69425124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69425124</a><br>so stop doing that", "filename": "peps lift", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 389, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1672490225039683, "time": 1672490225, "md5": "g7WSTHggscZ20Fy9uY+/gw==", "fsize": 73013, "resto": 69413018}, {"no": 69425154, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)07:38:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69425008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69425008</a><br>In regards to beans you don&#039;t need a pressure cooker per say, but then you also don&#039;t need to soak them overnight if you have one.
