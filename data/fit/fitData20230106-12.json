This reply has some extra details in it is all</span><br>Good job so far on the weight loss dude! Squat and bench is a good baseline to start with. Put the squat first because it&#039;ll take more concentration and energy compared to the bench. I&#039;d also recommend putting in some rear delt raises/reverse pec dec after you bench. It&#039;s healthy for the shoulders. Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps for each lift. Just that little bit is okay for the first few weeks while you get used to lifting again.<br><br>If you like having a Chest/Leg day like you&#039;re doing now, then the other muscles to consider are the arms, shoulders, and back. Arnold Schwarzenegger had a split like that at one point. For the second day start with an overhead press, chinups/lat pulldown, and some rows. After that do a short circuit of lateral raises, curls, and a tricep exercise that&#039;s easy on the elbows like rope pushdowns. Same as the first day, do 3x8-12 (except for the chinups if you choose it over lat pull downs; those do to failure). Also for the lateral raises you always want to push those well past failure and get to the point where you can only squeeze out little partials. The shoulders are a muscle group that needs a lot of stimulation to grow and most compounds don&#039;t do much for the side delt. Do this day right after the first day.<br><br>After 2 weeks or so of this you can start adding more exercises to fill out the routine more. The soreness is going to come back for new muscles for you but most of your body will be good. The second day has most of what it needs already, you just have to add an extra arm exercise for both the bicep and the tricep and increase the volume of work you do for the back. It can really take a beating. The first day though you&#039;ll add Romanian deadlifts, an incline bench press, and a crazy amount of calf raises. If you want some more butt gains then also add Bulgarian split squats.", "time": 1672981897, "resto": 69489156}, {"no": 69495451, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:18:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "sorry about my noob question and ms paint doodle but does anyone know what these lines/indents on the sides of my tummy are (pink)? will they go away if i lose weight? thank you", "filename": "Untitled", "ext": ".png", "w": 258, "h": 240, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1672982283931613, "time": 1672982283, "md5": "owdPL2Mdz/sONHq1AwX/Sg==", "fsize": 4831, "resto": 69489156}, {"no": 69495485, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:22:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69493004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69493004</a><br><a href=\"#p69495416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69495416</a><br>First 2ish weeks<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schedule (fit it how you need to for your week)</span><br>Day 1<br>Day 2<br>Rest<br>Day 1<br>Day 2<br>Rest<br>Rest<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Day 1</span><br>Back Squat 3x8-12<br>Barbell Bench Press 3x8-12<br>Rear Delt Flies OR Reverse Pec Dec 3x8-12<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Day 2</span><br>Overhead Press 3x8-12<br>Chinups OR Lat Pull Down 3x8-12 (or 3xFailure if using chinups)<br>Dumbbell Rows OR Seated Cable Row (any variation of row is okay if you&#039;re limited by equipment) 3x8-12<br>GIANTSET x 3 Sets<br>Dumbbell Lateral Raises 8-12 clean reps and then 5-6 partials<br>Dumbbell Curl 8-12<br>Rope Pushdown 8-12", "time": 1672982536, "resto": 69489156}, {"no": 69495492, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:23:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69495416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69495416</a><br>You&#039;re a fucking God send bro, I mean it.

Here are a few tips that may help:<br><br>Set new goals: Consider setting new goals for yourself, such as increasing the amount of weight you can lift or improving your form. This can give you something to work towards and help you stay motivated.<br><br>Vary your routine: Doing the same exercises and routines can become monotonous over time. Try switching up your workouts by incorporating new exercises or trying different training techniques. This can help keep things interesting and help you stay motivated.<br><br>Track your progress: Keep track of your progress by writing down your lifts and workouts. Seeing the progress you&#039;ve made can be a great source of motivation.<br><br>Find a lifting partner: Working out with a friend or training partner can be a great way to stay motivated. You can motivate each other to push harder and reach your goals.<br><br>Remember why you started lifting: Take some time to remind yourself of your original motivation for lifting.

Lunch should be a small snack such as 1-3 servings of almonds or some fruit for the carbs or just a single chicken tiddy, again be liberal with salt.

People try and falsely say because we live longer now it would mean that it makes sense to delay motherhood but that isn\u2019t how biology selects traits, especially since our life cycle now is unnaturally extended by our use of tools. Could our bodies evolve to prefer later motherhood? Not for another thousand years save another technological intervention(freezing eggs for later use is not that saving grace tool), but should the technology disappear that could also lead to disaster. At any rate, we have not had any biological shift to move marriage and age of consent away from the age of 14 as was the case as late as the 1980\u2019s. The model that is being pushed now, trying to put age of consent to 25 is entirely propaganda tied to fears of over population by countries that never had the problem to begin with. The only ones heralding this outside of those fears are jealous people who were left behind either by choice or by leadership or groomers who need more time to exploit loneliness to bolster their own numbers.

I never should have been put on antidepressants, I obviously had ADHD, but a GP can prescribe sertraline but not dexedrine so they gave me the pill that they had.<br><br>How helpful you find therapy depends hugely on the quality of the therapist so you have to find one that really works for you. Don&#039;t be afraid to shop around and see other people. In my experience I knew I&#039;d found a good therapist when he started anticipating the things I was going to tell him. Like I was telling him about being an underachiever and muh feelings and he said &quot;yeah, and none of this would matter if you were stupid, right? Because you would never have such high expectations for yourself&quot; sort of thing and I was like &quot;yeah, fuck. He gets it,&quot; because I often sort of wish (not really) that I could just be dumb and not have to worry about this shit.<br><br>The utility of therapy, for me, was twofold: as a sounding board for my own self-reflection, and then to provide structured behavioural interventions. A therapist can&#039;t tell you what&#039;s wrong with you because they can&#039;t read your mind, but they can help you figure it out for yourself by guiding your self-reflection. And then they often have, at least in my experience, really good ideas for simple changes you can make to do things better. The smarter and the more insight you have into yourself the less you&#039;ll get out of it, but even just being held accountable to someone has utility, in the same way that some people have personal trainers not because they need training but just because they need someone to call them out if they&#039;re cheating on their diet, or the threat of having to explain to someone why they failed.", "time": 1672922515, "resto": 69482540}, {"no": 69485143, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)07:42:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69485092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69485092</a><br>sometimes you cant deal with the feelings in a normal way until youre a bit &quot;&quot;doped up&quot;&quot;<br>eg gym helps but it takes antidepressants to get you out of bed to get to the gym, then gym helps u get better and you stop taking them after some time", "time": 1672922552, "resto": 69482540}, {"no": 69485148, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)07:42:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Lastly,<br>https://www.nhsinform.scot/tests-an<wbr>d-treatments/medicines-and-medical-<wbr>aids/types-of-medicine/antidepressa<wbr>nts<br><br>Here&#039;s a great quick summary that you can actually trust instead of &quot;hurr doctors bad&quot; nonsense from 4chins.", "time": 1672922576, "resto": 69482540}, {"no": 69485181, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)07:46:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69485148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69485148</a><br>Sorry, wrong link.<br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/<wbr>NBK361016/", "filename": "1666921692492", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 601, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672922783566444, "time": 1672922783, "md5": "VobYWuqnKaKWzMSjF0BNPg==", "fsize": 131237, "resto": 69482540}, {"no": 69485189, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)07:47:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69485181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69485181</a>", "filename": "1655823385015", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 609, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672922848558920, "time": 1672922848, "md5": "6otnybU+6SO96Wprkuh+ew==", "fsize": 147561, "resto": 69482540}, {"no": 69485202, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)07:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69482540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69482540</a><br>anti-depressants fuck your brain up, make you suicidal and make you turn on those that love you.", "time": 1672922941, "resto": 69482540}, {"no": 69485225, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)07:51:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You need to quit everything that brings you artificial dopamine hits.

It thus far has not caused me to gain weight, has not caused sexual dysfunction, has not caused sleeping problems, etc. It makes my depression less noticeable, I still have thoughts of suicide, but instead of that thought becoming the only thing I can think about and leading me towards a breakdown, it&#039;s just an intrusive thought that I can push aside. I don&#039;t cry, I don&#039;t get into negative thought feedback loops that lock me in place, etc. I&#039;m also pretty robotic, I did not express my emotions well prior to taking bupropion but now I have actually had people comment that I act like a robot. I believe bupropion/wellbutrin is also used to treat some addictions, and while I was not addicted to alcohol it completely eliminated my desire to drink alcohol. I drank a few beers a week, but since taking the meds I haven&#039;t touched any alcohol at all in over 2 years. <br>Overall the medication has definitely improved my life, it is very likely that I would have killed myself if I hadn&#039;t started taking it, but again please anon don&#039;t get yourself on medications until you have exhausted ALL OTHER COPING MECHANISMS. These medications are not to be fucked with, more extreme ones have serious side effects and you basically can&#039;t get off of them once you start taking them. I tried to stop taking mine for about 2 months and all of my old problems came back, but even worse.

Functional analyses show that this variant reduces MC1R activity to a level that alters hair and/or skin pigmentation in humans. The impaired activity of this variant suggests that Neanderthals varied in pigmentation levels, potentially on the scale observed in modern humans.

Nothing gets me diamonds like her saying &quot;get me fucking pregnant&quot; or &quot;breed me&quot; or &quot;I want it I want your cum I want you to cum inside me&quot; and then they do that thing where they wrap their legs around you and lock you in.

There is no right or wrong in this world, the fitness &quot;influencers&quot; all make their money by convincing you that they&#039;re right and the other &quot;influencers&quot; are wrong.<br>One influencer will say calories are all that&#039;s needed for weight loss, another will say that is wrong because it encourages people to eat poorly and lose weight while still maintaining unhealthy habits. Both of these people will then respond to each other by manipulating the words of their opponents.<br>The calorie guy will tell you that the healthy eating guy is denying the laws of physics and saying that you will gain weight on 300 calories a day because it&#039;s &#039;bad food&#039;. The healthy eating guy will tell you that the calorie guy is trying to assert that eating cupcakes for every meal is healthy because you&#039;re not exceeding your calories.<br>The reality though is that they&#039;re both right in their own way, and in fact what both of them are saying don&#039;t actually conflict each other at all.. Both of the influencers know this, the only reason they&#039;re telling you that the other one is wrong is become they want you to side with them enough that you buy their shirts and eBooks.<br>The photo you posted is a perfect example. The thumbnail for that video tries to tell you that &quot;calories are a lie&quot;, as in, they don&#039;t exist? They&#039;re not relevant to weight management? What could this &quot;shocking new truth&quot; be? Well I watched the video for about 3 minutes, the guy literally admits that eating less calories will make you lose weight, but it&#039;s external factors that make it hard to lose weight using this method alone.
