Two cards per season. Starting March 20th the fool and the king of coins will have domain over my life. Very exciting. The fool I believe will be a sort of metamorphosis for me. I think I&#039;m gonna be different by the summer solstice. The king of pentacles will be my guide to the material. I should be making more mature financial decisions anyway. In terms of fitness I think this is gonna be a technique and maintenance phase. I might end up doing some bodybuilder routine, lots of volume but low stress per excercise. I should learn my cardio as well. <br>Until then, I will be cutting. My winter cards (starting Dec 21 2022) are the empress and the page of cups. So I&#039;ve certainly been exploring my relationships and seeking out a deeper connection to my vulnerabile side. But I do thing with the page, encouraging me to be curious about new relationships, and the empress encouraging me to be vulnerable, I may fall victim to heartbreak. So to protect myself I am going to adopt some of the more healthy coping mechanisms I had when I was younger and more socially successful. Anyway, why I am cutting: Currently 215 and wanna be 195 by valentine&#039;s, at least 200. If I don&#039;t have an interest by then I may fall victim and start participating in social media again (Instagram twitter tinder and so) not certain yet, depends how lonely I get. Currently supping vit d cause seasonal affective disorder lmao, also zinc, magnesium, caffeine, creatine and protein for various reasons most of them lifting. <br>Currently my lifts are 1/2/3/4 give or take ten pounds with working sets of 5 at 90% of that. Doing shieko style but I&#039;m gonna do 5/3/1 BBB cause it&#039;s actually pretty exciting to me. If you want me to pull a card for you let me know and I might make a thread.

Lantus seems a bit involved.</span><br>Yeah that works too, you definitely don&#039;t need to run lantus and can run a short acting insulin alone, the opposite is also true. I would say lantus is definitely less involved though, with short acting (again depending on how you structure it) you&#039;re injecting with every meal, or at least high carb meals, so 3-6 times a day usually, and need to make sure your blood glucose is properly managed every time. Lantus is a set and forget once in the morning type thing, then repeat. Note that I do concede that impact of lantus vs. short acting (when each is isolated) definitely wont be as pronounced in effect, short still wins there. Combining both for an advanced protocol is obviously better than either individually <br><br>regardless the optimal way to work it in at any point, or at least what I do, is <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;work up to max GH dosage without insulin, once at peak monitor blood glucose fasted every morning for ~4-6 weeks, ideally work up to your max metformin dosage during this period too</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when you have an idea of where you are every morning add lantus at a dose of [body weight in kg * 0.1], which is a conservative 50% of the dose recommended for starting diabetics</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;adjust upward as needed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;for short acting start with 2iu before every meal, work up as needed (again, conservative starting point) and monitor blood glucose 1, 2, and 4 hours after (3 hours if your next meal would fall at 4 hours) then adjust as needed</span><br>eventually you won&#039;t need to monitor every meal since you&#039;ll have it dialed in, but the carb load required per IU varies drastically per person (even more than most people tend to think desu). 10g of carb per IU is the common recommendation but some people need as little as 4g, others need as high as 20g. its really not the boogieman compound people make it out to be, it&#039;s just very involved", "time": 1672670438, "resto": 69435256}, {"no": 69449045, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)10:35:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bumperino", "filename": "1671937932424268", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672673709776865, "time": 1672673709, "md5": "XK+liNYMKVb2mRWU5nRlhA==", "fsize": 16039, "resto": 69435256}, {"no": 69449471, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)11:16:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are the down sides of doing TRT at 40 if I keep my bloodwork in check.

But at the same time, this isn&#039;t a legalisation issue like weed is. Steroids actually are quite bad for you. It&#039;s all well and good to say that people should have a choice but we already know from the tobacco industry how this ends - in a lot of preventable deaths, with no discernible gain.<br><br>The correct path is probably something like the UK, where steroids are legal to possess for personal use but supply and trafficking are still very illegal. There&#039;s usually what&#039;s called a &quot;deemed commercial possession&quot; amount written into laws like this that says possession of anything over X amount (in my country, 50 grams whole weight) is evidence of intent to supply, or whatever.<br><br>Punishing steroid users is generally ineffective, pointless, and unjust - I&#039;m only hurting myself - but that doesn&#039;t then mean that selling steroids should be allowed. That&#039;s the nuance that is missing in discussions like this.<br><br>And steroids definitely do cause violence, and especially domestic violence. The usual way they study it is by interviewing the girlfriends and partners of steroid users, who pretty consistently report that their partner&#039;s behaviour changes when he&#039;s on cycle in all the ways you would expect. It&#039;s not a universal feature of steroids, obviously, but it&#039;s real and significant and does cause extreme outcomes sometimes. So the question becomes - &quot;here is a drug that has no useful purpose and causes poor health and violence, even if in small amounts. Why should we put up with it when it offers nothing to society?&quot;<br><br>Steroid users, of which I am one, see the benefit of using steroids. But for most people, and certainly for the government, being able to build a mass monster physique is a &#039;benefit&#039; that they literally do not give a single shit about, so it doesn&#039;t count. And so the only argument for steroid legalisation is freedom of choice, and that&#039;s a poor argument.", "time": 1672709871, "resto": 69452334}, {"no": 69455654, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)20:53:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69455384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69455384</a><br>If I go my entire fucking life without hearing the muh genetics cope it will still be too little too late.<br><br>Testosterone levels do correlate with LBM, but not in the way you think - body composition drives testosterone levels and not the other way around. Androgen receptor content, not testosterone levels, is what drives body composition. Granted, the androgen receptors need to have androgens to receive, but lack of androgens is not the rate-limiting factor. The number of androgen receptors you have is controlled by the number of CAG repeats on the AR gene - the reference range is 10 to 30, lower is better. And the difference in lean body mass from average to either extreme is 3%.<br><br>This effect is utterly crushed by the impact of actually hitting the gym - so &quot;shit genetics&quot; doesn&#039;t count as an excuse for not doing so. But let&#039;s compare who you are to who you could have been if you didn&#039;t have shit genetics. Let&#039;s say you weigh 90kgs. With shit genetics you&#039;d have weighed 87.3, and with ideal genetics - 92.7kgs. It barely makes a fucking difference. It definitely doesn&#039;t make a 15kg difference, like you&#039;re trying to imply based off of OP. 5kgs of muscle isn&#039;t nothing, but it&#039;s not very much. And that&#039;s assuming you have the worst, most dogshit genetics possible and comparing yourself to the best. In real life it&#039;s more like 2-3kgs, because your genetics are probably just average.<br><br>What matters a fuckload more than muh genetics is things like how much money you have, and how close your gym is to your house, and whether you work shift work, and whether your parents taught you good food lessons, and whether you have mental illnesses, and whether you like to play sport and have friends who do too.

Replacing your old way with hyper restricting diets is just replacing your old dysfunctional lifestyle with another dysfunctional one. You are trying to skate around the core of the problem which is poor eating habits usually revolving around portion control, and over indulgence of snack foods and fast food. This is why calorie counting, along with a balanced diet and exercise work so well because you are adopting it a lifestyle that is sustainable since you don\u2019t have to maintain constant restrictions on your life to such an extreme degree. You can still have occasional treats like ice-cream or a burger and beer at a bbq, and you don\u2019t have to always be maintaining a super strict diet that will eventually lead to a break in your willpower.

Here in the states you can just lie about it as long as it was through a private healthcare company / psychiatrist because there&#039;s no way the military can get those records if they don&#039;t know where to look. If you want to join, figure out how easy your records and medication history are to access and move forward from there. Also if you have cuts than put concealer on them and/or lie and say it was a cat or something. Based on what you said a SOF (special forces) gig is what you want but I would imagine that it&#039;s quite difficult to get into. In the states you can get a contract for the job right away, but lots of people fail out because they can&#039;t make it in some capacity physically or mentally. If you&#039;re in good enough shape (you can just watch youtube videos on German special forces) than I would try to go for it if you really want. Also make sure you&#039;re still young enough to join. If you cant get SOF then intel would work but you would need to keep yourself in shape. I haven&#039;t worked with the Germans (yet) so I&#039;m not sure the divide between the Heer &amp; Luftwaffe, but over here the air force is a much better gig for any job because they have a bigger budget and less people. Ultimately a job in either the Heer or Luftwaffe (as long is it&#039;s not logistics / medical administration / military police) would get you out of your comfort zone and help build discipline. You will suffer, but communal suffering is often what brings people together the most. By this I mean, those that you suffer with will become your good friends. If you really want to join than start taking the steps you need to, but always have backup plans if something doesn&#039;t work out. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Btw what&#039;s the gay shit Ur referring to?</span><br>Promotion of sodomy, transgenderism, egalitarianism, race mixing, diversity, cultural marxism, etc...", "filename": "mittens", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 877, "h": 856, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1672678174393632, "time": 1672678174, "md5": "OjmG8WnlUB/vbZK/j90SlA==", "fsize": 51059, "resto": 69437217}, {"no": 69449825, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)11:55:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69439702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69439702</a><br>Based", "time": 1672678501, "resto": 69437217}, {"no": 69449833, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)11:55:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The only reason I struggle at 31 is due to army injuries.

Talk to a dermatologist to get tretinoin but honestly there are sites where you can order it from overseas for cheaper.
