If a woman is fit and beautiful, shouldnt she feel confident and fulfilled in the knowledge of that?<br>Yeah, hypothetically. But a lot of how we percieve our position in the heirarchy is based on the reactions that we percieve in other people. Its all competitive right. Like what you&#039;d percieve at a conscious and unconscious level is that men pay slightly more attention to women in yoga pants- and even if it makes a very miniscule boost, you&#039;d adopt that to max out your own stats. Its more than a small boost also. The problem is that it continues to perpetuate ad infinitum until all women in the gym are wearing yoga pants, so only the emotional downsides are conferred; the woman becomes resentful in the realization that due to her will alone she has acted shamefully and debased herself in the pursuit of a shallow pleasure which she never recieved an appreciable portion of.

The vocals overpower the mix so much that the rest of the music is reduced to percussive accents around the frontman. Mostly just low effort samples and beats anyway. On the other hand, the vocals being so prominent, rarely ever vary in tone, timbre, or intensity, so the listen was incredibly monotonous and boring. Seems like once the tempo and time is established in a song, it doesn&#039;t ever change as is typical of most hip-hop and related genres. It is unique though. Can&#039;t say that it completely lacks soul. A couple tracks ALMOST hooked me (the first verse in track 11).

You already burn 0 muscle in the first 10 days of a fast. Your growth hormone is cranked through the fucking roof while fasting. This helps to preserve muscle. In addition, your internal organs are used in order to get the necessary protein to feed your muscles, your sex organs, and your brain. After you stop fasting, your organs regenerate and return to normal size. 40% of weight lost during a 10 day fast is pure fat. The other 60% is plasma, water, and broken down organ. You can even build muscle and get stronger during a fast.

Elite sprint swimmers need to have wide clavicles great abs and low body fat, all of which are conducive to aesthetics. Maybe their training helps, but those inherent traits helped them rise to the top much more so than the training made them that way. Football players need huge amounts of muscle mass and power. Sprinters need to have a high percentage of fast twitch fibers as well as be doped out of their mind. Weightlifters need a low bodyfat percentage due to weight class restraints except for heavyweights, who, incidentally, are absolute fatasses. And they\u2019re all on steroids. No idea how these retarded memes became so common. I love swimming btw and think it\u2019s amazing for the core but the vast majority of guys at the pool are skinny fat or fat fat, regardless of whatever elite swimmers might look like. Fell for the retarded meme myself, honestly. Eventually I did get a physique that actually surpasses a lot of elite swimmers though the guy in that pic bodyfat and bicep mogs me. Want to know how I did it? The REAL secret of elite athletes: steroids.

Think of it as a FUPA that has transcended even further beyond.

The black lines in pic related follow what would be the usual pathing of scars as the extra skin which couldn&#039;t be removed is double layered upon itself before being stitched into place. While not a perfect solution, it does remove the protruding pouch and opens up additional benefits such as removal of waste without the involvement of heavy readjusting of prior skin obstacles.
