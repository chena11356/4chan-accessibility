So we&#039;re able to keep increasing volume because we can do more reps but we can&#039;t really increase intensity without just increasing time under tension. If you&#039;re a kind of person who can respond to just pure volume and don&#039;t require much intensity to grow yeah these could be good for you.

That is something that explains every organism we know on this planet, from viruses, bacteria, mammals and us.<br><br>Now let&#039;s ignore all microbial life and focus purely on animals, because it&#039;s easier. We eat two things, (cellular) machinery and chemical energy. This maps to protein and vitamins and minerals (machinery) and sugars, carbs and fats (energy). Except animals can actually convert these between each other to a greater or lesser degree - remember this.<br><br>Now, life surrounds us animals. But the only source of external energy (for animals) is sunlight. Everything must come from the sun. Luckily plants surround us, and are concentrated sources of solar energy, they usually turn sunlight into sugars, and then into long starches and fibres. Humans can&#039;t digest most plant fibres (like cellulose). Either way, this means most animals eat plants. But other animals are concentrated sources of everything animals need to live. So some animals specialise in only eating other animals, they&#039;re literally bags of collected energy and machinery so there&#039;s this niche where a being could just eat other animals.<br><br>Now let&#039;s focus exclusively on humans. We do not have the ability to digest cellulose - gorillas have this, cows and sheep and goats have this - but we do not. So this means we have to eat fruits and vegetables and seeds only. We basically cannot eat leaves (though some exceptions apply). And we can function just fine doing this! Don&#039;t believe the propaganda, being vegan can be healthy. It&#039;s just really hard and most don&#039;t succeed. <br><br>This brings me to eating other animals. Its easy to get lots of essential nutrients from animals.

Start out light with the squats and deadlifts if you&#039;re getting fucked up by them, perhaps even with an empty bar. For your core, just a few minutes of planks per day will make you strong and will get rid of all your back problems. Both myself and all of my dyel friends that I&#039;ve coached had back problems and planking fixed it. Refer to the stronglifts 5x5 website (first thing that comes up when you search &quot;stronglifts 5x5&quot;) for all the details you could want regarding the program.<br><br>I cannot more highly recommend pull ups for really any lifter. It will resolve your scapula issues, prevent injuries in the future, and make you way stronger on all lifts, especially bench press. 3 pull ups at 230 lbs bodyweight is pretty good, especially for a beginner. Do controlled negatives or use bands to get more reps, or if you can, try weighted pull ups.<br><br>Do not concern yourself with intentionally losing weight for a while\u2014being in a calorie deficit, especially as a beginner when your connective tissue is still weak, makes the probability of injury WAY higher than it otherwise would be.

As an anecdote, I was able to deadlift 3.5 plates as a little 140 lb high schooler while all my other lifts sucked, but I was constantly fucking myself up because I was still a newish lifter and my connective tissue was not strong yet; it takes around 3-4 years to get tendon maturity.

My wife had been running a state licensed home daycare at our old house (she worked in childcare since she was 15 and loves babies) but she shut it down after we had 2 kids, the ratio of kids to adults in the household meant we ended up only being able to take on 2 clients in addition to our two children, and when she was pregnant with #3 it would have come down to trying to run a home daycare with one client...eh anyway...her salary was no longer necessary. We also timed our sale of our first house pretty well, it was the peak of the market (but we moved farther out to a cheaper area because I&#039;m not commuting) and low for interest rates.<br><br>I hope you can afford it soon anon if that&#039;s what you&#039;re after.

Small children are cheaper than you think. If your wife breastfeeds and if you are willing to do reusable diapers chances are good you&#039;ll get most of what you need in terms of baby equipment from a baby shower. The rest you can buy at local consignment sales for a fraction of their sale price. Yeah, easy for me to say considering I managed to have an easier time of it but I mean what else is your alternative? I suppose you could hope to find a higher paying job in your field. The one bit of advice I can give from experience is that if you&#039;re looking to advance quicker don&#039;t stay at one place for too long. Get in, get some resume builders under your belt, and get out. I&#039;ve heard people say 2 years is the longest to stay at a company, after that the performance based pay increases flatten out below what you could attain in an increase by getting a promotion via transfer to a different company. Depending on your field all it might take is some certifications and a good interview. I dunno, I hope it works out for you anon, it really saddens me the amount of people I know who are having their heads kept just below water by the myriad political and economic conditions that have done nothing but deteriorate at the expense of the younger generations for the better part of 40 years.", "time": 1674025511, "resto": 69633623}, {"no": 69637944, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)02:06:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69637940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69637940</a><br>by design*", "time": 1674025572, "resto": 69633623}, {"no": 69637996, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)02:14:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69637940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69637940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve heard people say 2 years is the longest to stay at a company</span><br>So true.

On average I shoot about 5ml loads by myself and closer to the 7ml-10ml range when I&#039;m with my woman.

If I were to do one set of chest, even if it was to failure, I would full recover within hours, and because the stimulus was not very great, I wouldn&#039;t get much adaptation either.

I&#039;ve seen some people hit technical failure at rep 15, but continuing with lengthened partials for another 10+ reps. And more than this, 1 set to failure on a short-range movement will not provide the same stimulus and fatigue as a set to failure on a long-range movement because of stretch-mediated hypertrophy.

Contrary to what certain books suggest, serratus anterior does not play an active role in this motion. In fact, Serratus Anterior is involved in the opposite movement, such as in front raise. During pullover, serratus anterior could be activated if the shoulders are raised from the bench, somewhat like at the end of a pushup. The Serratus Anterior is also known as the boxer&#039;s muscle because of the movement during the end of a punch.

Also, it&#039;s kind of fucking retarded to be watching my waistline at 18% when I could just cut to 10-12% and literally make the same progress while not looking like a fatty. <br><br>Life is hard when you&#039;re retarded.", "filename": "1671666978366740", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 462, "h": 430, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1673986392637811, "time": 1673986392, "md5": "7Ap2mB6qz8sW06XYKPI3YQ==", "fsize": 22142, "resto": 69611894, "trip": "!MENT/e/KZk"}, {"no": 69632345, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:15:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69632308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69632308</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;200 lbs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18%</span><br>Are you like 5&#039;6&quot; or are you just incredibly dyel", "time": 1673986541, "resto": 69611894}, {"no": 69632407, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:20:53", "com": "<a href=\"#p69632345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69632345</a><br>I&#039;m 5&#039;9.

Mechanical tension is the primary driver of hypertrophy, so to get any meaningful growth outside of the novice stage you&#039;re going to need to get within a few reps of failure. What MMC is good for is that generally if you have a good MMC you&#039;re probably not destroying your joints (as I find that if a joint is hurting during the movement you also tend to not feel the muscle as much), and it ensures that you&#039;re biasing the correct muscles that you&#039;re trying to target (EG, if on bench you only feel your shoulders and triceps, your shoulders and triceps might be only 1 rep from failure at the end of a set but your pecs could be 6 reps from failure, meaning that your pecs won&#039;t grow because they are not receiving enough stimulus).<br><br>Besides this, MMC is best when approaching failure anyway. For example, I feel my biceps the most when I hit failure on incline curls. If you&#039;re going for MMC with light weights and a lot of reps you&#039;re just feeling the burn from metabolite buildup or whatever while neglecting mechanical tension, when ideally you should have both (On incline curls when I hit failure I feel both an extremely intense burning sensation as well as a visceral sensation of my biceps almost being torn apart from the mechanical tension. This is what a good MMC entails.)

If you squat with a wide stance you could try using a more narrow one to decrease adductor involvement so you can still squat for the time being (though if it still irritates you drop the weight or stop doing it entirely until your adductors are no longer an issue)", "time": 1673987628, "resto": 69631482}, {"no": 69632943, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:08:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673989697, "resto": 69631482}, {"no": 69633301, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:40:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69632202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69632202</a><br>Also the upper traps thing makes me a bit skeptical of this, because if this is true we should be able to get huge traps by shrugging our arms with no weight. 3-5lbs doesn&#039;t even register for the upper traps because of how strong they are, you can move a good amount of weight with them and the upper traps can be stretched with ridiculous amounts of weight (Just look at all the videos of people doing above the knee rackpulls with 400-500kg lmao).", "time": 1673991637, "resto": 69631482}, {"no": 69633336, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:44:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69631482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69631482</a><br>i love u may u have a nice thick fit tomboy gf brother", "time": 1673991849, "resto": 69631482}, {"no": 69633420, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:53:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69633336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69633336</a><br>Thanks bro, you too", "filename": "16247791367213895072394971219560", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1673992391365696, "time": 1673992391, "md5": "obEJtVkPr/ePL8RR/gXLfQ==", "fsize": 62421, "resto": 69631482}, {"no": 69634169, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:01:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673996469, "resto": 69631482}, {"no": 69634405, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:24:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673997853, "resto": 69631482}, {"no": 69635124, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:28:53", "name": "Arthur Whisky", "com": "<a href=\"#p69633301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69633301</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3-5lbs doesn&#039;t even register for the upper traps because of how strong they are</span><br><br>Because you are doing what everyone has done for a long time, and still does it when the subject is brought up. And that&#039;s understandable. The light weight is not to work the muscle groups. The light weight is simply there to keep things in motion and adds a little more targeting. The traps are not being worked by the weight, this much is true, I am isolating them, think of flexing your traps if you can, or any other muscle group. I isolate them, and squeeze. The weight just helps with that slightly, but it is not the weight working them. I then relax them. Repeat 40 times. <br><br>This is primarily how Maxick developed himself, As a sick child, he had no access to weights. Over time he learnt to amazing length, how to isolate almost all muscles in the body. Isolate and squeeze/relax. If you overall flex, you combat one muscle group against the other, this is what you do not want to do. <br><br>For most people this can sound a little what the heck. Did he do that? Or was he lying, and secretly lifting heavy. To that I would say he clearly displayed expert muscle isolation, way above the limits of some large bodybuilder today. So he is not lying about that. But still, does that work? Well it just so happens people did follow these systems, and they too did get muscular. They have fallen into obscurity because of the mindset heavy to grow. And people see a tiny weight and laugh. But it is again, not the weight working the muscle. <br><br>And for the curious, I implore you to try.
