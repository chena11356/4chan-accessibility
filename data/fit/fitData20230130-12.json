was unforeseen by scientists at the time, mostly cause they couldn\u2019t figure shit out. Before reason, the way arguments were determined was by striking your opponent repeatedly about the head with a sharp or blunt object, and seeing if he bleeds or stops breathing. If he does, he is wrong, and may have to drink depending on if you are playing a drinking game. The preceding idea is stolen directly from a catoon tv show and I think it\u2019s downright hilarious.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reason can be observed by taking facts and then saying stuff about them. For instance, we shall take the example of my dog (for instance) whose name is Gus, who is small and shaped like a weiner, which is funny. I sometimes call him &quot;EsophaGus&quot; and &quot;Augustus Caesar,&quot; or even &quot;wigglefloppyponypup&quot; if I have been up to some serious drinking. (for instance!) This is what reason is:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fact 1: Gus is small.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fact 2: He is a small dog.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conclusion: There is no God.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rousseau invented this and because of it I bet he got more ass than a warehouse full of toilet seats, or tampons, or even rapists, which is really saying something because I bet those rapists would be very upset for being pent up in a warehouse all day and would vent their anger through more rape. This is a bad thing unless you dress them up as clowns in which case it is also terrifying.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In conclusion, sometimes when I buy a bottle of poteen and sit around drinking it I usually wind up drawing pictures of turtles on my body with a knife using blood as ink. This makes serious sense to me. You can even use your nipples for the eyes of the turtles, and that way you can always see if someone is sneaking up on you from the front, which is pretty tricky, because you\u2019d naturally be thinking they\u2019d sneak up on you from the back.

I specifically remember the chalk softly floating up to the sunlight that was shining diagonally across my vision. There was something poetic at how it floated, so softly, through the sunlight as my jaw clenched uncontrollably. It was like the peaceful eye before the hurricane hits. I slammed myself under the bar, walked the weight out, and ground through 3 reps with a weight I had already done for 27 reps.

Theres a nice beach, lots of very nice hotels that aren&#039;t expensive, and food is great. As for the whores, theres a street called soi 6. Essentially the whole road is just short-time bars, maybe 4 dozen different ones? Each bar has roughly 10-20 different girls working, I would say 85% of bars are ladies only, but there were some ladyboy ones if you&#039;re into that. Theres also whores walking the streets (not working at the bars), dont talk to them. They aren&#039;t employed by the bars for good reason, usually std related. Drinks are cheap. I would say atleast 75% of the bar girls are fuckable, with about 10% being genuinely hot, even for being monkeys. Lots of variety, theres also some russian bars if you want to bang white chicks. I didn&#039;t personally go to those because I cant bang white chicks in america, wanted to get my yellow fever fix good and handled. Pricing was $35 for an hour, plus like 10 bucks to the bar or something. I think its 1200 baht or whatever the conversion is. Just pick out the lady you like, sit at the bar with her for like 5 minutes and talk as best you can (they speak english pretty well), and then tell her you want BOOM BOOM. they&#039;ll know what you mean. She says &quot;okay wun fousan baht&quot;, give her baht, she pays bar, takes you upstairs. She showers with you, hoses you down and shit and gets her cooter nice and shiny, wraps you and herself in a towel and you&#039;re off. Then you go to a private room and you can plow to your hearts content. Also at the bar the whores like to play connect four. Im not kidding, and theyre really good at it. So get ready for that. I think you can also rent the whores for a day if you want them to come to your hotel, I didnt do that so Idk how it works. Also, get a tinder when you&#039;re there. I plowed a handful of normal thai girls that just liked white guys, no baht required", "time": 1675049307, "resto": 69773740}, {"no": 69776070, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:35:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69773740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69773740</a><br>Skating, snowboarding", "time": 1675049705, "resto": 69773740}, {"no": 69776096, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:38:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69776021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69776021</a><br>thanks for the thorough reply.

Its not dangerous. Theres tons of aussie/brit boomers, so if worst comes to worst and you need to ask someone something theres always a friendly drunk white guy within arms reach<br>2) I honestly wouldn&#039;t even bother trying to go online, the bars are supreme. If you&#039;re shy or awkward or whatever fear not, the girls will grab you by the arm and drag you over to them, cat call you from the street, you name it. Im not exaggerating they will jump onto you and wrap their legs around you in the street and say &quot;YOU COME FUCK ME NOW&quot;. Good luck walking down that street and not getting puss, I dont care how weird you are<br>3) Maybe? I would ask the local boomer expats, they know all the spots. Theres definitely different kinds of asians at the bars, if youre walking down the street and you see a korean lady just go talk to her is what I would say<br>4) not sure, but when it comes to money I doubt they&#039;d say no <br>5) I didn&#039;t do that personally so Im not sure. In my experience they were all very nice as far as hookers go, Im sure if you bust early they&#039;d be cool with a round two. If not dude just go next door and get a different broad 20 mins later, its not like you lost a lot of money. Theres pharmacies that sell viagra over the counter, have a few drinks and take one of those blue monsters and you&#039;ll be in the zone <br>6) hardest part with tinder was communication, but if you find one that speaks english well then its very safe to assume they want to fuck. Especially if you say you&#039;re just visiting and they are down to meet at a hotel, pretty clear intent. Again, worst comes to worst and they want to marry you kick them the fuck out and go to the bars or try the next girl. Its comical how easy it all is, you have hundreds of options at any given moment so if one goes south for whatever reason just shift to the next girl you see", "time": 1675050713, "resto": 69773740}, {"no": 69776286, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)23:03:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69776180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69776180</a><br>thanks brah, so just a few more questions lol.<br>Are STDs a legitimate concern?

As well, the population of the &quot;urbanite&quot; has persisted throughout history as well and respectfully increases/decreases with an area&#039;s urbanization. Rome&#039;s Plebians, the Renaissance Period&#039;s &quot;nobility&quot;, the Age of Enlightenment&#039;s Bourgeois, and the modern day Big Fucking Faggot. <br><br>However, as you mentioned the explosion of power, a massive urban population is a double-edge sword. Due to the large amount of people in an area, outliers begin to emerge quite frequently and the compact nature of cities allow easy access to them. 3rd standard deviation individuals are seen as &quot;common&quot; and individuals that would fit in the 4th or 5th standard deviation percentile would become present along with being accessible.

To break bad habits, whether it\u2019s drugs, PMO, obsessive gaming etc, you have to ruminate on and recognize the deleterious nature they have on your current position, developing a hatred of them strong enough to disgust you from partaking in them further. Freeing yourself of the anchor they place on your current situation, holding you back from achieving what you truly want. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve ever been able to kick something holding me back. Recognition and hatred of it and what I\u2019ve allowed it to do to me. Good luck brother.

On a physical level, it takes ~75 days for a sperm cell to fully mature, which is something that I was totally ignorant about before discovering NoFap, and virtually no normie talks about it. As the guy in <a href=\"#p69754128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69754128</a> put it; <br><br>Women have ovarian cycles which determine their behavior, mood, and even how attractive they are. They get a peak that lasts roughly a week where they&#039;re super feminine, in a great mood, and are mega horny to get fucked. This is their body trying to attract sperm in the healthiest window where the egg has the highest chance of getting fertilized. They also release pheromones from their sweat and skin during this phase. You might recall moments when you&#039;re around a date or a gf where she&#039;s just twirling her hair and being giggly and just giving &quot;the look&quot; of wanting to get drilled. <br><br>Men don&#039;t have any such cycles, we just have a gradual build-up of sperm (that most people shoot into a tissue every night). Our competitiveness starts to soar as we get more and more sexually charged. Most guys start to lift more, eat more testosteronous foods like red meat and eggs, etc... Most guys also note getting the laser eye contact with women when speaking to them. But yeah, the most bizarre factor is the common theme of exes hitting guys back up.

That&#039;s simply how women operate. They don&#039;t break up with someone just so they can be alone (MOST of the time), as this will make them look like a ruthless cold whore. They will stay with someone and then meet someone that they think is superior. Then they will start hanging out with that new guy and they may or may not be fucking him (extremely likely that this is happening). Then they will treat their official boyfriend like shit so that he will WANT to leave her. <br><br>If this goes on long enough then she will find a way to get rid of him (generally) rather than having to break it off herself (to maintain a social image and also to give her boyfriend an opportunity to redeem his honor and status), because they want to feel like a good person, but in order to feel like a good person they can&#039;t just straight up abandon someone. So all of the little tiny things that she can find to belittle her boyfriend that she no longer thinks is manly or good enough for her, she will begin to use as ammunition in order to cut him down. Then she might try to cleverly play social scenarios in order to make him look like an absolute piece of shit, try to case him up, try to make other people fight him, etc.<br><br>They do all of this in an effort to preserve their image and their own false sense of integrity.

I was locked out of my own house and had to climb in to get my stuff when I got out of jail, which I later found out was illegal (even if it was my own house), which could have landed me in prison if anyone saw and reported it. There was a temporary restraining order placed on me immediately so I was effectively banned from my own house and job. We worked at the same place, but on different shifts.
