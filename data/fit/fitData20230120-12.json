You turn it on. It shows &quot;zero&quot;.<br>- You take a bowl or other receptacles and place it on the scale, while it&#039;s empty.<br>- The scale shows the weight of the bowl, bowl weighs let&#039;s say 50 grams.<br>- Then you pressa special button called &quot;TARE&quot;.<br>That button&#039;s job is to reset the scale&#039;s measure back to zero. Meaning if you took the bowl off the scale after that, the scale would show &quot;-50 grams&quot;.<br>So after you use TARE to reset the weight to zero, you can just add the sugar or other ingredient to measure it and the scale has alreadyaccountedfor the bowl&#039;s weight by restting to zero.<br><br>That&#039;s how scales work. Turn on scale, but bowl, on it, use TARE button, andthen add whaever you want ot measure to the bowl.<br><br>I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m explaining the basics of how to use a scale to measure stuff.<br>Maybe you&#039;re an orphan, or your parensforgot to teach you howto use a scale, but this should be common knowledge.<br><br>It&#039;s okay, I&#039;m not trying to shit on you.<br>But the fact you don&#039;t understand the joke, because you don&#039;t undestant howscales work, actually confirms the stereotype of americans being ignorant about the most basic stuff people should know.<br>Hilarious.<br>You confirmed the stereotype in the meme.<br><br>If you&#039;re not american, then that&#039;s okay, but I&#039;d still be a bit concerned.<br>This is why we need a mentor system inour society for experienced men to teach how life works to younger men.

Personally, I had a lot of success when doing a few sets at a heavier weight, then at 50 pounds, then as many reps as I could do at 25 pounds, then as many as I could do at body weight (at the end of a session, I PR\u2019d with 21 reps at a body weight of 212)</span><br><br>Also I personally used to use this method also from his TM Part 1 book:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A progression of three sets of five will work for these exercises, but once the weight is over thirty pounds, a trainee can get creative. One method is to use three sets of five (as heavy as possible with full range of motion), then half the weight and go for max reps, and then go for max reps with just body weight. Another method is to warm-up to a heavy triple, back off for a couple sets of five, then go for reps with 25 pounds, and then go for reps with body weight.</span><br><br><a href=\"#p69657801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69657801</a><br>Yeah good Bobby advice as usual.", "time": 1674173542, "resto": 69657281}, {"no": 69658024, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:16:40", "name": "JUSTIN KIM(C Class: Rank 4)[burst drive: scorching core(128 days to comp)1590 days to WR]", "com": "<a href=\"#p69657938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69657938</a><br>well idk it may or may not be good for me.

The reason why that tiny bit of ROM is cut off is so that the plates don&#039;t touch the floor. I do RDLs with an arched back, knees behind ankles, a wide grip, and the biggest deficit I can use without crushing my toes because I need the extra range of motion to maximally stretch my hamstrings.

Christianity itself is very broad, and (to me) it&#039;s nested in the larger broad group of world spiritual systems.

Example : you ignore her all day, give her subtle cold stares of distaste, then as you walk past her you mutter stoically &#039;&#039;good job on the report&#039;&#039;. Make sure to make it as flat and without affect as possible. You basically deprive a lot without ignoring (keep acknowledging her presence with stare, attention when she speaks etc, but make it flat and cold in a respectful way), and then you hook her with the &#039;&#039;nice compliment&#039;&#039; or kind gesture. She is complaining about something like &#039;&#039;oh i need to get this for X task&#039;&#039; etc, you pick a moment where she is just venting to the wind about something, nobody seems interested. You make a mental note. Few hours later, you show up to her office, just simply put the &#039;&#039;metaphorical stapler&#039;&#039; on her desk and say &#039;&#039;you wanted this&#039;&#039; and walk away. She will probably be confused for a minute &#039;&#039;oh what? oh yeah the stapler...thanks?&#039;&#039; because she thought nobody paid attention or listened to her. That is how you get her to think &#039;&#039;he cares about me, he listens when no one does&#039;&#039;. <br>100% she will be trying hard too from that point on. She will completely drop the &#039;&#039;too good for you&#039;&#039; act and start making her own shy fucking awkward attempts at being nice to you too. Bringing you gifts, giving compliments etc. She&#039;ll start mirroring you thinking that&#039;s your love language etc. At some point she will even say something along the line of &#039;&#039;you know, I thought you were a jerk at first&#039;&#039; etc then you ask why and here comes the inevitable compliment laced with an insult &#039;&#039;well because you are so...intimidating (read :handsome)&#039;&#039; that&#039;s when you go &#039;&#039;well you should get to know me&#039;&#039; and then she will probably be excited and you ask her &#039;&#039;do you want to meet me over the weekend to do (something)?

But your words are measured, you don&#039;t overtly spill out your emotions. A flat, cold but respectful affect is what you need. Bite your tongue before you think about spurting out some overtly nice comment. Measure yourself. <br>Secondly, you don&#039;t give her too easy a time. The reason she instinctively pulls back with you is because she is insecure, and because men with stature and respect often give her a hard time. They keep her accountable, they value her but are strict and severe enough to not fall head over heels for her. So you must know when to pick battles with her. If she is clearly stepping out on a professional level, taking an odd stance etc. Be the one to remind her respectfully. Don&#039;t be afraid to drop the hammer, in a strict but affectionate way.

Anyone that trains in a boxing gym will probably be better than the vast majority of the people out there in terms of fighting potential. What I do recommend for people who are like me but didn&#039;t know, is that especially in America, 80% of the gyms out there are pure memes that will only teach you boxing as a sport, not as a fighting style meant to cause physical harm to your opponent, because real life is situated in war, life and death and not sports. I recommend to train with bare hands, make sure you train regularly for strength, and to build your muscles so you arms, forearms, shoulders, hips are all to notch. Doing cardio is also an essential aspect of fighting.<br><br>The next secret to fighting, especially someone who wants to cause you harm is INTENSITY. If you&#039;re not intense while maintaining form, you risk being taken out. Another suggestion to anyone&#039;s repertoire is to buy a handgun and either learn or pay someone to properly teach you the mechanics of how it is used.<br><br>Last point and one that barely anyone talks about is mental. Regular people often don&#039;t want to harm others and only do so when pushed into a corner, learn to lose that mentality and actively focus on hurting your opponent, there is no such thing as &quot;honor&quot; when life or death is at hand, you either win or lose.

The last 6 months of his life were spent vomiting almost continuously and being diagnosed with liver problems. He got taken to the hospital a few times the week before he died but he always checked himself out with Mom&#039;s blessing. Once when they were taking the idea of one of the nurses remarked that they could not believe he was being discharged. 2 days before he died I had dinner with mom. She told me the story of how that morning he&#039;d woken her up screaming from the basement about how he was in horrible pain in his back. She told this like in the same manner as someone talking about the weather. When I found this out my jaw dropped and we left our dinner and went home and I finally managed to get a nurse on the telephone to convince him to go to the hospital.

Weed, psychedelics and low-dose stimulants are ok in moderation<br>- eat healthy unprocessed foods. lower calorie diets seem to be better for longevity, and bulk/cut cycles put a lot of unneeded stress on the body. Staying 12-15% BF year round is best for longevity.<br>- avoid nutrient defficiencies, most common ones are magnesium, omega-3 and Vit D. Put all your food for a week into cronometer and see what&#039;s missing.<br>- 8 hours quality sleep per night. Missing sleep is one of the fastest ways to age, since your body can&#039;t repair itself.<br>- fasting triggers autophagy where the body can remove dead and damaged cells, essentially reversing aging at the cellular level. You need to fast at least 24 hours to start autophagy. I usually fast for one full day per month, and extend it to two days if I feel good.<br>- don&#039;t tan/sunburn and generally avoid excess sun exposure. Some (20 mins/day for white people) to get natural vitamin D is fine, but beyond that use sunscreen or cover your skin. <br>- excercise helps prevent aging, but excessive endurance cardio (think marathon runners) puts too much stress on the body and ages you. Strength training and HIIT cardio is best.<br>- Don&#039;t be lonely. Having a large amount of friends you see in person, and/or a healthy relationship massively lowers stress and reduces aging. If you&#039;re a hopeless sperg you can make friends at board game meetups, anime conventions and shit, or you can go out to a concert/festival and take MDMA to force to social pathways in your brain to activate.<br>- reduce oxidative stress on the body. NAC is a powerful antioxidant that&#039;s easily available. antiinflamatories like aspirin or CBD work to lower this as well (ibuprofen and paracetamol lower test and are generally toxic, aspirin and CBD are much healthier).", "time": 1674137297, "resto": 69651787}, {"no": 69652212, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)09:09:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69651787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69651787</a><br>This wasn&#039;t veganism, this was her mother dying and her becoming ridiculously anorexic as a result.

Standard is 650nm and 830nm), accutane until your skin clears up (avoid old protocols that stuff ask for .1mg/kg/day that&#039;s way too fucking much, it&#039;s now proven that a mere 5mg per day is enough for 92% of people and 10mg per is enough for 97% of people.

All this stuff is cheap too. A 500w red light LED panel is $150 and LEDs are very long lived. A kilo of Vit C is like $8 in bulk powder. Accutane you can get online from something like reliableRX for $80 for a year&#039;s supply (essentially all you&#039;ll ever need for a lifetime).

Pretty self explanatory.<br>The second factor is a bit more complicated though. It depends on how physically and mentally fatigued you get by a given exercise. For example, maybe dips give you a great stimulus and don&#039;t produce a lot of systemic fatigue or mental fatigue, so you could do 5 sets and be completely fine. On the other hand, maybe squats produce a ton of systemic and mental fatigue (due to how hard they are), so 5 sets wouldn&#039;t be a good idea, 3 would be better instead. If this causes problems with factor 1 due to insufficient volume, you can use exercises that are less systemically and mentally fatiguing to fill in volume gaps.<br>For one example, maybe you really like squats and they aren&#039;t mentally fatiguing, but they still cause a lot of systemic fatigue that you cannot recover from if you do more sets. Instead, you can add in some bulgarian split squats to get the extra volume as they are less mentally fatiguing.<br>On the other hand, if say deadlifts are really mentally fatiguing but not too systemically fatiguing, you could take a variation of the deadlift that is still systemically fatiguing but less mentally fatiguing and do that for extra volume (Snatch grip deadlifts?

The back is a conglomerate of a lot of muscle groups of varying sizes, so trying to put them all in one session will result in one part getting trained really well and another part getting trained rather poorly depending on what the exercise ordering is. That and most of the upper-back muscles are very fatigue resistant anyway, so you could train them on back-to-back sessions and be just fine as long as you manage your recovery well. I personally train my upper back 4 times per week.<br><br>On upper days I do horizontal and vertical pulls, slightly biased toward horizontal pulls as I do 2 per session while only 1 for vertical pulls as well as some lower trap isolation (might move the lower trap isolation around though).<br>On lower days I do more upper back work, mostly lats (front lever pulls superset with bodyweight chinups, and straight arm pullovers), rear delts (powell raises) and infraspinatus/teres minor (db external rotations https://youtu.be/44wU6u8x3rw?t=323)<wbr> as I can still do more lat volume and I don&#039;t isolate the rear delts/infraspinatus/teres minor on upper days. For the erectors it&#039;s more like 2x a week obviously as most of the volume will come from lower body days, however I do deficit strict barbell rows on my second upper day that takes place 2 days before and after both lower body days so this adds a tiny bit of extra volume. And on my first upper day I do chest supported rows with thoracic flexion and extension which trains my thoracic erectors (if you can do these, round your thoracic spine as hard as you can for 10 seconds after the last rep of the last set. you&#039;ll feel it a TON, more than most of the other back muscles actually).
