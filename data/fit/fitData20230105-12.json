Pic related has the exact same amount of calories as a Reese&#039;s cup and isn&#039;t more filling at all, nearly all the calories come from saturated fat and its just a fucking scam.<br><br>Additionally the only reason to go on keto at all is if you understand so little about nutrition and food satiety that you need a meme diet that just completely cuts out an entire macronutrient. There are SO MANY carb sources that are great for weight loss like fruits and potatoes and oats and brown rice that you&#039;re not allowing yourself access to if you do keto. Couple this with the fact that keto is not maintainable for most people since any diet that keeps weight off you have to be able to switch to your entire life, and I wouldn&#039;t recommend anyone do it except if you have a medical reason to.", "filename": "keto", "ext": ".png", "w": 807, "h": 818, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672869217157154, "time": 1672869217, "md5": "2uBGZ5QRjrFhSw7cwd81wA==", "fsize": 818487, "resto": 69477993}, {"no": 69478314, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:54:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69478282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478282</a><br>I want to ramp calories up because i generally feel lethargic. <br>t. samefag", "time": 1672869254, "resto": 69477993}, {"no": 69478321, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:54:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69478114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478114</a>", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 16-54-16 (4) _fit_ - _fat_ - fat loss general - Fitness - 4chan", "ext": ".png", "w": 894, "h": 100, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 13, "tim": 1672869276680801, "time": 1672869276, "md5": "EuWyHqeypHaCoh7CCg+unw==", "fsize": 22350, "resto": 69477993}, {"no": 69478334, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:55:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69478114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478114</a>", "filename": "Screenshot_20230104_135516_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 677, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1672869330753191, "time": 1672869330, "md5": "rQ44Gmex5md1YSkelhvTnQ==", "fsize": 245743, "resto": 69477993}, {"no": 69478350, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69478334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478334</a><br><a href=\"#p69478321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478321</a><br>Samefag", "time": 1672869409, "resto": 69477993}, {"no": 69478352, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:57:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69478321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478321</a> (you)<br>nice inspect element and delete the (you) ketotranny", "time": 1672869425, "resto": 69477993}, {"no": 69478353, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)16:57:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69478321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478321</a><br><a href=\"#p69478334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69478334</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;screenshots posted less than a minute apart</span><br><br>either the same person on 2 different devices or 2 people in a Discord coordinating with each other.

If you don\u2019t already eat healthy, you have no business crash dieting. 90% chance you\u2019ll binge or rebound or yo-yo or whatever you wanna call it. Spend 3 months adopting new nutritional habits, eating only healthy shut you cook yourself, and perhaps a small deficit as well.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the diet</span><br>The key is salt. The water fasting fags are on to something with their snake cum. Electrolytes help you avoid hunger and the fatigue and shit moods and sleep issues, to an extent. Don\u2019t go crazy but make damn sure you\u2019re getting your sodium and potassium in.<br>For breakfast I switch it up depending how I feel but it\u2019s either 2-4 whole eggs with salt or it\u2019s oatmeal and some salted almonds. Lunch should be a small snack such as 1-3 servings of almonds or some fruit for the carbs or just a single chicken tiddy, again be liberal with salt. I like dinner to be my largest meal and make damn sure it\u2019s got carbs. So a single cup of cooked rice + protein source, sometimes I\u2019ll straight up ditch the protein source and just eat rice&amp;veggies.<br><br><br>Because this is already a technically unhealthy way of dieting and meant for those who are over 18% body fat, forget macros.I.e. Don\u2019t concern yourself with protein being high enough. Fat being high enough would be more beneficial for hormonal health and sanity tbqh. Your goal should be to keep your deficit no less than 1,300 calories. Worry only about that. Because you are a fat fuck over 18% body fat, any muscle loss you experience is not true muscle loss. You might lose 0.5lbs of actual muscle through the entire process.

Carbs are split between three general types, which are sugars, starches and fiber. Try to avoid sugars (though fruits are good for you and have alot of sugar), these are often not good nutritionally and they&#039;ll spike your blood sugar which when it levels out will cause you to become hungry. Starches are often nutritionally good for you, but they&#039;re like sugars and can spike your blood sugar as well, this would be things like rice and potatoes. There&#039;s nothing wrong with eating them, just be aware that they can cause problems with hunger as well. Finally, fiber, which is slow to digest and pretty much always a good idea to eat. Lots of vegetables are high in fiber, like broccoli, cabbage, spinach, etc. You should try to get as many of your carbs from fiber as possible. <br>General diet plan: hit your protein intake goal and then fill out the rest of your calories with fat and carbs, and try to get the *good* kinds of fat and carbs. Cutting out fat is very bad for you as many important vitamins require fat for your body to properly absorb them (fat-soluble vitamins). Cutting out carbs probably isn&#039;t as damaging to your health as cutting out fats, but carbs are the most efficient fuel source for your body and cutting them out will be difficult and it will also probably make you feel like shit (if you&#039;re eating good carbs, that is).", "time": 1672860011, "resto": 69465999}, {"no": 69476653, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)14:25:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69476596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69476596</a><br>I see, I&#039;m trying to lose weight, so I thought cutting out almost all carbs would be beneficial.
