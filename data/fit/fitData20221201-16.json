It&#039;s the equivalent of what the Bible is for Christian bros. You don&#039;t have to be Muslim/convert to being one if you want to read it, just approach it with an open and put away all the preconceived notions you have/heard about it. The main difference between Islam and Christianity is that Muslims believe that Jesus was a prophet of God, instead of God himself. So there&#039;s no Trinity in Islam, just God. Aside from that, Islam and Christianity share many values and similarities. Islam also tells you to take care of yourself, avoid alcohol and excessive gambling, and to stay fit. It also has verses that warn you of the kikes and their trickery, as well as specifically saying that pedophiles, troons, and faggots are not normal, and are a transgressing people. If you do choose to read it, pay attention to the Quran and not the Hadiths, since they are man made and have a lot of verses that make no sense and/or contradict the Quran. In the same vein, don&#039;t follow blindly what sheiks and other religious figures like that say, (as well as many other Muslims, sadly they make the religion into more of a game, and put more value into the words of religious celebrities/figures than the Quran and God himself) since the only words that matter are those of God&#039;s and the Quran. Either way, even if you don&#039;t choose to read it, it&#039;s not a big deal, I just wanna tell the Christian bros to not believe all the kike propaganda about Muslims, aside from our religious beliefs, we have many of the same core values.<br>WAGMI frens.", "filename": "946853642513797456", "ext": ".png", "w": 1341, "h": 938, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1669928523656666, "time": 1669928523, "md5": "yZ27PVj+DS8OBrxEXmVd2g==", "fsize": 1626942, "resto": 69094228}, {"no": 69125545, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:11:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69122725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69122725</a><br>I didn\u2019t make the image retard, the \u201crabbi yeshua\u201d poster did.

People have a bad habit of using egolifting weight in exercises like bent over rows, cable rows, cable pulldowns, etc, and this makes it very difficult to correctly activate the lats/back or hold correct position and form, and it has a way of making biceps and shoulders take over. One big difficult pill a lot of young lifters have to swallow is that bodybuilding means you have to swallow your pride a lot of the time and lift light but focused... just because you can row 225 doesn&#039;t mean you should or that it will grow your back compared to 135.<br><br>Some good cues for lats activation:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do scap pullups (look them up) to strengthen scap muscles and learn how to selectively activate them. Focus on retracting and moving scaps during your lats work, and if you find that your shoulders remain protracted (shrugged up/forward) through the whole movement of rows/pulldowns, you are using too much weight. Use a weight that allows you to move your scaps out and in</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;for lats, focus on the concentric portion of the exercise as &quot;crushing oranges in your armpits&quot;.

This is also true of deadlifts/RDL</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;keep your elbows tucked for rows/pulldowns, i.e. do work in the scapular plane for pulldown work and keep your elbows closer to your sides for rowing work.
