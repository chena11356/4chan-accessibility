I&#039;m already below deficit as is with adequate protein, but if I could optimize that even more I&#039;d get even better results. I hold myself back on several swaps simply for the sake of my sanity of keeping items around I still enjoy. Swapping something I like for something I do not like for the sake of faster results is just not the way for me, I need a balance of compromise which I achieve via better meal rationing and no snacking.

A therapist can help you if you don&#039;t feel like you can find anything on your own, but speaking for myself at least, everything in life is a lot easier the longer I unwrap all the shit that&#039;s inside of me and pinpoint the exact places where I wasn&#039;t taught how to function by my parents or by the chunk of society I grew up around. If you want a healthy starting point then the channel HealthyGamerGG on YouTube can probably give you a lot of insights into whats wrong with how you function. He covers these specific types of issues a lot. Some people here like Jordan Peterson (others think he&#039;s a hack), and he also has some good advice, just not as big as my first recommendation.

Despite smoking since I was 16 I could swim entire pool length (50m olympic pool) on one breath up to my late 20s. I quit smoking because I was seriously broke for half a year and I could not afford them for some time and after I got back on my feet I didn&#039;t like the taste anymore.<br>So yeah you can totally be /fit/ while smoking and I&#039;d even assume it&#039;s actually good for your health since there&#039;s so much lobbying against it. What I&#039;d recommend (and what I do from time to time) is to buy a pipe and smoke pure tobacco instead of pre-rolled cigarettes.", "time": 1674081650, "resto": 69644731}, {"no": 69645629, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)18:03:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69644731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69644731</a><br>use snus instead no lung damage but even more nicotine", "time": 1674083037, "resto": 69644731}, {"no": 69645633, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)18:04:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69644731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69644731</a><br>Compare the entirity of europe to america.

Eating a variety of nutrient-dense foods, such as lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, is important for maintaining your overall health.<br><br>I strongly encourage you to seek help for your addiction and to speak with a medical professional or a dietitian about a healthy eating plan that can provide your body with the necessary nutrients it needs.

Yeah, easy for me to say considering I managed to have an easier time of it but I mean what else is your alternative? I suppose you could hope to find a higher paying job in your field. The one bit of advice I can give from experience is that if you&#039;re looking to advance quicker don&#039;t stay at one place for too long. Get in, get some resume builders under your belt, and get out. I&#039;ve heard people say 2 years is the longest to stay at a company, after that the performance based pay increases flatten out below what you could attain in an increase by getting a promotion via transfer to a different company. Depending on your field all it might take is some certifications and a good interview.

If they couldn&#039;t do that, some of them would just got skin cancer and eventually die.

Headgear only helps prevents superficial damage like cuts. It does very little to mitigate the concussive force. Studies have been done that show that in a lot of cases headgear can be worse due to limited field of vision and larger target/more leverages to hit. Plus people naturally assume its okay to go harder because they see headgear. Same with gloves, while there is a big difference between 16 oz and 8 or 10 oz gloves, you can still get pretty messed up if you take too many hard shots to the head, even in the 16oz ones.

Since this much wacking. It can cause weaker erections and desensitivity (and I was in the mindset that this was training to prevent finasteride loss of libido) I developed a new technique and mindset, where id focus on maximizing the erections strength and using the lightest grip possible and edging. So I was basically max erections strength for 30min while barely touching it. It has worked for me as a technique for maintaining firmness and sensitivity despite that frequency and I suppose since I&#039;m maxing out each time it&#039;s kind of like training for your dick.

That is something that explains every organism we know on this planet, from viruses, bacteria, mammals and us.<br><br>Now let&#039;s ignore all microbial life and focus purely on animals, because it&#039;s easier. We eat two things, (cellular) machinery and chemical energy. This maps to protein and vitamins and minerals (machinery) and sugars, carbs and fats (energy). Except animals can actually convert these between each other to a greater or lesser degree - remember this.<br><br>Now, life surrounds us animals. But the only source of external energy (for animals) is sunlight. Everything must come from the sun. Luckily plants surround us, and are concentrated sources of solar energy, they usually turn sunlight into sugars, and then into long starches and fibres. Humans can&#039;t digest most plant fibres (like cellulose). Either way, this means most animals eat plants. But other animals are concentrated sources of everything animals need to live. So some animals specialise in only eating other animals, they&#039;re literally bags of collected energy and machinery so there&#039;s this niche where a being could just eat other animals.<br><br>Now let&#039;s focus exclusively on humans. We do not have the ability to digest cellulose - gorillas have this, cows and sheep and goats have this - but we do not. So this means we have to eat fruits and vegetables and seeds only. We basically cannot eat leaves (though some exceptions apply). And we can function just fine doing this! Don&#039;t believe the propaganda, being vegan can be healthy. It&#039;s just really hard and most don&#039;t succeed. <br><br>This brings me to eating other animals. Its easy to get lots of essential nutrients from animals.

Overweight prevalence among the richest (45.0% [35.6%\u201354.4%]) and the poorest (45.5% [35.9%\u201355.0%]) were roughly equal in high-income settings. At $8,000 GDP per capita, the adjusted probability of being obese was no longer highest in the richest decile, and the same was true of overweight at $10,000. Above $25,000, individuals in the richest decile were less likely than those in the poorest decile to be obese, and the same was true of overweight at $50,000. We then projected overweight and obesity rates by wealth decile to 2040 for all countries to quantify the expected rise in prevalence in the relatively poor.
