I put on like 12kg in 2 months because of a medication I was put on (I was already overweight so this put me on the cusp of obesity) and it made me realise how awful my diet was and that it was just my good metabolism due to youth that let me only reach overweight status. I was 24 at the time and knew that my metabolism would slow past 25 and that things would only get worse, so I started doing an hour of exercise 5 days a week (half an hour cardio, half an hour calisthenics), cut out all soda and goyslop, and used more whole foods and ingredients for what I still ate. This was enough to get me down 35kg and I\u2019ve maintained my weight within a margin of 1kg up and down ever since. It\u2019s really not that hard to lose weight and be moderately healthy, like it took effort but nowhere near as much as you expect it too before you start doing it. I think a lot of fatties are under the false assumption that you need to do bodybuilder tier exercise and diet to lose weight (I was one of them for the longest time) and use that to justify not trying to lose weight. There are also those who are just flat out deluded, not misinformed like most.

Having sex is overrated anyway unless she is riding you or in one of the sexual positions where she is doing the work. Eating pussy is much more fun. Its an adventure. I usually start off at the taint and slowly work my way up to the vagina. Kissing her inner thighs and toungue fucking her deeply penetrating as far as I can with my toungue. I then spread the labias (pussy lips for you virgins) and tease the clit before sucking on it like a jolly rancher (this is a piece of hard candy for your europeans and 3rd worlders). Its just so much more exciting and fun. I have literally came from eating women out before. I also like to make them taste themselves and kiss them in the middle of it or lick their nipples and get their nipples hard with their own vaginal muccus. I love looking up and seeing 2 erect nipples like mountain peaks that I must climb. Anyway, sex is just a lot of work. You have to thrust back and forth if its doggystyle or if its missionary or a variation of you&#039;re doing all the work. Some of the other positions like anything where you stand up and carry her or the pile driver is not that pleasurable for your dick. The best way to have sex is for the women to do cowgirl, reverse cowgirl, ride you on the couch/chair, or straddles you. Same with blowjobs. Nothing more relaxing than laying or sitting down and watching a hot chick suck the cum out of your dick then keep sucking.", "time": 1671455123, "resto": 69306702}, {"no": 69306750, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)08:05:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69306702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69306702</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;skinny men</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic is of fit non-skinny muscular man</span><br>I&#039;m really starting to think there might be some bigger conspiracy to get people to stop taking care of their bodies.", "time": 1671455135, "resto": 69306702}, {"no": 69306757, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)08:06:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69306732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69306732</a><br>No woman wants to have sex for more than 15 minutes unless they&#039;re blackout drunk, their vagina will start to hurt.

When you consume too much it&#039;s gotta go somewhere and your coronary arteries have plenty of room.<br><br>This isn&#039;t to say CICO is the answer. A healthy well balanced diet in accordance with your level of fitness and effort is the answer. Not all calories are equal. High carb is more effective for energy demand. You will never find an elite athlete doing keto.

Steroids are going to addict you and shut down natural test production. You don&#039;t even look bad. Your problem is you put too much focus on your body. Improve your life in other departments, while working out all the time as a supplement. Working out should be a supplement to your life, not your main hobby. Otherwise anyone who follows your way of life will end up like you - insecure and never happy with progress. If you focus on other aspects of your life while regularly working out you&#039;ll slowly, but surely build up a better body with no stress involved. It&#039;s the kind of thing that takes years, and there&#039;s many variables like height, genetic potential, limb length etc. that dictates how you look. Another important thing to consider is that it doesn&#039;t matter how you look like compared to Schwarzenegger, or some roided up TikTok star, what matters about your body is how you look like to people you hang around. You can mog average people with 1 year of progress. You can mog regular lifters with few years of progress. you&#039;ll likely never mog Schwarzenegger, but it&#039;s not like you are going to ever meet him + you can mog him in other departments of your life such as skills, job, money, fashion sense, house etc. So in general my point is that if you gymcel and do roids you&#039;ll be impressive only to other gymcels - at some point average people can&#039;t even recognize that you have this amount of muscles - you just look good and fit to them at a certain level, and after that point a normie can&#039;t tell a difference. For normies people who have many aspects of their lives developed are more impressive than some autist who engages only in one specific pursuit. It&#039;s good to have a &quot;main&quot; skill, but this skill should make you money, so you can have freedom to pursue many things at the same time. Gymcelling doesn&#039;t pay you, so don&#039;t do roids that will addict you, and shut down your test production - it&#039;s absolutely not worth it.", "time": 1671498507, "resto": 69312380}, {"no": 69312862, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)20:11:07", "name": "sage", "com": "<a href=\"#p69312380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69312380</a><br>I still want to lick your belly button and suck your dick.

There are connotations to this term which are not intended because I\u2019m not talking specifically the Bible, believing Christfag stuff or performing those rituals associated with Christianity. The term is an attempt to describe a higher thing prone to abstraction.

Think of all of your five senses, and how we to take them all individually and at face value. We hear a song lyric in passing, we see a color with a symbolic meaning, appreciate an artwork that evokes emotion inside our soul, feel a texture that reminds us of something, a friend in passing says something off the cuff. Generally it gets thrown into our short term memories and thrown away to make room for something else. We don\u2019t think about it, because it\u2019s all \u201cjunk data.\u201d However it all adds up into one collective whole that where if you were imagining a radio, that jumble of sensation would be like tuning in to a specific frequency.", "time": 1671373622, "resto": 69285840}, {"no": 69297361, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:28:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69296665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69296665</a><br>The human mind is an antenna, capable of receiving these frequencies. Even transmit them through action and word, to the Universe at large. However it is incredibly taxing; mentally, and emotionally. Constantly worrying about it drains the batteries so to speak. Most people are tuned out and living with individual sensation and not collectively. It\u2019s just hard to do so all the time so it gets rerouted into the subconscious, manifesting negatively as mental illnesses: anxiety, depression, phobias, complexes. There is a converse to this. Being tuned in and having that full battery can result in successes, useful introspection, manifestations of desire, and downright seemingly unfair entropic manipulations, even if we aren\u2019t fully conscious to it.

In simpler terms: we fuck up and get fucked up all the time. Overthink it and run out of batteries, hamster at the noggin wheel fully exhausted. However God is not wrong, and has never been wrong, although we are blind to the greater implications and consequences of where He leads, hence hindsight being 20/20. Think of every time you messed up and went &quot;oh I shouldn\u2019t have done that&quot; but you did it anyway.

In fact this whole thing is turning into a thesis on chaos magick and I\u2019m not intending to go into it atm. I could go on forever.<br><br>This shit\u2019s getting wordy. Following signs. <br><br>When I met her, I had found a quiet place without any electronics, distractions, or anything else that would get in the way, and just spoke. Talked about whatever was on my mind from good stuff to every anxiety and fear, and asked even the air around me to give me a sign, direction, or heck I\u2019d settle for a compass. And it did, in a laughably literal way not very long afterward, and into one stupid event I follow right down to one butterfly effect. I met her from it, and her name is a pun, within a pun, and was a sign. I was tuned in and saw it immediately and said to myself this person will either be the greatest heartbreak of my life so far or the best thing that ever happened to me ever. She\u2019s still both. <br><br>From more pragmatic standpoint, good luck is opening the door when opportunity knocks and that\u2019s about 80 percent of learning anything or getting anything. I will direct you to a short article by Richard Wiseman called The Luck Factor. Just put what you want, what you NEED out there. With your voice and your actions. You don\u2019t need a gf, you don\u2019t need sex, you don\u2019t need the world to like you, be rich, famous, fucking whatever. You\u2019d be very surprised with how little might inspire you to make a massive change. You\u2019d be even more surprised by what you realize that you need.", "time": 1671373835, "resto": 69285840}, {"no": 69297409, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:33:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69296665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69296665</a><br>Okay, anyway.

Your best bet is a 3 day hypertrophy routine until you hit 1/2/3/4, you&#039;ll still see strength gains (albeit slower) and you&#039;ll pack on mass much faster than you normally would on a lower rep range strength routine. Do not fall for dogmatism and absolutism, if you want to grow a muscle isolate it. As for the diet, cut until you see your abs.

Also 3000 isn&#039;t nearly enough calories for real gains. I was eating 7000 during my dirtiest bulk. Don&#039;t be afraid of gaining a little fat, with the extra height it&#039;s way less noticable.<br>Lastly start fucking lifting you pussy. Heavy as fuck compounds, also mix in calisthenics and maintain them during the bulk. Its way easier to keep calisthenics during a bulk then to start fresh at a heavy weight.

The cutting system I use is pretty simple. Intermittent fasting + calorie restriction. I skip breakfast (usually easy) and try to have a late lunch + light dinner. My biggest point of failure is the immense hunger I feel sometimes at night when I&#039;m trying to go to sleep. During the day I can smash endless cups of coffee but for obvious reasons I avoid that at night. My plan is to get some metamucil in the next few days and try that instead. It&#039;s a fibre drink that theoretically should make you feel full but without adding many extra calories. Has anyone here tried anything like that?

Slowly re-add foods you want to eat back forever, and occasionally treat yourself even later than that. If you ever pig out or something, BOOM, you just learned a trigger food, most people have them.<br><br>If you do a short fast 24-72 hours, do 1 once a month. As you are probably just going for a full reset like myself, I&#039;d hit a 72-132 hour fast (even 7 days, but that&#039;s assured mass loss wtf). anything after 72 is probably hitting muscle. With that being said, allegedly the &quot;max&quot; benefit is a 5.5 day fast for naturals. Done 2-4 months out of the year.<br><br>I&#039;m schizo of it myself, but I&#039;ve only really heard good things about it, just be sure you have an exit strategy and are properly nutritious prior to the fast, and yeah, the first 3 days suck the most ass, and refill with electrolytes. /fasttards/ have an occasional fast right, but I think it&#039;s bad long term strategy.<br><br>also it shrinks your stomach over time, reducing appetite, you will get hungry at your usual feeding windows, but the longer the fast the less you eat so the more those get muffled, and you most likely will want to binge if you break it early, so be careful with that.

Works well, only downside is i get super jittery too so I need to take it with taurine<br>4. Caffeine. Cheap and easy to get.

We studied two explanations for this apparent resistance to diet--low total energy expenditure and underreporting of caloric intake--in 224 consecutive obese subjects presenting for treatment. Group 1 consisted of nine women and one man with a history of diet resistance in whom we evaluated total energy expenditure and its main thermogenic components and actual energy intake for 14 days by indirect calorimetry and analysis of body composition. Group 2, subgroups of which served as controls in the various evaluations, consisted of 67 women and 13 men with no history of diet resistance.<br><br>Results: Total energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate in the subjects with diet resistance (group 1) were within 5 percent of the predicted values for body composition, and there was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in the thermic effects of food and exercise. Low energy expenditure was thus excluded as a mechanism of self-reported diet resistance. In contrast, the subjects in group 1 underreported their actual food intake by an average (+/- SD) of 47 +/- 16 percent and overreported their physical activity by 51 +/- 75 percent. Although the subjects in group 1 had no distinct psychopathologic characteristics, they perceived a genetic cause for their obesity, used thyroid medication at a high frequency, and described their eating behavior as relatively normal (all P &lt; 0.05 as compared with group 2).<br><br>Conclusions: The failure of some obese subjects to lose weight while eating a diet they report as low in calories is due to an energy intake substantially higher than reported and an overestimation of physical activity, not to an abnormality in thermogenesis.", "time": 1671475710, "resto": 69308779}, {"no": 69309565, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:49:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69308779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69308779</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;group of people with credentials write a paper together stating the sky is green</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything you have observed in others\u2019 experience and tested yourself since the the beginning of recorded history contradicts this</span>", "time": 1671475790, "resto": 69308779}, {"no": 69309579, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:51:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69309555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69309555</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fatties are delusional copers, but you\u2019re supposed to take them seriously when they discuss weight loss methods don\u2019t work</span><br>Trips confirms this", "time": 1671475911, "resto": 69308779}, {"no": 69309580, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:51:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Guys, stop replying.
