Now how to make things easier: Replace everything in your diet with a more calorie dense option or something that is easier to eat, easier to digest or less satiating. So for example, instead of potatoes you eat rice. Instead of chicken breast you eat chicken thighs, instead of beef mince you eat half and half beef and pork mince. Add butter, olive oil or similar to all meals. Make a sauce to go with all your meats (use the oil, fat and the juices from the meat as a base). I add peanut butter wherever the taste might suit, it&#039;s good in a curry. Put it in your protein shake, too. Hopefully you can handle your dairy. Cheese like gouda is great for bulking. 2 big slices on a sandwich with butter and that&#039;s a super easy 500+ kcal snack. Instead of water you drink milk - instead of skim milk you use full fat milk, instead of full fat milk in your coffee you use cream. Keep some vegetables in your diet but mostly go for those rich in vitamins that aren&#039;t very satiating, personally I eat a lot of bell peppers. Start eating early even if you&#039;re not the breakfast type or don&#039;t get hungry in the morning. Have like 4 eggs and something like whole wheat sandwich bread. You could probably just have a shake if you want. Throw in a banana and some peanut butter with the whey. Then I&#039;d recommend making a big batch of a simple meal, for example a chili con carne. You can put in lots of beans, maybe throw in some sweet corn and cook some rice as a side or you could be making a big batch of some spaghetti bolognese or a stew or curry. This will be your main dish for the rest of the day or you can keep leftovers for the next day. Point is you cook once a day but make enough that it lasts you for at least 4 big servings.", "time": 1670845013, "resto": 69232995}, {"no": 69233192, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:38:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69232995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69232995</a><br>Muscle activation LATS.<br>Work on that.<br>Or Swim, Swimming gives you a decent back", "time": 1670845102, "resto": 69232995}, {"no": 69233395, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)07:14:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69233008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69233008</a><br>Thanks I guess I should stay like that, whats DFC btw ?", "time": 1670847248, "resto": 69232995}], "last_modified": 1670847248}, {"no": 69228421, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)18:16:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;low test male asks doc for trt </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nope</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mentally ill retard asks for hrt</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sure, here you go!</span>", "filename": "07CC40B6-9D87-469E-828C-2FB1FD586C80", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670800579561746, "time": 1670800579, "md5": "xDxQIMKinzT3iJlj5VK26w==", "fsize": 277593, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "low-test-male-asks-doc-for-trt", "replies": 32, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 27, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 69231776, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)01:58:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69230221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69230221</a><br>Most doctors pop a blood vessel and shit themselves when anyone else but another doctor, pharmacist or a senior nurse that experiencemogs them ask about getting on medications.

There is a new diagnosis for people like us, it&#039;s called CPTSD. Talk therapy does not work for this as effectively as the hypnosis/meditation style treatments where you recover and reprocess the memories. You can actually fix this shit instead of having to listen to that garbage self talk and living in the perpetual fear for the rest of your life. This problem was often misdiagnosed as bipolar before advancements (happened to me, but I never took the meds).<br><br>Additionally splitting like this is common with trauma. You&#039;re on this site, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve read Frtiz&#039;s books on trauma and how it creates alters in the brain. In our case they were programmed by the environment and self preservation instead of being set up by handlers. You&#039;re not schizo, you just have an elaborate compartmentalized self defense and survival structure built into your brain that was to keep your child self alive in such a garbage environment.<br><br>I have a technique for you for the inner critic (the angry, self-hating representation of you who mentally beats you). That voice is a self created defense mechanism. It was made by your mind as a way to try to predict your retard parents confusing behaviour. By sparring against this voice you were able to survive and make it to adulthood. Now you don&#039;t need the voice to be like that anymore, so when it starts up try first asking it when it was formed. Mine was created at age 3 for example, and using meditation I was able to go back and reprocess the memory when it was formed.<br>(1/2)", "time": 1670844644, "resto": 69231059}, {"no": 69233155, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:32:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69231650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69231650</a><br>The inner critic is usually an inner child who has taken on a soldier/drill sargent role. Then try telling it that you are now safe from those shitbags and that negative self talk is actually hindering you. Tell it that you love them for trying so hard to keep you safe all these years, but that now they can rest and choose to do something new. Mine wants to keep defending so I tell it to keep an eye on things and help me analyse people&#039;s and my own behaviour. When they get too negative remind them that they are safe and that you are an adult now. Remind them that you are in charge, not the bad people, and that you will always love and defend them. Using this technique has been extremely effective for me and it only gets bad when I feel under threat from other people now, not always rational either, it&#039;s just anxiety sometimes when I&#039;m worrying I&#039;ve fucked something up.<br><br>Just treat it with love, but it will be hard for the alter to accept it and not mock you for being kind if you haven&#039;t reprocessed the memory and let it feel seen and understood.

Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and empathy found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oxytocin affects social distance between adult males and females, and may be responsible at least in part for romantic attraction and subsequent monogamous pair bonding. An oxytocin nasal spray caused men in a monogamous relationship, but not single men, to increase the distance between themselves and an attractive woman during a first encounter by 10 to 15 centimeters. The researchers suggested that oxytocin may help promote fidelity within monogamous relationships.[135] For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;bonding hormone&quot;. There is some evidence that oxytocin promotes ethnocentric behavior, incorporating the trust and empathy of in-groups with their suspicion and rejection of outsiders.[92] Furthermore, genetic differences in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) have been associated with maladaptive social traits such as aggressive behavior.[136]</span>", "time": 1670842081, "resto": 69232336}, {"no": 69232965, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)05:56:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69232336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69232336</a><br>Getting married happily ever after is low T.", "filename": "marriage1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 820, "h": 381, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1670842587275068, "time": 1670842587, "md5": "gDns8iBNggyMl4ym+B3YcA==", "fsize": 94933, "resto": 69232336}, {"no": 69232984, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:00:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69232965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69232965</a><br>You can tell this is probably true, because strong androgenic steroids like tren are renowned for causing relationship breakups.<br>Testosterone would do the same thing but on a more subtle level.", "time": 1670842832, "resto": 69232336}, {"no": 69233025, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:09:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69232336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69232336</a><br>Procreation is the purpose of life.
