I&#039;m gonna attribute this to the fact that finasteride was originally developed to deal with enlarged prostates, which is primarily caused by excess DHT production. Chances are if you suffer from androgenic alopecia that you also have an enlarged prostate squeezing on your bladder. Enlarged prostates can also exacerbate your chances of developing prostate cancer later in life. So if you&#039;re going bald be extra sure to have your prostate examined, your chances of developing prostate cancer are higher than men who still have hair (but men with no balding issues should get checked anyways). <br><br>It&#039;s actually been observed in studies that men with androgenic alopecia who take finasteride have a lower rate of developing prostate cancer and heart disease than those who don&#039;t.

This is why they want tall hot youthful looking men. If you&#039;re a dyel the gym helps you by making you more attractive but like with almost everything you can have too much of it. After 2 years of consistent effort not only will you make increasingly smaller gains in both strength and size, on top of that, the increase in attractive per pound of muscle gained decreases. Eventually you will reach a point where adding on extra muscle reduces your physical attractiveness to the average woman. If you have 16 inch biceps and abs, you&#039;ve basically gained all there can be gained in terms of increasing your sexual attractiveness via the gym. The only people you will be impressing now are men.<br>Within male dominance hierarchies, there is no upper limit when it comes to strength and physique. This is why the insanely jacked gymbros have almost exclusively male attention online and irl. Sure some women will be impressed but a lot will also be physically repulsed. After a certain point, more jacked you get the more attention you receive from men relative to women.

We&#039;re not a species where the strongest men reproduced. If that was the case we&#039;d be as ugly as an elephant seal. We&#039;re still a tournament species not a pair bonding species, and it&#039;s sexual selection controlled by women that&#039;s been the driver of our evolution, not male intrasexual competition. Sure maybe there are places where &quot;da stronkest man clubber oder man n only stronk man fuck&quot; but these societies produce some of the ugliest people you could imagine and don&#039;t last very long. What we have in reality is a matriarch with a few men at the very top because they&#039;re exceptional at providing whatever is was that women needed. <br>Historically it&#039;s been genetic material since resources were collectively owners by the tribe. And with the development of civilisation women were forced to pair bond to have access to said resources that were once collectively owned. It&#039;s only with the recent advancements in technology that women were able to enter the workforce and secure their own resources without having to be locked into a near permanent relationship with a man out of necessity. Now that most women can work an easy job and have all their basic needs taken care of by themselves, they don&#039;t require a relationship. What they want is the best genetic material and they only chase guys who slight resources for luxury. They can afford holidays, high heels and nice outfits what they want is a flashy car, designer items and luxury resorts at least half a dozen times a year.<br>Sure most women eventually settle but most men don&#039;t tick their boxes anymore. The hairy bear that can flip cars is, was and will probably never be what the vast majority of women would ever call an ideal man.

I use porefessional pore eraser primer makeup to fill in the large gaps and it helps a little bit. You gotta push the product into the dents. Moisturize. Plump and well moisturized skin reduce their appearance but don&#039;t use any products that are shiny or give glow, must use matte.<br><br>If you really want to treat it, you can go the surgery route. Subcision with suction method to detach the anchored scar tissue and prevent it from reattaching(highly likely, need 5+ sessions). Be careful though as if you scar easily it may make it even worse. Fillers to replace the voids and collapse of collagen. Tca cross to fill those indents and raise the scars.<br><br>Lasers are a waste of money as it only treats the superficial level of skin and is only to be done after you fixed the underlying tethered scar tissue.<br><br>The most effective solution that will reduce their appearance is the phenol peel.
