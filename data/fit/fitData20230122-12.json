I mean honestly so gross to imagine eating that, but god does American obesity make sense now after seeing how prevalent and how damn popular those drinks are.<br><br>Finally, I will note that I was on the lookout for Disney adults, and was kind of shocked by what I saw. &quot;Disney Adults&quot; are almost all obese and seemingly low IQ.

My guess is that this person used to be terribly diabetic (and still is lol) and had to get their toes amputated because they went necrotic. After that event, it traumatized the man enough to at least start to look into his health. As for scarring, looking at amputations like the one I postulated, the surgical scars are usually more on the top of the foot.

So long as you get within 2-3 reps in reserve on a set you have essentially extracted all value that you can from the exercise, but the issue there lies within knowing how close you are to failure, which is impossible to know unless you actually go to failure.

The results between if you do that vs multiset exercise is exactly the same, the only difference being that you have a chance to overtrain if you do too many sets. Once you get past the point of being able to do 35 reps with bodyweight you&#039;ll need to add more weight somehow though. I just meant that if the lowest possible amount of weight you could move in a deltoid lateral raise for example is your arm, then you would know that you tapped out when you can&#039;t move your arm anymore, not that bodyweight is superior. If you wanted to do bench press until you couldn&#039;t press your empty arms into the air anymore then that would be an equivalent to that analogy. One major benefit of doing the single continuous set is that you same an immense amount of time. You can literally spend a fraction of the time in the gym.<br><br><a href=\"#p69683587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69683587</a><br>Injury prevention is #1. There&#039;s next to 0% chance that you&#039;ll ever harm yourself doing 5-10 second reps with a weight you will tap out in 60-90 seconds with, which is usually around 30%-50% 1rm. Slowly approaching failure also increases your capability to exercise the muscle to a greater degree. Moving slowly allows for you to produce more muscular contractile force (not the same as force applied to joints). By moving more slowly you allow the actin and myosin filaments more time to grip onto each other and ensure that the maximum amount of filaments are being utilized. If you go really hard really fast only a few of them will grab each other, propelling you in the motion quickly, at which point momentum takes over somewhat, reducing the work done by your muscles mid rep. Doing it slower gets more actin and myosin cross-bridging over a much greater range of motion, which theoretically could prevent cases of drastic regional hypertrophy though that specific claim has not been studied yet. It&#039;s likely that it would if it were directly compared to faster rep speeds.<br><br>I will do a second post in one second", "filename": "Actin and Myosin Filament Gripping to Contract Muscle Fiber", "ext": ".png", "w": 1347, "h": 894, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674369500935088, "time": 1674369500, "md5": "DcMLteeDXsWb2heEgDPdkA==", "fsize": 1330528, "resto": 69678829}, {"no": 69683671, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:40:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69683663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69683663</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Once you get past the point of being able to do 35 reps with bodyweight you&#039;ll need to add more weight somehow though.

They might have just gotten tired, utilizing all of their stored ATP. If the weight is waaay too light then it is possible that they are not stressing the muscle enough to demand greater muscle recruitment. If you&#039;re doing such light weight it&#039;s possible that the slow twitch muscles are going through a cycle. They are recruited then they are fatigued. They then rest for a short period. After they have recovered (slow twitch fibers recover extremely quickly) they are put back into the rotation of recruitment. As they are performing work, other slow twitch fibers are resting. Then those burn out. The other fibers that have already recovered then are fresh again and return to work. You could Theoretically have such strong and developed muscle fibers that the slow twitch ones just continue to cycle like this without having to recruit fast twitch fibers, especially if the weight is particularly low, which appears to occur around the 35 rep mark. You would still get gains from this, but the gains would only be limited to the slow twitch fibers, which are the fibers that are least susceptible to increases in size and strength.<br><br><a href=\"#p69683690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69683690</a><br>Like this guy says.

If you do them slowly and with 0 momentum you&#039;ll notice that your joints will feel even better. The next step in growing greater muscle and protecting yourself in the long run is to analyze your frequency. For naturals, there appears to be an upward limit in protein synthesis capability, though the limit is unknown. Most people will exercise several times a week thinking that if they don&#039;t exercise all the time then they will lose their gains, but it takes 3 weeks (21 days) of inactivity in order to BEGIN to lose muscle unless you are literally bed-ridden or a limb is immobilized. One study, seemingly the first of its kind, also showed that in untrained subjects, they were continuing to see increases in muscle size and strength for up to 20 days after a single bout of exercise. The MAXIMUM that a natural should be exercising is twice per week but many people could still benefit to a comparable degree from exercising only once per week or even less. Taking 10 days off also resensitizes your body to the activation of P70S6K, which plays a direct role in myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis. Taking 10 days off every 6 weeks will resensitize you. So if you&#039;re having issues with your joints you could always do sessions less often and see the exact same gains or even better depending on where you are in your fitness progression. The bigger you become, the more absolute damage you can do to your muscles and therefore the more time you need to rest. As your ability to do damage can increase by 300%+, your ability to recover only improves slightly (around 50% bonus protein synthesis from untrained to elite), thus necessitating that the more advanced you are the more rest you need and not the other way around, which is generally what bro scientists would recommend.

If you&#039;re feeling intense burn, are getting extremely winded, are getting tired after each rep yet are continually able to keep repping, etc. then you are approaching cardio failure. It&#039;s a sort of false-failure, as your muscles are still capable of producing substantial force given a short rest. If you&#039;re experiencing Cardio failure then you should increase the weight so that you reach muscular failure first or utilize rest-pause to continue to rep if you&#039;re close enough to muscle failure that you can reach it within a few more reps. You&#039;ll know when you&#039;re reaching or are at cardio failure, as you&#039;ll feel like you just ran a marathon and are breathing so hard that you can&#039;t talk at all.<br><br>Cardio failure may occur at first when you start exercising, as your capillaries and mitochondria have not yet developed significantly to keep up with the demand. You will then enter into a progression period where you will not experience it for a long time. After you get significantly large it will start to creep in again (Like once you&#039;re advanced bodybuilder status). At that point there&#039;s nothing much you can do to stop it as your cardiovascular demands in order to simply meet muscle failure even with a very high weight are very high. At that point you&#039;ll need to use various techniques to hit true failure such as rest-pause and drop sets.<br><br><a href=\"#p69684137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69684137</a><br>Gotcha man.

If you&#039;re overweight, no matter what you do you&#039;ll always stink like shit. So you have to be lean. Fat is a storage deposit for literal poisons that your body did not want to or have the capability to process at the time of ingestion. They are stored in fat as an extended release survival mechanism. Lose the fat and that almost 100% of the time fixes bad smell. It&#039;s hard to get out if you have even been fat in the past at any point if you bulked up on bad foods. After that, you&#039;ll have to shower a lot in order to wash out the residual stuff that&#039;s caked into your skin layers. It&#039;ll take time. Once you&#039;re lean, maintain a good diet by getting all of your micros on a daily basis, avoid obvious bad foods like things that have preservatives and other artificial shit in it. Improving testosterone levels also will drastically change your smell. Higher test levels in blind shirt smelling tests have shown greater attractiveness rankings by women test subjects. If you&#039;re sad or depressed that will also drastically affect your smell. They can detect that too and it&#039;s more repulsive than someone that&#039;s just dirty. In short, do everything that you know you need to do in order to be as healthy as possible and also improve mood by being in a good place in life. Sweating a lot sometimes helps as well. Sweat itself does not smell bad if you&#039;re already healthy. Stale sweat smells bad. If you sweat a lot, you will sweat out some of the bad shit that you&#039;re holding onto and your old layer of stale sweat will be refreshed with newer sweat. Much of the smell also comes from bacteria on the surface of the skin, which exists in its own sort of microbiome on the surface. They eat what is in your sweat and then fart out what people perceive to be a bad smell. Washing and then exposing yourself to direct sunlight will get most of it away. Being healthy for a long enough period will alter your skin microbiome. Once you&#039;re healthy, you don&#039;t even need soap.", "time": 1674364181, "resto": 69682002}, {"no": 69683150, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:11:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69683136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69683136</a><br>how am I going to bench 315 if I&#039;m lean?", "time": 1674364309, "resto": 69682002}, {"no": 69683155, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:12:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do colognes have any long term side effects?<br>Surely spraying your body with chemicals can&#039;t be good for you in the long run?", "time": 1674364349, "resto": 69682002}, {"no": 69683241, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:25:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69683155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69683155</a><br>Colognes should be harmless.<br>Just skip anti perspirants.

It\u2019s not just porn and fapping but it\u2019s equally disgusting. I\u2019m addicted to quick instant gratification dopamine rushes. Caffeine, nicotine, food, fapping, porn, weed, etc.<br>It is disgusting. It\u2019s not so much the urge to cum as it is boredom and the above.<br><br><br>For instance, I was once capable of reading an entire book in a day.

What causes food to be stored is insulin. I lost a lot of weight through calorie counting when I was 18. It literally worked based on my total daily energy expenditure what I ate and then the deficit pretty much mapped up with the number of calories and the 3500 for a pound of fat. Much later in life I had like many people put the weight back on. I tried doing the exact same thing and it did not work at all. I had my fasting insulin level tested and it was higher than many people have even after they&#039;ve eaten. So what I found was that fasting didn&#039;t work as quickly in the beginning but after a prolonged period of fasting the fasting insulin came down and I was able to lose weight basically in line with the calories in calories out. Also if you have fat in your liver or pancreas and either prediabetes or diabetes, fasting is much more efficient at taking that fat out than just eating a typical diet but fewer calories. There&#039;s numerous studies where people on fasting diets versus calorie counting diets have the same calorie deficit but the people who are fasting have lower fasting insulin on things like that. It depends what your goals are. Like if you&#039;re healthy what Arnold Schwarzenegger recommends in his book is basically you eliminate carbohydrate until you&#039;re just out of ketosis you don&#039;t want to be in ketosis but you don&#039;t want to eat more carbohydrate than normal.

I think of all the squandered opportunities, the missed connections, and all the things I missed out on in my youth. It\u2019s not so much that I missed out on living my best life in my teens and 20s, it\u2019s that I didn\u2019t take action. That\u2019s the thing that keeps me up at night. I\u2019ve had opportunities for dream jobs literally dropped on my lap, I had girls give me all the signs, I had friends invite me for cool shit\u2014and all I did was stay at home. It\u2019s constant self-sabotage and I\u2019ve made the decision to cut that shit out.<br><br>So I say I\u2019m kinda optimistic, right? I\u2019m actually kind of lucky. I have steady employment with steady bonuses paid quarterly, I have my own place, and I\u2019m in the best shape of my life. Better yet, I\u2019m going on a weeklong vacation to Hawaii with some dudes I met recently. I\u2019ve been more social in the past year than I\u2019ve ever been from my teens into my late 20s. I\u2019m going to have a good time to build up these relationships and I\u2019ll use these good aloha vibes to carry me throughout this year. That\u2019s the thing\u2014I\u2019m jumping at every opportunity to flourish. I\u2019m not repeating the same mistakes I made as a kid. I have no excuse, I don\u2019t give a shit.

First year after it happened, lots of nausea, stomach pain, terrible constipation, things like that. Saw a stomach doctor and got an endoscopy and he just said I &quot;digest food slowly.&quot; That was it. Said nothing more.<br><br>Early last year I found I&#039;m b12 and iron deficient. Went under the radar since I was (((within range.))) Range of like 200-1100 that is. B12 was at 272. And yet they want elderly patients to have a level of like 700 at least, hm, wonder why that is.<br><br>Anyways started with GI issues. Stomach got a little better after a year but then I developed what my (((doctors))) could only say was a &quot;generalized anxiety disorder.&quot; I started having panic attack episodes, but they were entirely physical. Couldn&#039;t breathe, body got tingly and numb, etc. Been to the ER 3 times it was so bad. Once I was pretty convinced I was dying. That was a year and a half ago. <br><br>I begged a new stomach doctor to order me a stool test and lo and behold, a fungal and a bacterial infection. I&#039;m 26 but feel like I&#039;m fucking 90. Sick all the time. Can only hold down a part time job, have no energy for friends, haven&#039;t felt normal in years. I feel like I&#039;ve lost a solid 5 years of my life thanks to this shit.

I\u2019m leaning towards this product called nutrafol which takes a nutrition-based approach to fortifying your hair health by detoxing your body, giving it tonic herbs to deal with stress better, and help provide the nutrients needed for healthy and balanced hair growth.

But first things, allow me to introduce myself.<br>I am anon, aged 20 years old. It has been 6 months since I started training. Throughout my journey I lost around 14kg (30lbs). I was 87kg (191lbs) and now I am around 73kg. I can finally carry my bodyweight using my arms and do pull-ups, long series of push-ups, do around 20-30 km (12-18 miles) per week and getting to a decent shape. Almost lost my moobs and life is going great. Nevertheless, my strength has stagnated over the course of the last period, and I feel I can no longer go beyond my current records. I must say I am a kind of a puritan. What I mean by this is that I refuse to take anabolic steroids and even protein supplements. It may be entirely wrong to think like that. But bear with me.<br><br>On the other hand, I am fine with getting HGH pills. The problem, that they are illegal to take without medical prescription in France. I am 5&#039;10, so finding a doctor that would prescribe for me HGH is impossible. I&#039;d like to know if there are any other way to go round this issue and get them even via, let&#039;s say unorthodox ways. Also, I wonder if there aren&#039;t any kind of drug that would increase my protein absorption from 30% to at least 70%. My diet is consistently made out of lentils, eggs, bananas, chicken, lamb liver, oat, peas, beans, peanuts, everything that a student can get, and alternate between whole bread, pasta, mashed potatoes for carbs. No goyslop (at least no obvious goyslop) since 6 months.

She was in bed all day the next day and then the day after that she couldn\u2019t walk and was puking. She also complained that she get like she needed to take a shit but nothing would come out. Of course for the past 2 days I just figured she was whining about bullshit like usual but after she told me her symptoms I googled them and, lo and behold, all signs point to an appendicitis. So I take her to the hospital. <br><br>While in the ER she is clearly in extreme pain. The NP attending to her, without waning her, does a Markle test. (Look it up on YouTube) In this version, however, the NP picked up her right leg off of the table and, again, without warning, slapped the shit out of the heel of her shoe. <br><br>I watched this happen in real time and I remember it like it happened in slow motion. I\u2019ll never forget it. The energy transfer went up her leg, through her torso, and ended with her eyes growing as big around as dinner plates. She then let out the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard in person. It did not end with just one scream. It continued for what felt like an hour, but was probably only 15 seconds. She screamed so loudly and with such energy, the NP actually sheepishly apologized to her for doing the test. At that point everyone knew that there was a 99% chance that her appendix actually was rupturing. The cat scan confirmed it and if we had waited another day there was a good chance she would have died. <br><br>But damn do I still laugh when I think about the NP doing that test on her. It was like watching a bullet go through a huge square of ballistic gel in slomo. But now I can\u2019t make anymore jokes like \u201cwell maybe it\u2019s your appendix\u201d when she complains about something hurting.", "filename": "41F6EA93-008F-4FCA-B1B9-6799AD1CCFA1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 695, "h": 710, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674364729021610, "time": 1674364729, "md5": "2Dp5dN1GvfOzWLRz1hPkcQ==", "fsize": 101602, "resto": 69674156}, {"no": 69683220, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:22:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69679319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69679319</a><br>This is cope and you need to address it.

I completely cut video games out of my life a week ago and I\u2019ve already had incredible improvements. Was addicted for years. My life is good by most metrics, but I wasted way too much time on pointless video games as a distraction. Only drawback is I used them as a stress reliever so now it\u2019s harder to unwind after a long day, but I\u2019ll figure it out.

I&#039;ve thought about this before, what to use as a stress reliever now that I don&#039;t have video games anymore, and I think the answer comes from some activity that can be easily at home (i.e. no prep work or something time restricted like cooking, you can only cook for so long) and with some long term benefits. I&#039;m going to try to finally commit to learning Japanese, as it seems like an activity that has real benefits, is interesting to myself (and others), and can distract myself from the horrors of the modern world. <br>I think another important distinction to make is that it isn&#039;t just video games that have this addictive property that society ignores, its a lot more than that. Generally anything where the corporation producing it has some incentive to make money from your extended use of their product is addictive, so things like social media (including youtube and 4chan), any store (constantly purchasing shit products from chinese bug warehouses rather than good quality products from good stores), and I&#039;m sure you can think of other examples. Anything that gives short term dopamine through means that are unnatural (i.e. technology) should generally be avoided, as they grant you no long term benefits. Understanding these points is easy, but the actual execution of them is what leaves most of humanity as these useless dregs that consume social media for 90% of their waking life. I think the solution is just having an Iron Will and tanking it out until you just forget about the great pleasure (I write great pleasure, but its more force of habit after a while) that these activities give you.", "time": 1674371975, "resto": 69678788}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 69683533, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)01:14:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I have an IQ of 133 (tested when I was a kid, infact the paper indicating my IQ is yellowish kek)<br><br>But why am I always so anxious?
