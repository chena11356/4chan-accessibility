Realistically you only need maybe a good chefs knife and a paring knife, but I like my cai dao a lot for food prep. Cast iron and stainless steel cookware, wooden cutting board, fresh ingredients, preferably in season and local. Wooden spatulas and spoons. Decent stove with oven. I like microwaves for softening vegetables, but that&#039;s not a must. A large selection of fermented sauces, flavored oils, herbs and spices are a necessity to make it all taste good. <br>For the love of good become at least decent at cooking, it&#039;s not hard and has a massive influence on your health. Plus it&#039;s a socially valuable skill, bonding over food and cooking is something almost all people can do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Room:</span><br>Clean, not overcrowded. I like having to think little, so no clutter and a set of clothes that have style but aren&#039;t hard to combine (meaning most clothes work with most other clothes). Style over fashion, as fashion changes yearly.<br>Plants. At the very least among the window and a few more in the room. Plants make a room look infinitely better, improve air quality and look good.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sports related stuff</span><br>A foam mat, dumbbells, some resistance bands, black roll. A good pair of hiking shoes, two hiking backpacks, one for daytrips (water, food, a first aid kit, lamp, picnic blanket,food containers,cutlery) and one for actual outdoor adventures(I keep that one empty because what I pack depends on where I go). Also fishing equipment.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Literature stuff</span><br>A bookcase with books I enjoyed a lot and may want to read again, mostly the stuff I like showcasing.

I have nice looking bottles for my oils in the kitchen, which I refill when I buy oil. I have glass caraffes for drinks and thermos jugs for tea/coffee. I have ceramic soap dispensers in the bathroom and glass containers for flour, pasta etc in the kitchen.<br>This way you can buy the cheap stuff (as long as its still quality) or the large soap refills, and make it still look and feel premium/quality. Makes your house much more enjoyable.<br><br>Do not have too many empty walls. Not sure what it is, but women don&#039;t like empty walls. Be creative, big pictures are good, something that tells a story is better. I like to go foraging, so I have made my herbarium into a bunch of pictures that I have hung around my room with local edible plants. <br>I also know it&#039;s basic, but having dimmable or &quot;mood&quot; lighting is a good idea. Fairy light chains, LED strips with indirect light, anything to go to half brightness for a comfy feel.<br><br>Lastly make sure to make your home feel nice for guests. A dedicated guest towel in the bathroom? Maybe a bowl with toiletries you &quot;borrowed&quot; from a hotel?

My doctor was so fucking careless and useless he insisted I stay on antibiotics instead of going on accutane. Then I got one appear right between my eyes and it was so big the puss spread into my eye and it swole up so bad it looked like I got punched by Mike Tyson. This was enough for me to get onto a waiting list for a dermatologist here in the UK and I was hoping I would finally get prescribed accutane. This also coincided with me seriously researching steroids and wanted to take a cycle of testosterone, previously the only thing holding me back was my obvious predisposition for acne. So after a while I got my date for the dermatologist, and did in fact decide to hop on test, and I guess my thinking at the time was<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hopefully I&#039;ll get on accutane before any acne sides appear </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if not then it&#039;ll really convince them to put me on accutane</span><br><br>After quite a few weeks in and just before I was due to see the dermatologist, I got acne like I had never had before.

She also took the opportunity to feel up my bicep which was looking juicy from the test. I honestly can&#039;t remember the dosages they had me on, but it was high, especially the last few weeks of it when they gave me a super high &quot;blast&quot; dose, I assume to reduce the chances of my acne returning.<br><br>So needless to say it cleared up my acne well, and I got all the typical sides such as very dry skin and super dry lips. I never experienced much hair loss, maybe a bit of thinning while I was on it, and no negative psychological effects. No boils have ever returned, but I have had some small spots, and also some slightly bigger ones due to my own stupidity, mainly thinking I was literally immune to getting acne now and putting thick oil-like products on my skin. <br><br>But of course as with all drugs there must be a catch, and I have to admit despite it being many many years ago now, I still have very dry skin. The insides of my ears are constantly flakey, my lips get chapped as hell during winter, I get dandruff easily and my scalp is itchy. I can literally rub moisturiser all over my skin and it absorbs so quickly my skin won&#039;t even be moist. I also believe it messed with the oil glands in my eyes, and subsequently gave me blepharitis. <br><br>So to your answer your question yes, there has been lingering sides, but I was also given a very high dose.

You&#039;re doing low-bar squats, and when that weight is pushing down on you then often a novice only thinks they&#039;re doing good-morning squats, while they&#039;re actually doing it right: back rises with the hips, bar stays over mid-foot. If you feel the weight shifting to the balls of your feet, skip this step. You probably are leaning forward.<br>From here, the first option is to ignore the problem. This sounds bad, but for a novice the important thing is doing their primary movements and just accepting failure as it presents itself. Doing the exact movement is of course the best way to get better at the exact movement.<br>But otherwise, you&#039;ve got a few options. Either it&#039;s a quad weakness, or a back weakness. More often than not it&#039;s a quad weakness. If you&#039;re only a couple months in squatting 150lbs front squats are nice. But if you lack the mobility to get into the front squat position or are pushing over 225lbs for your sets, adding another compound can be a bit taxing for when you&#039;re trying to add 5lbs every session. It&#039;s perfectly fine to add in machine quad extensions to keep em progressing alongside your back and hamstrings.

He tries acting like a health expert because he watched occasional lifting videos despite not lifting for like a year, he also did barely any weight out of fear or some shit.

Angus MacAskill was a 7&#039;9&quot; sailor from the 1800s without gigantism who was able to lift anchors. Also look up the big WWE stars feats of strengths. Kane, Big Show, Andre, Hogan, and Undertaker etc. were all able to do things the shorter performers could not due to their, you guessed it, size. The shortest on the list are Taker and Hogan at ~6&#039;7. Andre did not even lift weights and it is claimed he was able to bench about 500 lbs. when he first tried. Kane was able to beat everyone on the roster in legitimate Arm Wrestling backstage. The Big Show also said he felt the safest and most comfortable with 6&#039;9&quot; Kane lifting him. <br><br>To answer OPs question fully it depends on what metric of strength he is asking for. The reason powerlifters cap out shorter than strongmen is that they focus on moving a bar against their body and levers. Strongmen focus on moving their bod and levers against the weight. Something to exemplify this would be 4 foot tall dwarf powerlifters squatting 500-700 lbs. Meanwhile they physically could not compete in something like Sumo or Strongman where the goal is to be the absolute strongest and most skilled. <br><br>The first world heavyweight wrestler in the 1890s-1900s when it was legitimate was a 5&#039;9&quot; 220 lbs. guy. He had a record of something like 3000-2 and invented the Bench Press. &#039;Despite&#039; his height he could dominate nearly any other man. This should go to show that the CNS is what has the biggest impact on strength. Height and weight are just good coefficients to add to it. <br><br>You could also just look at nature to recognize that Elephants are the strongest land animal as they are the biggest land animal. They can thrash rhinos and hippos as if they were carboard. <br><br>So to summarize, there is no ceiling on height adding to strength.

The clue is in the name. Something only becomes a disorder (or indeed any kind of disease) when it produces symptoms which are clinically significant. This means that the symptoms interfere with the normal functioning of the organism. The reason why small tits aren&#039;t an illness is because small tits still function as tits, for example. Whereas if your arm is broken you can&#039;t use it as an arm anymore, and so you are sick. &quot;Normal function&quot; is a value judgement - homosexuality used to be an illness and now it isn&#039;t because what we consider &quot;normal&quot; has changed. This is just as true for physical illnesses too: some deaf people (insane ones, but they do exist) will tell you that being deaf isn&#039;t a disability because they live in a deaf community and communicate with sign language. They legitimately don&#039;t need hearing to communicate and live a &quot;normal&quot; life. Obviously they&#039;re wrong, but articulating why requires engaging more substantively with the concept of normality and doing so shows how even what we consider &quot;healthy&quot; at a physical level is ultimately opinion and not fact.<br><br>Anyway, the point is that for body dysmorphia to BE body dysmorphia it has to interfere with your life in a way that matters.

Correlation =/= causation.<br><br>Gays engage in risky sex more than straights, and that&#039;s why they get hit by the risks more often. The question that needs to be answered then is why do gays engage in risky sex more often? The answer is multifaceted - in some places there is no gay dating scene and the only way to have sex is in venues like bathhouses or nightclubs with strangers, which is obviously going to drive up the risk. Other factors are linked with things like self-esteem - people who feel undesirable are more likely to have risky sex because they&#039;re more likely to feel like they have to take anything that they can get. Anyone can feed undesirable, but gays are particularly prone to it because they usually have trauma in their past related to their sexuality and because beauty standards in the gay community are high and harshly enforced. And so on - there are as many reasons as there are people.<br><br>One response to this risk profile is abstinence: it can be dismissed out of hand, because it never works and never will. When faced with a choice between risk and celibacy everyone takes the risk, gay or straight, every time. <br><br>The point is that none of these things are caused by homosexuality, which is why homosexuality is not a disorder. Office jobs in front of a computer put you at risk for astigmatism but there&#039;s no such thing as &quot;office job disorder&quot; - because the problem is not the office job, it&#039;s staring at a close object for an extended period of time which causes the muscles that focus your eyeball to get lazy. If you don&#039;t name the problem accurately and specifically you will never be able to fix it.
