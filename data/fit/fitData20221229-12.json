Sucked me off everywhere we couldnt fuck or couldn&#039;t strip down (she had a thing about being completely naked during sex, which only amplified her perfect body). The day she took my virginity, we cut school and stayed at her house since her mom was working in another state for 3 days, and left her home alone. We fucked all day for 3 days straight. First day I came 9 times, 2 and 3rd day only 5, but was fuckin all day and all night basically.

In other words, you need to:<br>- be as good looking as you can be (be jacked, dress well, smell well yada yada also go talk to /fa/<br>- have enough money to afford some luxuries (aka not only being able to live comfortably, but also being able to buy some luxury shit without having to get a loan or having it put a strain on your budget.)<br>- have enough experience with women that they stop being special (which is why I recommended &quot;banging women overseas&quot;. Start with paid professionals and then try your hand with the free ones).<br>You need to get to the point where you&#039;re busy, you have a full life, and women can only tag along if you allow them and if they&#039;re not too much of an annoyance to you.

I just follow the browny recipe from Tasty and replace as much as I can with low/no-kcal versions.

eat?</span><br>Mostly fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, which provide a great source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It also includes moderate amounts of fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, yogurt, and olive oil, which are all excellent sources of protein and healthy fats. The MD includes very little processed or red meat, making it ideal for those looking to cut back on unhealthy fats, and also avoids added sugars, refined grains, and processed foods.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s wrong with unhealthy fats?</span><br>Eating unhealthy fats can be extremely detrimental to your health. Trans fats, saturated fats, and hydrogenated fats all increase your risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Eating too much of these fats can lead to high cholesterol levels, which can put you at an even higher risk of heart disease. Additionally, unhealthy fats can increase your risk of T2 diabetes and obesity. It&#039;s important to stay away from these fats and instead focus on eating healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Doing so can help you stay fit and healthy while also reducing your risk of various diseases.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What to snack on?</span><br>Some great snacks to enjoy include fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, hummus, hard-boiled eggs, olives, Greek yogurt, and whole grain crackers. All of these snacks are packed with essential nutrients and can help to keep you energized and full throughout the day.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do I start the MD?</span><br>In addition to eating healthy, it is important to engage in physical activity and get adequate sleep every night.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What meats can I eat on the MD?</span><br>Make sure to get lean cuts of poultry, such as chicken and turkey, and a good variety of fish and seafood in your diet. Don&#039;t forget eggs, dairy, and even a moderate amount of red meat like beef, pork, or lamb. But don&#039;t go overboard; limit your red meat to just a few times a month. Focus on lean proteins like fish and seafood, poultry, eggs, and legumes, and you&#039;ll be shredded in no time!<br>Last thread: <a href=\"/fit/thread/69398407#p69398407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69398407</a>", "filename": "1672316349194", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 140, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672316367593496, "time": 1672316367, "md5": "U4ayBO0XRbH3jFJia6aElg==", "fsize": 353046, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "mediterranean-diet-general-2", "replies": 1, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 69402697, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)07:21:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69402685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69402685</a><br>I just updated the thread with info on the types of meats you can eat on the Mediterranean diet.

homemade cake with strawberry frosting for her birthday, during which we both enjoy the cake with some cheap Moscato from Kroger.

When I&#039;ve finished snacking on her toe, I&#039;d take her by the hand and lead her into the bedroom with the strawberry frosting in my other hand, where I&#039;d gently whip her around me so I&#039;m holding her from behind. Gently, I would kiss her neck and earlobe for a few minutes to warm her up, followed by assertively pushing her onto the bed face-down. After removing whatever underwear she may or may not be wearing, I&#039;d kiss and lick up the back of her legs, starting from behind her knees all the way up to her anus. Then, I&#039;d use two fingers to scoop a generous glob of strawberry frosting from the tub, whisper to her a promise that she&#039;s going to love this, then slowly start working it up inside of her butthole with my fingers. When the first glob is mostly packed inside her butthole, I&#039;d go back for a second glob and take my sweet time repeating the process. Finally, I&#039;d grab her wrists so as to keep her pinned down while I bury my tongue tonsil-deep into her butthole, insisting that she push the strawberry frosting out of her anus and into my mouth while I swallow as much of it as I can. This will eventually lead to her up on her knees, bucking her hips against my face while I continue servicing her asshole well after the frosting inside her is gone and she&#039;s on her way to her third...no, fourth orgasm.", "time": 1672295760, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401007, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:41:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400973</a><br><br>If /fit/ is sleep, strawberry frosting rimjob anon is its sleep paralysis demon.", "time": 1672296076, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401010, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:42:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69401007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69401007</a><br>Thank you, anon.", "time": 1672296137, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401230, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:28:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400942</a><br>Tanned girls in egyptian outfits is my fucking jam", "filename": "1667169121556612", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 735, "h": 453, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 77, "tim": 1672298928807546, "time": 1672298928, "md5": "SxUPBo39FSGMcJfmmAetZw==", "fsize": 23929, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401277, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:39:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400942</a><br>That&#039;s a man.", "time": 1672299592, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401303, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:49:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400942</a><br>Tanned men in egyptian outfits is my fucking jam", "filename": "1667419694287959", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 319, "h": 298, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1672300187381114, "time": 1672300187, "md5": "UNJ1UHCq0/7yH3CfD/6KUg==", "fsize": 12017, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401341, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:57:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400973</a>", "filename": "1640402965096", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 392, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1672300670979137, "time": 1672300670, "md5": "h1d6/UJ3Y01VwnBHWEzscA==", "fsize": 78410, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401351, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:01:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400942</a><br>clean up your flat, slut.", "time": 1672300871, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401705, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:12:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400942</a><br>Sauce now!!", "time": 1672305160, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401736, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:18:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400942</a><br>MUST COLONIZE", "time": 1672305489, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401910, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:52:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400953</a><br>same here bro", "time": 1672307567, "resto": 69400942}, {"no": 69401968, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:05:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69400942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69400942</a><br>Can someone tell me how they young girls are getting these sharp upturned noses?

Or will I be forced to double my feed for a few months in order to re-gain the fat needed to burn in the future to maintain my lifts?<br>Also what should I be watching out for if my body starts to wither away?

The entire process of a cow eating grass and digesting it in multiple stomachs extracts nutrients and turns them into forms that can be used by their bodies and stored in their meat, fat, and organs, which can then in turn be used by monogastric omnivores such as humans by eating that meat, fat, and organs. There are a few problems when it comes to lab-grown meat:<br><br>1. Obtaining these highly bioavailable forms of micronutrients without the use of animals. In many cases this is not even possible, there are supplements whose most bioavailable forms are simply sourced from animal products and then put into pills. If we can only use plant-derived versions of all these micronutrients they won&#039;t be any more bioavailable than they would be from eating plants, meaning far less efficient and far less effective nutrition than real meat.<br><br>2. Getting the right amounts and ratios of nutrients into the lab-grown meat. There are still disputes over exactly what nutrients are found in various meats and in what amounts; there are some studies which say ruminant muscle meat contains vitamin C and there are some studies that say it doesn&#039;t contain any vitamin C. So what nutrients do we add, what amounts, what ratios? It would have to be calibrated like a stack of supplements, and coupling that with all the nutrients being synthetic or plant-derived will make this a nightmare.<br><br>3. We don&#039;t even know if we know about every nutrient that exists in meat. Phytonutrients in plants were only discovered a couple decades ago and their possible positive effects have been studied for an even shorter amount of time. How do we know we know everything about the nutrient content of meat?

The requirements for those rewards are pretty easy to clear, so I basically get back 10\u20ac/month passively.<br><br>The good about the Mi band 7:<br>- heart monitoring is pretty accurate, which gives me a rough idea about my cardio health. I compared it to actual medical equipment with my doctor and it was off by barely anything (like 1-2%)<br>- step counter is nice to have, but really nothing important, a phone could do that too<br>- The battery is amazing.

This means I rarely have to recharge the thing.<br>- waterproof<br>- cheap<br>- intutive sports tracking<br>- nice features, like finding your phone and a mini flashlight<br>- Ironically the biggest quality of life upgrade isn&#039;t fitness related: It syncs with my phone for push notifications, so I get alerted when I get messages or emails. With quick reply I can even reply from the band. So now I can always look if the message I got was important and possibly respond, no matter the situation and without getting my phone out. <br>The bad:<br>- The default band isn&#039;t all that great. It works, but isn&#039;t stepless (still the steps are close enough to barely matter), but most importantly it doesn&#039;t breathe, so dirt, sweat and dead skin accumulates under it quicker. IF you get one, absolutely get a better strap<br>- Not the biggest fan of the design. It looks okay, but nothing special either. Would have preferred a sort of analog watch design more I think. I&#039;ve grown fond of it over time though<br>- you are supposed to place it one fingers width away from your wrist. That&#039;s just barely too high to easily look at it with long sleeves.

I don&#039;t know how it works, but it makes me wake up much more relaxed and less tired. <br>As for the sports monitoring, the cardiovascular tracking is really nice to have and seeing improvements is fun. For lifting it&#039;s less ideal, but still a neat little datapoint to consider. <br>Another negative is that due to the position of the band on your arm, you can&#039;t really wear it with a normal watch, which is a bit sad because I like my analog watches, but it&#039;s fine.<br>Last negative is that the sports tracking modes overestimate caloric spending, but I have never seen any fitness tracker (other than proper measurements at a doctor) that didn&#039;t, so just keep in mind those numbers are inflated.<br><br>Before i got it, I didn&#039;t think I needed a tracker at all, now that I have one I really enjoy it.

So you can easily be in a situation where you&#039;re hitting maintenance levels at 2,000 calories but feel like you&#039;re perpetually starving.
