I dropped about 65 pounds with this boards help, going from 215 to 150 (6ft m), in around 2020 thourgh a mixture of dieting and fasting, and I started working out afterwards. I got a decent amount of equipment and made a home gym in my basement, and it was pretty good for a while. But then eventually I just kinda...stopped? I don&#039;t know why, it wasn&#039;t a concious thing, I just didn&#039;t do it anymore. A lot of times since then I&#039;ve gone back and worked out for a few weeks or a month or two, but then I&#039;ll stop, and it&#039;ll repeat. In 2021 and 2022 I probably worked out maybe 6 months out of the time. <br>That being said I live a pretty active lifestlye. I was maybe 2-5 miles a day, play volleyball and other shit, and over the summer work a landscaping job, plus my eating habits have entirly shifted away from junkfood or most processed things. I&#039;m 157 now and still in good shape, but I havn&#039;t made it, and I won&#039;t make it like this. Its like I got half way there and just stopped.<br>I have no fucking idea what to do. Every time I start again I work out for a few weeks and just lose the habit. I want to improve and do better but then I just dont. And I sure as hell ain&#039;t giving up, I still have a lotta potential to reach, but I&#039;m lost on what to do and how to actually achieve what I know I&#039;m capable of. I cant point to any one thing that the issue, or whats wrong with me, but I know I need to do something different. <br>So, anon, what do you think I should do? What advice can you give. I try talking to my friends about this but most of what they say is just &quot;accept yourself&quot; which is fuck all helpful.
