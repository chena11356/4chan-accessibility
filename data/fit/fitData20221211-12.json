You all have worth and value. We all keep expecting to be something and become somebody. And it never feels right. Those goals don&#039;t get met. It leads to depression, rejection, stress, and sadly suicide. So why do we keep trying to be someone, when you&#039;re already you? It&#039;s vital to stop trying to be something that&#039;s loved and start loving yourselves. If you met yourself, wouldn&#039;t you get along? You love the same things. Have the same sense of humor. Have the same upbringing and outlook. You have a heart. You&#039;re not bad people at all. So stop trying to be something you&#039;re not and love the person you are. If you need guidance, follow the things you love. It may not lead to riches and things, but you love this stuff for a reason because it&#039;s simply part of you and uplifts you. That&#039;s a life, living in what you love. And I truly believe love is a little peek into heaven and God. And following what you love is your destiny. It&#039;s why it&#039;s in you to begin with. So don&#039;t give up and be who you truly are.

I&#039;m pretty lazy when it comes to cardio, I tend to go long periods without doing any at all besides a short warm-up on the rowing machine. During the periods where I actually do cardio (mostly boxing/muay thai) the difference it makes to my performance and appearance is insane. Fat just disappears and I feel like I have more energy all the time. <br><br><a href=\"#p69222418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69222418</a><br>Makes sense but is also quite speculative imo, toleration of prostitution also relies on johns separating their lusts from their normal interactions with society and respectable women, and also society itself actually having notions of respectability in the first place, i.e. separating prostitutes from respectable women. This approach would probably work better in places like Saudi Arabia where men are horny but women are expected to be chaste, versus the West where women are &#039;liberated&#039; and casual sex, porn, Onlyfans etc are more acceptable.", "filename": "1504791794643", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 559, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1670755284785763, "time": 1670755284, "md5": "61XDymhV7CYdJddpaehj7A==", "fsize": 533662, "resto": 69221702}, {"no": 69222622, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69222613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69222613</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but is also quite speculative</span><br>Just look at societies where prostitution is illegal:<br><a href=\"#p69222583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69222583</a>", "time": 1670755381, "resto": 69221702}, {"no": 69222627, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:43:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69222521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69222521</a><br>Broccoli is tasty though, what are you on about.", "time": 1670755437, "resto": 69221702}, {"no": 69222744, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)06:05:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69222622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69222622</a><br>Prostitution is legal in lots of countries that are just as degenerate and sex-obsessed as USA though, thats the point I was making. And it&#039;s not a question of legality either, but toleration - prostitution is essentially decriminalised in most of the West - it&#039;s not against the law to be a prostitute in Sweden, but it&#039;s illegal to buy sex or run a brothel - this is to protect the women that do it from harm and gives rise to independent &#039;escorts&#039; who spend time with men for money, and if they happen to have sex during that time then that&#039;s just two consenting adults having sex. Prostitution is fully legal in places like Germany and Netherlands, those societies aren&#039;t any more functional than Sweden or the USA. My point is that, in places where sex isn&#039;t seen as a big deal, prostitution probably isn&#039;t really a necessary evil and might just add to the societal decline, whereas in places where sex is seen as shameful and all the men are raised from birth to be incels (see Middle East, India Pakistan etc) it would probably be more beneficial because it&#039;s their only outlet besides rape", "filename": "1504886265771", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 945, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670756737473795, "time": 1670756737, "md5": "8hQPoA1YmhDYwbM/UBsCAg==", "fsize": 117076, "resto": 69221702}], "last_modified": 1670756737}, {"no": 69221802, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)02:55:00", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/fit/", "com": "Why are some men alpha and some men beta?
