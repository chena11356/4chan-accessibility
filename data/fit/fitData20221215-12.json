Simply put, I like a wide variety of exercise and machine work, I only use the barbell for the bare necessities (bench, squat, Romanian deadlift) and since I go to the gym at the very least 4 times a week and gets me out of my small apartment, the ROI is good. That monthly fee is really not that much to pay for the activity itself.<br><br>And lastly I don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;m absolutely never as hype and motivated to workout at home, no matter the circumstances.

It\u2019s true that most people will work jobs that they hate and be as good as slaves, but it\u2019s also true that someone who refuses to work towards what they find meaningful is just as sad as the wageslaves. If you align your life around meaningful work, money will come as well as fulfillment. But men that think they\u2019re beating the system by not working towards anything and choose to spend their time with meaningless distractions are doomed to a life of nothingness, a childish life of pathetic and unfulfilling nothingness that is truly sadder than even the most drone-like working man.", "time": 1671041465, "resto": 69253051}, {"no": 69257164, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:17:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69257093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69257093</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A man\u2019s purpose is where he finds his meaning</span><br>nothing precludes neets from having that", "filename": "328490713907490", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1249, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671041867268019, "time": 1671041867, "md5": "uQTM8PgLC1vjG4qOupfJHw==", "fsize": 314242, "resto": 69253051}, {"no": 69257199, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:21:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69253359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69253359</a><br>mad wagie, no forget to get up early tomorrow to go back to cagie!", "time": 1671042079, "resto": 69253051}, {"no": 69257240, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:25:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69253051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69253051</a><br>Wow that&#039;s interesting, what does your girlfriend think about you being unemployed forever?", "time": 1671042300, "resto": 69253051}, {"no": 69257270, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:27:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69257240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69257240</a><br>She&#039;s concerned.

I was reluctant to change, as this system had given me gains in the past. I continued to use a lot of the principles of Westside, but had a lot of injuries. I also was very inconsistent because I was rarely performing the competition lifts. After a string of injuries and bomb outs, I took some time away from powerlifting. After moving to the Washington, DC area, I met Carlos Osegueda that runs Central Virginia Athletic and Barbell Club. He had been training with the Block Periodization system and making progress. At this time, I decided to research by reading Issurin\u2019s Block Periodization: A Breakthrough in Sports Training and Principles and Basics of Advanced Athletic Training. These books gave me a better understanding and for the next year, I used trial and error along with the knowledge I gained to fine tune the programming to fit my needs. Using this system, I set a 190-pound total PR and gained my first Elite at 242.</span>", "time": 1671043223, "resto": 69249860}, {"no": 69257406, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:42:01", "name": "Big Rick", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;69257272</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;69257131</span><br>See ya in three day, newfag!", "time": 1671043321, "resto": 69249860}, {"no": 69257529, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)13:54:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Cold, poor and sleep deprived, but at least lifting is going well!<br><br>Wife veto&#039;d me running on ice at night with no spikes, so ended up going into work and using the gym there.

Struck out horribly alot, but i didnt let that stop me. I started fixing my autism through sheer volume of interactions with women, and slowly realized that in the end, personality is fixable and that all my failures in the past were due to solely my bitterness and anger at my powerlessness.

In a real world fight, everything is going to happen in less than 10 seconds. In all likelihood, the only thing your opponent knows how to do is throw a few wild haymakers at your head and hope he knocks you out before he runs out of gas. If you can get him on the ground and control his arms, he&#039;s probably going to be helpless. This video is a good example. Black kid is tough shit when he&#039;s throwing punches, but helpless as a toddler as soon as the white guy grabs him and he can&#039;t throw no more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGI<wbr>VCD8lBH0<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For 1 vs. a group encounters: </span><br>#1 is knowing how to run the fuck away as fast as you can. <br>#2 if you can&#039;t run, is probably just boxing. If you go to the ground against multiple opponents, then you are basically dead. You have to stay on your feet, stick and move as much as possible, be explosive and overwhelming, and try to end it as quick as possible. The guy in this video is probably the perfect example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rA<wbr>3M9i74lY", "time": 1671063453, "resto": 69256244}, {"no": 69260875, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:24:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69256409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69256409</a><br>Throwing leg kicks in a MMA fight is fine, because most opponents are going to just check it and respect your counter punch, because they&#039;re fighting for multiple rounds and not just going all in every attack. <br><br>But throwing leg kicks in a street fight is just damn stupid.

(Natural female priority.) As the economies shrunk, the turmoil of decolonization and the second wave feminist movement took over, this push for equality became a push for special interests and it&#039;s in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s that we start seeing the career woman trope get pushed as the ideal and not the exception among women. The whole you can have it all thing, coupled with the loss of industrial based jobs due to improved mechanisation and Chinese/3rd world production crippled the semi-skilled work force, and this along with educational pushes to get more women into education/career women is what has devolved us into the shit show we are at today. <br>The irony of it all is that women have always been the consumers, even in my great grandfathers generation, men earned, women spent.

All they need is time under tension or in other words: 10-20 &quot;hard&quot; sets that are close enough to failure. Now I started lifting focusing on the classic compounds and developing my connection with the muscles but these days I just do 1-2 compounds or compound variants for a muscle or muscle group and then some isolations. Some examples: for shoulders I do 4 hard sets of seated DB OHP (rep range anywhere from 6 to 15), some drop set shenanigan lateral raises because they give me a sick pump and 3 to 4 sets of rear delt flys. One big compound, two isolations, 11 or so hard sets total. For legs I do squats, then leg press and then whatever &quot;small&quot; exercise I feel like. If I dont feel like squatting I say fuck it and just go really hard on leg press and vice versa.<br>Chest is a good example because I do some benching, sometimes flat bb bench, sometimes incline db bench, whatever I feel like. It only matters that its hard enough and gives you a sick pump. Round it off with two more exercises that are more Isolation types. <br>Idk how to explain but yeah.
