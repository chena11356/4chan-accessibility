Every great powerlifter/bodybuilder/strongman probably has more injuries than he/she can fit on a single page of paper.<br><br>That said, there&#039;s a risk reward ratio that you need to determine for yourself. You can significantly lower the risks by learning good form and technique, doing the proper prehab and rehab movements to build small muscles (for shoulder this is the rotator cuff muscles), and by checking your ego at the door and lifting intelligently. This can allow you to lift more safely for longer and lift heavier. If you want to lift super heavy, there&#039;s risk, but for me also a great reward.<br><br>So yeah, OHP is a dangerous movement, but there are many ways to make it safer that aren&#039;t simply &quot;don&#039;t do it&quot;.

They will be so focused on getting a gf without asking what they actually want out of a gf or how much they&#039;re willing to put up with one. Some people are perfectly fine with that, and more power to them, but one thing you should keep in mind is that every relationship you will ever be in will end in either breakup or death.

One of the things that makes alcohol so unique as a drug is the quantity you need to consume to get high from it. No other drug even comes close, most drugs can get you extremely intoxicated with only a few grams, whereas you could drink several ounces of alcohol easily. As a result, it damages just about every part of your body, muscles, bones, brain, kidneys, pancreas, liver, teeth, heart, veins, nerves everything is affected by it and none of it is good. If you drink once a month or something, or maybe just on the holidays, your body will recover, just like it would recover from anything else. But if you drink too much too often (there is a medical definition of heavy alcohol use which I think is like 10+ &quot;drinks&quot; a week), it will do serious damage over time and there can be no doubt that it will negatively affect your health and physical fitness.

Your forearms are hurting because they are not used to the training and they are the weak link. You can take some weight off and do higher rep sets as that tends to do the trick. Then after that its just wait for your forearms to adapt and catch up and you&#039;ll be able to go down in rep range again. People also often get this kind of pain when doing pull ups, solution is doing them banded. Other pulling work can also contribute to the forearm fatigue so for example curls, rows. This might be a overall forearm volume issue and not specific to the exercise meaning that if you did no other pulling movements your forearms wouldn&#039;t feel like this on this exercise, or it might be exercise specific. It don&#039;t matter because the solution is the same. <br><br><a href=\"#p69602844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69602844</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Guess this is just my body trying cope with this new stimulus?</span><br>Yes.
