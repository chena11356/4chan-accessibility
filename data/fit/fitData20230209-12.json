That\u2019s not pure leisure time either, you\u2019ve still got to do stuff like cook and eat your own dinner, shower, handle life admin (which goes through the roof once you have children). Weekends? Gone. Those are spent in playgrounds, visiting family, or at birthday parties. So many birthday parties. In amongst all that you still need to find some time to maintain a functioning adult relationship with the mother of your children, so that you don\u2019t turn into miserable automata who just see each other as colleagues, and wind up fucking your children up by getting divorced. Exercise just gets squeezed out by all the other much more pressing demands on your time, unless you really prioritise it.

Ironically, it is easiest to do this once you engage in sex/romance because the realities of it will wake you up to how you romanticize it.

Start with routine interactions with cashiers, then try asking an employee questions about a product, and work your way up until you&#039;re forcing yourself to attempt conversations with strangers about whatever random thing around you that you have an opinion on. Then take those skills and simply talk to women with no sexual or romantic intentions. After that, you just need to wait for a girl to express interest (you will learn to pick up on it) and ask her out.
