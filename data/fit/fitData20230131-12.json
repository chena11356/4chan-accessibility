Soi, rapeseed (AKA canola), cottonseed, or any other plant seed based oil is similarly processed. Widespread adoption of seed oils in the 20th century coincides with the rise of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity and the highly processed goyslop that is universally agreed to be terrible for health (eg: fried fast food, packaged snack cakes, frozen pastas/pizzas) universally contains seed oils. Anyone shilling for this trash is the modern day equivalent of the doctors that used to endorse cigarette brands.<br><br>Olive oil is much higher in omega 3 fatty acids.

It would at least be a starting point to get a decent $20/hr so I can then start trade school learn electrician shit and get a job doing that and once done with school be making like $50k starting, with potential for six figs with enough time.

American city architecture forcing everyone to drive to get anything done at all is the reason their cities are so shit. Yes, have a car, drive it to get places when you need to, but every time someone doesnt drive one, theyre not contributing to the dogshit air quality, high level of noise, and traffic congestion that make living in cities so bad. And as for cyclists obstructing traffic or whatever, if 75% of space is reserved for cars with fuckhuge parking lots and roads everywhere, just give the bikers 5%. Adding another lane doesnt noticeably reduce congestion anyway due to induced demand, whereas every person choosing to use a bike instead actually does. Also, the concept of suburbs and american city planning in general is garbage and QoL in a city does not have to be that bad. Its better than raising children in some crime ridden city center, but its still terrible because due to the terrible intentional design decisions, they are prevented from going anywhere or doing anything without a car, and driving a bike along the large roads connecting suburbs to everything else is hilariously dangerous.<br>I understand that americans dont comprehend that it doesnt have to be like that because its all they know, and I understand that cyclists can be annoying if they disregard their own safety and do stupid shit.

Based on your beard growth.. you &#039;likely&#039; have higher levels on DHT or androgen receptors. This androgen (DHT) is &#039;mostly&#039; responsible for androgenic alopecia (hair loss) as it is way more androgenic that e.g testosterone (though extremely high test can cause AA too).<br><br>2. Lifting increases hormone levels (DHT) and inflammation in the body.<br><br>3. Increase in hair loss<br><br><br>Solution:<br><br>Start finasteride (1mg), minoxidil (5%) and nizoral shampoo (2%). Shave your head and start this ALL at once. <br><br>Why shave your head? You will experience shedding in the beginning and this will make you to not obsess about your hair (very important). Moreover, you will see if you look good bald.<br><br>Why all at once? You lost your hair recently. Thus, you have high chance of regrowth. Furthermore, both fin and min can induce shedding and it&#039;s better to get it done at the same time. <br><br>Is finasteride dangerous? Not really. Five of my friends are on it and our dicks didn&#039;t fall off. My libido didn&#039;t change at all. The likelihood of you getting side effects is under 5% (2-3% in literature). The likelihood of &#039;permanent&#039; side effects is the likelihood of dying from aspirin. The &quot;permanent&quot; side effects can be fixed anyway by injecting hormones. Don&#039;t get scared from fat.. hormone starved.. genetic subhumans online.

Perhaps, in the grand scheme? Lol no. So far the societies these people have control over are rapidly deteriorating dumpster fires with no sign of future viability. If they can&#039;t find a way to make it all work and perpetuate itself, it won&#039;t exist for very long. I&#039;d be much more worried if feminists etc. were in change AND they showed the initiative to actually run with the ball or the capacity for actually building competitive societies. <br><br>Getting in power is like step i. Actually having success in that position and building something worthwhile, or even self perpetuating at the least, is the core of the whole endeavor. I see no sign of it from anyone today tbqh. I&#039;m doubtful the Chinese can make it work but I&#039;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they have the capacity. Slavs can&#039;t seem to put their dysfunction behind them to save their lives despite all the opportunities in the wold. The west is currently hopeless although still capable of riding on past success for now. I look around and see no one who has their act together.<br><br>With the west in decline there are huge opportunities out there for others- but they can&#039;t seem to capitalize. For me the take-away is that maybe it is much much harder to make a modern society work- even at a basic level- than people assume. Alot of people assume whoever is next in line will inherit the earth but I think the bar is actually pretty high. The west made it look so easy from like 1700 till now, so I see why people feel this way but it&#039;s starting to look to me like no one is up to the task right now. Like women and minorities found a spaceship and are fantasizing about flying through the cosmos but no one stopped to consider that apparently none of them can figure out how to fly the goddam thing.", "time": 1675100373, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69781828, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)12:44:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No wonders the gods burned Gullveig.", "time": 1675100659, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69781834, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)12:45:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69777733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69777733</a><br>Gotta start wearing this to the gym", "filename": "thot proof", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 693, "h": 665, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1675100714660756, "time": 1675100714, "md5": "Q3YL6p2lj1qVP+NpOVoEsg==", "fsize": 39720, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69781887, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)12:51:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69777838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69777838</a><br>It&#039;s always jewish cunts or jewish glowniggers, ever time.", "time": 1675101080, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782023, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:06:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69778265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69778265</a><br>You have to go back.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/plebbit/", "time": 1675102004, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782054, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:09:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69777821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69777821</a><br><a href=\"#p69778532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69778532</a><br>2 more clowns who cant tell some /fit/tard photoshopped it", "time": 1675102169, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782059, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:09:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69781507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69781507</a><br>based renaissance man", "time": 1675102195, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782099, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:13:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69778221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69778221</a><br>But thats ok because this is about THEM", "time": 1675102396, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782131, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:16:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69777806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69777806</a><br>Imagine her tying you up and threatening to cut your dick off<br>Haha that&#039;d be weird...", "time": 1675102598, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782134, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:16:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69782054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69782054</a><br>did you see the video? she did say that", "time": 1675102604, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782178, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:20:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69777733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69777733</a><br>Why is it always ugly women who think they&#039;re hot shit?", "time": 1675102805, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782207, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:24:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69782178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69782178</a><br>is she really that ugly? are my standards really that low?", "time": 1675103068, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782217, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:25:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69778634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69778634</a><br>This is her writing<br><a href=\"#p69778521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69778521</a><br>This is her paying someone to write on her behalf", "time": 1675103118, "resto": 69777733}, {"no": 69782273, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)13:31:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69782178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69782178</a><br>Feedback loop.

There are many who believe that the oxytocin released during sex with someone you love counteracts the harmful effects of dopamine and prolactin release in the brain that comes with any orgasm. It should also be obvious, but if you&#039;re single, you will be burning absolute holes in women&#039;s skulls with your eye-contact, and your newfound masculinity makes it virtually inevitable that a woman will service your parts at some point. Whether you want to hunt for PAWGs, or fully retain your nut is up to you.

Now you do get more upper traps on lu raises but no one is failing on lu raises from weak upper traps so that&#039;s entirely irrelevant.

You can also do band pullaparts superset with band dislocations. I like 3 sets of these with very little rest, it only takes like 2 minutes to get done. Beyond this you&#039;ll probably have to figure out what muscle is limiting your shoulder mobility (for me it&#039;s lats, very obvious because my left lat is tighter than my right lat while my left shoulder has less mobility than my right shoulder, probably because I&#039;m right handed so I reach with my right arm more) and work on stretching it.<br><br>For external rotation, I do them on lower body days personally but really they can go almost anywhere.
