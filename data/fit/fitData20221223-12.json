Braising meats (such as beef short ribs/chuck roasts) - you want to consume the collagen in the meat, now turned gelatin, which provides you with fantastic flavour and additional easily digestible protein, as well as helping your GI tract heal from irritation/inflammation. Make sure to drink the braising liquid or reuse for another dish. Can also be done with a slowcooker.<br>4. Ginger (either fresh slices for your tea or cooking)<br>5. Lemons/Limes - do not underestimate the role of vitamin C is collagen synthesis<br>6. Kiwi - one of the most nutrition fruits per pound there is, and vitamin K source<br>7. Banana - banana :)<br>8. Blueberries<br>9. Spices (not spicy) - look up the micros in things like cumin/cinnamon/turmeric/etc, the east knows what they&#039;re doing.

The caption read \u201cI am back home (for the holidays) and it\u2019s just so beautiful. I can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Her facial expression in the photo was utterly pathetic. She could have been *the* most beautiful woman in the world yet that expression would still be so off-putting. Something about the post as a whole \u2014 it was one of the most cringe performances I have ever seen on social media and that\u2019s saying something. I unfollowed her immediately. It was an impulse so strong that I experienced it more like an order than an emotion. I had a funny feeling she would delete the photo so I checked several hours later. Sure enough \u2014 it was gone. Upon reflection, I realized that was a perfect example of how personality and self-expression matter perhaps more than anything else. It didn\u2019t matter that we go way back, that she is beautiful, that I might have a chance if I bothered to try \u2014 fuck all of that. My point being: if you are treated like trash and what you say about yourself otherwise is true then, in all likelihood, your personality turns people off.

After you grab the bar, lock in your lats. It should feel like you&#039;re forcing your shoulders down, not back, but also not forward. I&#039;m also not seeing an obvious brace. From newbies especially I want to see a cartoonish, open mouth deep breath before the pull. Ideally you&#039;d do like 1k does where you take that breath before taking your grip but that requires a better muscle memory for your setup than you have yet. Instead, once you get the bar and your feet set and you know where your hips need to be at the pull, keep your hands on the bar but do whatever you need to do to make room for a big breath. /smg/ raises his hips to do that for example. Then you want to bring all that muscle and air tension and wedge it between the bar and the floor by driving the hips in.

I got really lucky, I can walk, I can lift things (though nothing too heavy) and I can get up from the floor (albeit with access to a wall or something to pull myself up).<br>As a result of my disability while growing up I spent a lot of time in various medical facilities and met other children with other disabilities. These ranged from kids with progressing degenerative muscle deseases, over mental impairments to your average wheelchair bound kid. Some had diseases that progressed, some didn&#039;t. Those who had diseases that progressed usually had a few years left to live, though those last 2 years I&#039;d hardly call &quot;living&quot;, it&#039;s essentially waiting in a hospital bed until your lungs or heart give out.<br>You know what all those kids had in common?<br>I never met one who was bitter about their situation. They were sad, or frustrated at times, but never bitter. They all had dreams and aspirations as any other kid would.<br>One wheelchair bound kid I was friends with for a few weeks in a facility could barely stand outside his wheelchair, but to him the important part was that he could somewhat stand, sometimes even take a few steps. So, for the short time I knew him, he tried every day. A good third of the times he&#039;d collapse, pull himself up into the wheelchair on his arms and try again.<br>These kids taught me a lot, and while I was blessed to be able to live a relatively normal life (as in I don&#039;t need a caretaker), I never quite forgot them when I am lazy or can&#039;t get the motivation to do sports.<br><br>Because how could I in good concience waste a gift that I have that these kids dream their entire life of experiencing?<br>How could I look into their eyes and tell the kid who fights daily just to be able to stand that I, who can walk up stairs, can&#039;t be bothered to exercise today because I am lazy?<br>I couldn&#039;t. And so I don&#039;t.", "time": 1671586784, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323947, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:40:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323916</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hassan</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;69323927</span><br>Shut the fuck up you ur u a gay", "filename": "1659691947005285.web", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 1040, "tn_w": 76, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671586825041628, "time": 1671586825, "md5": "nSak4SC7stXdVONEiaWAWQ==", "fsize": 1352500, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323960, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:41:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323811</a><br>I really want to fuck a younger woman I used to have a huge milf fetish<br>Only until fucking my ex a 31 year old almost about to hit the wall roastie<br>It felt like I was fucking granny", "time": 1671586905, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323967, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:42:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323941</a><br>This made me emotional<br>I hope you achieve your goals brother", "time": 1671586966, "resto": 69323811}, {"no": 69323981, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)20:43:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69323941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69323941</a><br>I once was in love with a girl who suffered from cystic fibrosis.

I started in January 2020 and he would always go the same time as me, we never spoke, but there was always this tension between us. I think it started because one day I was squatting in the power rack and my gf was squatting in the only other power rack beside me. I&#039;m significantly taller than her so sharing a rack wasn&#039;t an option for us. He seemed so visibily pissed off at us, me in particular, I could see in the mirror he kept looking at me, but he never said anything. I ignored him. He did the leg Press which was right behind the power racks and kept looking at us. It only took us like 15 minutes to finish our sets and then we moved on and immediately went to my rack, put on the exact weight I was squatting for 5 reps, which was 160lbs, and did it for a bunch of reps, clearly he did this on purpose as he then put on 225lbs and did sets of 5, then did 275lbs and did quarter reps for sets of 3. Then every leg machine my gf and I went to he seemed to want to use the machine, hed walk by and lock eyes with me like he wanted to say something but didn&#039;t. Ever since then there was tension. Then clown world lockdowns happened, I was blessed enough to have access to a complete home gym my buddy had so I continued to lift all thru 2020 and 2021. Then end of 2021 I went back to the gym, same time, and the same guy was there, I was stronger than him now, but his shitty attitude was the same and there was still this tension. He squatted 280lbs for sets of 5 so when I was Bench pressing I specifically put on 280lbs and benched it for 8 and then looked at him and smiled and he stared at me like he wanted to hurt me but he didn&#039;t do shit.
