The closer to the center the supports are, the more careful you have to be because the weight imbalance needs to be smaller.<br>Using the dimensions of the olympic bar, it&#039;s mass center should be at 65,5 cm from the pinning position. This means that, at 20 Kg, the momentum of the bar is 128,5 N.m.

Since 4 plates are ~80 Kg it&#039;s close to tipping, and any additional weight would contribute more to the momentum, we can add the momentum of a 5 Kg plate to see if it tips.
