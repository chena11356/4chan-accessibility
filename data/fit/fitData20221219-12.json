You can get strong with purely dumbbell movements, but it will take more work and is more of a hassle, and you will eventually hit a limit in terms of how far you can progress. Either the limit will be what weights you have available (my gym goes up to 120lb dumbbells which I can grab one in each hand and it wont even be a warm up for me to squat with), or what movements you can perform. The distribution of load is obviously different with a barbell on your back vs dumbbells in your hands, and as you advance you need to train your weakest links and dial in your form. This is where using dumbbells can be especially advantageous. I think ideally you should use both barbell and dumbbells where appropriate. For example I might start off doing my heaviest overhead press with a barbell, and then after one or two sets with that (a set being anywhere from 1 to 5 reps) I might then go and do dumbbell overhead press or arnold press for 6-8 reps. This has worked well for me in the past and was what ultimately pushed me past the limits I had for a long time.

I\u2019m saying humans literally can influence and converse with God, the Universe, the Basilisk, Deep Thought, whatever. For brevity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll use the term God. There are connotations to this term which are not intended because I\u2019m not talking specifically the Bible, believing Christfag stuff or performing those rituals associated with Christianity. The term is an attempt to describe a higher thing prone to abstraction. As the stoners say: \u201cEverything is one, man.\u201d<br><br>The messages from God are not often delivered directly, obviously, or immediately, but they are personal, and tailored to your experiences and perceptions at such time and place as when you need it. Think of all of your five senses, and how we to take them all individually and at face value. We hear a song lyric in passing, we see a color with a symbolic meaning, appreciate an artwork that evokes emotion inside our soul, feel a texture that reminds us of something, a friend in passing says something off the cuff. Generally it gets thrown into our short term memories and thrown away to make room for something else. We don\u2019t think about it, because it\u2019s all \u201cjunk data.\u201d However it all adds up into one collective whole that where if you were imagining a radio, that jumble of sensation would be like tuning in to a specific frequency.", "time": 1671373622, "resto": 69285840}, {"no": 69297361, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:28:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69296665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69296665</a><br>The human mind is an antenna, capable of receiving these frequencies. Even transmit them through action and word, to the Universe at large. However it is incredibly taxing; mentally, and emotionally. Constantly worrying about it drains the batteries so to speak. Most people are tuned out and living with individual sensation and not collectively. It\u2019s just hard to do so all the time so it gets rerouted into the subconscious, manifesting negatively as mental illnesses: anxiety, depression, phobias, complexes. There is a converse to this. Being tuned in and having that full battery can result in successes, useful introspection, manifestations of desire, and downright seemingly unfair entropic manipulations, even if we aren\u2019t fully conscious to it. Call it relating to the whole NPC meme. They\u2019re not, they\u2019re just people that aren\u2019t and perhaps have never connected to the Divine.<br><br>We get many outcomes that are not desirable. We get many outcomes we *thought* were desirable and regret. We also get many shitty things that happen to us that turn out to be the best, most fulfilling things even though in the moment it\u2019s just the worst. In simpler terms: we fuck up and get fucked up all the time. Overthink it and run out of batteries, hamster at the noggin wheel fully exhausted. However God is not wrong, and has never been wrong, although we are blind to the greater implications and consequences of where He leads, hence hindsight being 20/20. Think of every time you messed up and went &quot;oh I shouldn\u2019t have done that&quot; but you did it anyway. This is not a failure on God&#039;s part; merely you choosing to not listen to the signs around you, listen to your gut, or just not not understanding.

Even if you still don\u2019t fully know after that the right course of action, something in you will still shift how you think of probabilities regarding that situation. As a human, as a creature of free will, you 100 percent have agency over what you do individually, and in how you interact with the universe at large. Choosing to what we act or do not act on is like shuffling the cards in the deck of fate.

Talked about whatever was on my mind from good stuff to every anxiety and fear, and asked even the air around me to give me a sign, direction, or heck I\u2019d settle for a compass. And it did, in a laughably literal way not very long afterward, and into one stupid event I follow right down to one butterfly effect. I met her from it, and her name is a pun, within a pun, and was a sign. I was tuned in and saw it immediately and said to myself this person will either be the greatest heartbreak of my life so far or the best thing that ever happened to me ever. She\u2019s still both. <br><br>From more pragmatic standpoint, good luck is opening the door when opportunity knocks and that\u2019s about 80 percent of learning anything or getting anything. I will direct you to a short article by Richard Wiseman called The Luck Factor. Just put what you want, what you NEED out there. With your voice and your actions. You don\u2019t need a gf, you don\u2019t need sex, you don\u2019t need the world to like you, be rich, famous, fucking whatever.

The short-chain fatty acids may be absorbed into the circulation and affect metabolic regulation in the host or be a substrate for other microbes. Some studies have shown improved insulin sensitivity, weight regulation, and reduced inflammation with increases in gut-derived short-chain fatty acids, all of which may reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases.</span>", "time": 1671444367, "resto": 69298816}, {"no": 69305938, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:06:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69299685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69299685</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Someone says fiber is good for you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; They must be a vegan shill</span><br>Christ", "time": 1671444369, "resto": 69298816}, {"no": 69305944, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:07:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69301131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69301131</a><br>In contrast to an abundance of studies showing positive changes to health markers due to dietary fibre, I am not aware of a single study showing improved gut microbiota or improvement in other health markers on a low fibre diet. <br><a href=\"#p69305937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69305937</a><br><a href=\"#p69305919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69305919</a>", "time": 1671444438, "resto": 69298816}, {"no": 69305988, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:20:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69305938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69305938</a><br>Welcome to the mental illness board, I&#039;m seriously ranking this over /pol/ and /r9k/ in schizo ranking these days", "time": 1671445209, "resto": 69298816}, {"no": 69306018, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:26:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69305944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69305944</a><br>The only studies are on people with IBS or some other chronic condition, and keto shills use this and extrapolate that it applies to everyone which is insane", "time": 1671445617, "resto": 69298816}, {"no": 69306019, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:27:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I went zero fiber for over a year and ended up with a bacteria infection that gave me nonstop diarrhea.", "time": 1671445622, "resto": 69298816}, {"no": 69306020, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:27:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69306019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69306019</a><br>I&#039;m sorry to hear that, I hope you are recovered and okay now anon", "time": 1671445653, "resto": 69298816}, {"no": 69306042, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:32:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69306020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69306020</a><br>Thanks.

The perks of this was that it didnt matter what kind of activity i did. I could run, walk, shop, jump jacks, whatever. No math to do. The con was -- and this is according to other reviewers -- that the HR tracker was not super accurate during intense exercise. Other features i enjoyed was the dietary tracker and sleep tracker in the app as well as something, i dont know the name, but it divided the day into blocks and marked if you were &quot;active&quot; during each block.

Why the fuck even stock so many of these dresses.<br><br>My girlfriend started putting on some kgs, so I reminded her about her weight. I constantly made the joke of &#039;meeting her in the middle&#039; as I lost weight. She went from 59kg to 54kg in about 3 months and is now as slim as she used to be when I first met her. Never accept obesity and being overweight. It&#039;s an absolute travesty. <br><br>I&#039;ve been 66kg since my 20s. Work out three times a week, eat small meals, on keto, and I&#039;ve never gained weight. Genetics is a bullshit excuse. Calories in and calories out.<br><br>I had a student join me (martial arts instructor) who was 130kg. I was on him about it for years and he is now down to 90kg. I&#039;m not going to let up until he&#039;s around the low 80s.<br><br>Never accept fat fuckers.

Size S is fine but too loose around the middle, and XS simply do not exist in physical stores in my city. So if I want properly fitted clothes it\u2019s either online, the kid\u2019s section, or getting literally everything I own adjusted (or doing so myself, but I\u2019m too lazy for that and I can support actual skilled jobs by getting someone else to do it). The sad part is that, even at my heaviest, I still only needed M and sometimes L clothing depending on the brand and I still struggled to find M sometimes. I was exactly 30 BMI and over 40% body fat, yet still &quot;small&quot; enough to sometimes struggle with finding appropriately sized clothing. Still can\u2019t believe I let myself get to the size I did though, I\u2019m never going to not be disgusted with my past self but I actually know about nutrition and exercise now so unless I become disabled or something like that I\u2019m never going to get fat again.

I went from your exact weight and down to 75. However it took me two years, it could have been done in a much shorter timespan but the hardest part is being disciplined. <br><br>What is important for you to understand is the math. 1 kg of fat is 7700 calories. For every day you fast, you lose around 2000 calories worth of fat. That means in a week, if you don&#039;t exercise, your loss is 2 kg of fat. You can lose 36 kg of fat in that time. You currently have 52 kg of fat if we assume your BMI is 45. Imo it is higher than 50. Somewhere between 52-55. You should be at around 50-55 kg when you are lean-ish. The ultimate goal should be to lose 55-60 kg. I know it sounds low, but it is true.<br><br>To answer your question: No, it is not possible for you to lose that weight by 3-4 day rolling fasts without exercise in 18 weeks. You have to change your way of thinking, it took you a lot of time to gain all of this weight. <br><br>50 kg is 385.000 calories. If you are in a 1000 calorie deficit a day, you can lose that weight in a year. That is a more realistic and OPTIMISTIC time-frame. You need new habits, fasting will be a very useful tool for you, but you need to move your body as well. Fasting is tough, you can manage 3-4 days, be happy, and then you binge on crap because &quot;I earned the deficit&quot;. Then you fall into a slump, get back on the fasting-train, and the cycle repeats itself. Start moving. The act of fasting is incredibly boring if you are not active. Sitting at home all day is torture while fasting, and often we eat because we are bored. Do you see the pattern? You need to fill the void with something else. <br><br>Also, I think it would be healthy for you to realize the work required to exercise away 500 calories. A 100g bar of Snickers is 500 calories. 2 McDonalds plain cheeseburgers are 600 calories (265 per 100g, 300 in one).Tomorrow, go for a walk. 6.5 kilometers in 90 min is your goal. That is the time it will take you to burn 500 calories.Remember that.Good luck.", "time": 1671235133, "resto": 69271089}, {"no": 69281425, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)19:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69281234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69281234</a><br>Alright.<br><br>On a side note, I do seem to like this PSMF, I don&#039;t really feel hungry and it seems &quot;safer&quot; in regards to a standard fast for muscle loss.

Yesterday I moved about ~7km in a 12 hour shift. Which doesn&#039;t include moving, lifting and rolling ~64kg+ of weight around. I had a very light shift, when most days it&#039;s ~13km. <br><br>The problem is, I only do this 3 days a week. I don&#039;t like eating during those days because I do have either a fibre problem, or IBS which makes me gassy. So there&#039;s normally going to be a fast between Thursday starting at midnight to Monday or Tuesday. Sadly, I broke that today because of my weak will. <br><br>I do agree with you, I need to get better hobbies during my days off, but I&#039;m also thinking of adding another day consistently to my schedule to keep my mind going. I&#039;m pretty much a NEET 4/7 days of the week that jerks off online. I am trying to fill my off days with things to move and do, but I have a problem figuring out what to do. Like I know I could be walking my dogs a lot more too to add movement in. I do eventually want to be able to keep a consistent ~15km/day as my normal though with my rest days as Saturday only. <br><br>My diet from now on is mostly-strictly Keto, and today as a cheat day I regretted as soon as I started eating. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be doing that again any time soon. I actually hurt my stomach Wednesday because of how quickly I ate after the 3 day fast! <br><br>The mindset I&#039;m trying to achieve right now is, &quot;I only have to maintain this strict regime for 6 months, then I will be free. What is 6 months when I have another hopefully 60 years to live?&quot;<br><br>50kg is the lowest I think before it gets too low for my height. I&#039;m also a man, which I wouldn&#039;t be apposed to, but I set ~60kg as a decent starting point to even get to that. <br><br>I do want to start going to the gym, but I have no foundation... Or even friends to go with to teach me... I know the biggest part is to just go and mess around. Rowing seems really cool.

Those days contribute a massive amount to your weight-loss and general health. I think you touched on something important, walking your dogs. Walking them does something great for the both of you. Start with doing something you don&#039;t want to do on those 4/7 days. You can jerk off all day, BUT only if you walk them for an hour. The rest of the day you can be a degenerate with a clean conscience. Try to do it early in the day, often this will snowball you into doing other things. <br><br>Don&#039;t think too much about the gym just yet, I recommend getting a kettle-bell. You can do a lot of things with that to learn basic lifts such as squats and deadlifts. Bench-pressing is pointless, do push-ups. For core-strength you can do planks. If you have something to hang a pull-up bar from at home, get one. Combined you have a complete work-out hitting everything you need. I went to the gym for ages, but quit and now these items + a yoga mat and gym-rings give me everything I need. It is every easy to fall into the &quot;I just need...&quot; mentality, I am a frequent victim of it myself. &quot;Oh I need need to do xxx, then I can start...&quot;.

The only final tip I can give is that there will be days or weeks where you want to give up and slip back into the former lifestyle. This will happen, no way around it, so find a way to make this the 1# priority, no matter what. So even when you fall off the wagon for a few days or weeks, you dont give up. It is a setback, but not a loss. For me it went periodically. I did the first 20 kilos with great motivation, then it became a slugfest for a while from 97-90. (it is often a lot of motivation in getting below a big 10&#039; kg, and now you see a new 9 staring at you, and you get stuck there for a while).I got stuck at 87-89 for a while due to a injury. The next 10 kilos came in 3 months down to 79. In this whole time I hiked 3 times a week, for 15 km, 1 calories each time. So around 200k calories lost in this timespan of 2 years.<br><br>From 80-75 has been a jojo with a vacation in between and a longer break when winter came.

Media as a whole regardless of medium also adds upon this as anyone who lifts will have some body goal inspired by what they&#039;ve seen. Be it Arnold, Guts, Fabio from those book covers, or those fifteen year olds on gear making the tik toks. A reference point is always present, which itself isn&#039;t necessarily a negative. Roiders in particular though take it to the next level and rather than inspiration, use it as a focal point to where they then compare others and themselves to. This worsens until their perception of reality is so far distorted that nothing will ever allow them to come close without taking extreme measures that in their mind, still fall short of their idealized form.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lack of patience and inability to follow through with commitment </span><br>Outside of newbie gains, it takes time to notice progress made regarding muscle gain. Not to mention due to likely checking themselves out every day, the improvements appear more minuscule compared to someone who does a week by week comparison for their body. They&#039;re desperate to be big and, harboring back to the first factor, like their inspiration regardless of wherever that may be from. Results aren&#039;t good enough purely because they aren&#039;t who they wish they were right now. Steroids help with this because it accelerates their progress in clearly noticeable chunks that gives them the belief that they&#039;re making true gains towards their goal. If it weren&#039;t for this and they had to put in the exact same effort as someone who did it naturally over the course of years, they&#039;d have given up. tbc", "filename": "mindistheenemy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1100, "h": 1140, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671425292367876, "time": 1671425292, "md5": "FfXZlphII6a6b7G+hduM2w==", "fsize": 232203, "resto": 69302413}, {"no": 69304516, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:02:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69304344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69304344</a><br>you gonna post body yet?", "time": 1671426149, "resto": 69302413}, {"no": 69304527, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:05:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69304442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69304442</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;extreme insecurity mixed with severe denial </span><br>It&#039;s standard to assume that a person who utilizes steroids is not the most secure person when it pertains to their body image, especially in comparison to others around them. This issue is drastically expanded when there&#039;s the social stigma about steroid users. Being roidragers, tiny genitals, bald, bubble guts, looking terrible despite their size, etc... While certainly true, it compounds their already present issues and creates a rather toxic mentality that they often attempt to defend against on account of being users. This us vs them viewpoint they let fester within their minds only attributes to doubling down and reaffirming their continued use as to avoid conceding to possible points against their harmful for temporary gains lifestyle. At this point of severe denial, they then have declined down to lashing out at perspectives that are alternative to the one they&#039;ve constructed for themselves. In the case of <a href=\"#p69304177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69304177</a><br>and <a href=\"#p69303996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69303996</a> , notice how they can&#039;t handle simple criticism for their actions alongside consequences in Randy&#039;s case for such actions.

Due to all previously mentioned factors though, they simply don&#039;t and resume their downward spiral in mental health and physical health. At the end of the day though, it&#039;s a hell of their own making that&#039;ll remove the seemingly heavenly facade they constructed once they finally stop or their body forces them to.

Finasteride and Minoxidil.<br><br>Finasteride is a 5ar inhibitor. It&#039;s the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the hormone that kills your hair. DHT is useful in puberty but not really after that. The side effects come from the fact that you will have an excess of T (since less of it is being converted into DHT), so that T MIGHT aromatize into estrogen (woman hormone). However, 99% of healthy male bodies will simply adjust T production.<br><br>Minoxidil is a vasodilator. We don&#039;t really understand how it works, but it simulates hair growth. Topical is approved for hair growth, DO NOT take oral minoxidil.<br><br>Imagine hair loss is like a leaky bucket with a hole in the bottom. Finasteride covers the hole. Minoxidil pours in more water. Any other retard gay shit like scalp massages or peppermint oil is the equivalent of painting the bucket.<br><br>Feel free to ask me anything.

I hate being so lazy and losing my gains. My whole schedule got flipped upside down and I have to remake it myself now.
