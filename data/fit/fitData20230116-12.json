It is when she is no longer &quot;hot&quot;, indicated by the decrease in her physical attractiveness, evidenced by a dramatic fall-off in approaches by men, lower expressed sexual interest by men, and fewer compliments from men - offline and online. When a woman &quot;hit the wall&quot; or reaches the age when her physical attractiveness decreases, her Sexual Marketplace Value (SMV) drops significantly, usually in her late twenties and early 30s.

After that, viable eggs decreases dramatically. Estrogen levels drop off after 35 which further decreases fertility and attractive looks. Because of this, female beauty is entirely based on youth. There&#039;s no reproductive benefit to a women who looks 32. Women also biologically mature faster so their physical peak (as in physical ability to perform tasks) is far sooner than men. This is a major reason why professional female athletes have the height of their careers much earlier than men.<br><br>Men are fertile from the onset of puberty until they die. While issues with sperm quality can arrise, the fact that the sperm have to reach the eggs prevents poor quality sperm from reaching the egg. Male testosterone levels only slightly go down after 30 and don&#039;t decrease at a harmful rate until mid-50s. It&#039;s been well documented that men maintain near peak muscle mass and muscular strength well into their 40s. Our attractive facial traits are also not centred around youth because our physical peak is not our late teens. Experience is the advantage for men so between 30-40 is best.<br><br>I can see any advantage for why women age better. A man in his 50s can be fucking prime 18-21yr old women.

I honestly doubt she even trains to any meaningful degree besides recording a couple reps to upload here. She also posted her boobs in some other thread for attention... so take that for what you will.

Even my greatest rivals like MA I still respect greatly because I can tell he gives a shit about lifting and he put in the work. oh my god literally run an lp or train hard or fucking do something, if you gave a fuck about lifting you wouldnt have such shit lifts after 3 months of lifting. even for a woman youre shit weak. my gf hasnt touched a weight in her life until 2 weeks ago and she deadlifted a plate first try.

The chonky powerlifter deadlifting a million plates.

Hit the trad and pin loaded leg press (3 plates for the trad idk how much for the pin loaded but it was almost maxed out), the step up box, the good girl bad girl, seated hamstring machine and farmers carries (45kg per hand).<br>Back was seal rows (only 30kg plus bar i was a bit fried by this stage), reverse delt machine, and high row machine (80kgs) for 5, pull over machine for 56kg-71kg till failure. <br>I finished off with a bit of shoulders on the ohp machine (40kg) with light weight bby (5kg) lu raises between sets.<br><br>Overall not too bad imo still getting back into the regular grind.

I eat somewhere between 80 and 160 g fat per day and somewhere around 120-175 g carbs and ~200 g protein.<br>I tried doing keto for a few years (too long) and it&#039;s a fine approach with lots of well-touted benefits, but it also has several drawbacks<br>1) it&#039;s better for people who have 40 or more pounds to lose than people who are closer to goal weight and their process is more like recomp than overall mass loss<br>2) as was mentioned earlier in the thread, high protein is not true keto and true keto is not high enough protein for long-term health imo<br>3) most people have goals that are not purely body composition related. Most of the time those goals would be better served by at least moderate carb intake rather than pure keto. E.g. &quot;I want to lose weight to have the energy to play with my kids outside.&quot; If you put the person with that goal on keto permanently they will likely reach a point where they are at a decent body composition but they don&#039;t feel the level of energy they would like to feel on a regular basis.<br>4) the food industry is starting to make lots of highly palatable ultra processed foods and labeling them keto. Up until a few years ago, keto meant preparing your own food and understanding what it&#039;s made of and its macro content. Nowadays there will be people who think they are keto because they ate packaged snacks that said keto, just like people in the 90s who thought they were eating healthy because they ate Snackwells low-fat cookies<br><br>Keto is a valuable tool and I recommend that people who want to do fasting for weight loss or longevity reasons get keto adapted first as it makes fasting easier.

The same goes for their pelvic floor muscles. The excess fat around their waists and thighs means there is limited motion down there so the muscles weaken, whereas in a healthy weight woman there is a normal range of movement down there so her pussy has the intended level of tightness (unless she has some other condition or just shit genetics that make her a gaper). A woman can make her pussy tighter by working out her pelvic floor muscles, and it has the added benefit of making it easier to hold her piss in (a major problem for women past The Wall).

If you get unfit later in life then you can reverse the damage and revert to a semblance of your former self. Basically it\u2019s a huge advantage.

I believe this makes it much easier for me than for someone getting fit for the first time in their life. <br>Anyone heard this theory before?<br>Maybe it\u2019s a mental thing?

Sure, I grant that a boxer is going to punch better than a Muay Thai person, but I don&#039;t think that entails that a Muay Thai person would really be in trouble in a fight. Boxing constrained to one range of striking: punching range. Muay Thai has kicking range, punching range, elbow range, and the clinch. If you are familiar with all those ranges of fighting, you are much more empowered to keep the fight _out_ of punching range and in a range where you are the superior fighter. For example, it is pretty easy to clinch with someone against their will.

After about a year of regularly stretching, I can now kick to head level. I learned a lot. Here are my suggestions:<br><br>1. The best way to get flexibility is to just do the thing you are trying to do. So, if you want to get higher kicks, just go kick a lot. Kick tons of reps every day. You don&#039;t have to kick to 100% of your mobility, because that would be dangerous, but maybe kick to about 80% of your maximum height over and over again.<br><br>2. Dynamic stretches. Dynamic stretches are where you throw your body to the limits of its mobility repeatedly for reps. So, in the case of kicking, swing your leg up in front of you as high as it will go, or swing it to the side as high as it will go, etc.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By4<wbr>QOLdVylo<br><br>3. Static stretches. These are the common form of stretching where you put your body in position and you hold it for a while. This is the least useful way to increase your flexibility, but I still do them in my routine. It is important to only do static stretches after you have some blood pumping, so I like to finish a workout with static stretches. Here is a great static stretch routine for high kicks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GX<wbr>1crXyw78<br><br>Also, I have found the hip stretch from this video to be amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL5<wbr>CIMJZSgQ", "time": 1673853115, "resto": 69613019}, {"no": 69614786, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:18:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69614752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69614752</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is the least useful way to increase your flexibility, but I still do them in my routine</span><br><br>That&#039;s completely wrong.
