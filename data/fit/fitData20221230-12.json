Wear eye protection, a decent respirator, and some clothes you don&#039;t mind throwing away when you&#039;re fucking around with the mold. After it&#039;s off the window give the area a final spray with the solution and let it air dry.

Your &quot;yeah i&#039;ll do paused back off sets are pure cope and you won&#039;t do it&quot;.

In other Greek states, for instance among the Boeotians, man and boy live together, like married people;5 elsewhere, among the Eleians, for example, consent is won by means of favours. Some, on the other hand, entirely forbid suitors to talk with boys. The customs instituted by Lycurgus were opposed to all of these. If someone, being himself an honest man, admired a boy&#039;s soul and tried to make of him an ideal friend without reproach and to associate with him, he approved, and believed in the excellence of this kind of training. But if it was clear that the attraction lay in the boy&#039;s outward beauty, he banned the connexion as an abomination; and thus he caused lovers to abstain from boys no less than parents abstain from sexual intercourse with their children and brothers and sisters with each other.

Yet that isn&#039;t right either. The entire notion of sexual orientation is a modern one, the word homosexual was coined c. 1890. For the ancients, sodomy was an act, not an identity.

Although Greek was a language of status, and the Romans heavily leaned on Greek culture, philosophy and myth, that, to quote Horace, captive Greece took captive her savage conquerer and brought the arts to rustic Latium, there was always a certain traditionalist tendency amongst the Romans to protect their manly and rustic traditions from too much influence from Greece. Pederasty was never as common with the Latins as with the Greeks, and where it did occur, it was not with freeborn boys. The Greeks viewed pederasty as even aristocratic, while the Romans considered it fit only for slaves and prostitutes. It was therefore only with Roman law that sodomy was first criminalized. First partially with the Lex Scantinia from around the second or first century B.C., then more fully with the Lex Julia.

It is written explicitly that it is &quot;many&quot;. Because of this, writes Xenophon, people outright refuse to believe that the Spartans forbad &quot;the connexion (sexual intercourse) as an abomination&quot;. This cannot be read as meaning anything other than that at least a very great deal of Greeks viewed pederasty as so normative in the eromenos-erastes relationships that they couldn&#039;t imagine a state banning it.

The idea that men can be born simply with an inversion of the typical attraction to women, and then seek to imitate relationships with women, like with marriage and child-rearing, is utterly absent from as far as I know all pre-modern cultures. &quot;Homosexuality&quot;, where it occured, appeared in a system similar to the Greek&#039;s. Marriage with women was a necessity, with pederasty occuring on the side, in a hierarchical relationship based on age. There was no homosexuality as such, only prefrence for either women or youths. The true heir of the Hellenic practice of sodomy is with bacha bazi.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you make of the endless writings about devout monks buggering each other in the Middle Ages?

Your plan should include gradually increasing the distance and intensity of your runs over time to allow your body to adapt and improve.<br><br> Focus on proper form: Good running form is essential for efficient and effective running. Pay attention to your posture, footstrike, and arm swing, and aim to maintain a smooth, fluid motion as you run.<br><br> Incorporate interval training: Interval training involves alternating between periods of high-intensity exercise and lower-intensity recovery periods. This type of training can be an effective way to improve your speed and endurance.<br><br> Get enough rest: Adequate rest and recovery are essential for improving your performance and preventing injury. Be sure to get enough sleep and allow your body time to recover between workouts.<br><br> Stay hydrated: Proper hydration is important for maintaining energy and supporting physical performance. Be sure to drink enough water throughout the day and during your workouts.<br><br>In addition to running, it is also important to focus on improving your strength and endurance in other areas, such as push-ups and sit-ups.

This can help regulate your body&#039;s natural sleep-wake cycle.<br><br> Create a sleep-friendly environment: Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Use a comfortable mattress and pillows.<br><br> Avoid screens before bedtime: The blue light emitted by screens can interfere with your body&#039;s production of the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate sleep. Try to avoid screens (including TVs, phones, and computers) for at least an hour before bed.<br><br> Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly. Just be sure to finish your workout a few hours before bed, as vigorous exercise close to bedtime can actually make it harder to fall asleep.<br><br> Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime: Both of these substances can interfere with your sleep. Try to avoid consuming them for at least a few hours before you go to bed.<br><br> Relax before bed: Try to relax and unwind before bedtime. This could include taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, or practicing deep breathing or meditation.<br><br> Get enough sunlight during the day: Exposure to sunlight during the day can help regulate your body&#039;s natural sleep-wake cycle. Try to get some sunlight during the day, especially in the morning.", "time": 1672334647, "resto": 69404859}, {"no": 69405067, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)12:28:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69404939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69404939</a><br>*aren&#039;t<br><a href=\"#p69405022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69405022</a><br>fuck off degen tranny", "time": 1672334888, "resto": 69404859}, {"no": 69405080, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)12:29:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69404903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69404903</a>", "filename": "1655495209746", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672334963031204, "time": 1672334963, "md5": "5opzQdq8Je15AWfDN6ckag==", "fsize": 68774, "resto": 69404859}, {"no": 69405106, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)12:32:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69405067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69405067</a><br>Die mad, roastie", "time": 1672335144, "resto": 69404859}, {"no": 69405738, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:44:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69405032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69405032</a><br>Fuck off loser.", "time": 1672339479, "resto": 69404859}, {"no": 69405778, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:49:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69404925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69404925</a><br>found the racist", "time": 1672339753, "resto": 69404859}, {"no": 69406147, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)14:32:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": ".", "filename": "1672342301722", "ext": ".webm", "w": 650, "h": 850, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672342322626935, "time": 1672342322, "md5": "IP15ZiAE4MwOdaaEhd5KiA==", "fsize": 2881214, "resto": 69404859}, {"no": 69406227, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)14:39:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69406147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69406147</a><br>Serena lost.

There are three things I&#039;m doing right now thats helping me with my current indie project (while doing a day job on a console game):<br>1. Give yourself a deadline. You should have an idea of where you want to be every 4 weeks. That usually a demo or a playable version of the game. Decide what needs to be in that version and what can wait until the next version.<br>2. Get a producer. I picked a friend of mine. We meet twice a week to go over the goals for the next few days and plan problems. You wont want to let him down.<br>3. On the design and coding side, think &quot;if nothing else existed, would the game be Functional?&quot; The &quot;Fun&quot; comes from adding features to the functional base. Another way to think of it is &quot;if this feature ceased to exist would the game break or just be less fun?&quot;. This lets you set up dependencies for your features and lets you make and adjust them more quickly. In my current game the game manager has the concept of Lose state, but doesnt have any explicit rules about what Causes a loss. Instead, my hero character has a component that says &quot;if this unit dies, you Lose&quot;.", "time": 1672387101, "resto": 69409604}, {"no": 69412328, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:21:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69409987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69409987</a><br>based. i believe in ye anon", "time": 1672388502, "resto": 69409604}, {"no": 69412335, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:22:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I want to buy land, establish a food forest, build my own house, have a workshop (smithing, woodworking, etc...), have chickens or pigs that free-roam the forest, have a wife and kids.

I usually make an entire plate of brownies under 1000kcal with 70g+ of protein, but you can tweak this by modifying the recipe a bit and using whatever you want.<br><br>To help: <br>Instead of butter I use applesauce<br>Instead of flour I use almond flour or oats I put in the blender to make oat flour<br>Instead of sugar I use stevia<br>Instead of melted chocolate I use 0kcal chocolate syrup<br>Instead of chocolate I use flavored protein powder (this isn&#039;t ideal though because its what makes protein brownies more dry, but just add a bit of greek yoghurt, quark or milk or something)<br><br>And if you don&#039;t like brownies honestly anything would work as long as you add protein powder for the gainz lol (honestly something like apple or lemon cake would probably be healthier). 1 banana + 2 eggs makes a batch of banana pancake batter. Multiply by how much batter you want (as 1 batch would give you about 240kcal 13g protein).<br><br>Final tip: check out pernilla stryker. she might seem like your average stacy but her low kcal recipes are surprisingly good", "time": 1672246566, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69394327, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)11:56:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>Oh, I don&#039;t know.<br><br>ROLLING DEEZ NUTS, ha got em.", "time": 1672246588, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69394339, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)11:57:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>Rollan for Ryuko", "time": 1672246660, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69394849, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)12:53:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69392046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69392046</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fantastic macros.</span><br>They were sued for lying about the macros", "time": 1672249995, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69394884, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)12:58:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>Rollo", "time": 1672250339, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69394898, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)12:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>rollin", "time": 1672250398, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69394990, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:14:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>NINE PLEASE", "time": 1672251247, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69395052, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:22:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>didnt read your post", "time": 1672251750, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69395060, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:23:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "plz quints", "time": 1672251797, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69395080, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>Rollin for &#039;em", "time": 1672251968, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69395087, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:27:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i like to have a nice matzo ball soup and salmon locks on toast this time of year", "time": 1672252042, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69395183, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:40:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389802</a><br>I&#039;d like to be a 2, but I&#039;m more of a 6", "time": 1672252804, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69395194, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:40:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;bush poking out</span><br>unf", "time": 1672252849, "resto": 69389802}, {"no": 69395203, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:41:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69389852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69389852</a><br>This add in eggs and milk.
