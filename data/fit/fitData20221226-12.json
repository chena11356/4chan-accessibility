Like in the video, the draw of fast food is that it&#039;s the same thing every time, and while it&#039;s not particularly tasty, it&#039;s comforting. You don&#039;t have to cook or do anything, and there&#039;s always other people in the drive-thru so you know you&#039;re not alone, and the food you get is always prepared the exact same way so you know what to expect.

You&#039;re doing low-bar squats, and when that weight is pushing down on you then often a novice only thinks they&#039;re doing good-morning squats, while they&#039;re actually doing it right: back rises with the hips, bar stays over mid-foot. If you feel the weight shifting to the balls of your feet, skip this step. You probably are leaning forward.<br>From here, the first option is to ignore the problem. This sounds bad, but for a novice the important thing is doing their primary movements and just accepting failure as it presents itself. Doing the exact movement is of course the best way to get better at the exact movement.<br>But otherwise, you&#039;ve got a few options. Either it&#039;s a quad weakness, or a back weakness. More often than not it&#039;s a quad weakness. If you&#039;re only a couple months in squatting 150lbs front squats are nice. But if you lack the mobility to get into the front squat position or are pushing over 225lbs for your sets, adding another compound can be a bit taxing for when you&#039;re trying to add 5lbs every session. It&#039;s perfectly fine to add in machine quad extensions to keep em progressing alongside your back and hamstrings.

Naked exercise was the daily rule for the people in their sports grounds\u2014the Gymnasion or the Palaestra\u2014youths, men, and maidens also, although the latter were not always present with the men at exercise. On special days both sexes combined for rhythmic dances. It must have been a magnificent spectacle to see the naked bodies in the ecstasy of their rhythmic movements. Among the Spartans, with their rigid morals, the virgins exercised naked with the youths. The new law that contestants should compete naked in the Olympic Games was made possible by the existence of such an outlook. Thus the act of Orsippos became a new pillar in the temple of Greek culture.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From knowledge of this springs the Olympic spirit\u2014may it be a symbol to us! The age of Olympus is dead and gone, and it would be a mistake to wish the age revived. Yet as a symbol this culture of physical and mental health may serve us, whose achievements of maturest perfection in all fields gave eternal models and examples to aftertime. The quest for harmony and perfection is bound up with iron Iaws; it is man\u2019s task to adapt himself to these. The weal or woe of a people depends on the physical and moral condition of every member; as was recognised by Lykurgus, the lawgiver of Sparta, and by Solon the Athenian. Thus leaders wrote thousands of years ago, and dealt accordingly; they and their people seeking health, vigour, and moral power in the Gymnasion, in the Pal\u00e6stra. The methods of education will undergo change; the State may intervene or the individual act on his own initiative; yet fixed and unchanged through the ages shall stand the ideal of the soul-inspired body in all its magnificence of Nature and sunlight\u2014the gymnast; the sun-man.</span><br>-Man and Sunlight, Hans Sur\u00e9n<br><br>We need a new Freik\u00f6rperkultur to succeed where the last one failed in reviving the heroic nudity of the ancients.", "time": 1672009462, "resto": 69365796}, {"no": 69370343, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)18:52:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69366234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69366234</a><br><a href=\"#p69366570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69366570</a><br>based recognition of the rampant and pernicious hermeneutics of gay suspicion", "time": 1672012329, "resto": 69365796}, {"no": 69370384, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)18:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "testicles is my favourite greek hero", "time": 1672012772, "resto": 69365796}, {"no": 69370722, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)20:05:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69366007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69366007</a><br>If everyone is straight and only fokus on excercise then it is nothing gay, objektivt.

Children were seen as essentially non-sexual, which is why this was acceptable. However, with society moving more and more from high-trust, tight-knit communities to low-trust areas where people didn&#039;t know eachother, the notion of stranger danger, of a pedophile coming along and napping your children, took a larger place in the popular consciousness. As a result, today, when we are looser with modesty than ever, we spend more time of our lives, than probably ever before, insulated from the outside world by layers of clothing.

When asked how much money you have/make never give a direct answer. You don\u2019t have to be rich, but make her wonder. That\u2019s the key with these retarded western chicks that are addicted to the glamorous social media life (that isn\u2019t even real). Spin everything so you sound interesting without outright lying. Hell, you could probably exaggerate way more than I do and still get away with it.

What does your boxing training look like that you&#039;re there for 3 hours?<br>Typically I will warm up for 30 min (calisthenics and roughly 2 mile run or equivalent cardio) followed by 45-60 min of drills. Then if it&#039;s a sparring night I will spar 4-8 3min rounds. That is a lot of volume for a single training session, and that is speaking as a competitive fighter.<br>I&#039;d be interested to hear more about your experience level as well as what your training entails. For boxing you want your rest times low and your intensity high, at 3 hours per session you are probably overdoing something somewhere. If you want to share some details I will help you. <br>Last thought : what I described above is for a &quot;boxing workout,&quot; i.e. drills and skills I would work specifically for boxing.

I&#039;d say one thing you might want to do would be to define what you intend to work on before you start training, and program a set amount that focuses on that. One thing about boxing is that footwork, endurance, reactivity, hand speed, power, etc. are all needed, but they are actually kind of unique and different from each other, and require different methodology to train. For example some days I want to focus on footwork more. I might do drills including jump rope, speed ladder, ski jumps, high knees, mountain climbers, pivots, stance changes, etc., and comparatively low punching. Other days I am looking to work on power, and might work the heavy bag, and maybe stay more stationary on it than I usually would &quot;for real,&quot; then use resistance bands or other complementary stuff later in that training session. In boxing all this stuff is needed but you cant really train it all at once adequately, when everything is the priority then nothing is. So, we train it separately then we learn to assemble it cohesively later when we are with our coaches and sparring partners. <br>All that BS said bro, define what you want to work on everyday rather than just meander vaguely through a bunch of random exercises. Have an idea that you want to work on footwork/power/defensive maneuvers/muscular endurance/cardio, make sure you do enough to achieve a goal for that training block for that day, and be happy knowing you&#039;ll make progress. Honestly I think you&#039;ll improve faster with that shift in mentality than you otherwise could just going up to a place with a guy who just kind of has gym full of novices all just wandering through different exercises working on random things.

For example, if your bench press RM are 160lbs for 15 reps, 180lbs for 10 reps and 200lbs for 5 reps, the the cycle goes as follows:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mon 135x15reps</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wed 140x15reps</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fri 145x15reps</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mon 150x15reps</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wed 155x15reps</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fri 160x15reps</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mon 155x10repsx2sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wed 160x10repsx2sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fri 165x10repsx2sets</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mon 170x10repsx2sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wed 175x10repsx2sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fri 180x10repsx2sets</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mon 175x5repsx3sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wed 180x5repsx3sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fri 185x5repsx3sets</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mon 190x5repsx3sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wed 195x5repsx3sets</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fri 200x5repsx3sets</span><br><br>Most people ran it with basic compounds.
