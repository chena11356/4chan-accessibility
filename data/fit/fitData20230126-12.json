You can mix it with whatever amount of water you like. <br><br>Example:<br>Skimmed milk powder has 12 grams of protein per serving, with 17 grams of carbs. <br>Say you need 180 grams of protein, that&#039;s 15 servings, just under a gallon, giving you all your protein for the day, with only 255g of carbs. You&#039;d be at 1800 calories for the day. That&#039;s even perfect for cutting. Replace some of that with whole milk to up the calorie count and get the required fat in there as well. I havent done the math to see how you&#039;d puzzle out the best way to mix whole milk into that to get the correct amount of carbs and fats but its easily doable. I guess obviously you&#039;d drink the whole milk first till you hit your fat ratio cap and then drink the rest in skimmed till you covered protein.<br><br>On top of all that, and what made me begin to consider it in the first place is that milk is the cheapest source of protien. If it doesn&#039;t happen to be by you, then it most likely is one of the cheapest. It&#039;s the easiest to prepare and to consume as well. No cooking involved. Of course if you&#039;re lactose intolerant then all this doesn&#039;t really apply to you.

She was shaped like blastoise and she was very obnoxious, always complaining about things to the staff and yelling at them. And whenever she did cardio, she would shout at herself to get pumped up. We called her Blitzkrieg Blob.<br><br>Anyway, one day, she\u2019s on the same stationary bike that she always uses. And, as usual, there\u2019s a moat of sweat surrounding the bike and she is screaming commands at herself while doing approximately 8 mph.

This was one of those supersonic implosions of the ass that causes a noise to come squelching out that is deep, yet sharp at the same time. It was easily 5 or 6 seconds long and seemed to reverberate off the walls and ceiling and travel along the epoxy floor all the way to the weights section. I didn\u2019t see it, but people closer to her claimed that she actually lifted her ass up off the saddle before she discharged, which would have been quite a feat given her morbidly obese physique.<br><br>Everyone immediately stopped doing what they were doing. I stopped my tricep pushdown mid-rep and, like everyone else, turned to look at the cardio area.

And then picture a gigantic cloud of that smell drifting over to you, and the closer it gets, the more you feel the air around you get warmer. <br><br>Needless to say, we all shoved our faces into our whatever towel or shirt we could get our hands on and tried our best to filter blastoise\u2019s bubonic ass bubble from entering our lungs. <br><br>The funny thing is that she carried on with her cardio session, all 15 minutes of it, then left and never came back. Even funnier is that the bike she used was never used again. People simply refused to get on it, even those who weren\u2019t there when the fart occurred. It was like the bike had a curse on it. Even on busy moments like Friday evenings or Saturday mornings when there was nearly always a queue to get onto a bike or treadmill, Blitzkrieg Bob\u2019s bike would remain empty.

I gave it the good ol&#039; RICE treatment and felt fine (if a little sore) the next day. I&#039;d been doing 13 mile long runs with no problems before that, but now like clockwork when I hit mile 6, that leg starts tightening up and I stop for fear of injuring myself. The pain itself feels soft (i.e. not bone), looking at a body chart it looks to be in the plantaris region, but not curving as much as the diagram shows.<br>Hopefully unrelated, but I&#039;ve also felt a sort of grinding feeling in my right foot. It doesn&#039;t feel like bone on bone, more like the kind of rough parallel friction you&#039;d feel trying to pull one cord out of a rope. It&#039;s not painful at all but is a bit distressing.<br>I don&#039;t really know how to communicate my &quot;technique&quot; for reference but I run about 163 spm at a comfortable pace. At any rate, my watch says &quot;great&quot; for asymmetry, contact, flight time, and regularity, and &quot;improve&quot; for stiffness and vertical.<br>Anyone dealt with similar crap and have advice? I&#039;ve been a runner middle school-college but I&#039;ve never had an injury (and don&#039;t have a coach to ask anymore lol)", "filename": "f26220334f669ffff92acda1bceb2c7c-1658350311", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1488, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674709004245494, "time": 1674709004, "md5": "O4+DdMnBm8/g8ulY6+ETJg==", "fsize": 204325, "resto": 69711002}, {"no": 69730420, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:07:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69730340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69730340</a><br>leg cancer..........sorry anon it&#039;s fatal", "time": 1674709630, "resto": 69711002}, {"no": 69730489, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:15:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69730157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69730157</a><br>I was wondering if I&#039;d make it to a mile as recently as two months ago.

That&#039;s right, pretty girl, I am not a good person. I hurt women. I ruin days. Think of all the fun we could have had had I not punched you. Continued to talk, joke, walk, have a good time through and through. You would go home happy and develop a positive sentiment towards me. You&#039;d think of me several times per day whenever you experience something you and I both enjoy, or whenever you&#039;re generally happy. That reality is not meant to be. I have to remind you that I am not who I appear to be. All this time it was a mask and now I cast unto you my true face. Oh, you&#039;re crying?! Well then, have another. Does it hurt? What hurts you more - the punch, ruining your perfect face; or the fact that I interrupted your high levels of joy, ruining your perfect streak of happiness. This could have been a boring day, a day you would soon forget because it was like any other. Instead, you will remember this day for a very long time because of what I did to you. You will no longer associate me with good times and laughs, but with tears and pain. What sets apart a tear of joy from a tear of sorrow? Pure context of the situation. You will spill tears of sadness. You will forever be scarred if not on your smooth, beautiful, perfect little face, then inside your brain. Every time you think of me, you will remember that my penultimate intention is to hurt you. I will lure you in with nice things and finish you off with unspeakable acts that leave you in sorrow. I am sorry that I am like this. I have trouble bonding with people. It&#039;s best we part our ways now, I must not get too attached to anybody. I could hurt in worse ways.

It has to be practiced to develop an automatic response to things like becoming angry. You practice meditation to prepare yourself for the worst day of your life. But be warned, once you come to the realizations and breakthroughts, you cannot put the paste back into the tube.

They wouldn&#039;t benefit anyways. Most of the time the doctors who are noticing you are probably ging to die and the doctors doing the organ harvesting are different people working for different companies. The harvesting guy doesn&#039;t even get called until after the family has consented. <br><br>Also on that note even if you register to donate your organs, your next of kin can still decline donation.

Children are born with malfunctioning heart valves, intestinal malformations, or leukemia. All of these things can be helped or cured by tissue donation. Organ donation is a whole other thing and obvious. Its not just alcoholics needing a new liver. They are at the bottom of the list anyways. Plus one thing to consider is that there is a higher transplant success rate within haplotypes, so if one haplotype group does not donate tissue often then that group has to use other tissue leading to high failure rates in transplants.

Like the other guy said. HIT is about getting the exact correct amount of training. Not more and not less, but the right amount of training and rest. Many people that perform multiple sets multiple days a week are either undertraining or overtraining. They smash a muscle and then smash it again before they&#039;re done recovering, let alone finished getting all the gains from the bout of exercise. Alternatively, they may be undertraining even if they do multiple sets because they don&#039;t take them close enough to failure or they don&#039;t push themselves very hard. They may be spending a lot of time in the gym just spinning their wheels. Training without going to failure is inconsistent and nothing valuable can be ascertained from the chaotic nature of something that is inconsistent.<br><br>HIT eliminates all of the guesswork when it comes to training. You can eliminate training entirely as a potential variable in why you may or may not be experiencing growth. Beyond that, you already know that you need to get as much sleep as possible. You can also calculate your exact dietary needs very easily. By doing HIT as an approach, literally the only thing that is left in your training that needs to be figured out is how much rest you need. The answer to this question becomes extremely simple once the training itself is figured out, which is what HIT provides. The answer is that if you&#039;re not making gains between every individual session, rest more. That&#039;s it. It&#039;s as simple as that. Train correctly to 100% be sure that you have provided the necessary stimulus and then let your body do its thing by providing it with the necessary nutrition, sleep, and rest time.<br><br>All of exercise literature, when studies control for intensity, shows that single set training leads to the exact same results as multiple set training in a tiny fraction of the time", "filename": "How much rest do you need", "ext": ".png", "w": 1840, "h": 1208, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674680155817450, "time": 1674680155, "md5": "subk+S0iT/GyBk8gO4/EZQ==", "fsize": 155998, "resto": 69720058}, {"no": 69725467, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:05:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "alright<br>then to more practical approach, more down to earth: objectively speaking, almost every lifter transfering from a conventional program to HIT will have more spare time (shorter, less frequent trainings and scheduled off times)<br>there are certains groups that require more frequent stimulation to grow (abdominals, forearms, calves), would it be ok to take them out from the HIT scope?<br>then comes cardio / sprinting / other athletic feats that can be trained, how concurrent are these to lifting?<br><br>I&#039;m looking for a way for an optimal physical development time-wise, HIT sounds great as a method to cut down on bullshit and junk volume and therefore spare more time", "time": 1674680751, "resto": 69720058}, {"no": 69725608, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:17:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can HIT be applied to calisthenics?

Fixing your sleep and hydration is in most cases much easier than optimizing your training to the point where you have a program that works extremely well for you.

Although it does depend on what you&#039;re doing, for example if you&#039;re front squatting 3x a week you probably don&#039;t need to do as much ab work as front squats tend to be much more taxing on the abs than other compounds.
