Here are a few things you can try to help you break your bench press plateau:<br><br> Focus on progressive overload: Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed on the body during exercise. To break your plateau, you should focus on increasing the weight you&#039;re lifting or the number of reps you&#039;re doing.<br><br> Incorporate accessory exercises: Accessory exercises, such as incline press, dumbbell press, and tricep extensions, can help to target different areas of your chest and arm muscles, which can help to improve your overall bench press strength.<br><br> Improve your form: Make sure you are using proper form and technique when bench pressing. This will help you to lift more weight and reduce your risk of injury.<br><br> Rest and recovery: Adequate rest and recovery is essential for muscle growth and strength. Make sure you&#039;re getting enough sleep and that you&#039;re allowing enough time between workout sessions for your muscles to recover.<br><br> Consult a coach or a trainer: Consult with a coach or a trainer who can help you to evaluate your current training program and make recommendations for how to improve your bench press strength.<br><br>It&#039;s important to remember that reaching a specific weight or rep goal is not the only indicator of progress, and it&#039;s important to keep in mind that every person&#039;s body is different and it&#039;s important to listen to your own body, and not to compare yourself to others.", "time": 1674296227, "resto": 69672506}, {"no": 69673503, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)05:34:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69673243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69673243</a><br>This. <br>I have a decent bench, but I never bothered Dumbbell pressing.

I\u2019m leaning towards this product called nutrafol which takes a nutrition-based approach to fortifying your hair health by detoxing your body, giving it tonic herbs to deal with stress better, and help provide the nutrients needed for healthy and balanced hair growth.

In smaller gyms I ran my own business like in your post but it can be difficult to get enough clients. I worked at a Golds as well and there you work for the gym and are paid hourly and the gym takes 90% of the cost of the lesson from the customer, which was far more than I ever charged on my own. We were given an emotionally manipulative script to memorize and run through throughout the workout that made me feel like a used car salesman every time I recited it. Despite this artificiality it worked nearly every time which was discouraging to my soul. I went from sharing a passion I was knowledgeable about to taking advantage of easily manipulated people which I take no pleasure in, furthermore the company got all the money and left me with an hourly pittance. I was the top trainer at the gym with all my hours full and was miserable for most of the day except with a few of my regular clients that had fallen in love with lifting and made great progress.<br>I had a few high watermark moments though, mostly when I was still independent in smaller gyms<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get a new client, 45 year old Mexican father, hasn\u2019t exercised since he played football in high school</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we develop a great relationship and he books many sessions, often doublebooking for extra time, I also train him for free and lift with him as a workout buddy outside of our scheduled sessions</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the span of six months he lost twenty pounds, went from a 185 deadlift to 365, had way more energy and spent more time with his kids, back no longer hurt, et cetera</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;before I moved away I worked out with him and his son, who he had been training the same way I trained him.

In my experience, there are two distinct sorts of pain involved with exercise:<br>1.) soreness - this is from ripping your muscles and stressing your joints and ligaments. This is literally what exercise is: destroying your body so that it will grow back stronger. This is good. This is known as DOMS (Delayed onset muscle soreness) and usually sets in 2 or 3 days after exercise. This goes away over the months and years as you get stronger.<br>2.) sharp pain - this is a sign that you went too far. Maybe you lifted too much weight or ran too far or long or maybe you used poor weightlifting form. Fix whatever you did wrong to avoid this. Don&#039;t do the thing that causes this.<br><br>The line between these is something you learn. As I type I realize that part of learning to exercise is learning to discriminate between these types of pains, because it&#039;s most relevant in the beginning. This is probably why people advise newbies to take it easy. <br><br>Personal example: I recently did a new aggressive burpee + kettlebell press regimen. My shoulders were fine the next day but the second day I could barely life my arms due to shoulder sorenss/quai pain. My instinct told me that I shouldn&#039;t do that exercise anymore, but I kept with it and now I don&#039;t get that pain anymore. It was just DOMS. <br><br>Yes risk is higher for beginners. You are made out of jelly. Learn to embrace DOMS. That doesn&#039;t mean you have to work out when things hurt. Let your body recover before going again. If you can find some manner of harnessing the power of motivation - if you can find the fuel (mind is disgust and resentment at my society) then you will have something for the moment a few months from now where you want to quit. That is the real test: what will fuel you to continue when it&#039;s not new and exciting? Maybe you can internalize the joy of new capabilities and fitness as you improve and use that to continue.", "time": 1674259450, "resto": 69665788}, {"no": 69669349, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:06:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69665788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69665788</a><br>i was in the exact situation (and frankly i still am) it gets easier each week, just do not stop.", "time": 1674259606, "resto": 69665788}, {"no": 69669408, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:14:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69669349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69669349</a><br>Don&#039;t listen to this fag.

Being fat should never be normalized because deep down women will always know that the most masculine men crave dainty vulnerable innocent SKINNY women.", "filename": "ZW20-BID01L_08X_F1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 855, "h": 1290, "tn_w": 165, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674302026551712, "time": 1674302026, "md5": "QGfMBXMjw4+lptEeA0bFkw==", "fsize": 56144, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fat-women-consider-all-skinny-women-to-be-1010", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 69673963, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:00:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why did you need to make a whole thread for this", "time": 1674302419, "resto": 69673922}, {"no": 69673970, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:00:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Yeah, that pic is more of less the ideal body.

I just want you to know that you deserve better than this site and whatever creepy white guy sent you here, you should be with someone that respects you and doesn&#039;t put you in an awkward position like this.

Here are a few tips to help you find the energy to hit the gym after work:<br><br> Prioritize your workout: Make your workout a priority and schedule it into your day just like any other important task or appointment.<br><br> Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for energy and recovery. Try to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night.<br><br> Eat well: Eating a balanced diet that includes protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats can help to provide you with the energy you need to power through your workout.<br><br> Plan ahead: Pack your gym bag the night before and have your workout clothes laid out so you&#039;re ready to go when you get home.<br><br> Take a nap: If you&#039;re feeling tired, try taking a short nap before your workout. Even a 20-minute power nap can help to boost your energy levels.<br><br> Bring a friend: Exercising with a friend can make your workout more enjoyable and help to hold you accountable.<br><br> Try a pre-workout supplement: Some people find that consuming a pre-workout supplement before hitting the gym can help to boost energy and focus.<br><br>Remember that it&#039;s important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. It&#039;s ok to take rest days, and if you&#039;re feeling too tired, it&#039;s better to take a rest than risk injury.", "time": 1674299449, "resto": 69673670}, {"no": 69673697, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:12:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69673670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69673670</a><br>I don&#039;t.

Like what if I get stuck and can&#039;t deadlift more? I&#039;m thinking the way out of that is to do another variation that moves more weight like a sumo, since it limits the ROM and certain parts of your body get more used to that higher weight, so that will help you with the conventional later on at a lower weight you couldn&#039;t do?

They speak nothing of the actual quality of beef. This is especially true for ground beef. Lots of claims of &quot;it&#039;s the same thing.&quot; Think for a second, retards. If it was the same, why is it significantly cheaper? If you take the same cut of beef that&#039;s selling for say... $15/lb then grind it into ground, it should be MORE expensive, not less. It is the same product with slightly more labor and equipment; that always adds a cost. <br><br>Unless you see the butcher doing it or you do it yourself, what you are getting from that ground beef are all the shit and scrapes; the stuff they wouldn&#039;t normally sell. It is nowhere near the same as buying a whole steak. It&#039;s not even the same quality as a frankensteak cobbled together with transglutaminase. <br><br>With actual steaks, there&#039;s still a huge variance in quality. Probably the most prominent indicator is marbling, or intramuscular fat content. If you&#039;re buying some bargin bin $5/lb steak, it&#039;s going to be tough and tasteless as shit, and very likely not all that fresh and from a cow that wasn&#039;t exactly in its prime.

This was when I started hitting the gym, and due to my familiarity I lost 20 pounds along with gaining back a lot of my muscle I had lost due to very strict gym closures the year prior.<br><br>Anyways, being fit in lean does multiple things.

I had forgotten how much that helps. Also, worth noting, the impact is literally measurable depending on how committed you are. You can put hours of work into a project or relationship and feel very little to even no reward that makes it worth it. With being fit, that&#039;s not the case if you are actually doing the work.

You get the idea.<br><br>This is really where you get treated better.

Sure, but there are limits.For one, how can you take care of another person if you can&#039;t take care of yourself in the most basic way possible? What ultimately happens is you don&#039;t have the foundation to achieve even the most basic tasks to take of the most basic thing that also happens to one of the most important: your physical health. You&#039;ll have to overcompensate, I have yet to meet an obese person who doesn&#039;t do this. They try to do it by being overly self-depreciating to be funny, or trying to show off their financial success or even by trying to hard to get a ton of women to show they are sexually vibrant despite people thinking otherwise. They&#039;re always trying to overcompensate in some area to the point it becomes their personality. They lack balance and moderation and stability. I mean this not just in personality but even in money, confidence and especially their own relationships with people.<br><br>When you are also fit you just can say no more easily, at least for me, and I&#039;m generally a really agreeable person. I think when I was out of shape I just felt undeserving or even desperate. An attractive woman&#039;s attention starts making you thankful, which is horrible. Being fit is you setting a standard, and you can apply that in real life. You become familiar with the feeling of saying no to things because you do it with yourself all the time now. You say no to getting wasted, or smoking pot all day to cope. You start saying no to foods that are soley there for comfort. You say no to fat family members who want to drag you down. It&#039;s hard and uncomfortable, but so is muscle soreness and getting up to go to the gym. The entire process of being fit is being uncomfortable. You become familiar with it.<br><br>Saying no really empowers you IF you have the leverage to do it. Good luck bros.
