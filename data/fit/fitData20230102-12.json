But in BJJ since it&#039;s actually targeted towards white collar desk jockey hobbyists, I&#039;ve seen a better culture of explaining it. Judo is more like, just keep trying whatever until it works. No explanation of strategy or whatever. And that&#039;s fine since it works for a lot of people, and especially for kids. I think that a non-trivial part of the judo learning curve is that you&#039;re pretty much meant to get into it as a kid.

I think I&#039;m gonna be different by the summer solstice. The king of pentacles will be my guide to the material. I should be making more mature financial decisions anyway. In terms of fitness I think this is gonna be a technique and maintenance phase. I might end up doing some bodybuilder routine, lots of volume but low stress per excercise. I should learn my cardio as well. <br>Until then, I will be cutting. My winter cards (starting Dec 21 2022) are the empress and the page of cups. So I&#039;ve certainly been exploring my relationships and seeking out a deeper connection to my vulnerabile side. But I do thing with the page, encouraging me to be curious about new relationships, and the empress encouraging me to be vulnerable, I may fall victim to heartbreak. So to protect myself I am going to adopt some of the more healthy coping mechanisms I had when I was younger and more socially successful. Anyway, why I am cutting: Currently 215 and wanna be 195 by valentine&#039;s, at least 200. If I don&#039;t have an interest by then I may fall victim and start participating in social media again (Instagram twitter tinder and so) not certain yet, depends how lonely I get. Currently supping vit d cause seasonal affective disorder lmao, also zinc, magnesium, caffeine, creatine and protein for various reasons most of them lifting. <br>Currently my lifts are 1/2/3/4 give or take ten pounds with working sets of 5 at 90% of that. Doing shieko style but I&#039;m gonna do 5/3/1 BBB cause it&#039;s actually pretty exciting to me. If you want me to pull a card for you let me know and I might make a thread.
