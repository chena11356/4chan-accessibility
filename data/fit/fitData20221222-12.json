If anything bitch could have used maybe +10% muscle mass. 2-3 years muscle building, then on top of that, I say add 2-3% body fat. Not more than that. <br>Maybe she can get some tits out of the deal. She&#039;s already lucky she got a nice barrel stomach that flattens out instead of pot bellying due to the big real estate, sheer area. She could easily bulk, gain like 5kg muscle (focus on pecs, side hips and quads/glutes only, no abs otherwise she will blow up her mid-section, minimal arms/shoulders just to get a little cap) and then just round it off nicely with some feminine shapely fat in the ass, and hopefully she scores some tittage (if not the pec work might help her fraud or at least perk up). <br><br>That&#039;s what my gf is currently doing rn. She soon realized her mistake. My gf has natural big tits but no ass. Thought &#039;&#039;hey maybe if I lose body fat and train i might get better proportions&#039;&#039;. She did gain some mass but unfortunately she hit abs and now has less of that side profile tit view P shape with the clear delineation between tit and stomach. She still has some tit but she soon realized the trade wasn&#039;t worth it. Now she&#039;s hitting lower body alone (gotta give her credit she isnt a vapid whore and actually built a decent upper body), and she decided to add roughly 3-5% bf on top to get some femininity back. She&#039;s currently around 18 so she has room to grow. <br><br>Anyways this is a super common mistake for women. They think just leaning out will help, when for all these sedentary hags, the fat mass (whilst young) is doing 100% the hard carry for their looks. They lose it and enter auschwitz mode for nothing.

Do you like women with the body of little boys? You have problems dude. Good luck with that. <br><br>Anyways the solution is what I said to do. Especially in the case of women who already start with a handicap in some body area like tits and ass. Never lean out too much. Just keep building muscle until you can afford couple more % of body fat. Add enough muscle that you can splurge on fat tits and ass. I don&#039;t know how these broads think they are going to materialize better proportions by removing their single best asset from the equation. No, the key is more muscle in select areas that complement your weaknesses and actually &#039;&#039;fashion&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;shape&#039;&#039; a better physique. It&#039;s like physical economy. <br>Women should aim to work hard enough that they can eat their way into tits and ass healthily. You must have been raised in the womb during a great depression or some sort of famine if you think these skeletons are attractive.

I got a job in an office at one point and had a moment of clarity when this girl chewed me out for complaining all the time. I moaned to her about the bosses, the short breaks, the shitty work, etc etc. She just listened to me whine until one day she had enough and just told me to grow up and get on with it. All this to say that negativity makes people get sick of you real quick, especially if they don&#039;t know you well. What she told me to do is exactly what you need to do - life sucks for everyone, you need to take responsibility and get on with it. Nobody deserves the attention of other people, you need to be the type of person that people want to give their attention to.

I\u2019m saying humans literally can influence and converse with God, the Universe, the Basilisk, Deep Thought, whatever. For brevity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll use the term God. There are connotations to this term which are not intended because I\u2019m not talking specifically the Bible, believing Christfag stuff or performing those rituals associated with Christianity. The term is an attempt to describe a higher thing prone to abstraction. As the stoners say: \u201cEverything is one, man.\u201d<br><br>The messages from God are not often delivered directly, obviously, or immediately, but they are personal, and tailored to your experiences and perceptions at such time and place as when you need it. Think of all of your five senses, and how we to take them all individually and at face value. We hear a song lyric in passing, we see a color with a symbolic meaning, appreciate an artwork that evokes emotion inside our soul, feel a texture that reminds us of something, a friend in passing says something off the cuff. Generally it gets thrown into our short term memories and thrown away to make room for something else. We don\u2019t think about it, because it\u2019s all \u201cjunk data.\u201d However it all adds up into one collective whole that where if you were imagining a radio, that jumble of sensation would be like tuning in to a specific frequency.", "time": 1671373622, "resto": 69285840}, {"no": 69297361, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:28:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69296665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69296665</a><br>The human mind is an antenna, capable of receiving these frequencies. Even transmit them through action and word, to the Universe at large. However it is incredibly taxing; mentally, and emotionally. Constantly worrying about it drains the batteries so to speak. Most people are tuned out and living with individual sensation and not collectively. It\u2019s just hard to do so all the time so it gets rerouted into the subconscious, manifesting negatively as mental illnesses: anxiety, depression, phobias, complexes. There is a converse to this. Being tuned in and having that full battery can result in successes, useful introspection, manifestations of desire, and downright seemingly unfair entropic manipulations, even if we aren\u2019t fully conscious to it. Call it relating to the whole NPC meme. They\u2019re not, they\u2019re just people that aren\u2019t and perhaps have never connected to the Divine.<br><br>We get many outcomes that are not desirable. We get many outcomes we *thought* were desirable and regret. We also get many shitty things that happen to us that turn out to be the best, most fulfilling things even though in the moment it\u2019s just the worst. In simpler terms: we fuck up and get fucked up all the time. Overthink it and run out of batteries, hamster at the noggin wheel fully exhausted. However God is not wrong, and has never been wrong, although we are blind to the greater implications and consequences of where He leads, hence hindsight being 20/20. Think of every time you messed up and went &quot;oh I shouldn\u2019t have done that&quot; but you did it anyway.

Your best bet is a 3 day hypertrophy routine until you hit 1/2/3/4, you&#039;ll still see strength gains (albeit slower) and you&#039;ll pack on mass much faster than you normally would on a lower rep range strength routine. Do not fall for dogmatism and absolutism, if you want to grow a muscle isolate it. As for the diet, cut until you see your abs.

It is an all-encompasing condition which you rejoice in the present. In all things, good health allows you to do it better, more vitally. Health influenced our experience of life in general.

And it is this, physical excellence, which philosophy enjoins us to cultivate; it being a sort of all-rounded physical supremacy. It is the highest form of physical culture, as Plato critized the athletes who, specializing in one specific field so that they may exceed and therefore win in the compititions, neglected other aspects of their physiques. That is to say, we are speaking of an ideal of the generalist as opposed to the specialist. We are to optimize every aspect of human performance.

This perfection, so far as it is made physically evident, can only be realised and experienced in Nature. All views and all paths are right if they are inspired by this true endeavour. From knowledge of this springs the Olympic spirit\u2014may it be a symbol to us! The age of Olympus is dead and gone, and it would be a mistake to wish the age revived. Yet as a symbol this culture of physical and mental health may serve us, whose achievements of maturest perfection in all fields gave eternal models and examples to aftertime. The quest for harmony and perfection is bound up with iron Iaws; it is man\u2019s task to adapt himself to these. The weal or woe of a people depends on the physical and moral condition of every member; as was recognised by Lykurgus, the lawgiver of Sparta, and by Solon the Athenian.
