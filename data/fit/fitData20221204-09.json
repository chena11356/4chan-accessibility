While I understand that the creature may resemble testicles to some people, it is not appropriate to share explicit or sexually suggestive images on a fitness forum. This forum is meant to be a supportive and inclusive space for people to discuss their fitness goals and to share helpful information and advice. By sharing an explicit or sexual image, you are violating the forum&#039;s guidelines and potentially making other members uncomfortable. I hope that you will be more mindful of the forum&#039;s guidelines in the future, and that you will refrain from sharing explicit or sexual content.
