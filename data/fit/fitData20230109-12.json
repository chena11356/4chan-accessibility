More so once you increase your protein intake. For overall health, wellness, and recovery, make sure you get all the foods you need for a good diet. I made another post about my college days diet in another thread, mostly lamb, mushrooms, onions, spinach, broccoli, beans, and fruits like berries. That will hit all the little micronutrient goals. If you&#039;re lazy or cheap, you can even meet calorie and protein goals by chugging down like 400 calories of protein powder and water to get like 50g or protein. <br><br>Just get a balanced diet with tons of protein. Lower calories to lose the weight, don&#039;t expect it to be fast, don&#039;t think about it too much past that. You aren&#039;t some morbidly obese fuck, so a normal human being diet will work.

We remained good friends, though. Very sweet girl. But when I went to see her recently in our thirties, turns out she was fat. Really, really fat. Landwhale fat. (Her husband isn&#039;t fat, though, lol). She hit the wall, too. Not hard, but a little. Whatever, though, I made nothing of it and sipped my beer while we caught up. Then this old guy sat down next to me and gave his order and drank his beer. And when my friend went away to serve a table, the old guy leaned over to me and whispered, &quot;They use to have hot women working here, what the hell happened?&quot; And it shocked me for some reason. To hear that. I knew she was fat, that she wasn&#039;t looking good at all. I wouldn&#039;t date a girl who looked like her if you put a gun to my head. But somehow that guy shocked me. I&#039;ll never forget the feeling. It&#039;s like my brain hadn&#039;t caught up to my eyes or reality until that guy put it bluntly. I don&#039;t feel bad for her. She made her choices.

If I just didn&#039;t ignore, one word responded, ghosted or just stared at girls talking to me until they left it all would have been fine. By an interval of like 4 years, I learned enough social skills to be able to succeed with the women from those 4 years ago.

At 22 I knew about all the chances I missed at 18, at 26 I learned about the chances at 22, and so on. By the age of 26 I had basically &quot;turned down&quot; 10 advances of diffrent women from ages 13 to 25 that all would have lead to some kind of relationship if I just knew what was going on and pursued them with interest. Like I said, I didn&#039;t need to be good at any of the social games that most people find natural, I just needed to catch up with this social awareness interval and it would have been fine and I never did.<br><br>The scary thing now at 31 is I haven&#039;t had any of these revelations since age 26 or so. I have to guess its because I interact with women so sparingly nowdays that I just haven&#039;t got enough experience to unconsciously receive any kind of revelation. Or the interval have increased and I&#039;m in for a big suprise in a few years, to know of even more missed opportunities.<br><br>It just doesnt feel like before though since the only women I interact with are from work.

You&#039;re at the point where you have absolutely fried your metabolism if you are at OMAD. Honestly try a refeed week to try to prime it back to a state where you can lose it. Don&#039;t underestimate cardio as well. Most importantly you need to recognize being that lean is not sustainable for naturals. It is transitory. My last few lbs came off from me doing a week of apple cider vinegar, kale shakes, and rice cakes. I didn&#039;t drink water at all for the last 36 hours and also took a bath in epsom salts. It was so fucking stupid. I was delusional just to get some pictures. My best friend and training partner did it with me and he passed out in the locker room and started shaking. Seriously, if you&#039;re trying to hit low single digit, recognize it is TEMPORARY and accept it with grace when you gain the weight back and become sustainable again. Also why are you even cutting that hard? Girls? For yourself? Competition? Why?

The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry. Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poop -molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky poop/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm. Unfortunately, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil</span><br>1/2", "filename": "jdshower", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1017, "h": 759, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 186, "tim": 1673176453993642, "time": 1673176453, "md5": "c7CHiC0TRSCVS32NlMjUZw==", "fsize": 156068, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "qtddtot", "replies": 102, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 57, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 69521089, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:14:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69521084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69521084</a><br>2/2<br><br>Here comes the question: wouldn&#039;t that only happen to a fat fucking whale?

Make sure you&#039;re not protracting at the top as that will recruit the pec minor, which isn&#039;t a bad thing as I think more people should train that muscle too, but it&#039;s a different exercise (pec minor dips as opposed to lower trap dips). I like these because they&#039;re extremely non-invasive, you can put them almost anywhere in your program in a superset/giantset with few issues. If this doesn&#039;t seem to do anything though then give the trap-3 raises a shot as for whatever reason everybody recommends them for lower traps. I&#039;d also recommend some direct external rotator work if you&#039;re not doing them already (Facepulls do involve them but I MUCH prefer doing an isolated movement for the infraspinatus/teres minor because facepulls tend to be more rear delt dominant which isn&#039;t a bad thing necessarily but you could just do powell raises for that instead). Other than that I can recommend maybe trying some band dislocations and lu raises, but honestly I never did these consistently so I don&#039;t think they provide a ton of extra benefit, I&#039;m just throwing out everything I&#039;ve ever heard relating to shoulder issues. The final thing I can say is that it could just be the way you&#039;re doing the lift; I had some mild left shoulder pain from behind the neck press but I fixed it by learning how to force upward rotation of the scapula very early in the lift (just try to do the motion while trying to use your upper traps as much as possible to upwardly rotate and elevate your scapulae, you should feel them a lot even without holding any weight), now I have 0 shoulder discomfort doing BTNP to failure.", "time": 1673238524, "resto": 69524711}, {"no": 69530875, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)23:30:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69530148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69530148</a><br><a href=\"#p69530854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69530854</a><br>For horizontal presses it could be that you&#039;re holding scapula retraction the entire time, from what I&#039;ve heard the optimal way your scapula should be moving on horizontal presses is retraction on the negative, and protraction into neutral (if bench variation) or full protraction (pushup variation), so maybe you can try that and see if it resolves your shoulder issues.
