I&#039;m not young anymore and have noticed a significant improvement from adding even just a little cardio. inb4 I&#039;m fat - been athletic my whole life, wrestling and martial arts background. just wanted to share some rowing joy, bros - simple as. I didn&#039;t even realize they stored vertically til I did some research, so I always thought with limited space it wasn&#039;t feasible to get one.

Proper quad IM injections are in the lateralis, so if sitting down with the knee at 90 degrees, the syringe is parallel to the floor entering the side of the leg. Put your middle finger in the little pocket on the side of your kneecap and extend your thumb out as far up the side of your leg as you can, where your thumb lands is right around where ideal quad IM location is.<br>-This one is just me, but stick the needle in slowly.

Congrats man, you&#039;ve logically deduced the most basic thing about fitness that makes 0 sense but people keep trying to shill it to confuse you and sell you their programs and solutions. RIR and RPE and all that shit is useless because you literally are incapable of knowing how many you could have gotten without actually reaching failure. The only thing you can really know about where your RPE is at is if you&#039;re at either 0 (rest) or 10 (failure). Anything between those two is a complete mystery and literally cannot be used to make a basis for a consistent approach with training.<br><br>Good thing you don&#039;t need that shit anyway. Just hit failure. Once is enough. Anywhere between 5-35 reps until you fail. Approach it very slowly with 5 seconds up, 5 seconds down, and short pauses at the bottom and the top. Fail within 60-90 seconds of beginning the lift. Only use enough weight to get to failure within that timeframe. Only add more when your times start to go above that range. One set, per session per muscle group, twice per week maximum unless you roid.<br><br>Train to failure, rest enough to recover, rest even more to grow. <br><br>Do this and you will get the same fucking results as doing 5-10 sets and you will have 0 risk of overtraining or undertraining. Everything else is either a scam or under/misinformed people trying to help even though they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing and they are just parroting someone else that also does not know what they are doing. You&#039;ll save a shitload of time and never be confused if you do this. It&#039;s safer since you&#039;re going slow and using lighter weights as a result and is also consistent. There&#039;s literally no reason to do anything else, unless you just like training another way. If you just want results and don&#039;t want any of the fitness industry horseshit, just do this.<br><br>Sources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1iQ-OGWrY6qvdjtSq4aEcATp1nwf743suWZ<wbr>R9VpwfHw0/edit?usp=sharing", "filename": "Henneman-Size-Principle-MU-Recruitment-graphic-2", "ext": ".png", "w": 1341, "h": 843, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1675529781927631, "time": 1675529781, "md5": "kOanlVZwnYdK4w0/ITyJRQ==", "fsize": 79257, "resto": 69831839}, {"no": 69843551, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)11:57:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69843528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69843528</a><br>Fuck me, I fell for a bot", "time": 1675529847, "resto": 69831839}, {"no": 69843554, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)11:57:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69841380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69841380</a><br>You look good", "time": 1675529857, "resto": 69831839}, {"no": 69843555, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)11:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69843431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69843431</a><br>you are overweight, there&#039;s no way around it, your face complexion is simply overly pudgy", "time": 1675529874, "resto": 69831839}, {"no": 69843597, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)12:02:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69843431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69843431</a><br>nigga you fat", "time": 1675530142, "resto": 69831839}, {"no": 69843600, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)12:03:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p69843551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69843551</a><br>Do I look like a bot, child?<br><br>This conversation is boring me.

The other sets you can continue to do as normal if you want, but hit failure at least once on every exercise every session. You might not be going hard enough to stimulate growth and there&#039;s no real way to know for sure unless you hit failure. If you&#039;re worried about being in a weird position and failing, like with the pike for example, you can do that motion until you are getting close and then superset it with something a lot safer like an overhead press with something in the nearby vicinity that is relatively light like some books or something.

Pretty much everyone can consistently make gains with this frequency. You may also want to regularly take 10 days off every 6-8 weeks. Training breaks can help break plateaus if you experience them. Also, pay attention to how you feel when you begin a session. If you still feel like total dogshit from last time, you should not do a session on that day. It is very hard to fuck up over-resting. You essentially just have to give up lifting to fuck up with over-resting. It takes 3 weeks for atrophy to start. Your gains will not disappear so long as you consistently exercise. It&#039;s far more likely that you will overtrain than over-rest<br><br>I&#039;m assuming that you&#039;re not ridiculously jacked, but even if you were, 40s should work pretty well. Just make sure to go very very close to failure on your bodyweight exercises to fatigue the muscle as much as possible.

It did great for that but our house is from the 1800s and the pipes are probably not good. There&#039;s a lot of sediment in our water that the Brita didn&#039;t filter out for some reason. In my exasperation I got that RO system but I should have probably done a bit more research beforehand.<br>For one, it&#039;s one of their passive systems which means its efficiency is dependent on your house water pressure. Cold water also makes it less efficient. You can make it wildly more efficient by buying a permeate pump, which they also sell. Second: the tank is not just a tank but a special air cushioned shell that provides the pressure, meaning it can break. Depending on your use it might be better to invest in a pump-driven system up front. The downside to a pumped system is that it needs power to give you water and the RO membranes are a larger and much more expensive size.<br>I was going for cheap at the time.

I start by doing 10 sets of an exercise (40-60 second rest period between sets), and switch to 8 sets with an increased number of reps before rotating back to 10 sets. Gains are starting to come fast and my level of endurance continuously surprises me. I think doing low intensity cardio before every workout has really helped. I will begin cutting down to 170 pounds when summer begins and hopefully at that weight my lower abs and obliques will be showing. And yes, my gains would probably be much faster if I did SS or some other normie shit, but it wouldn&#039;t be nearly as much fun.

There are all these different so-called diets out there and the reality is they can all work.<br><br>What are you defining as &quot;weight loss&quot;? The term weight loss is often confused with the term fat loss. So you can lose 50lbs and still look flabby, is that ok with you?

If you mean fastest, my answer is simply eating nothing.<br><br>I can&#039;t tell you the &quot;best&quot; diet for weight loss, I will also make the assumption you have confused weight loss with fat loss. My opinion is that following these steps will result in a variable, sustainable diet that CAN result in a leaner more muscular body if combined with strength training:<br>1. Eat 1g/lb in protein<br>2. Double your bodyweight (lbs) and multiply it by 0.35, this is how many grams of carbs a day, do the same but multiply by 0.15, this is how many grams of fat per day.<br>3. Figure out an easy to follow diet that reaches roughly these numbers that you can eat every day: avoid ultra-processed foods, most vegetables have so little macros they should be eaten without affecting your results negatively while providing micronutrients.<br>4. To encourage fat loss, lower your carbs by 10, your fat by 5 and your protein by 5<br>5. After two weeks, if no progress, lower the numbers again.<br><br>Getting that much protein can be hard, best sources: turkey, chicken breast, eggs, egg white, edamame beans, tofu, skyr or low fat yoghurt, canned fish.
