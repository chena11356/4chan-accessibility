After that vacation, Moore would drive from his home in South Carolina to wait outside the home of the victim.

There is a lot of data collected from a large variety of sellers all over (if for instance we&#039;re looking at the NY Times best seller list, which is the most popular in the US, it is data from all over the US). However, there&#039;s a lot of factors:<br>1) Yes, it is absolutely tallied every week, thus new winners are awarded every week.<br>2) While there are three major categories, there are shit tons of subcategories, so literally dozens can be awarded best seller every single week.<br>3) It is not even a measure of who sold the most that week in that category: there are simple minimums. For big categories I believe it&#039;s 10,000 sold in a single week. For smaller it could be 7500 or 5000.<br>4) Sales are not cumulative, so it has to be 5-10k in a single week, but that also means a book that sells 2k every week for 52 weeks straight will waaaay outsell a book that has a big media push and sells 20k in one week then 10k second week, then practically nothing forever after, but only the latter will have the best seller award.<br><br>And just like movies, publishers know when other books are being published, even by other publishers, so they can time certain books to be released during lulls to boost relative visibility. Along with a halfway decent advertising campaign, it&#039;s rather easy to get on the best seller list, and you only need to get on it for one week to be able to forever parade it on the cover.<br><br>The hardest part is actually convincing the publisher to invest that kind of advertisement push on your book.", "time": 1674801083, "resto": 69731258}, {"no": 69743321, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)03:12:08", "name": "CecilDrakeInSeattle", "com": "<a href=\"#p69742131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;69742131</a><br>They are an adult human of the species, able to give birth.

Eventually that slowed down because I hit a wall for my muscle gains but switched over to essentially lifting maintenance reps in the window of 10-15 per set and 3-4 sets per exercise and increasing my caloric deficit. I drank a fuckload of water, added in cardio, my food intake was very heavy in protein and fiber, and the weight loss continued faster than before.

Has to have lost about 50 pounds in the last 6 months. I work out at a planet fatness by necessity because there&#039;s literally nothing else in the area and $10/mo is cheaper than buying all the shit for a better home gym. Anyway, this gym being a planet memeness there are a lot of fat failures who come for a few weeks, do shitty exercises with light weights and poor form and then disappear forever. I was sure this blubberella was one when she waddled in coated in spandex and started going through some machines.<br><br>Surprisingly she&#039;s stuck to it and is losing weight. I wouldn&#039;t say she looks good but she definitely looks better than when she started coming in, and who knows 6 more months at the gym and she could start looking like a human female again.

I do sometimes accidentally go a few days without carbs and you can really tell in both good and bad ways when you are deeper in ketosis. <br>cook at home you will realize how much time you used to waste eating multiple times a day.

I was a fat fuck, too, in my late teens to really 20s. Since I couldn&#039;t focus anymore and desperately needed to study for my bar exam, my doctor prescribed me Adderall against ADHD (which was obviously a wrong diagnosis as I only couldn&#039;t concentrate because being a lardass hurt my sleep quality and made my T levels drop to next to zero).<br>The diagnosis was wrong, but the medication was right. That stuff made me completely forget any feeling of hunger because it&#039;s a powerful appetite suppressant, I would go entire days without eating without even realizing (only bad thing was that it affected my thirst as well, so I had to force myself to drink enough water). I got to normal weight within a year or so and also started lifting weights.<br><br>Then, I realized that I didn&#039;t even need the medication anymore because my overall brain chemistry had returned to healthy levels (no sugar + fat addiction anymore, sufficient T levels, good quality of sleep). I could focus again without any issue and had no cravings for food anymore. So I just stopped taking the pills regularly (I still took them on occasion when I had to study very intensely for a specific exam, I only ceased taking them altogether about a year ago) and I&#039;ve maintained a healthy weight ever since (approximately five years now).<br><br>Adderall/dexamphetamine is an amazing drug to overcome an addiction - which obesity is, really, it&#039;s nothing but a food addiction.

It gets easier and easier, and its fun. Just don&#039;t be a creep. People usually avoid eye contact with strangers completely, so even 1 second of eye contact indicates some kind of interaction/interest. Staring is legitimately aggression, so no more than 3 seconds at the most. 1-2 second is enough to get the point across and gauge interest. Ignore any woman that looks away immediately. Possible approach if there is a smile, smirk, blush, etc. Absolute approach if she starts obviously hovering in the area. Also, no neutral facial expression because it means the nature of your interest is hidden and that is creepy. Look up smiling with your eyes. A smile with teeth breaks aloofness. Also, you might be called a creep if you check out one girl and not her friend and the other gets jealous. With people you work with there needs to be much more subtlety.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2nd glance only, if its the first eye contact and you smile you look like a psycho. I make eye contact once, look away, then about 3 seconds later I look again. When you make eye contact for the second time just maintain eye contact- shell look away again, just keep looking until she meets your eyes again (3rd time). Then you can smile, if she smiles back then go talk to her. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It sound austistic when I break it down like that but its kind of automatic for me, always seems to work for me.

They&#039;re so EXHAUSTING!<br><br>I&#039;ll let you guys in on a little secret. Kids are easy as fuck if you aren&#039;t stupid, weak, lazy, and poor. It&#039;s no surprise that those 4 traits are often connected to one another. Stupid? Yeah, you&#039;re almost definitely poor. Weak? Yeah you&#039;re likely lazy and stupid also.

I don&#039;t want my kids growing up around some out of shape weakling who eats goyslop and feeds them the same and allows them to be lazy. They will grow up around two parents who cook the family meals every night of the week, who go outside and exercise, who emphasize sports and competition, who demonstrate that it&#039;s normal adult behavior to be invested in your own health and to go to the gym to lift weights a minimum 4 days per week.<br><br>Sometimes I look at other parents who are weak fat messes and younger than I am, and I look at their kids - oftentimes starting to get pudgy themselves. It&#039;s no wonder there&#039;s an obesity problem, these people are never taught to take any pride in themselves. They&#039;re raised to be fat, weak, stupid losers from day one. They will get older, fatter, dumber, and constantly demand more and more accommodation, convenience, support, anything to take away any form of exertion from their lives. I&#039;m convinced most people would be happy becoming the Wall-E fat fucks.
