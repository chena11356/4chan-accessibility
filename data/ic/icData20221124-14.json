If what makes you care about art is the fact that it&#039;s tangible, then your interest in art is purely consumption-based, not experience-based.Digital art is not as constrained by the medium as other traditional artistic mediums are, giving it a much wider expressive potential. And sure, some things are &#039;easier&#039; in digital, but the complexity lies in how and what you paint moreso than wasting time with annoying shit like running out of paint or medium or making a mess. So long as there is drawing and painting going on, the struggle and experience of the artist will always shine through.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2</span><br>Spoken like a true artlet.
