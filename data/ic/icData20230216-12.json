Also the alignment of the chin/mouth looks off and needs adjusting in lieu of the mouth shape.

I mainly make profits from selling my books and original page art at art shows and comic and anime conventions. I fund my print runs with crowdfunding campaigns, and then sell the books for pure profit at shows. My evergreen bestseller is Purrvana, a colorful watercolor painted psychedelic cat graphic novel that appeals to normies of all ages and all demographics from bikers to gangsters to grannies to crazy cat ladies. I have sold over 2,500 copies of Purrvana to date. I also make money from commissions, both my OCs and other people. Most of my commissions are catfight wrestling matches featuring my OCs or other people&#039;s OCs. I advertise mainly on pixiv, discord, twitter and my webcomic also works as an advertisement. I also drew animal coloring books years ago that still sell, at shows and online. After a bad experience working with a publisher several years ago, I began self publishing and now that&#039;s all I want to do.<br><br>I read that Image creators are in the red and go in to debt with Image unless their book sells a certain amount of copies. I recently read tweets from an image artist who says that after his book he worked on sold 5 issues at 15,000 issues each, he only made $1100 in profit and he got paid months after the final issue came out, after the profit share was split with image, the writer and colorist. I don&#039;t sell a high volume of copies, and my crowdfunders don&#039;t go crazy, but I still make a lot more profit than that Image artist whose book was selling 15,000 copies each issue for example because I keep all the profit of sales for myself. I also do freelance work. Advertising and marketing is not really something I&#039;m good at, but I&#039;m getting by and trying to improve at it. I&#039;m also going to start a life drawing class at my local Junior College next week and I hope it will up my skills so I can charge more for commissions, and it will also improve my comic pages.

Matrix cites Otaku USA, which in turn cites Anime News Network. The ANN article in question is about Demon Slayer&#039;s sales in Japan for the October 19-25 week in 2020, according to Oricon. Though not part of the headline story, the article states that the series had 100 million copies in circulation (including digital copies, which Oricon does not count), not sales, as of the 22nd volume&#039;s release on October 2.<br><br>Neither ANN nor Otaku USA reported on American comic book sales. The video version of Matrix&#039;s article indicates that his source for the &quot;15 million&quot; number is a sankaku Complex article, which in turn cites comic book blog The Beat&#039;s analysis of NPD BookScan data for 2019. It should be noted that the analysis is restricted only to the top 750 titles, so the 15 million figure applies only to that selection. It should also be noted that BookScan only represents a selection of retailers, and is not representative of the entire market.<br><br>That said, even the 15 million figure from The Beat&#039;s limited-scope analysis is a lower amount than Oricon&#039;s reported sales figures for Demon Slayer in 2019: 12 million copies. That figure is also disputed; publisher Shueisha reported that the manga sold 10.8 million volumes that year. So Demon Slayer clearly didn&#039;t outsell the American comics industry in the same frame of time. By conflating Demon Slayer&#039;s lifetime circulation numbers with yearly sales and stacking them against partial sales numbers in the American market for 2019, the numbers provided in Matrix&#039;s article paint a misleading picture.&quot;<br><br>And this source came from a anime focused website .

The problem with drawing poses in extreme perspective like this is that even a photo can look &quot;off,&quot; so your drawing from said photo will be judged as inaccurate even if you reproduced the image 1:1. This is why artists from antiquity on through the 19th century tended to paint figures in poses with most of the limbs seen at full length. Perspective lens distortion within a figure was almost unheard of, and even foreshortening was used with caution. Typically, a foreshortened limb or figure would have to be coupled with a full-length limb/figure so the viewer had a &quot;reference&quot; by which to judge the foreshortened parts. Coom art drawn from close-up reference photos with lense distortion is aesthetically less pleasing than, say, a Bouguereau, but coomers have horrible taste and only care about seeing monster tits on their FOTM anime girl so they can cry, &quot;Momma!&quot; while jerking it.", "time": 1676520533, "resto": 6521252}, {"no": 6521674, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)23:15:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;pose art manikin or action figure performing a kick</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;use as pose reference</span><br>??????", "time": 1676520924, "resto": 6521252}, {"no": 6521792, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)02:38:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6521478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6521478</a><br>The artist is mostly correct, but he messed up a bit around the butts and pelvis imo.

Once you can see the whole figure, it&#039;s easier to notice what is off. With less strokes on the page it&#039;s easier to fix the mistakes too. With a gesture drawing approach likes Glenn Vilppus, about 30 seconds is enough to get the major masses and limbs down. At that point I just check that the hips are at about halfway of the length of the figure and visually measure that it&#039;s around 7 to 8 heads tall, that&#039;s usually enough. For longer drawings or harder poses, more time is spent double checking stuff. You may find you keep making the same proportional mistakes, so that&#039;s something you can study and be on the lookout for.<br>A lot of the time you have to deal with foreshortened limbs and overlapping forms so it takes a lot of practice. There is also choosing what to exaggerate or idealize. For example, you can make the legs longer and it will usually look better, so when in doubt you can make them a bit longer.", "time": 1675939541, "resto": 6505776}, {"no": 6512816, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)08:14:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6512687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6512687</a><br>Haha, they were just quick sketches to get the idea across.

I was fascinated when I learned how solid the non-JP comic industries were. American underground and indie comics were a crapshoot, mostly consisting of slice-of-life self-insert shit since quality control in those comics only existed in capeshit, but could still be a goldmine and a second option. Webcomics put more on the table and showed what the potential could be. Things like The Walking Dead were a strong exception to our industry. But, in other countries, a title like that would be on the upper standard and not a rarity.<br>I really believe that the reason why the capeshit print side is hurting is due to the fact America shoehorned comics from being a luxury/fine art industry like in the late 1800s-early 1900s, to being something for kids and all about superheroes.

The first couple lines of a drawing have almost no constraints, the constraint is what you want the scene to communicate", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 553, "h": 281, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 63, "tim": 1676482006934377, "time": 1676482006, "md5": "55W+EyIR4g8+V+GJq4upIQ==", "fsize": 60085, "resto": 6520942}, {"no": 6521008, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)12:26:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6520995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6520995</a><br>The people who draw these<br><br>There is a big difference between someone sketching and drawing on their own and someone who wants to produce a professional piece<br><br><a href=\"#p6521000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6521000</a><br>It should be on libgen", "filename": "20230107_135714", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 3000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676482007906641, "time": 1676482007, "md5": "Q8x5PcEOdxXi/3qDDyYbog==", "fsize": 3348137, "resto": 6520942}, {"no": 6521744, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:04:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6520965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6520965</a><br>I was able to find a pdf for free online easily and can confirm that it&#039;s good. The intro pages should show you everything. If you like video instructions and examples though, I heavily reccommend Drawing Database perspective series. It&#039;s the most in depth formal perspective I&#039;ve seen for artists, go through that and you will understand all the concepts. (dont just watch it either, try and actually DO the drawings with the instructor and that will make them sink in your long term memory). You might have to come back and review stuff, which is where this book might come in handy, as well as the videos.

Fortunately that&#039;s pretty easy to do. <br><br>On the plus side, provided you&#039;re working on decent paper, you have basically endless opportunities to correct your mistakes, and the opacity of the paint will cover up any stains left on the paper from earlier attempts. <br><br>To me, the most important thing is to control the amount of water in your brush; too much water and it makes a mess, too little and it won&#039;t go on smoothly. I have also trained myself to step away and let areas dry before adding another layer; otherwise they just mix on the sheet. Fortunately, this doesn&#039;t take long. <br><br>Also, every single paint will have a different consistency, from smooth to gooey, so you&#039;ll have to get used to that too.

People like collecting artwork of deities, ideas, talismans, and relatable experiences. I make a lot of them with the intention of being worn or to decorate an altar / sacred space. I sell both online and locally, but you could do well by just selling online. The biggest part that you would need to remember is that people will absolutely talk to you about your process, moreso than any other art. Your experiences are a bigger part of the selling point than you&#039;d expect from other niches. If you say you aren&#039;t religious/spiritual and you were just making it for fun, they&#039;ll steer you into thinking you were touched or possessed, so it&#039;s better to nail down your narrative, real or fake. This is because they treat this art as an expression of God, and the market is always hungry for new work.

I do have Christians who buy my stuff, but they&#039;re moreso from the mysticism or multi-path background.

Tyranny and immorality are one and the same. <br>With that out of the way, no matter what is intrinsic, whether you have 8 arms or are quadriplegic, is nearly insignificant in the face of what you leave out- which is free will, conscious choice. It matters what you do, recursively, in everything. Some things, you could make a lifetime argument about, but sex, with the in built equivalent in neuronal and hormonal devotion to that of a long time hard drug addict? It is no less than lifelong, life altering how you choose to approach it.

Love is the answer, and the antithesis to following lust for the sake of lust. Because lust for the sake of lust will lead you- wherever the fuck it wants to. Peruse any number those rabbit holes at your leisure by visiting some neet caves, or just having a casual stroll down any prostitute infested street. It doesn&#039;t take very much care- love- to want to see something better. Any at all in fact that you don&#039;t purposely ignore will wreck any illusions.

You cannot remove lust from love. It is not as black and white as you think. Love is not a zero-sum game. Love can be subtle or bold and all shades of grey. It is about giving in, giving up, and letting go. Or, it can be ethereal, eternal, and undying. Some nuances are lost through time, buried by the current social construct and culture. As an artist, I love classical mythology. Let me give you an example. In the beginning, there was nothing but chaos, and then came Eros, the God of desire, love, and sex. Gaia(earth) and Uranus(atmosphere) had sex(Eros). Without Eros, the desire to have sex which is lust. There will be no existence. The word erotic came from this greek origin, a primordial God named Eros. I can judge others based on their desires. Sure, there is some love more ethereal than others, with less instant gratification and more fruitful. However, we cannot assume that everyone desires the same love, like you and I. We both are on the same page. Here is where we differ. I do not see lust as immoral or wrong. I encourage young men to explore as much as they can afford. Fall in love, make mistakes.

Contrary to not being worldly, it&#039;s eminently worldly to build on other&#039;s forethought and wisdom. We know where choices lead, by our own forethought- which by the way you have regardless of whether or not you choose something likely to be destructive in some way. And we have it by the collective experience of thousands of generations. One of the mental traps people subscribe to these days is thinking you need any depth to avoid the infinite destructive contrivances of the world.

And the more care you take, both the more you find you can control, and the less you find purely frivolous. Your personhood isn&#039;t removed from the example of science, either metaphorically or physically. And lastly, most esoterically, if we agree on transcendence as a fitting attribute of God, then it doesn&#039;t really fit pursuit of God to focus on that which is selfish. No God that is worth anything but destruction to others that is, as the embodiment of myopia. That aside however, I&#039;d say every single thing you listed as artificial is dead precisely because of what it lacks in a transcendent Godly capacity.

It&#039;s about choosing the risks you want to take on and why you do, and in so doing calling out the lie that the ends justify the means. They do not, and that very thing is how politics work themselves into the morass that we currently find them in, worldwide. So is the notion that denying something deeper in a mechanistic (sociopathic) approach is a valuable contributor to society. It can only serve to rob everyone, especially the individual, of potential. The difference, down to the minutia, is between a company charged with removal of toxic waste from a pond that then takes it to the next town&#039;s pond; and one that invests R&amp;D into a plasma incinerator, that takes the byproducts, turns them into materials to construct arcologies for space travel, who are working on the cure for cancer. The difference in attitude, like personal attitudes, makes all the difference. On the way up, down and everywhere in between, success or failure. Companies are a great example of the rule of law of concepts like faith, love, and humility extending beyond the personal. A tiny glimpse of the transcendence of them, in a word. Reason is will. And focusing on the ends, at the expense of the math involved in getting to them, leads to weak, circular reason. <br>Ive already spoken to tyranny and compulsion- but again, tyranny, at its heart, like the 1st company above, is faithless.

I am merely pointing out your hubris, and your insistence that your version and your worldview are the only paths. Fathom this, I want to be part of a society of love. Yet, I do not want to impose what I want upon the world. Not out of helplessness or indifference, but out of the principle of freedom. Hard-fought freedom is the freedom that is already paid for by the blood of men and women throughout history. Just like Christ, who paid for our sins, freedom has to be fought for. In that spirit, I reject your insistence, despite your good intention. Be humble and learn, good intention often leads to unintended consequences. Here is an example, the Indian government came up with an incentive to control the cobra snake population. They pay a bounty for every snake captured. The Indians saw it as an opportunity and start to breed cobra snakes for monetary gains. When the Indian government realized it, they stopped the policy. The Indian citizens got upset and released the cobra into the wild. Effectively increases the cobra population. A direct opposite of what they intended. Good intention does not always lead to good outcomes. Yes, you may want what you want, but by pushing against others, you will only further push them to the other side.

I don&#039;t need to impose any will, not just because I happen to believe that all things will be corrected eventually, and that they already do so to an imperfect degree on their own; but because all of the impact i would ever desire in life is more than contained in my own free will alone. My choices. And quite honestly I question whether I&#039;d ever even consider myself fit for that role sometimes. Not only have I found that sufficient, but in acting in concert with the best intentions, to the never-ending perfection of the ideal, -as far as I can see it at any given time- is quite the opposite of &quot;God laughing at plans.&quot; I&#039;ve been graced by uncanny luck, with every step of faith.

(And you can test this even in a secular way.) <br>It&#039;s a funny word, humility, its root being love, it is acting in good faith in a selfless way. In order to do this, you must be both proactive and reactive in sensitivity to the other person&#039;s needs. Some things that are impossible according to your worldview. Some I think you&#039;ve demonstrated here if you&#039;d like me to point out. <br>But correct me if you think otherwise, hubris would imply willful or incidental ignorance, and a self centered motive. I don&#039;t think I misunderstand your position at all after a week or so talking. I&#039;ve lived both sides of it as I said early on.

I saw somebody equating this to somebody who wants to run hyperfocusing on studying ideal gait mechanics and whatnot instead of just going out and running. Sure, you might be great at doing your studies and at some level know what you should be doing, but it takes time and effort to have your studies really stick and show through in your original work. Look at Proko, the guy can make some great stuff when engaged in careful observational work, but when it came to applying his knowledge through creative drawing and cartooning, he immediately struggled (though I think he&#039;s since worked on this). Regularly drawing what you want, especially from imagination, helps to keep your studies contextualized as feeding your knowledge base for your original work (&quot;studying these female gymnast photos will help me draw my fit comic book heroine in stable, dynamic poses&quot;) as opposed to studies for the sake of studies (&quot;yes, my copy of this image which happens to be a photo of a female gymnast is about 75% faithful to the reference; next time I will try to boost it to 80%&quot;).", "time": 1675717872, "resto": 6490932}, {"no": 6509157, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)19:13:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6508919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6508919</a><br>Good point irshad, the 50% rule, yes.", "time": 1675728836, "resto": 6490932}, {"no": 6509529, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:22:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6508684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6508684</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A raw beginner should expect to spend an entire year just honing down on the basics </span><br>fucking lmao, kill yourself boxshitter scammer<br>Sorry you wasted your time dude", "time": 1675758128, "resto": 6490932}, {"no": 6509549, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:07:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6509529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6509529</a><br>you will be working on the basics forever.

There will probably be more suggestions and useless discussion below but we all know that a person willing to take action can get over the beginning stages of art with a little time and these resources.<br>But what of the question on how you get yourself to spend time making art and practicing making art? Really, that is the bane of all the people who come here over and over again failing to make any real progress. A person determined to spend their lives drawing will maybe look at a few of these, choose some and spend a lot of time drawing taking in the advice. But why do anons fail to do so? They have some sort of motivation, but clearly it&#039;s not so much aimed at drawing or practicing itself, but rather at &quot;becoming an artist&quot; or &quot;making it&quot;. If they wanted to actually draw they would do it. So what can be done about that? How does a person who aims at &quot;becoming an artist&quot; change their aim to &quot;spending their time drawing&quot;? Or how does one give up on it?<br>Honestly I&#039;d love to hear your ideas but I feel like there&#039;s no real good answer here.

Either way I don&#039;t think it matters much who did what first because most of supposedly Ancient Chinese principles which later on impacted the rest of the Sino sphere aren&#039;t inherently Chinese. The biggest East Asian influences such as Lao Tzu&#039;s Daoist philosophies on dualism (same with Chinese alchemy) predate China and Buddhism is from Ancient India but Confucianism I&#039;m not so sure where Confucius would have been inspired by. I also don&#039;t think there is a cohesive Chinese culture, it is not a monolith, it is constantly changing and historically it shows through constant civil turmoil. China itself is very ethnically diverse with many provinces having their own local culture and language and many different Chinese ethnic groups besides the Han. For example compare Beijing, Hong Kong, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Taiwan.
