They are the quickest way to improve and learn about any fundamental you are having problems with. If you need to work on your hands, copy hands from other artists, and if you&#039;re having trouble with rendering, make careful studies of paintings with lighting you admire. Studies can be quick or long. You can even copy anatomy books like Bridgman, Morpho, and Hogarth. The type of studies you want to do depend on your personal goals and the types of problems you are grappling with.<br><br>Artists of all levels are welcome.

I recommend meditating on what you&#039;ve been doing so far, what you&#039;re doing right now and what do you see yourself doing in the future. Reflect on your activity as an artist and your ability to make money. Look at other people, actively seek out either mentors or people you can learn from.

I know about the blackpill and it is mostly true, that&#039;s why I chose forex actually. Where human sentiment drives the prices. Look into Price Action trading specifically, that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been doing for about a year and a half with a prop firm and on my own. I started out with crypto and then stocks only to realize that blackpools and hedge firms stabilize the markets to maintaing price change at key levels and retail investors have very little probabilities to work with. To give an example, I invested 1200$ in a tech stock that had bullish sentiment a few years back, after a year I have made a total of 200$ overall despite it&#039;s price value going up, except that if you zoomed out on the chart you could see that it&#039;s being hedged down over and over to a consolodiation every 2nd month to maintain a slow steady pace. For an entire year. Welcome to stocks. If you do not have a lot of money you will not make money. Same with crypto and all the shitcoins that pop up, flavor of the month on coinmarketcap I see them literally every month there&#039;s the next Mooncoin. It&#039;s all bullshit. Meanwhile in forex, a 300pip change is not only common but expected and with proper leverage and risk management you can easily get a 1:3 investment return that way. If anything, try it out.

Well, the trad analogy is literally masking tape. But you can also think of it as a stencil. For example, a stencil made from cardboard or a plastic sheet. The paint/pixels only affect the part of the canvas that isn&#039;t covered by the mask. If you&#039;re patient, I can answer any questions you have until you understand it. Just check back a few times a day and take your time. Also, don&#039;t expect it to &quot;click&quot; instantly. It doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re stupid. You just need to have that &quot;eureka!&quot; moment.<br><br>But more broadly, masks help you to &quot;color inside the lines&quot; without having to actually respect/obey the boundaries. Here&#039;s an example: sketch the first letter of your first name as a &quot;bubble letter&quot;. Like an animal balloon. You can just use the Procreate Pencil brush, for example. Now create a new layer and ink over your pencil sketch very carefully. Don&#039;t expect instant results. Take your time and work on a new layer. Now...underneath that layer, create a new layer and carefully fill it in to create a silhouette. At this stage you WILL need to worry about coloring inside the lines, but just this once. Now lock the alpha pixels of that layer and select your airbrush. (And duplicate the layer and disable it so you have a backup copy.) Don&#039;t worry about masks for now. We&#039;ll get there. Alpha lock is basically the same thing. Masks are less destructive and the better tool, but you&#039;re trying to just understand the basic concept. Any pixel that is alpha (i.e. transparent) will not accept color from the brush. So anything outside of your silhouette/fill color will not be affected by the brush.<br><br>2/2", "time": 1670680424, "resto": 6409342}, {"no": 6410185, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)17:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6409701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6409701</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Masks.

Your brain is used to making the &quot;artstyle translation&quot; due to you watching anime.<br>2. anime figures usually dont have many if any imperfections so when your brain &quot;processes&quot; the images it doesnt add any or at the very least , not that many.<br>3. Its usually more realistic (depends on style but thats why I say usually) , atleast compared to cartoons that tend to be straight up caricatures. Shading might be a bit simplistic , but your brain can fill in the blanks on that.<br><br>Hell , I heard some people basically just draw a realistic/semi-realistic person , simplify the shading and use lines to depict certain things, remove some imperfections (eg.

You&#039;re what I&#039;m talking about when I say &quot;missing the appeal&quot;. If somebody wants a good story, they read a book. If somebody wants good art, they look at an artbook. When somebody wants art and story working together, they read a comic.

It&#039;s not as simple as throwing some text or audio on an image, there&#039;s much more to it than that. Choosing what image, how you draw it, how you phrase the text, if you use text at all or a lot of it etc are all STORYTELLING choices that are not STORY choices. Do you understand? It&#039;s a fundamental part of making comics to tell a story with visuals, and it takes skill to do so.<br>To use another medium as an example to help clarify: moviemakers are not necessarily photographers, because shooting a movie uses multiple mediums to tell a story, while a photographer&#039;s primary (and perhaps only) goal is capture a single moment or a series of single moments, to show off a bunch of pretty pictures. They are fundamentally different, and a movie can succeed at telling a story with visuals and sound and movement while not having very many pretty pictures at all, or not having very good writing or whatever.", "time": 1670459161, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6408458, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)06:42:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402047</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;/ic/ who draws once a week at best thinks it&#039;s easy to draw a weekly or biweekly manga</span><br>Yeah good luck", "time": 1670586167, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6408499, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)07:46:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6406802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6406802</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When somebody wants art and story working together</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they consume animation, or video games, not comics</span><br>Dumbest poster I&#039;ve read so far today", "time": 1670590008, "resto": 6402047}], "last_modified": 1670590008}, {"no": 6408208, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)22:44:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Whats the point of selling digital art?<br>People hastle me to get off benifits and sell art but this is the prices people expect, plus basically nobody is interested in buying my art in the first place.<br>I get hella tired easily and would have a mental breakdown slaving away ar making less than enough money to pay by or rent or food.

Even then, it&#039;s really hard to monetize the content you produce. And yes, if you&#039;re managing your own company, you won&#039;t have much time to draw at all. That&#039;s business work and therefore done by businessmen. You should also keep in mind that doing your own indie projects won&#039;t net you much gain unless you get the funds to make em in the first place, market them, and then strike a deal to sell them somewhere. Even then, pirating animation is like the easiest shit, so be aware of that. And be prepared to work as a third party for bigger companies, you&#039;ll be doing a lot of ads and shit. Nothing really that creative. I&#039;ve thought long about this all because I have the same dream, but lets be realistic here. You&#039;d be better off joining some indie studio and pitching your stuff to them with the expectation that they MIGHT give you the greenlight, and then you have to actively work on your project but it most likely wont legally belong to you, so you have to fight with other people for the right to decide what should and shouldn&#039;t be done in your projects. You&#039;d be real lucky if they also don&#039;t fire your ass afterwards, even if the IP turns out to be very profitable, leaving you with jack shit for all the work you put.

Interest is likely innate/nature -- therefore making talent seem like a God-given trait. The longer you work, the more progress you will see. Just like lifting weights or doing math.
