If you want to improve at drawing from a model or photo like this, you should look at the Bargue drawing course. Some general advice: You need to go slow and be careful in your measurements. Work out the large shapes and proportions first, then move to the smaller details. Begin your drawing with mostly straight lines, and try to observe carefully the inflection points of the curves in your reference. Start with a single value for your entire shadow mass. Squint your eyes to determine what belongs to shadow and what belongs to light. Once you have essentially &quot;posterized&quot; the image into sharply defined light and dark shapes, then begin gradually feathering out the shadows into the light masses, and adding the slightly darker details within the light. In general, the tendency of beginners is to have too much variation in the shadow mass, and to overstate reflected light, which causes the drawing to lose its sense of weight and pictorial impact. It is better if the shadow is kept uniform, and most of the interest is within the light areas.", "time": 1669928473, "resto": 6395812}, {"no": 6397808, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:04:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6397804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6397804</a><br>Here is an example of the approach.

By the 8th episode, according to the video, it was nothing more than filler material and gags. Despite them having the skill and the talent, it still failed.

He recognized early on that very simple, lo-fi graphics could be more endearing and relatable than ultra-realism, and used this understanding to great advantage.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No matter how much CG approaches reality, it will never be able to overtake real visuals. There will always be an unsurpassable limit...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do these playworlds really need to be that photorealistic, I wonder? I actually consider it more of a minus if the graphics are too realistic. There\u2019s a similar line of thinking in the entertainment world\u2014using soft focus lenses when women are filmed, for instance. When that is done, each person can project their own conception of \u201cbeautiful\u201d onto the woman being filmed, and everyone will see their own personal Venus.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If things are too realistic, there\u2019s no room for your imagination, and the reality of those faces you thought were beautiful will be revealed. Or to use another common expression, it\u2019s actually more erotic when a woman leaves some skin covered. Even if a video game doesn\u2019t have the power to display very complex graphics, I believe your imagination has the power to transform that perhaps-unrecognizable sprite called a \u201crocket\u201d into an amazing, powerful, \u201creal\u201d rocket.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Television has gone from black and white to color, and now that we\u2019re seeing high-definition tv it\u2019s almost too detailed. You get that problem I mentioned, of seeing wrinkles of beautiful faces. Since television is mainly a medium for information, I think it\u2019s better for it to be more clear, but games don\u2019t require that. I think the world of a game feels larger when you can use your own imagination.</span>", "time": 1669819504, "resto": 6390633}, {"no": 6396227, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)09:51:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6396222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6396222</a><br>Source for those quotes: https://shmuplations.com/yokoi/<br><br>Related to the above: Remember the old Tamagotchi &quot;virtual pet&quot; keychains?

I had planned for a different kind of strip,but although I was capable of drawing the chunks of a panel in pencil while balancing the Bristol board on my lap,but I didn&#039;t have the time at my computer to use Photoshop to isolate the images,chopping away the extra white of a drawing and leaving it as a layer with clear transparency surrounding it. And that takes time that I no longer had. So,a story sprang up from a random drawing of a demon head in a bubble. This strip. Not meant for public consumption, but I liked how the head was coming along,so I decided to add another character, and thinking about how they would interact. What sort of character? A hybrid of two other characters, anthromorph races being normally incompatible for breeding. <br>&quot;It doesn&#039;t stop them from trying &quot;,to quote Cassandra. As the pen made images fade into view,I invented personality and reason for these things I create.

Futurists thought the future will be bright, so every time you see AI in media, it was always proceeded by some other insane futuristic inventions like fusion reactors, space travel, holograms, cyborg tech and so on. But the truth is that AI is here, and it is far easier to make then colony on the Moon. Lawyers and Judges are getting replaced month after AI manages to replace book writers. Same goes for good chunk of scientific fields that mostly work with texts. AI can already understand logic and predict outcomes based on text, the main limitor is memory (reason why textbots forget stuff so easily and constantly change subjects). We have no idea what will happen and how effective it will be once it learns how to remember. Maybe just giving textbot human-like long term memory will immediately turn it into AGI, maybe it wont change anything and just allow it to generate fantasy novels. You cant really predict what will happen since AI research is advancing much much faster then neurology. After all, all it took for AI to master drawing was to make it recognize objects on a picture very well, when just strap it to noise generator and boom, you got machine that will draw you anything in any artstyle, as well as make any kind of fake photo and soon maybe even make 3D objects. Nobody knew it could replace artists this easily, so maybe giving it extra memory will make it finally understand topics described to it, and become AGI by just reading a lot. <br>Nobody knows.", "time": 1669858565, "resto": 6393755}, {"no": 6396877, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)20:37:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6396851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6396851</a><br>Yeah, sucks that you get screwed from both ends.

even as an exercise, youve failed. circles are done fast and have tails or miss connecting. contour lines dont actually obey the shape they are contouring most of the time and vary from contour to contour. lines have littel to no lineweight differentiation outside extremes like large black lines. theres a lot of wobble on lines too. they dont feel smooth when you are doing longer lines or lots of lines in a row. the distance between lines in sequences is also arbitrary. you dont care or think about them at any point. just mindless lines haphazardly thrown. the distances matter. they can be uniform or imply perspective by gaps shrinking or expanding between them as you go and so on. line weights would further differentiate the lines and imply form and shape (thicker near edges/thinner in mid could show it bulging towards us, like say that eye looking thing at the top, and give it more form). many of the curved shapes just have no dimensionality. feel flat even with contours. the ones you put dots on are affected greatly because you refuse to have diversity in line weights. if the dots were larger and get thinner as it curves around and if the dots contoured as well it would go a long way. add some line weights to the conotours or exterior lines and it really pops. everything is just flattened into nothing with lazy, mindless lines.", "time": 1669849984, "resto": 6396464}],

Put down your flats (make them your mid tone), then create a clipping mask layer ontop. Then paint in the ambient shadows with a soft brushsoft, (the general form shadows not the drop shadows). Then on the same layer with the same color lay down your drop shadows using the lasso. Might want to duplicate the ambient layer first for back up incase you screw up. To clean it up I would make another clipping layer ontop of the last one and paint over top sample from underneath. This is a really simple base to start from. The real trick to making great shadows is understanding the your darker skin tones and your shadows are NOT THE SAME. They overlap, so what you want to do is make the base I just explained your darker skin tones then ontop of all you did brush your true shadow color in selectively. The easiest way to find your shadow is to sample from your background. The warm skin cool shadow, cool skin warm shadow thing is more about creating good contrast between the subject and the background then actually making proper shadows. So, before you start dropping in shadows figure out your background. Shadows are also sponges for color so if you want to dial them up even more you can try putting different colors from around the painting in different areas, just don&#039;t get carried away or they won&#039;t gel right. After that it&#039;s high lights, bounce lights, and subsurface scattering. Oh, and I said Lasso and softbruch mainly but every painting is comes down to both soft and hard brush. It&#039;s doesn&#039;t matter which one you start with, it just matters that you know when to soften and when to harden. The Lasso is just best for making perfect gradients that even the best soft brush technique can&#039;t produce as quickly.

This is the method taught in the French-style ateliers. See picrel.<br>Left image: Find the vertical and horizontal center lines. Notice the horizontal line touches the top of the lips, while the vertical line locates the inner corner of her left eye (right eye in the picture). You can further subdivide the picture to find additional points. The usual analog method is to hold the pencil at arm&#039;s length, with the tip at one point and your thumb on the pencil marking the other point. Then move the pencil to check if the distances are equal.<br>Center image: To keep your copy in proper alignment, use plumb (vertical) and horizontal lines to find points that line up. In the atelier, the student would hold out his hand with a weighted string attached to give the vertical line, and use the pencil or straight edge for the horizontal. Be careful, check twice and don&#039;t rush.<br>Third image: Begin the drawing by lightly sketching in large, &quot;enveloping&quot; forms using straight lines. Straight lines are easier to judge than curves. The subtlety of curvature can be added after the overall proportions are secured. You may also carry oblique lines beyond individual forms to further maintain proper alignment. Note how the line of the cheek continues to the vertex of the collar.<br>The overarching principle here is to work from the general to the specific. Find the large proportions, then go smaller and smaller. Treat the shadow areas as shapes, too.
