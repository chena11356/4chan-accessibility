Obviously if I regularly get commissions my art at least has appeal, but I don&#039;t consider myself highly skilled. It&#039;s just not all about aimlessly grinding and hoping people will care that you did. I get commissions because of networking, targeting a specific niche, and because once you start getting things off the ground, you&#039;ll end up with clients who regularly come back.

You need to draw something several times to solidify your understanding of that thing, and by understanding it, you solidify it in your mind as well. It&#039;s easier to imagine an apple and rotating it in your head than it is to do the same with a car engine. The apple you&#039;ve seen a million times, seen it from different angles, you&#039;ve touched it, felt it&#039;s weight, tasted it, etc. The engine you&#039;ve most likely only seen briefly a couple of times over your lifetime. Your understanding of the objects is completly different. Often we want to draw things we know exists, but don&#039;t really have a good understanding of what they really are. So we end up with this brief &#039;glimpse&#039; of that thing, rather than the actual thing. Also, understanding how one things works often helps you understand how other things work. Knowledge builds on knowledge. This is why a broad visual library is such an important thing.

Once you can see the whole figure, it&#039;s easier to notice what is off. With less strokes on the page it&#039;s easier to fix the mistakes too. With a gesture drawing approach likes Glenn Vilppus, about 30 seconds is enough to get the major masses and limbs down. At that point I just check that the hips are at about halfway of the length of the figure and visually measure that it&#039;s around 7 to 8 heads tall, that&#039;s usually enough. For longer drawings or harder poses, more time is spent double checking stuff. You may find you keep making the same proportional mistakes, so that&#039;s something you can study and be on the lookout for.<br>A lot of the time you have to deal with foreshortened limbs and overlapping forms so it takes a lot of practice. There is also choosing what to exaggerate or idealize. For example, you can make the legs longer and it will usually look better, so when in doubt you can make them a bit longer.", "time": 1675939541, "resto": 6505776}, {"no": 6512816, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)08:14:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6512687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6512687</a><br>Haha, they were just quick sketches to get the idea across.

Fortunately that&#039;s pretty easy to do. <br><br>On the plus side, provided you&#039;re working on decent paper, you have basically endless opportunities to correct your mistakes, and the opacity of the paint will cover up any stains left on the paper from earlier attempts. <br><br>To me, the most important thing is to control the amount of water in your brush; too much water and it makes a mess, too little and it won&#039;t go on smoothly. I have also trained myself to step away and let areas dry before adding another layer; otherwise they just mix on the sheet. Fortunately, this doesn&#039;t take long. <br><br>Also, every single paint will have a different consistency, from smooth to gooey, so you&#039;ll have to get used to that too.

If you can git gud with one of these, most other pens will be child&#039;s play.<br><br>- Sakura Micron Pens are good all rounders. They get a lot of praise and memes made about them because of how anime centered the brand is but honestly they are very good pens for what they are, especially at the price point, and doubly so if you get them on sale. Big range of sizes, as small as .003mm and up to like 2mm I think? Also they come in colors too but the majority are only 0.5mm. The thin ones are very brittle though so be careful.<br><br>- Sakura Micron Brush Pens are okay if you have nothing else. Better than a sharpie, but you should definitely look into getting some other form of brush pen for big areas you&#039;d need in solid black. Ink strokes are very streaky and it&#039;s very noticeable in the light. Not for fine lining unless you have the steady hands of a brain surgeon. <br><br>- Pentel Brush Pen (hard plastic kind, with the traditional bic style cap) is a very good pen as well and comes in a variety of sizes, but the medium size specifically is the best in my experience. They&#039;re also refillable via cartridges which is nice. When you learn the brush control it&#039;s an incredible pen to use but brushes aren&#039;t everyone&#039;s cup of tea.

They dry up quickly in storage too, as I had all mine for just under 2 years before I had to replace them and didn&#039;t even use them every day. It&#039;s a style of pen in between pen and brush, but honestly I found the ink to be inferior to the Pentel and the Microns. It wants to play in this middle ground but doesn&#039;t excel at either side. But this might be an unfair judgement, as the Kuretake I got were from Hobby Lobby so I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re the real deal or just some manufactured cash grab attempt with a brand name. Quite a big pen though,<br><br>- Copic Multiliners are cool but I also find these to be inferior to the Microns. Their all-aluminum design is neat and flashy, but it&#039;s just paying extra for the same quality of work you&#039;d get from the Microns. Both of their inks fulfill largely the same thing. The Copic multiliners are refillable as well but a refill costs about as much as a brand new Micron so pick your poison I guess. These are significantly thicker than a Micron so if you&#039;re using a bag for your pens you won&#039;t be able to fit as many in there.<br><br>- Pentel Brush Pen (soft plastic kind with a plain black rigid cap and a red ring around it) is an okay pen, nothing to write home about but also no glaring flaws. One of mine leaks though but I chalk that up to me having it fucking forever. The ink is a little streaky but also a little too wet for my tastes, which is not a good combination as you&#039;d need at least 2 layers to get a flat black. Has a massive ink reserve in the rubberish housing and you squeeze it to add more ink to the chamber which flows into the bristles. These do have some cool utility though, as you can get some really cool dry brush effects with minimal effort if you let the ink run out a little and only squeeze in just enough to wet the tip again. Not worthless, but a far cry from the top as well. It&#039;s as big as the Kuretake.", "time": 1676082759, "resto": 6514221}, {"no": 6515282, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)04:50:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6514885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6514885</a><br>Copic does have two advantages over Micron in my opinion.<br>One, their Sepia, Brown and Wine colors are great for colored line art in marker illustrations.<br>And two, there&#039;s no pirate Copic multiliners yet, but Amazon is packing with Micron clones that aren&#039;t anywhere near as good as the real deal.", "time": 1676109047, "resto": 6514221}, {"no": 6515322, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:43:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6514355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6514355</a><br>good", "time": 1676112229, "resto": 6514221}, {"no": 6515463, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)08:25:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6514599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6514599</a><br>Fight me, bitch", "filename": "00v02540000000-st-01-holder", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676121925882970, "time": 1676121925, "md5": "MFzOiQlGUTuzkjmI6X+Zxw==", "fsize": 18484, "resto": 6514221}, {"no": 6515487, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)08:51:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6514882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6514882</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;- standard Bic Ballpoint Pen is a classic and very underrated, but of course terrible in a professional setting.

And because most of their work is often going to include skin tight clothes or none at all, their well rendered drawings make for pretty good references. Not to suggest I wouldn&#039;t use the more reliable IRL references, but fictional art sparks a lot more inspiration out of me and it&#039;s much more appealing to stare at than real porn imo.

After all, it is intrinsic, whether, by nature or nurture, it is a preference, and therefore an outcome of free will. I respect freedom because it usually is paved by the blood of men and women. I do see how absurd it may seem to let sexual desires overwhelm self-preservation.

First to clarify, I&#039;m not talking about imposing will, I never will- to the point where I can get away with something not affecting me or the ones I love. Tyranny and immorality are one and the same. <br>With that out of the way, no matter what is intrinsic, whether you have 8 arms or are quadriplegic, is nearly insignificant in the face of what you leave out- which is free will, conscious choice. It matters what you do, recursively, in everything. Some things, you could make a lifetime argument about, but sex, with the in built equivalent in neuronal and hormonal devotion to that of a long time hard drug addict? It is no less than lifelong, life altering how you choose to approach it. Take a cultural example from Muslims, it&#039;s the most powerful demon in Islam, to the point not seeing a woman&#039;s face is considered preferable to allowing the instinct influence. And they&#039;d know a thing or two about that, having been bought off of conquest by Indian pleasure palaces. <br>What is love? Love is the answer, and the antithesis to following lust for the sake of lust. Because lust for the sake of lust will lead you- wherever the fuck it wants to. Peruse any number those rabbit holes at your leisure by visiting some neet caves, or just having a casual stroll down any prostitute infested street. It doesn&#039;t take very much care- love- to want to see something better. Any at all in fact that you don&#039;t purposely ignore will wreck any illusions. Loves constructive force, and specifically per this conversation, containing lust within it, has been considered de facto understood and valued for this, really always. <br><br><a href=\"#p6513950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6513950</a><br>If the cook is making polystyrene meals that only smell and taste like food, yeah, those people are prey.

You cannot remove lust from love. It is not as black and white as you think. Love is not a zero-sum game. Love can be subtle or bold and all shades of grey. It is about giving in, giving up, and letting go. Or, it can be ethereal, eternal, and undying. Some nuances are lost through time, buried by the current social construct and culture. As an artist, I love classical mythology. Let me give you an example. In the beginning, there was nothing but chaos, and then came Eros, the God of desire, love, and sex. Gaia(earth) and Uranus(atmosphere) had sex(Eros). Without Eros, the desire to have sex which is lust. There will be no existence. The word erotic came from this greek origin, a primordial God named Eros. I can judge others based on their desires. Sure, there is some love more ethereal than others, with less instant gratification and more fruitful. However, we cannot assume that everyone desires the same love, like you and I. We both are on the same page. Here is where we differ. I do not see lust as immoral or wrong. I encourage young men to explore as much as they can afford. Fall in love, make mistakes.

Guess niche fetish art pays because more passionate fans needing to scratch that spefic itch. Draw basic pin ups of basic anime girls and you will be lost in the sea of artists doing it. Spice it up with personal niche and you get devoted fans willing to pay you", "time": 1675378887, "resto": 6429056}, {"no": 6503148, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)21:24:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.instagram.com/navarysar<wbr>t<br>https://twitter.com/lunarbadger<br><br>I don\u2019t post as much as I should.

If you enjoy what you do then work ethic is not a skill you need to hone.

I mainly make profits from selling my books and original page art at art shows and comic and anime conventions. I fund my print runs with crowdfunding campaigns, and then sell the books for pure profit at shows. My evergreen bestseller is Purrvana, a colorful watercolor painted psychedelic cat graphic novel that appeals to normies of all ages and all demographics from bikers to gangsters to grannies to crazy cat ladies. I have sold over 2,500 copies of Purrvana to date. I also make money from commissions, both my OCs and other people. Most of my commissions are catfight wrestling matches featuring my OCs or other people&#039;s OCs. I advertise mainly on pixiv, discord, twitter and my webcomic also works as an advertisement. I also drew animal coloring books years ago that still sell, at shows and online. After a bad experience working with a publisher several years ago, I began self publishing and now that&#039;s all I want to do.<br><br>I read that Image creators are in the red and go in to debt with Image unless their book sells a certain amount of copies. I recently read tweets from an image artist who says that after his book he worked on sold 5 issues at 15,000 issues each, he only made $1100 in profit and he got paid months after the final issue came out, after the profit share was split with image, the writer and colorist. I don&#039;t sell a high volume of copies, and my crowdfunders don&#039;t go crazy, but I still make a lot more profit than that Image artist whose book was selling 15,000 copies each issue for example because I keep all the profit of sales for myself. I also do freelance work. Advertising and marketing is not really something I&#039;m good at, but I&#039;m getting by and trying to improve at it. I&#039;m also going to start a life drawing class at my local Junior College next week and I hope it will up my skills so I can charge more for commissions, and it will also improve my comic pages.

Matrix cites Otaku USA, which in turn cites Anime News Network. The ANN article in question is about Demon Slayer&#039;s sales in Japan for the October 19-25 week in 2020, according to Oricon. Though not part of the headline story, the article states that the series had 100 million copies in circulation (including digital copies, which Oricon does not count), not sales, as of the 22nd volume&#039;s release on October 2.<br><br>Neither ANN nor Otaku USA reported on American comic book sales. The video version of Matrix&#039;s article indicates that his source for the &quot;15 million&quot; number is a sankaku Complex article, which in turn cites comic book blog The Beat&#039;s analysis of NPD BookScan data for 2019. It should be noted that the analysis is restricted only to the top 750 titles, so the 15 million figure applies only to that selection. It should also be noted that BookScan only represents a selection of retailers, and is not representative of the entire market.<br><br>That said, even the 15 million figure from The Beat&#039;s limited-scope analysis is a lower amount than Oricon&#039;s reported sales figures for Demon Slayer in 2019: 12 million copies. That figure is also disputed; publisher Shueisha reported that the manga sold 10.8 million volumes that year. So Demon Slayer clearly didn&#039;t outsell the American comics industry in the same frame of time. By conflating Demon Slayer&#039;s lifetime circulation numbers with yearly sales and stacking them against partial sales numbers in the American market for 2019, the numbers provided in Matrix&#039;s article paint a misleading picture.&quot;<br><br>And this source came from a anime focused website . YA and creator owned series do well in sales .

It is a big problem to most of us, but there is a compositional challenge, how to arrange stuff, choosing the perspective.

The hikki kid was really talented and displayed strong technique early on, but their work tended toward life drawings and environments - pictures without people in them. On the other hand, Fuji&#039;s stand-in, while not as skilled, displayed a strong affinity and aptitude for crafting narratives; they were always looking for some way to tell a story through drawings. <br><br>Their reasons for taking up drawing are also believable, and, to a certain extent, relatable. The hikki girl draws all day every day because it&#039;s a viable form of escapism and there&#039;s not much else to do; Fuji&#039;s stand-in (I think, can&#039;t remember) does so partly because of the praise it earns her from peers. <br><br>In terms of which character /ic/ embodies best, I think the board leans slightly toward the former due to the lingering influence of the concept art era. It should be noted that quite a few people here see art as a means by which to secure a livelihood, usually through the patronage of a dedicated fanbase; this entails a focus on producing art that is very accessible, usually pin-ups and the like. I won&#039;t go so far as to say that an (erotically charged) illustration of a character against a simple background is entirely lacking in narrative, but a emotional response is certainly the foremost prerogative, whether it be in the form of a libidinal response or an appeal to the viewer&#039;s particular tastes.", "filename": "Look Back - c001 - p006 [dig] [VIZ Media]", "ext": ".png", "w": 784, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675736085294854, "time": 1675736085, "md5": "9OY6hAxdK+YCzWfDGmA+JQ==", "fsize": 423520, "resto": 6509133}, {"no": 6511111, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:50:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1675871425, "resto": 6509133}, {"no": 6511120, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:58:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I draw for fun and to inspire others to do the same<br>Drawing is insanely fun, it makes me feel like I can fly", "filename": "1598398559334", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1235, "h": 1754, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675871898247087, "time": 1675871898, "md5": "+Es2eYrLjDp05LcEro5Eqg==", "fsize": 2112024, "resto": 6509133}, {"no": 6511129, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)11:09:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t know, I haven&#039;t drawn in a week.

It&#039;s a 15.6 inch screen drawing tablet.<br>I have been very fortunate that it doesn&#039;t seem to have any hardware issues (some scary reviews out there lmao) so far, but holy sweet mother does its software suck. <br>Coming from an ancient wacoom bamboo from like 2012 I just cannot believe how bad the software is. In general I am extremely grateful that the tablet was so cheap because I was that guy who thought that a screen less one would be just as good but let me tell you now that I&#039;ve seen the light I can never go back. <br>The problem is that the D16&#039;s drivers are being held together with duct tape and cum and it just barely works even having lots of strange issues like I can&#039;t use the two side buttons on the pen because pressing one even for a second will remap the stylus to half way between my main monitor and the d16 display which I sometimes can&#039;t even fix upon several restarts of the computer. Loads of little headaches and setting it up for left handed use was hell. <br><br>Basically I never want another Chinese tablet again. I&#039;m still running windows 10 and the driver to this tablet hasn&#039;t been updated since 2018 so I am mentally preparing myself for this tablet to just stop working when I&#039;m forced to upgrade to win11 probly within the next year. <br>I dont use pen tilt and I&#039;ve found that 15.6 inches I about all the space I have on my tiny desk and so far I haven&#039;t found that I wished the tablet was bigger (only that it worked better).<br>I have no idea about any of this tech stuff but all I want is a functional tablet with good software and support. I dont use pen tilt or even need buttons on the tablet (I have a keyboard). Because if this I&#039;m heavily leaning to a less feature packed Wacom. I really don&#039;t want to buy used.

Seems like you want to hurry up and get to the end result already, when really majority of your focus should be on the start of the drawing.<br>Let&#039;s say it takes 5 steps to complete a drawing.

Judge it, if you feel the copy is off, learn from it, continue onto the next drawing.<br>Once you finish fully copying the book, do it again but from imagination. The imagination being; see the drawing, close the &quot;book&quot;, try to draw what you recall. And go from there. Half your drawing time should be on completing this task, and the other half should be working on your personal stuff. You NEED to do both. As you do this, you&#039;ll start to make a connection between the importance of your studies and your own work. You&#039;ll be frustrated, you&#039;ll feel it&#039;s pointless, you&#039;ll even question why you&#039;re even doing this. This is normal, everyone goes through these emotions. Eventually, you&#039;ll start telling yourself &quot;stupid fucking anon from fag making me do his exercise. So goddamn pointless I hate him. I HATE EVERYONE!!&quot; but once you&#039;re done with the book, I guaranteed you, you will be at the level you were trying to aim for this entire time.

Therefore, to say that pornography is the highest form of pure visual art is a narrow and misguided perspective that fails to fully appreciate the depth and breadth of what art can accomplish.", "filename": "1655511719421", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 717, "h": 1017, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675207157645333, "time": 1675207157, "md5": "8yDk46Xvo71xOb+/TUG0cg==", "fsize": 273105, "resto": 6493174}, {"no": 6499044, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)18:24:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6493174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6493174</a><br>how do people come up with simple drawings like this which have erotic gesture?
