It could help to start with bigger shapes and two values first (your main light and shadow) then go into the smaller details and more nuanced values later. Another way to clean it up would be paying more attention to your edge control. To me it seems as if you went first with a small brush, which would explain the white spaces, but you don&#039;t seem to have a clear image of what the final product would look like.<br><br>I agree with the guy that a two stone study would be good but I don&#039;t know if I would agree with treating your current progress as an underpainting because the layers look very rough and thick to me the more you add the more uneven it will become. This was my mistake with my first oil painting 4 years ago. Instead of knowing how to take away from the paint and be decisive with my actions, I kept adding more over my mistakes up only to end up with my layers, texture, surface, and brushstrokes all fucked up so I had to use my thinner to wipe layers of wasted paint and repaint over after destroying all the preexisting paint. Thinking you can just correct your mistakes by painting over like with digital is a common mistake for people painting for the first time.<br><br>I also don&#039;t know if I would agree with the comment on warm tones, because temperature is more advanced than values. If you don&#039;t know your light and shadows adding more varied temperature will most likely make things even more confusing (mistake I do a lot the time).

I would have said you&#039;re comfortably int due to the mans grasping hand stylization, but as I look at it more I realize a few things. The truth is, the stylization disrupts certain things but what makes it obvious for me is the clothing.

And those were not small design changes, it was changes like changing from one ponytail to 2 ponytails, then freeflow hair going on shoulders, then one just on the back.

With Stable you still need skill at prompting because it is too raw and does not fiddle with your prompts at all, plus SD is the smallest of the big AI bunch (Dall-E 2, Midjourney).

You can see the death of classical art play out in the late 1800\u2019s between the academic artists and the pastoral \u201clower class\u201d artists. Academic Artists lived in such a culturally conservative Christian world because that\u2019s who their patrons were. So much of their genre work, what we recognize as mythological work, was trapped in the past echoing the same pre approved themes and stories from the Greek and biblical accounts. The work was stale. Take bouguereau for example. The absolute pinnacle of artistic ability but his work is mostly boring as fuck from an emotional or narrative view. The early impressionists we\u2019re addressing that lack of meaning by making work that was real to them and had to do with the world they lived in. It was mostly great for a while but then motherfucking Picasso came along with his god damned cubism and then everyone stopped giving a fuck about the quality of the craftsmanship and wanted work that was more of the pure emotional state and less of the representation of what the emotion was derived from. The fauvists were high as shit. The late impressionists all had heavy metal poisoning from lead white and fake absinthe. The dadaists jumped the shark. The cult of personality period in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s was a blur of coke and ether. The naive artists tried to bring the art world back down to earth. Brutalists didn\u2019t survive the 80\u2019s. Album posters were the only real art in the 90\u2019s. 2000\u2019s were a joke. Now everyone is suddenly an illustrator/graffiti artist and acrylic flows like water. We are trying so hard to recover the identity that was lost. Thankfully ateliers are becoming way more popular but they still lack the ability to teach depth and emotion in art. The west doesn\u2019t have a cultural identity or narrative that people resonate with, and we don\u2019t even like each other that much right now.", "time": 1674889178, "resto": 6493566}, {"no": 6493804, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)02:02:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6493800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6493800</a><br>By western people I mean everyone who participates in western culture so bringing out old welsh, Greek, and Scandinavian mythology won\u2019t work.

It is idealized. The figures are not individuals, but ideal &quot;types&quot; that follow proportional canons. Forms are simplified and monumentalized, and accidental or distracting details are omitted. Also, violent perspective, with its size distortion, is not a part of this art. Foreshortening does appear, but more so in the baroque offshoot. Classical art favors a depiction of the human figure in which the parts are seen in their true forms and relationships, and the posing of figures reflects that.<br>The subject matter was Greek myth, and later Biblical stories and historical events, all rendered in the classical style. Accuracy in historical costuming, accessories and architecture was valued. Educated people were familiar with the subject matter of classical art; it was a shared cultural heritage.<br>The historical changes that brought industrialization, communism and two world wars sounded the death knell of classicism. The old order was seen as standing in the way of &quot;progress,&quot; and needing to be overturned. The audience for this kind of art mostly disappeared.

If you know Photoshop, you know everything. You can literally get hired at lots of places for just being able to show you can use Photoshop well.<br>People say that CSP runs faster but I don&#039;t think this is true. Unoptimized CSP runs faster, but if you just google &quot;Photoshop 60 fps&quot; &quot;Making Photoshop Faster&quot; from Borodante or KNKL you&#039;ll find that Photoshop can fully utilize multithreaded machine setups. Even with higher end PC builds, I&#039;ve noticed Photoshop runs faster than CSP, even after tweaking settings for both. For some reason the cursor on Photoshop just tracks directly behind your pen much more accurately than CSP by a tiny margin, whereas CSP you have to do extensive fuckery to get that to be the close to the same.<br>For CSP The Pen pressure is more customizable meaning I have more options for line brushes and adjusting things. This is not as big of an advantage as you&#039;d think though as for PS the Pen pressure control out of the box works great already, whereas in CSP you usually have to fuck around for a bit to get it feel right. Usually I end up changing all my pens to a straight or slight curve and make everything dependent on my tablet curve pressure anyway. <br>I still use CSP mainly for 2 reasons:<br>The program is constantly getting better and better, whereas the newer versions of Photoshop is actually getting worse than CS6 for painting artwork. With the future updates, it will surpass PS<br>CSP EX has a built in storyboarding feature that is extremely valuable for organizing and making a workflow for making manga/comics and an industry level animation timeline workflow.

Thankfully there&#039;s a way around this issue with tool presets. Expect to do a lot of googling how to set up krita when you start using it.

Many artists draw inspiration from their own desires, dreams, and experiences when creating their works. They often use their art as a means of exploring and expressing these desires in a creative and imaginative way.<br><br>It&#039;s not uncommon for writers, painters, and other creatives to use their art as a way to escape the realities of their lives, and to bring their deepest desires and fantasies to life. This allows them to live vicariously through their characters and to experience things they may not otherwise have the opportunity to experience.<br><br>In the case of Berserk, it&#039;s likely that Miura was inspired by his own desires and dreams when he created the world and characters of the manga.

It&#039;s a 15.6 inch screen drawing tablet.<br>I have been very fortunate that it doesn&#039;t seem to have any hardware issues (some scary reviews out there lmao) so far, but holy sweet mother does its software suck. <br>Coming from an ancient wacoom bamboo from like 2012 I just cannot believe how bad the software is. In general I am extremely grateful that the tablet was so cheap because I was that guy who thought that a screen less one would be just as good but let me tell you now that I&#039;ve seen the light I can never go back. <br>The problem is that the D16&#039;s drivers are being held together with duct tape and cum and it just barely works even having lots of strange issues like I can&#039;t use the two side buttons on the pen because pressing one even for a second will remap the stylus to half way between my main monitor and the d16 display which I sometimes can&#039;t even fix upon several restarts of the computer. Loads of little headaches and setting it up for left handed use was hell. <br><br>Basically I never want another Chinese tablet again. I&#039;m still running windows 10 and the driver to this tablet hasn&#039;t been updated since 2018 so I am mentally preparing myself for this tablet to just stop working when I&#039;m forced to upgrade to win11 probly within the next year. <br>I dont use pen tilt and I&#039;ve found that 15.6 inches I about all the space I have on my tiny desk and so far I haven&#039;t found that I wished the tablet was bigger (only that it worked better).<br>I have no idea about any of this tech stuff but all I want is a functional tablet with good software and support. I dont use pen tilt or even need buttons on the tablet (I have a keyboard). Because if this I&#039;m heavily leaning to a less feature packed Wacom. I really don&#039;t want to buy used.

Pentel Graphgear 1000 is nice, but doesnt have the same heft as the Staedtler. I only have 1 of those. If serious about it or do drafting, Id recommend getting rotring 600. its full metal body and pretty much the best possible mechanical pencil you can possibly buy. everything about it is fantastic. the feel, weight, how much lead comes out with each click, durability, etc. the others have mostly plastic construction with a metal tip. this thing will last you forever and can pass on to your kids type of deal. if you need perfection, that is the one to get. super expensive for a pencil though. <br><br>for sizes, it comes down to what you draw and the size of the paper/lines you want. 0.5mm is a good starting point. i dont think you will want the 0.7 or 0.9 options. fairly large lead size. if going that big, youre better off looking into lead holders. a 2mm is nice for just roughing in lines and i let my go dull so its not making hard lines/easier to erase. once youve got your gesture/shapes in, you can switch to a 0.5 or smaller for details depending on the actual drawing space/size of the page. 0.3 is my detail size usually. i dont go smaller often unless its some architecture/drafting thing im doing where there are more standards for lines. like id do a person/anime/comic book character in 0.5 and the eyes or any smaller details with 0.3. could do the whole thing in either size though. i dont think you need a million pencils. i just happen to have them for various work and commercial reasons.<br><br>for lead, i have a lot. 2B or HB is all youll probably need. ive got pencils of multiple sizes with 8H, 4H, 2H, 2B, HB, etc.", "time": 1675296485, "resto": 6482721}, {"no": 6500974, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)19:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6500924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6500924</a><br>Sorry friend I got this from Pixiv, it&#039;s just to illustrate the clean line art<br><a href=\"#p6500931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6500931</a><br>Thank you very much, I&#039;ll look into it", "time": 1675297721, "resto": 6482721}, {"no": 6501387, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)00:39:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6500904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6500904</a><br>Pentel P205 for sketching, Graphgear 500 for linework.", "time": 1675316362, "resto": 6482721}, {"no": 6501762, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:54:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6483737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6483737</a><br>Gouache is much cheaper and easier to get into, you can reactivate anytime you wish, blend with water, it has many limitations, the colors shift a lot, very low contrast due to the matte finish.

I mainly make profits from selling my books and original page art at art shows and comic and anime conventions. I fund my print runs with crowdfunding campaigns, and then sell the books for pure profit at shows. My evergreen bestseller is Purrvana, a colorful watercolor painted psychedelic cat graphic novel that appeals to normies of all ages and all demographics from bikers to gangsters to grannies to crazy cat ladies. I have sold over 2,500 copies of Purrvana to date. I also make money from commissions, both my OCs and other people. Most of my commissions are catfight wrestling matches featuring my OCs or other people&#039;s OCs. I advertise mainly on pixiv, discord, twitter and my webcomic also works as an advertisement. I also drew animal coloring books years ago that still sell, at shows and online. After a bad experience working with a publisher several years ago, I began self publishing and now that&#039;s all I want to do.<br><br>I read that Image creators are in the red and go in to debt with Image unless their book sells a certain amount of copies. I recently read tweets from an image artist who says that after his book he worked on sold 5 issues at 15,000 issues each, he only made $1100 in profit and he got paid months after the final issue came out, after the profit share was split with image, the writer and colorist. I don&#039;t sell a high volume of copies, and my crowdfunders don&#039;t go crazy, but I still make a lot more profit than that Image artist whose book was selling 15,000 copies each issue for example because I keep all the profit of sales for myself. I also do freelance work. Advertising and marketing is not really something I&#039;m good at, but I&#039;m getting by and trying to improve at it. I&#039;m also going to start a life drawing class at my local Junior College next week and I hope it will up my skills so I can charge more for commissions, and it will also improve my comic pages.

Guess niche fetish art pays because more passionate fans needing to scratch that spefic itch. Draw basic pin ups of basic anime girls and you will be lost in the sea of artists doing it. Spice it up with personal niche and you get devoted fans willing to pay you", "time": 1675378887, "resto": 6429056}, {"no": 6503148, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)21:24:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.instagram.com/navarysar<wbr>t<br>https://twitter.com/lunarbadger<br><br>I don\u2019t post as much as I should.

Keep trying and thinking on how to achieve your goals in a healthy way. Plus remember you need to get to a high enough skill level where your creations naturally comeout. If its frustrating you, re-evaluate the goal and lower it to a skill level thats appropriate. So with comic making, if you get stuck on a full story, do a short story, and if you get stuck on a short story, do a one page scene.
