Aside from two paintings of doubtful attribution painted around 1440, the first successful use of full angular perspective was by Dutch artist Gerard Houckgeest in 1650. (There was limited use of the angular construction in floor tiling throughout the period, but this could easily be achieved by connecting the corners of a one-point perspective grid, and did not require an understanding of the rules of two-point construction.) Inspired to develop a radical design for his painting of the tomb of William the Silent, the king whose efforts united Holland in 1581, Houckgeest turned to Vredemann\u2019s architectural representation technique of the oblique construction for the interior of the church at Delft. This dramatic shift from the unremitting one-point perspectives of the church interiors of Saenredam and Neeffs gained Houckgeest immense popularity in The Netherlands, but it was to be another half-century before the two-point construction appeared in Italy in the hands of Canaletto.&quot;<br>https://www.webexhibits.org/sciartp<wbr>erspective/raphaelperspective6.html<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6483887</span><br>Is this mental illness?", "time": 1674325056, "resto": 6483529}, {"no": 6484058, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)15:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vermeer was also involved in fraud, forging his mother-in-law&#039;s name to borrow money, then right after that dying mysteriously at age 43.

It entails first drawing a simple view, then projecting parallel lines from various points on the figure at a desired angle to construct a second view. Sometimes, as in picrel, one or more intermediary steps are required to get the desired end result. Picrel is from Jean Cousin&#039;s Livre de Portraiture, which contains many examples. You can also find a few simple (one-step) examples of this method in Burne Hogarthe&#039;s Dynamic Figure Drawing. It shows up mostly in older books, though.<br>Note: This method does not give you size/camera distortion, only foreshortening. For the former, you need to set up a picture plane and have your projecting lines converge towards a point representing the eye of the viewer.<br>This is all fascinating but I don&#039;t recommend it. When it takes more than one step, it&#039;s an enormous amount of labor; furthermore, it&#039;s difficult to predict the end result. It is better to work intuitively and train your eye to what looks right.

I started at the age of 29 and even went to art school after. The difficulties are mostly psychological in nature. I was already established in my field, made good money and was regarded as a high achiever in things that required a logic/math oriented mind. Starting out people chuckled at my trash art, they saw it in contrast to my wagie achievements and also even felt safe to shit talk me, because &quot;I could take it right?&quot;.<br>Things got worse when I went to art school to try to become pro at some point. The school itself was great, and I didnt mind meeting younger people better than me, it was actually a blast. The bad part are family, partners, friends who actively discourage you &quot;from throwing your life and talent away&quot;. This continues to this day, I am 36 now and a decent artist. Yes I don&#039;t earn nearly as much as I did, but I am happy and don&#039;t feel depressed anymore. Still get offers from people in STEM &quot;to come work&quot; with them. It&#039;s meant well, but I can&#039;t help but feel hurt by the fact that the people closest to me think what I am doing is kind of a joke and they are still waiting for me to &quot;snap out of it&quot; and get a real job.<br>Just be prepared to find new art friends and be humble again. You will go from high regarded normie to nobody overnight. You will most likely not get support from the people you think who would, even worse you will get discouragement throughout. This, paired with the fact that you will have low confidence at first (because you are bad and even young kids are better than you) makes it incredibly hard to make it.

I&#039;ve been drawing since childhood. Didn&#039;t go in artscool or art classes. I drew cartoons, anime, some of my fantasies. My classmates thought that I was good at drawing, my parents also praised me. I thought I was good, when in reality I just drew like a child who loves to draw. In each class there are at least 1-2 such children. You know these guys, or maybe you were them.<br>With age, I began to draw less and less, by the age of 18-19 I drew maybe a couple of times a year.<br>But one time I needed to draw pictures for my text rpg, and god, I realized how shitty of this i was. <br>This caused me great pain, never in my life i hated and despised myself more.<br>So I took courses in academic drawing and painting. I was 27 at the time.<br>Now I&#039;m 31 and I still continue my education. By no means do I claim that I am a good artist now, I am not even close, but I see my growth with each work.<br><br>So, in my opinion, drawing as a child gives only two good things:<br>1. Fine motor skills develop.<br>2. You go through the drawing phase for fun as a teenager.<br><br>The first catches up very quickly, in just a couple of lessons you will already be good friends with a pencil/stylus.<br><br>The second point is what breaks many adult beginners.<br><br>The realization that before you start drawing your fantasies, you have to go through the hard and boring part. And it may take years. Those who have been drawing since childhood already had their fun. They have drawn cute anime girls, robots, disney princesses and monsters.They understand that it will not get better. And they will have to suffer. And accept it more humbly.<br><br>All this, of course, does not apply to those who studied in art schools as children, and then continued their studies in art at a college or university.

Seeing at a different angle makes the mistakes stand out. For the likeness, get the shape of the head is really important, yours is pretty good.

I do have a memory, I know what I look like or my mother. I just can&#039;t project it into my visual field or use my third eye to see it with my mind&#039;s eye. I have a friend of mine who can project anything into his sight, we call that hyperphantasia. btw I do have imagination since my &quot;PC is working well&quot;. It&#039;s different for audio stuff tho. I can hear my thoughts in any voice, imagine music and instruments, sounds and stuff in my head. other senses like smell, touch and taste are less pronounced. I can feel imagined touch to some degree but taste and smell are basically not existent. I do differentiate between the third eye visualization, hypnagogia and dreams. I do dream and I see them just the same as if I&#039;m awake. I do see flashes when tired and shortly before going to sleep. for me that&#039;s working alright. but in the waking state I just see black when closing my eyes, I just see black when thinking of a person or an object.

Reading is supposed to be smooth, clear, and quick. Language evolves to be smooth clear and quick. You want to communicate with as much ease as possible, and so the more visual elements you add the more bogged down that communication becomes. Your eyes become lost in the colors even if they look pretty. I feel the same way about black and white comics that use too many greys and too much detail on every page. I consider the best comics to be the ones where you not only get completely immersed in the story, but you&#039;re also turning the pages quickly so you don&#039;t get a chance to break that immersion or think about anything else. You shouldn&#039;t have to pause the story in your head to think &quot;wow how beautiful&quot; unless it&#039;s deliberately there for the pacing. You should only linger on a page if that is what the story calls for, like to take in the scenery or gravity. Black and white keeps your eyes moving, undistracted, turning the pages, until you hit a beautiful two page spread with intricacies deliberately rendered to make you stop and look carefully. And whatever you&#039;re looking at there, would likely be important.<br>As for skill level in coloring I don&#039;t care. A comic artist is a comic artist. It&#039;s a separate skill from illustration. Learning to speak in sequential imagery is a skill of its own that even the most skillful colorist could fail at. All language, including the language of sequential imagery, should be simple and concise. Highly skilled highly rendered colorful illustrations aren&#039;t simple and concise, they&#039;re just pretty. What you don&#039;t include in your art is just as important as what you do include. Manga is popular because people like it. It&#039;s just that simple. And they like it because it trims all the fat and focuses on easy visual communication and smooth eye movement, while also making its limited black and white look pretty.", "filename": "C3548F01-B0B3-4FC1-8BE2-484C6CCFF95D", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 924, "h": 1387, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674319457754302, "time": 1674319457, "md5": "HpUEbZY+PEYqiVlao85dwQ==", "fsize": 240705, "resto": 6482017}, {"no": 6483832, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)12:26:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I think it depends on the comic.

Nothing beats a regular pencil on printer paper. Limitless medium. Main tool I use, always carry a pencil with me everywhere I go. Cheap color pencil like crayola is easy for quick coloring. Expensive color pencils work nicely with mixed media.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Charcoal and conte</span><br>Love charcoal on newsprint. Use it not only for figures but also for sketching whatever comes to my mind. The effects of charcoal and conte are very unique and I like the look of fluid and gestural drawings in charcoal.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ink</span><br>Kino. Great medium and so much you can do with just ink and black and white. Both ink pen and wash are nice and I love the smell of ink.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oil</span><br>So much you can do with it from simple to incredibly complex. The luminosity of paints and the way layers shine through each other is beautiful. A medium that really is fantastic but takes a lot of thought and consideration into brush strokes, colors, temperature, drying time, even how much paint you load to make a good painting. Can start to become very expensive when buying mediums and more colors. Using a few tubes limits the color range you can get as you lose chroma from mixing but I&#039;m pretty sure there are some painters who use translucent layering from pure colors to get bright effects and having layers shine through together without needing to mix colors directly at all that they wouldn&#039;t be able to get from mixing. Slow drying.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Acrylic</span><br>Hard medium but a great challenge. I don&#039;t like the way colors look through layering but it might be a competency issue. Not as beautiful as oil but acrylic is good for mixed media and you can use different mediums with acrylic for different effects and it dries much faster.<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1674075502, "resto": 6479669}, {"no": 6479849, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)15:59:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6479847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6479847</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Watercolor</span><br>Easy for anyone to pick up but hard to get good. I like the look of washes and translucent layers. Cheaper than and dries fast. I have trouble with drying times and the way my brushstrokes look because of it. Love it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gouache</span><br>Really bad with it. I like to use it opaque like with acrylic, but you can definitely use it with translucent layers. When I paint opaque with it my brush picks up the layer underneath because gouache reactivates very easily from water, which gives me awful colors, and trying to get around this with a thicker paint stroke makes my surface and layers uneven and thick giving them unintended texture. When using opaque strokes I lose values and chroma so I cannot reach the color notes I could get with translucent layering over the whiteness of the paper, or maybe I just don&#039;t know how to mix gouache I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m still keen on using it to improve but it is very hard.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oil pastel</span><br>It&#039;s ok, I used it for mixed media once. Gives an unique look.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Digital</span><br>Efficient and easy to clean up. Can reach color notes easily, but I prefer the color of oil paints and watercolor over digital colors and layering. I don&#039;t like using digital for lineart either, prefer to use a real pen instead. I don&#039;t like staring at blue light and prefer traditional because I&#039;m a tactile person and like the feeling and smell of traditional tools. Digital is great for pumping things out quickly though but trying to spend for than 10 hours on a digital piece is a chore meanwhile with traditional I can easily spend more time on it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sculpting</span><br>Worked with natural clay, polymer clay, and monster clay before.

Artists naturally have high egos and to imply that they do not have an ability in a skill that they think is beneath them--in this case, teaching--is far to incomprehensible for them to process. So instead of attempting to improve at the skill of teaching and finding other, more concrete ways of explaining something, they resort to shit-flinging and name-calling anyone who doesn&#039;t immediately understand their shit advice. <br><br>&quot;Just Draw&quot; is another one of those shit advice. It&#039;s pandered by artists who want to seem like they know a thing or two about drawing but are absolutely ignorant on the process of drawing. If you were to ask Kim Jung Gi why he makes the marks he makes, he could pull a bullshit answer out of his ass that will help literally no one except those who are already good at drawing. If he was being honest, he&#039;d just say to &quot;just draw&quot; because he doesn&#039;t know what specific things you need to do in order to improve and even if he did, he wouldn&#039;t be a good enough teacher to explain it properly. <br><br>This goes to my point in another thread about the PET acronym. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Performer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teacher</span><br>Nearly all of /ic/ are either performers or aspiring performers.

Performers tend to not understand the process of being able to learn something and therefore are the worst teachers in that field. They tended to have received their skill by sheer mileage and have often taken decades to get to where they currently are. As they have not properly analyzed their approach and why they do certain things, they have an intuitive understanding of drawing which only helps them. Basically, performers cannot teach and can only perform. This is where you get the advice to &quot;just draw&quot; because performers tend to be the ones that actually take this advice seriously and tend to get good by sheer mileage rather than anything concrete that you can teach to anyone. <br><br>Teachers understand a skill at a much higher level than performers and while they may not be as good as the performers, they will often coach the performers regardless. Note how coaches in sports aren&#039;t usually better than the players on the team. (If they were, they&#039;d be mentors not teachers or coaches.) A teacher must have a very high level of understanding of whatever skill they are pursuing as they have to properly explain each and every step--otherwise, they&#039;re wasting everyone&#039;s time. <br><br>For instance, if we were to bring this back to drawing, lets say a beginner creates a drawing. You notice that the drawing is shit but because you are a performer, you can&#039;t exactly explain why it is shit.

Sometimes this is due to a &quot;copying is bad&quot; mind poison, sometimes it&#039;s due to a false idea that to &quot;be a master&quot; means that drawing entirely from imagination is the skill to practice. <br><br>In general, though, it&#039;s that they haven&#039;t made a conscious effort to examine their own tastes to where they have anything to say. It can be a compartmentalization issue - happens with coomer artists a lot, where they filter everything &quot;not sexy&quot; into a different mental box and so put almost no new inspiration into their &quot;sexy art box&quot; on the daily. <br><br>It could also be a complete disconnect between what they like to consume and what they like to produce - for some, a motivation to create is because of a lack of met desires with what currently exists.

I don&#039;t really think I&#039;m in a position where I can give you good advice, I have a great art friend who taught me a lot and the best thing I can say from what I learned from him is that you should take light fall off seriously. Values fall abruptly right before the light turns into shadow, it can be tricky to see but once you know it you can observe it everywhere and study the phenomenon (I did a poor job with this too by the way). Also, I prefer using opacity jitter rather than flow and another lesson from my friend was to keep the hardness of the round brush at about 50% most of the time, that way you can paint soft brush strokes by making the size bigger and hard brush strokes by making the size smaller. Don&#039;t ask me why but it works.

Also, simple styles like cartoon are just easier to draw yourself even if you suck at drawing then prompt the AI. Even normies know that what they generate is not exactly what they want and will spend several minutes trying to wrangle the prompts into giving them the desired character in desired style and desired pose, only to then lose all the free credits and be then forced to pay 30 dollar monthly fee for Dall-E or Midjourney. They will not use Stable Diffusion, that model is too small to produce good stuff without /sdg/ autism analysing each prompt and its weights.

ChatGPT still can\u2019t produce long cohesive texts that follow context well and will not do it for a while since lack of memory is key aspects of all the most advanced current textbots. Character design that tells a story and is part of a universe you made will not go away yet.

A few hours a day thumbnailing for boards, and a few hours a day life drawing will take you insanely far. By the time you get around to finishing a board you will be better than you were.

Think about the crew you&#039;re working with and then decide if being a senior or manager is worth it.<br><br>In one company, I had to deal with catty, woke bitches who only promoted people who kissed their asses. And they still continued to kiss ass while scrambling to get their shit together and blaming the people below them for not delivering on their promises. The entire team was a fucking mess and everyone was terrified they&#039;d get fired the next day. I would never want to work in that position, that&#039;d be literally like selling out my soul and morals.<br><br>In my current company, the people are actually smart. They might act woke, but they care more about what you can bring to the table more than anything. Most people are comfy as fuck and we&#039;re always ahead of schedule. My current manager keeps suggesting me leadership roles and asking if I would be interested in being a manager. I had never once had to speak up about my politics. I&#039;m only hesitant because I&#039;m already in a senior position but I don&#039;t want any more responsibilities cause my role is cozy. I&#039;d only take it up if they start to think I&#039;m too expensive for my position.<br><br>The zoomies do talk about politics but I usually just nod and try to steer the conversation to something lighter or some joke.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal.
