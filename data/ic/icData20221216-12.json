The industry is built in a way that financially incentivizes artists to further develop their skills and mastery of them. It&#039;s about as merit-based as you can get. With the most skilled artists getting the highest pay. That pursuit of self mastery, and the satisfaction of having created something with your own hands and mind, is exactly what gives the artist pleasure, and it&#039;s exactly what the industry encourages and rewards. Now you&#039;re saying, forget all the reasons you became an artist in the first place, become a code monkey like me, and Master a &quot;skill&quot; that takes an afternoon of tinkering to get good at, rather than a lifetime of dedication. The entire process of making AI &quot;art&quot; is completely at odds with what making actual art is like, and where artists find their inspiration. Your posting of pretty pictures wouldn&#039;t exist in the first place if you didn&#039;t have thousands of people who devoted their lives toward that aesthetic pursuit. Something an AI cannot do, at all. Because an AI cannot actually think for itself. The artist knows they didn&#039;t make that. That&#039;s why they&#039;re not satisfied with it. And despite your efforts to legitimize yourself with the title of &quot;prompter&quot; you didn&#039;t make it either. The machine did. But in order to validate the machine as a creative entity, you must first prove that the machine can think for itself.

Training machine learning models on synthetic datasets (i.e., data created and used entirely by AI for AI) is already a thing in big tech, and is sometimes preferable to training the models on the real thing. In essence, the AI will think for itself by training on itself. You should google it; this shit is crazy.<br><br>I do see where you&#039;re coming from in the other parts of your post, but ultimately isn&#039;t every industry built on the same mastery of skills? What industry doesn&#039;t better reward the best of the best for doing what they do? And if certain prompters are simply better than others at generating things using AI tools, are they not engaging in exactly the type of mastery you speak of? Again, I&#039;m not talking about the &quot;soul&quot; of the art here, but rather the using it as a means for monetary gain, which is what artists seem to be worried about.<br><br><a href=\"#p6421070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6421070</a><br><a href=\"#p6421074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6421074</a><br>Fair point.

It doesn&#039;t need to be colorful - it just need to be more structured. As it is now, the disorganization of ideas makes it unappealing and off-putting, I have a hard time figuring out in what order I should read the panels, what comes after what. It doesn&#039;t look like a strip, there is nothing guiding my eye in a continuity of events - it&#039;s all there, jumbled and confusing, all the information put forth in an explosion of thoughts and feelings. It&#039;s good as a creative exercise, as creation is usually explosive, but it needs refinement and structure in order to become digestible. When you open a book, seldom does the story develop all at the same time. It goes by parts, and it flows naturally from one event to the next. You need to think of your viewer as an infant that knows nothing of what you&#039;re trying to say to him, hold his hand, and walk him through your world, piece by piece, character by character, event by event, and thus the story starts to unravel before him, slowly and curiously. <br><br>You have talent.

I would imagine many or most of you could draw something better looking than this, so I hope this pushes you towards doing it yourselves. Got some notes of my own, but I&#039;d like other comments.<br><br>So starting off, I wanted to rectify one of my issues, in which it wasn&#039;t really clear where the characters were. Since that was clear, I wanted to immediately establish the Haunted House. I originally tried to draw the whole thing, but that took up too much space to even try to make it readable, so I cut out everything except the top, I think this was a fine decision. The first issue was the door. I was gonna have the door peeping open, then show the inside of the haunted house, cutting to the characters on the 2nd page. I realized that&#039;d leave me with barely any time for the &#039;plot&#039;, so I kept the door, and had the scaring faces.<br><br>As I was drawing the 2nd page, it felt obvious to me that I should have scrapped the door, to give more space for the scaring, to show more of the ones being scared, cause cutting straight to the scared faces on the 2nd page seems kind of abrupt, the build-up didn&#039;t seem enough for it as it stands.<br><br>If that was fixed, I think the top two panels of the 2nd page would be serviceable. As for the third panel on the 2nd page, I originally had all three of the scarers on the same page, to re-establish the fact that there were three of them. But I realized that with the current plan, I would have had almost a repeat looking structure. The vampire girl would have asked the last question in this panel, by the way.<br><br> I ended up changing the last panel as well. It was originally two, where the pumpkin head was going to ask who the girl was talking to, and it would cut to a similar looking panel as the current last, just a bit more squeezed. Speaking of that last panel, my lack of ability in perspective showed itself, I feel the idea (that the ghost disappeared) wasn&#039;t portrayed well.", "filename": "Comic7_005", "ext": ".png", "w": 1155, "h": 746, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1670297120893740, "time": 1670297120, "md5": "If4E5CZprTuTDf9fLg42kA==", "fsize": 543394, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404383, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:26:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403991</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://medibang.com/mpc/</span><br>is he the only consistent creator on manga dex ?<br><br>I mean pumping out 40 pages is pretty fucking impressive .", "time": 1670297201, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404390, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:33:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404383</a><br>fuck , forgot picrel", "filename": "Consistent", "ext": ".png", "w": 654, "h": 448, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1670297621886711, "time": 1670297621, "md5": "SQi2r9DKIKM4db7EZmEBMA==", "fsize": 306282, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404395, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:38:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404174</a><br>Aside from a convention, is there any more formal way to go about it?

I wish the bottom image was more INTENSE. The guy on the rights elbow should be slightly further back (like he&#039;s really PULLING left towards him) and with that same pulling motion the angle on his elbow should be closer together and the fist would be quite higher (the elbow going from 90 degree to around 45?). Also humans are really heavy so right would probably be leaning towards left at a stronger more dominant angle, which would make the scene more uncomfortable/tense having their faces closer. With that in mind I&#039;d change lefts posture too, to make them pulling away from right, with an arch in the back. With the stronger more dynamic pose, lefts t shirt would be getting pulled further up the back on the neck with more stretch and tension in the material.

There&#039;s no direct equivalent to this in digital since digital ink doesn&#039;t bleed, but you can minimize the effect by applying a blur before you export.

Yes, I am trying not to be luddite and trying it out for fun, no I will not pay them, no my prompts are too simple to help them in any way). What I mean seriously take off is most studios kicking out all all of the art team and 60+% of commercial artist jobs being lost. We are nowhere near that, but I can assure you that we will get there after prompting becomes easier to the point of you needing to just write perfect description of the scene and the AI perfectly placing each object there, and easily allowing you to change that with drag and drop features.

Normies are already losing interest in AI art after the novelty wore off, and they still largely prefer human artists, since if you say the art was generated by AI, it instantly loses its soul. The picture might look soulful in any way you could compare with other pictures, but once you namedrop the AI, it will quickly lose the interest of certain chunk of the demographic. When AI becomes widely accessible to everyone of no skill level, and it gets revealed that most artists are in fact just AIs that dont tag their images as AI generated, people will quickly hop on the train, every normie will become artist, and then the fad will go away and people will be no longer interested in it, but they will also lose interest with real art as well, since why even bother caring about something that every idiot with internet connection can do in 5 seconds.

What I think will happen is that people will indeed lose interest in ai shit (they already are) and more and more art related communities will start kicking ai prompters out, until all they have left is their subreddits and discords. People will put disclaimers like &quot;100% human created&quot; when posting artwork (I&#039;ve already seen twitterfags do it), 4chan drawthreads will put &quot;no ai&quot; into their OP (I&#039;ve already seem that on /co/) and eventually, it will simply turn into an obscure niche that only certain dedicated autists will care about. <br><br>The reason why the &quot;globohomo artstyle&quot; is so hated it&#039;s because coorporations overuse it RIGHT NOW.

Coorporations might be evil but they still care about self-preservation, not to mention the political implications of millions of people losing their income.

Most of online success is marketing.<br>Which is funny because the majority of these AI images struggle to gain more than 20 likes, where as even an artist with terrible self promotion and worse art skills can get more likes on average.<br><a href=\"#p6415324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6415324</a><br>Being an attention whore is not inherently wrong, but it&#039;s pointless. I think people are just flabbergasted that that would be an actual motivation for you, because at least with art attention whores, taking away the attention part they still draw because they&#039;re honing their skills and are proud of the fact they are able to capture a vision they had in their head by working hard and learning how to translate that accurately to paper. The same is not true here, there is no grind, nothing crafted that&#039;s actually intrinsically and unmistakably your own creation that could only be made by you. It&#039;s a weird motivation to waste your own time like this, to larp as someone who can make something like this solely for the praise/attention part and absolutely none of the gratification aspect. It&#039;d be less hassle to be a camwhore or something.", "time": 1671152066, "resto": 6414728}, {"no": 6420275, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:01:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Imagine being a cuck for AI art, lmao.

By significant errors, I mean the following. Perspective: the hat seems to be intended to be circular and viewed from below, and if that is the case, we should see most of the underside, but instead we see most of the top. Anatomy: the left and right hands have different finger widths and the right hand could not grip the pole properly in this position. Also there is no shape to the ankles, and a very long torso and upper legs compared to short lower legs. Line work: the line work is all of the same width and is concentrated in areas of higher detail, making them appear darker even when they are not in shadow. Hatching direction is inconsistent without any obvious reason to change directions in different areas. Rendering: the light seems to be coming from the left according to the fence and the clouds, but the grass casts shadows in the opposite direction - unless those are ripples, which is unclear. Some portions of the character are shaded, while the hands, face, and underside of the hat are not shaded. The transition from light to dark is abrupt in all areas without any form of feathering. <br><br>That said, the composition is nice and I like the way that the fishing rod and line bounces the eye back and forth.

AI bros use copyrighted pictures all the time without any shame. The reason that music gets pass is because there is less amount of frequencies in a song then there is pixels in picture. And there is way less desirable combinations of sound then there is combinations of shapes and colors. Most human music follows few sets of tempos that align with our biological mechanisms like breathing or heartrate. Instruments can only do so many sounds, and the same is for electro dubstep. If you let AI loose on music, it would start creating almost the exact copies of songs that listener would not be able to tell apart when listening to them for comparison. With Ai pictures and videos you cant say the same. Ask Ai to generate some public domain painting like the Starry Night from Vincent. It will give you blurry meshes that have incorrect number of clouds, some stars different and so on. Now if you listen to the music, it will become way way harder to notice, especially when the Ai is trained on certain human tempo that funnels certain sounds into their specific holes. If you looked at the diagram of the sound, you could easily see the differences, but when hearing it, not so much.

Understandably it makes the drawings look ugly but I guess that&#039;s sort of the point? There&#039;s something to be said for people who go out of their way to draw ugly things, it makes this point to capture realism at the cost of appeal. I kind of like it in theory. I always got the feeling it caused such a knee-jerk reaction from people because of the rise of social justice at the time, people were tired of hearing how much of oppressors they were just for having preferences and beauty standards so the artstyle was only pouring salt into the wound.

AI is program running on any computer that can do cognitive and informational tasks, but it also has very human design in its creation. Relying more on self thought probabilistic abstract connections instead of being line of code that is executed and has predictable outcomes. It is uniquely capable of doing any work human brain can do.

I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

I think putting characters together and having them discuss their ideas on whatever topics can help flesh them out as individuals rather than just character tropes. I usually like to put characters with opposing beliefs against each other. I think something helpful is also having someone to bounce ideas off of. I used to &quot;roleplay&quot; with other people, but it&#039;s not like the typical weird ERP roleplaying. It was more similar to writing an actual story where you choose a setting and each person takes turn writing full paragraphs and improv. There was a much stronger focus on writing an actual story and dialogue. You could consider it as writing a story with a partner rather than roleplaying. It&#039;s sounds cringe but it did help me empathize more with my characters and try to understand them. It also helped me understand how other people characterize and write their own characters.

(although any on-brand types of clay should be safe from toxins, there used to be a toxic plastic mixed in but most brands has removed this.) <br>When buying clay there is a typical difference between more expensive and cheaper brands, FIMO is a good lower cost brand, which does have some flexibility in the finished items.<br>I personally am planning to bulk buy cosclay, cosclay is even more flexible than Fimo.<br>When buying polymer clay you may notice there is a soft, medium and harder type - harder is more difficult to form, however it keeps details and frankly the soft clay will just fall apart if you are trying to make a standing clay sculpture.<br>For painting the sculpture I recommend using acryllic paint, fitting as that too is artificial plastics<br>Good luck with the arts anon", "time": 1670702435, "resto": 6409615}, {"no": 6410094, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)15:46:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6410055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6410055</a><br>Hello there.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The clay you are looking for is Polymer Clay</span><br>I&#039;m not really interested in baking clay.<br>I&#039;m using it to practice sculpting ultimately I plan on going into a mixed process where some things I sculpt in Chavant and then scan into the computer to fix or model further in the PC. <br><br>Like you can see there is no real need for baking it for me.<br><br>I plan on using plastic pins to hold some parts of the sculpture together. and their nature will make it trivial to simply assemble the sculpt for scanning (the horns can be problematic) and reassemble it in the PC.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Good luck with the arts anon</span><br>Thanks.<br><br>Does literally anyone know how to work with monster clay ?

To understand why it&#039;s as such you&#039;d need to study Japanese society and the psychological aspect behind the evolution of such artistic style. Once you do you then understand the groups of people in the West who like it vs. those who don&#039;t like it and the differences between their respective cognitions. One key reason is how much the average American/Westerner cares about how they are seen by others and whether they abide to what&#039;s &quot;objective&quot; or not, and thus how much they themselves get subconsciously shaped by others in the process.<br><br>That&#039;s one perspective. Others exist and continue to come through.<br>For example it&#039;s been a few years now that Western women artists (and those who identify with them) have been vehemently against anime because it often represents youth and beauty at a level which makes them personally feel uncomfortable at a less conscious level. This is a not a popular or nice thing to say (the truth never is really), but women&#039;s value are still very rooted in their appearance. As women get into their mid-20s and approach their 30s they watch their value decay and they come to understand that they simply cannot match the intuitive idealized expectation of most men anymore from a beauty standpoint (which anime showcases well on a certain level). The opposite isn&#039;t true: I don&#039;t think there are many guys feeling envious of anime guys. They appear cool and that&#039;s it, or if anything they can inspire growth.<br>This is why we&#039;re now witnessing an epidemy on social medias (and even this board now) with them calling any artist who dares to like anime &quot;pedos&quot; and whatnot, as a way to try and shape the norms, to shape reality, in a way that is more comfortable to them and can bring power back to them in this gender dynamic seen from a larger scale.", "time": 1670616243, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408884, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)15:54:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "watercolor practice", "filename": "221209", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1115, "tn_w": 112, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670619270032144, "time": 1670619270, "md5": "958gzWBKoIS8MV+6d4uEXQ==", "fsize": 414201, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408908, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:26:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6408772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6408772</a><br>Which tablet are you getting?", "time": 1670621196, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408909, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:27:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6408908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6408908</a><br>one of the screenless wacom ones", "time": 1670621267, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408928, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:55:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404199</a><br>Post your work first asshole then I will honestly post mine.

She&#039;s also mexican, but a cosplayer. And also has massive jugs, that she doesn&#039;t really show. And her style is pretty meh, just some chubby anime-esque bitches.

On Scratch, a kid-focused website (I&#039;ve used it since I was a kid and I still like it), children and teens still make them.

You&#039;re only seeing the surface level. The real differences here are<br><br>1.) A far better understanding of form. The face on the right is the most striking example, the way that the eyes are drawn indicates the head as a rounded volume with mass, whereas the left is a flat shape with sticker eyes applied to it. The jacket, clothes and even hair made of distinct, solid masses overlaid upon and wrapping around the body in layers. They all feel like they have weight and force applied to them as well. If you were really paying attention, you&#039;ll also notice very subtle indicators implying forms like the bones and tendons of the hand and the wrist under the skin- like the clothes, there is a feeling of the skin stretched upon and wrapping around these delicate forms.<br><br>2.) Better understanding of subject matter. Not only does the artist have a better understanding of human anatomy, they have an understanding of the anatomy of EVERYTHING in the piece. The jacket, the shirt, the pants, the hair, the skin and bone, they know the parts, the materials, how they fit together, and most importantly WHY that they are the way they are and act the way they do. This is why the clothes, the hair, the skin have such definite mass and purposeful application of forces upon them. See those crisp, chunky folds in the jacket on the right and compare them to the almost vacuum sealed, skintight jacket on the left with muddy indefinite marks indicating the idea of wrinkles that the artist knows should be there but doesn&#039;t understand how they work as 3D form, or the properties of the material that they&#039;re deforming.", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-06 20-17-57", "ext": ".png", "w": 733, "h": 758, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670380263658576, "time": 1670380263, "md5": "5xKi1KIqRsTTW1Hsb4XfjA==", "fsize": 644680, "resto": 6400360}, {"no": 6405564, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6405556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6405556</a><br>(cont&#039;d)<br>Now let&#039;s talk about you, and how you might learn better in the future if you weren&#039;t such a quarrelsome, midwitted know-it-all that defends every stupid hot take you have to the death, argues for the sake of argument, and won&#039;t ever listen to anyone else.<br>First off, the reason why you can&#039;t &quot;get anything&quot; out of the OP pic was because it&#039;s in Korean.

I&#039;m a beginner though, so take my comments with a grain of salt since this is just advice based on techniques I&#039;ve read up on.<br><br>The main thing to fix it would just be to clean up your lines. Like on the feet you have some double wide lines right on the end of them and it just looks messy so get rid of those. You have that too at the bottom of your character&#039;s head which could be seen as shadowing, but unless you emphasize it a bit more to me it just looks like a blob of messy linework.<br><br>In addition you have lots of doubling going on with your linework in general and while it can be a stylistic choice, typically it looks better to get rid of them. The pic here shows what I&#039;m talking about and no I don&#039;t know what it says, it was just the best image I could find to display it.<br><br>You also want to generally avoid outlines from different elements of a character intersecting. Like the outlines of the dude&#039;s eyes and hair meet and it looks messy so try and keep the lines one pixel in width so the lines are clean or provide a gap between the two elements so each part is distinct.<br><br>Other than some simple line cleanup your little dude looks good! I always have trouble getting eyes to look good with pixels and those look nice. It would not take much to make him look better!", "filename": "b6724eeb094ad5c375fcde94947429d7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 736, "h": 1104, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670709198156706, "time": 1670709198, "md5": "+mxxh0CgBLDfQivOrIW/8A==", "fsize": 44359, "resto": 6389109}, {"no": 6410267, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:49:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6389109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6389109</a>", "filename": "mommysexy", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670716197999107, "time": 1670716197, "md5": "/xWcG7araQnzg3wBXMwIJA==", "fsize": 21507, "resto": 6389109}, {"no": 6410268, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6389109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6389109</a><br>test", "time": 1670716291, "resto": 6389109}, {"no": 6410270, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:52:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve never been particularly fond of pixel art, but I do appreciate the work that goes into it.", "time": 1670716359, "resto": 6389109}, {"no": 6410623, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:04:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Should shading be its own layer?", "time": 1670745848, "resto": 6389109}, {"no": 6410739, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)06:46:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6410165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6410165</a><br>Thanks bro I&#039;ll keep going then clear up the lines at the end", "time": 1670759175, "resto": 6389109}, {"no": 6412018, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)01:02:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6409136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6409136</a><br>I like making 32x32 sprites with at most 4 colors: black, white, and 2 variable colors.", "filename": "Game Enemies Upped", "ext": ".png", "w": 1081, "h": 1081, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670824978528711, "time": 1670824978, "md5": "ZTt0rwOn5QML39zubmF8LQ==", "fsize": 32425, "resto": 6389109}, {"no": 6413952, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)21:56:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6389109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6389109</a><br>I drew this a couple of months ago.
