I&#039;m also working on a comic, and it&#039;s definitely a challenge to make dialogue seem natural and not cringe-inducing. Try and act out the interaction in your head, and ask yourself if it would be like that in a real life interaction. Also keep in the mind that the character&#039;s personality plays a role in each interaction (If you haven&#039;t done this already, you should write down a document for yourself that includes your character&#039;s personality, motivations, fears, etc..) And another thing to keep in mind is that not everything has to be vocalized. <br><br>I found it weird how this main character knows English well when she was abandoned as a little kid, I think she should be more mute (Or maybe you could make her dialogue have a purposefully limited choice of words.)

This was to see if I could get close to the original. It was drawn in 1600x2000 then cropped down mainly with the brush size between 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 depending on what the line thickness is. It&#039;s not a good brush for a single line drawing. Instead, you&#039;ll have to draw over your lines multiple times to get it to be thick. Keep it light and fast for the &quot;skippy&quot; thin lines.

Pic related is an example of such an attempt and these artists tend to wonder why it is these beginners draw so terribly as if they are trolling or not even trying but just as the beginner does not understand the significance of drawing from life, so does the seasoned artist not understand how a beginner typically sees the world. <br><br>One way to immediately realize if you&#039;re looking at something wrong, especially when it comes to drawing from life, is to trace over the drawing directly but pretending as if you are simply copying it. This means that you approach the drawing not by outlining the contours but by drawing it the way you would typically draw it if you were to copy it. One thing you will immediately notice is that despite you copying directly onto the image itself, therefore negating any issues with proportions, your drawing still looks like shit. Why the hell is that??? You&#039;d think that if a beginner traced over a drawing, it would not look so bad but that is not the case. <br><br>When a beginner attempts to draw from life, they are essentially trying to copy that trace that they drew out. In doing so, they end up copying an already shitty trace or representation of an image which will obviously lead to an even shittier copy of that image. Basically, if you can&#039;t make something look good tracing directly over it--acting as if you are copying it as you do trace it (using the image merely as a means to get accurate proportions), how the fuck do you expect to be able to copy it directly? You cannot. <br><br>This is why tracing must be used in order learn how to make something look good.

It is not necessarily the fact that drawing from life is more difficult thought that does play a role, but rather the lines are more explicit in anime and you know where the line stops and where the line ends. <br><br>This is why it is imperative that you copy from other artists first to see how they draw something rather than guessing how you should draw something like an eye or a nose. Many different artists have many different ways to approach drawing the facial features and you will see that they typically do not draw what they see but rather use life as a template on which to place their style onto. <br><br>This is why I believe telling beginners to draw from life is a trap if you do not first warn them of these facts.

Screened tablets beat the pants off of screenless ones every day of the week tbdesu, you can get used to the hand-eye disconnect, but drawing on a screen is just a bit more effortless in my opinion.", "time": 1673169762, "resto": 6442609}, {"no": 6463104, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)07:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Anons, help me.

It is not because it actually works for everyone but rather that it works for anyone who has an innate ability to draw--innate not meaning &quot;born with&quot; but rather a proclivity towards drawing that creates a natural ability to learn things. <br><br>In order for &quot;just draw&quot; to actually work, one must have talent in drawing. This talent will allow you to be able to draw for hours and learn from your work and mistakes without any instruction whatsoever--though instruction could never hurt. If one does not have talent in drawing, they must seek out help in order to improve or else they will stagnate as pointed out by this anon: <a href=\"/ic/thread/6463671#p6463757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6463757</a><br><br>Basically, if you don&#039;t have talent, learning to draw will much harder and even if you do end up attaining a certain level of skill, your art will never be as good as most of the worst works from artists that do have talent which is why you have to find a reason to actually pursue art.

I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them.

It&#039;s not supposed to be self-sufficient, just like a stabilizer in your drawing software of choice is not supposed to automatically solve all your lineart issues. <br>First of all, AI is the (potentially) ultimate referencing tool.

That is certainly good enough. The clothes are all wrong, but you&#039;re not an artist for nothing, you can fix that yourself. So copy it, add your own flavor, or try something else entirely, do whatever you want.<br>Second, AI is really good at inpainting. If you need a quick fix, or you don&#039;t like how something looks - consult the AI and see what it gives you, it takes seconds and maybe you&#039;ll find something inspiring.<br>Third, AI is really good at backgrounds.

But its unclear if we can do that now. I&#039;m not sure what will separate a future more-nuanced user of a more advanced ai and that of the artist other then those weird, esoteric, little details that artists obsess over. But no one will give a shit about those, it&#039;s consumer grade tech, now operable by significantly less skilled and therefore cheaper technicians, that creates great consumer grade art. Stuff the consumers will love. Slowly the beauty of the details in the craft become just another entry to the &quot;critically endangered crafts&quot; list.

Everyone absolutely sucks off japanese artists, manga, and the anime style which confounds me as i find that industry/market almost entirely saturated with garbage, including, or maybe i should say especially, the most popular stuff. I can only come back every year or two to sift through the surmounting shit pile to have a chance at finding something good. I actually came back to reading fairly recently and only two out of like 120 something manga skimmed was of any substance at all.

Seeking mental, and most likely deeply emotional, advice from anyone let alone someone you expect to be a trustworthy expert is hard to do and requires an upfront level of personal/emotion vulnerability to be able to do so. And then to have that implied contract of 1to1 bond/expected sincerity be broken by him delegating you to some &quot;text bot&quot; is a way different emotional ballgame then looking at some ai art.

If a therapy-bot did exist and was show to be able to deliver actually positive results in it&#039;s purpose i have no doubt people would move to use it and accept it, as public conscious moved to change its opinion on it.

And my personal answer to that is yes. Ai, even when knowingly engaged with, is capable of so thoroughly tricking the brain in some aspects as to unintentionally catch my eye with unique perspectives, or interesting shading, or it&#039;s use of color, etc. And as i said earlier, even to the point of being more interesting then some &quot;real&quot; artists.<br><br>Look i get it, why i like art and the reason i&#039;ll continue to make art is in the joy of doing each of those little details myself or MY execution of color, or form, or shading.

I can&#039;t imagine doing that crap and I&#039;ve been drawing for years. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll help but I&#039;ll lend you some of my advice. Pick your favorite artist you want to draw like and start copying their stuff. Not serious 1:1 studies, just make some shitty doodles with whatever looks cool to you. In my case I just copied Akira panels because I always loved it. I must&#039;ve copied half the series at some point. After a while I began to understand how Otomo drew figures. I didn&#039;t realize then that I was basically just doing figure studies, just not with irl people. Some time later I got confident enough to learn from other artists I admired and got better at copying, then I actually went over the fundies books that everyone pushes on prebegs. I felt like I learned in reverse but there is no wrong way to learning as long as you&#039;re making progress. Another piece of advice is to grow some skin and learn to take and LISTEN to advice from your superiors and apply it. Don&#039;t assume you know better when someone tells you this shading is inconsistent or this fold doesn&#039;t make sense etc. <br><br>Point is, while art is practice and hard work, it doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t have fun.

It is simply cope for their inability to teach that causes them to call everyone they can&#039;t seem to teach retarded. <br><br>In reality, a teacher does not think like this. A teacher self-asses and thinks of a new, creative approach to approaching this new difficulty. As you see in /ic/, these people give up the second someone fails to understand their advice and that is NOT how a real teacher approaches teaching. A teacher does not immediately shift the responsibility to the student, he thinks about what he is saying and analyzes his approach so that it best suits the right audience. <br><br>We have to make this distinction otherwise we can consider anyone who started a YouTube channel and made a &quot;How to Draw an Eye&quot; tutorial a teacher when they are simply, and most obviously not a teacher. They are performers that defame the teaching profession with their psuedo-understanding of the subject of drawing. It is absolutely disgusting. My mouth fills up with gravel just thinking of these so-called &quot;teachers.&quot;<br><br>Say what you will about someone like Sycra but he is one of the very few artists I&#039;ve encountered who actually hyper-analyze drawing which is why he is able to come up with ideas like &quot;iterative drawing&quot; or his most recent &quot;practice trap&quot; video. Those are oftentimes things that good artists believe or do already but typically do not know how to articulate or teach. Someone like Sycra is able to do explain these concepts more clearly so that those who aren&#039;t very good at drawing can begin to do these things as well.", "time": 1673409329, "resto": 6450706}, {"no": 6467666, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:01:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6467645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6467645</a><br>In terms of success, I&#039;d say there are some other forms of &quot;the performer&quot; that don&#039;t require somebody to be in the top 1%:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Specialist </span><br>Might not be the most skilled general performer in the world and their skills falter when they try to branch out, but they&#039;re quite good at (and dedicated to) their niche, and develop a following as a result.

I repeat, mentors are NOT teachers. <br>When I am talking about Teachers, I am talking about the rare kind of teachers, not some random, ass motherfucker that decides he wants to be a teacher. <br>Any professional artist can teach another up-and-coming artist a thing or two about what they know. Hell, Kim Jung Gi could&#039;ve brought a really great artist under his wing and taught that kid everything he knew and even if this kid became really good, that DOES NOT make Kim Jung Gi a teacher in the respectable sense. He is simply a mentor. <br><br>Mentors have a lower bar than teachers because you never have to hyper-analyze what you are doing to explain in very specific detail to someone who may need that amount of detail. Mentors will typically ONLY teach those who are ALREADY good at what they do but want to reach the next level. Anyone who is really good at what they do can fill this role. You can be the shittiest teacher alive and still be a mentor and your mentees will still be able to benefit.

Is not the machine doing the work for you? Have not the developers of the program you are using designed the software in a way where all you have to do is press knobs and tick boxes to get the brush you want to use and is this not a \u201cmachine\u201d doing the work for you. If we were to get really specific, and even in this case this wouldn\u2019t work, the only valid form of human vs machine would be if the human used a Command Line Interface and therefore controlled each and every aspect of the drawing. However, it is inefficient to use such a thing in order to create digital art so it begs the question how art created by a propriety program is any different from a machine creating derivatives of a piece of artwork. Would a few brush strokes on the result be enough to say that it was then created by said human?

I became an artist, and from fifty on began producing works that won some reputation, but nothing I did before the age of seventy was worthy of attention. At seventy-three, I began to grasp the structures of birds and beasts, insects and fish, and of the way plants grow. If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by the time I am eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential nature. At one hundred, I may well have a positively divine understanding of them, while at one hundred and thirty, forty, or more I will have reached the stage where every dot and every stroke I paint will be alive.

I am more of a male tomboy so to speak, I enjoy womens clothes from time (not in public though) and I can pass for female If I really wanted to, but these are all minute urges that go away whenever I meet a girl I really like, I fall into the typical male role. <br><br>DXM is a dissociative, and the higher plateaus you go into, the more you see how much of sense of self has been constructed by society, class and ultimately yourself. It can all be eroded away in an &quot;ego death&quot; which some liken to spiritual awakening. Once I saw that the universe is ultimately nothing, it would only make sense that the desire to be a good person, truly, comes from an innate desire to add meaning to a meaningless universe through kind acts. <br><br>I am half jewish and not accepted by the jews because my mother is not jewish. I am also clearly different from my non-jewish peers. Russian is my native language but I do not fit in the typical mold of Russian because I was raised in America, etc you get the idea. To me, Jesus was a jew who did not fit in the typical mold and was bold enough to question the status quo through a union with the spiritual god, then was to put to death for his belief. The resurrection, which I was not raised to believe in, is just something allegorical to me. I find comfort and poetic meaning in Christ, my favorite work of literature on the subject is Chapter 2 of The Master and Margarita, which depicts a more brutal and realistic picture of what may have transpired in Christs life: <br><br>https://www.weblitera.com/book/?id=<wbr>205&amp;lng=1&amp;ch=2&amp;l=", "time": 1672856651, "resto": 6442987}, {"no": 6456256, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:26:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6456254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6456254</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.weblitera.com/book/?id<wbr>=205&amp;lng=1&amp;ch=2&amp;l=</span><br><br>&#039;I think,&#039; replied the Procurator with a strange smile, &#039; that there is someone else in this world for whom you should feel sorrier than for Judas of Karioth and who is destined for a fate much worse than Judas&#039;! ...

I&#039;m just confused on how this works on anime characters as small as these, there&#039;s very little muscle, normal necks have smooth transition and curve to show the muscles going up the neck, this one just has a large gap from the neck to the clavicle so it would just be sitting on the top or the torso, there is sometimes a curve but when at rest there&#039;s nothing. <br><br>It&#039;s confusing sorry, i also don&#039;t know how much you&#039;re mean to shrink the neck by according to anime standard before it works well and when it&#039;s just a stick.

It&#039;s closer linked to age play then pedofilia. It&#039;s like saying that somebody that likes to do rape play is actually just a rapist. It not logical to say that because a rapist and a rape player isn&#039;t wired in the head the same way. A rapist acts on his compulsive desires because of the reason of it being a compulsion. It&#039;s nothing that can be controlled. Someone that does rape play, that person&#039;s desire of doing that act doesn&#039;t come from a compulsion. It comes from wanting to play around with taboo consepts. It&#039;s comes from a desire to wanting to explore with one&#039;s sexuality which is what a fetish is mostly for (in my opinion). In a simulare way does the lolicon, he explores taboos being free and playing around with his sexuality knowing his moral boundaries and would be able to stop doing it in an instant. While a pedofile is bound to his sexual feeling of children because that is the only thing that he can be atracted to even though he problebly don&#039;t even want to be atracted to that.

Compare it to the other, levels of detail are random and everywhere, her face is too convoluted for its size yet the hair is too simple and flat, there&#039;s bursts of strong color shapes all over the place (look at the shadows), that are just distracting, makes the image seem cluttered or dirty, best example being the bird&#039;s legs.

I think every artist struggles with it but now that you\u2019re conscious of this you can try to reignite that love somehow (IMO, if you work on finding friends irl like your heart wants you will probably want to draw more.

Some may have this skill, but that&#039;s really not the case for most. That&#039;s actually very hard to do, and while trainable, may not be teachable.<br>When I draw from imagination and I&#039;m using my memory, I&#039;m not remembering a completed image. I&#039;m recalling things like proportions that can be expressed as numbers, and descriptions that can be expressed as text. Text and numbers are abstractions. Abstractions are very easy to remember because they take up far less memory than an image, and are also malleable. So for me, the &quot;drawing from imagination&quot; aspect is the transition of layers of simple descriptions, rules, and proportions to the drawing. It&#039;s not about perfect visual memory, at least not in a significant way.<br>Another example of something that is almost never drawn from visual memory is fabric. Even when you have a reference in front of you, most instructors would tell you not to copy it, but to capture the underlying logic and behavior of fabric.

Now that people have delved into psychoanalysis and deconstruction, we are aware that our desires are multilayered and have unconscious, potentially darker elements underneath.

Instead, it\u2019s better to show the kiss as something symbolic and dreamlike, such as one person\u2019s body merging with another\u2019s, or an infant emerging from a womb.

Attached is a page from when I was in the feet section, the memory drawing and corrections are both there, so it&#039;s great we both had the idea of correcting the drawing after the fact. The chapter I struggled the most on was the beginning chapter, with all the full figures, but once you start getting into the body parts it goes a lot quicker. <br><br>My end goal was to get my drawing EXACTLY like how Bridgman had it, but of course I often fell short. In the beginning, I would stare at the drawing for 15-20 minutes, drawing it in my head over and over again, then I would bang out the sketch really quickly, to not lose any information. When I was doing the full figures in the first chapter, I could only do 1-2 drawings at a time before my brain went caput, but it really does get a lot easier after that.<br><br>My one criticism of your process is to use pencil, and then ink on top. imo it&#039;s important to give yourself the room to make mistakes. Even all my ballpoint pen sketches I did from manga in /msg/, I used pencil underneath.<br><br>About me taking only 1 month to go through Bridgman versus how long you&#039;ve been doing it, I just chalk that up to the fact that I already had several years of drawing experience before doing Bridgman, so I could do my studies very quickly, and i did it for 8 hours a day, like a maniac. For you, don&#039;t worry about how long you&#039;re taking, 1-2 hrs a day is plenty to progress. I think you&#039;re doing it right, I might&#039;ve rushed Bridgman, to my own detriment.<br><br>Anyways, do your 30 mins of gestures, and your Bridgman, and you&#039;ll do fine.
