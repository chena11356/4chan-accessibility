You&#039;re leaving small light spots that attract our attention where it shouldn&#039;t be (if the tummy should be the highlight you&#039;d need a different composition.) <br><br>When you think about values and light you should think of the painting as a whole. Unless it&#039;s concept art, a middle range value lile the one you picked for your painting is a pretty bad place to start, because already the whole composition is pretty much in the same value range. Especially early you shouldn&#039;t be afraid of really pushing the value range, somdare to go much darker and much lighter. <br><br>Keep your light sourse in mind. And what the light itself /is/. Different types of light will cause different shadows to be created. Harsh sunlight, for example, causes fairly dark but warm coloured shadows and might cause light to bounce off large surfaces. So a chin, which is pointing downwards but juts out might cast a lighter shadow than the nect area, as light is being reflected off of the ground.

Well, the reason I ask is because it&#039;s weird that you don&#039;t know how to answer my question about the armpit. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s 4 lines or not, you can represent forms with few lines. As for &quot;what I&#039;m trying to achieve&quot; it should be pretty obvious - representing the coracobrachialis, axillary fossa, deltoids, teres major, and latissimus in a pleasing and somewhat accurate way. That&#039;s what I&#039;m asking about. You bring up reference - the armpit is in shadow in the reference so it&#039;s largely invented, and anyway if it was that obvious in the reference I wouldn&#039;t really need to ask, I could just copy what I see. Calling something &quot;low effort&quot; because it&#039;s a block in is pretty weird, if I posted a fully rendered piece that had issues at the fundamental stage people would just shit on me that I polished a turd. That&#039;s WHY you ask for feedback in the early stages. If you know what you&#039;re talking about, show me your work and I&#039;ll eat my words but I hope you at least understand why I&#039;m skeptical of this response. Not even trying to be a dick. And as for the greyscale to color study, I was just looking for anything glaringly wrong with it or some pointers from people more familiar with the workflow.<br><a href=\"#p6435854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6435854</a><br>Thanks!

I&#039;m just confused on how this works on anime characters as small as these, there&#039;s very little muscle, normal necks have smooth transition and curve to show the muscles going up the neck, this one just has a large gap from the neck to the clavicle so it would just be sitting on the top or the torso, there is sometimes a curve but when at rest there&#039;s nothing. <br><br>It&#039;s confusing sorry, i also don&#039;t know how much you&#039;re mean to shrink the neck by according to anime standard before it works well and when it&#039;s just a stick.

If price is a big factor any medium works well with a limited palette of 6 or more colors. There are many ways to make a certain medium more expensive and cheap, which is why I would also consider oil. For example, oil paint covers huge areas easily with very little paint and there are inexpensive oil painting papers to paint on. Another example is if you compare gouache and watercolor, the gouache paint is a little bit more expensive, because you will finish it faster, but on the other hand, you don&#039;t need good paper for gouache. All of them have their difficulties and advantages, but if I would recommend an all rounder that&#039;s forgiving I would suggest oil even though it&#039;s not in your list. If this is not an option for you, I would choose gouache over acrylic, because it&#039;s forgiving in brush quality and maintanence and it&#039;s better for sketching and making smaller pieces. The emulsion is not as strong as with acrylic, which makes it easier to handle the paint on the brush and canvas. Go for watercolor only if you love watercolor or you going to have a bad time. Watercolor is an outlier and has some specific qualities that you only should put up with if you really want to go for the watercolor look and feel. I agree that it&#039;s inexpensive to get into though, but it benefits from higher quality paper. So all in all, I would suggest gouache if you don&#039;t want to consider oil, but personally I don&#039;t like the Himi gouache, it has a strange consistency and it has too many colors. Consider a high quality brand like W&amp;N, Holbein, Schmincke, Graham, but getting a small limited palette of 5-7 colors plus a big tube of white. Get those air tight wet palettes that everyone uses for gouache nowadays (I use them too, they are great) and you are good to go with a couple of synthetic taklon brushes. While you need thick paper to prevent buckling, you don&#039;t need 100% cotton, gouache is fine on cheap, thicker paper.", "time": 1672574481, "resto": 6367918}, {"no": 6450908, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)07:45:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "on the subject of least expensive medium<br>technically, it would be using dry pigments mixed with gum arabic or egg yolk.<br>egg tempera is cheaper if you take a bit of the yolk from when you cook with eggs. a whole yolk is too much waste.<br>gum arabic is cheaper when you consider a bag of the dry powder can last for years upon years.<br>extra expenses are that egg tempera should be done on stiff support that is covered with traditional gesso ground which can be intimidating for a lot of beginners. i have tricks for anyone who actually cares to use it. watercolor paper can be more expensive if you don&#039;t have access to scrap wood. but if you don&#039;t egg or gum paint, then you can try out other media with the pigments. <br>for both, kolinsky is considered the best which can be quite expensive. but great thing for either is that they are not hard on the brushes unlike how oil can be and especially acrylic, and brush clean up is easier.", "time": 1672577111, "resto": 6367918}, {"no": 6450992, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:00:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6450908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6450908</a><br>Just a quick comment: this is insane advice for a beginner.

Attached is a page from when I was in the feet section, the memory drawing and corrections are both there, so it&#039;s great we both had the idea of correcting the drawing after the fact. The chapter I struggled the most on was the beginning chapter, with all the full figures, but once you start getting into the body parts it goes a lot quicker. <br><br>My end goal was to get my drawing EXACTLY like how Bridgman had it, but of course I often fell short. In the beginning, I would stare at the drawing for 15-20 minutes, drawing it in my head over and over again, then I would bang out the sketch really quickly, to not lose any information. When I was doing the full figures in the first chapter, I could only do 1-2 drawings at a time before my brain went caput, but it really does get a lot easier after that.<br><br>My one criticism of your process is to use pencil, and then ink on top. imo it&#039;s important to give yourself the room to make mistakes. Even all my ballpoint pen sketches I did from manga in /msg/, I used pencil underneath.<br><br>About me taking only 1 month to go through Bridgman versus how long you&#039;ve been doing it, I just chalk that up to the fact that I already had several years of drawing experience before doing Bridgman, so I could do my studies very quickly, and i did it for 8 hours a day, like a maniac. For you, don&#039;t worry about how long you&#039;re taking, 1-2 hrs a day is plenty to progress. I think you&#039;re doing it right, I might&#039;ve rushed Bridgman, to my own detriment.<br><br>Anyways, do your 30 mins of gestures, and your Bridgman, and you&#039;ll do fine. However, Bridgman isn&#039;t the end, even after finishing it I still feel inadequate.

I find I draw to cope with the fact I find life never measures up to my expectations of what is &quot;interesting.&quot; I have traveled, seen cultures, made friends but easily I lose interest in all these things afterwards. It&#039;s fun to learn about someone for the first few days, but afterwards I get bored once I already learn what makes people tick and I use this in my own stories. I know it&#039;s sociopathic and narcissistic so I&#039;ve stopped making friends knowing I discard pretty much everyone I meet and it probably hurts them so I don&#039;t want to do that anymore to people. Fiction makes life and people more interesting than it really is. The only people I would find interesting are the 1% of people, but even then I can&#039;t be friends with interesting people as I only see socializing as a way to gain something out of it for my stories. When I start to really get to know someone I start to think I&#039;m wasting my time and my life is unfulfilled, it only feels fulfilled when I write my stories. Fiction lets me cope with my boredom as I can create the most fantastical worlds and build off of pre-existing cultures, concepts, history, philosophy, legends, and make them more intriguing in my eyes. It&#039;s like an endless playground for me. I think it&#039;s because the real world is not romantic enough for me, I like stories of epic battles, glory, strange things, and the exotic. The real world is very interesting in that it is spiritual and mystical with strange tales to tell, but real people are not interesting. I build off what I find interesting in the real world, and make it even more fascinating or perfect in my eyes. If I don&#039;t write about my OCs I feel like I&#039;m going to die while being around friends or makes me feel more unfulfilled.

This was to see if I could get close to the original. It was drawn in 1600x2000 then cropped down mainly with the brush size between 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 depending on what the line thickness is. It&#039;s not a good brush for a single line drawing. Instead, you&#039;ll have to draw over your lines multiple times to get it to be thick. Keep it light and fast for the &quot;skippy&quot; thin lines.

PC-98 games typically run at 640x400 resolution with 16 colors (although in practice there are often only 15 colors because one is indexed as transparent). There are actually rules as to which color values can be used, but there&#039;s no need to be so hardcore because the color choices are *practically* unlimited and nobody would be able to tell whether or not your colors would truly be possible on a PC-98 without analyzing the RGB values for each one.<br>There isn&#039;t one way these images were made. some artists sketched line art on paper, scanned, touched up and colored in a paint app. Some drew their lines directly in the paint app. What&#039;s needed from the paint app is:<br>1. Indexed painting mode, which assigns each pixel in your image to an index of your palette. If you change the color at that index, all the pixels in the image assigned to that index also change color.<br>2. Dithering tools. At a bare minimum, you need the ability to paint and fill using different patterns. Usually the standard dithering patterns are included but you can also create your own (helpful for doing textures, etc.). Some apps let you create custom gradients from your palette and automatically have dithering applied between each color.<br>Probably the two best Windows apps for doing this type of art are ProMotion and GrafX2. ProMotion is sort of the pixel art equivalent of Photoshop, as in being feature-rich and &quot;industry standard&quot; among serious pixel artists. It has everything you need, but can be overwhelming to use because of all the stuff you might not need. GrafX2 is simple and lightweight (and FREE) but its interface is a holdover from the 1990s and lacks some of the quality-of-life features people nowadays are used to having in their software.

Deconstruct, observe, and copy. The biggest part of drawing to begin with will be learning shapes and anatomy. Which means that figure drawing should be anyone&#039;s focus. No need to perfect shading, but look into the ways in which people use gesture and shapes to construct the body in different poses.<br><br>The more you draw poses, the better it&#039;ll be for you when it comes to drawing the things you want, because the foundations will be there. If you don&#039;t know how to draw the things you want, you will likely fail and give up. So accept that itll take time and your drawings will be shit at first, but understand that you&#039;re building a visual library to pull from later. So:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;learn 3d shapes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;learn anatomy and how 3d shapes build the human body</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;find figure references and copy them </span><br>Take as much time as you need, and feel free to focus on specific parts of the body at a time. You&#039;ll likely learn shapes before gesture, so your figure drawings will likely be messy and very blocky/robotic. As you understand more anatomy you&#039;ll begin to remember where muscles go and how the lines fold and bend around them, and that&#039;ll likely come after learning the general shapes.<br><br>Pretty much what I&#039;d say to any beginner. I&#039;ve seen that many start off trying to do too many things at once and then sort of panic and give up. One of the most important aspects of learning anything is to accept that you will be shit for a while, and to remind yourself that being shit and practicing is how you improve, because eventually you&#039;ll ask yourself why something is shit and seek answers.", "time": 1672609776, "resto": 6451440}, {"no": 6451660, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)17:27:10", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "20230101_191651-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1629, "h": 3070, "tn_w": 66, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672612030320159, "time": 1672612030, "md5": "xne1N7Gvm1IqhuFWkYybwA==", "fsize": 878463, "resto": 6451440}, {"no": 6451672, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)17:32:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Something to start off the year.

I think it would do a lot if your linework had somewhat more naturally-varying levels of thickness instead of being uniformly thick throughout the whole stroke. If you look at your reference, there are also many lines and areas that are somewhat &quot;messy&quot; but since the line thickness is organic it adds to the whole image. Basically I think you should focus less on making &quot;perfect&quot; linework and more on giving it that kind of &quot;whip&quot; that makes the whole image come alive, but idk if that&#039;s how it&#039;s even done in manga panels and my linework is probably also shit so idk haha.", "time": 1672685233, "resto": 6451440}, {"no": 6452958, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)13:56:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Daily loomis grind", "filename": "F713720D-E72B-40C6-9385-AA112324D951", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1614, "h": 1177, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1672685784179010, "time": 1672685784, "md5": "kFCZCOFy7e7855gLtz+pEw==", "fsize": 484964, "resto": 6451440}, {"no": 6452960, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)13:57:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6452519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6452519</a><br>Meat cave anon here, might be both of us lol", "time": 1672685859, "resto": 6451440}, {"no": 6452973, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)14:17:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6452958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6452958</a><br>loomis is outdated, we draw boxes now", "time": 1672687061, "resto": 6451440}, {"no": 6452981, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)14:27:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it possible to get something suitable as a drawing board from a DIY store or similar?

They both teach techniques for maintaining character consistency, after all it&#039;s key to what they do. Practice drawing characters using character sheets (for anime, settei); here&#039;s a useful site: https://setteidreams.net/settei/<br><br>It is tough work, but to draw a character sheet you really do need to pay closely attention in keeping things in proportion with each other and often things like rulers are used in order to do so. Ear heights should stay in the same location relative to the other features of the head; eye shapes (the whole shape as well as the inner shapes) should stay very similar in size and shape (here in your drawing you have strong &quot;sanpaku&quot; eyes in one drawing but not the other, in other words, the iris takes up more space on one of the characters compared to the other. Eyes are crucial to character likeness, so you will get a lot of value from being more exact with the eye shape you draw. Brow thickness is also a very important thing to keep consistent. If you look at any settei, you will see just how exact they do it.<br><br>But that is settei though, and outside of that, it&#039;s okay to not draw so precisely.<br><br>For your level and experience, I would say this problem is fairly normal though. Consistency also means stability and robustness of your mental models. Your mental models are things like how you draw things, how you think about the different patterns you draw. It contains 3D and 2D information. Since there is a lot of freedom to stylized art, your mental models are probably still pretty loose in many areas. Pursue artistic growth in general and it will improve. Make sure to make some art with your best shot.

If you need to work on your hands, copy hands from other artists, and if you&#039;re having trouble with rendering, make careful studies of paintings with lighting you admire. Studies can be quick or long. You can even copy anatomy books like Bridgman, Morpho, and Hogarth.

I can&#039;t imagine doing that crap and I&#039;ve been drawing for years. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll help but I&#039;ll lend you some of my advice. Pick your favorite artist you want to draw like and start copying their stuff. Not serious 1:1 studies, just make some shitty doodles with whatever looks cool to you. In my case I just copied Akira panels because I always loved it. I must&#039;ve copied half the series at some point. After a while I began to understand how Otomo drew figures. I didn&#039;t realize then that I was basically just doing figure studies, just not with irl people. Some time later I got confident enough to learn from other artists I admired and got better at copying, then I actually went over the fundies books that everyone pushes on prebegs. I felt like I learned in reverse but there is no wrong way to learning as long as you&#039;re making progress. Another piece of advice is to grow some skin and learn to take and LISTEN to advice from your superiors and apply it. Don&#039;t assume you know better when someone tells you this shading is inconsistent or this fold doesn&#039;t make sense etc. <br><br>Point is, while art is practice and hard work, it doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t have fun.

I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

I became an artist, and from fifty on began producing works that won some reputation, but nothing I did before the age of seventy was worthy of attention. At seventy-three, I began to grasp the structures of birds and beasts, insects and fish, and of the way plants grow. If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by the time I am eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential nature.

May Heaven, that grants long life, give me the chance to prove that this is no lie.\u201d<br><br>\u2015 Hokusai", "filename": "Tsunami_by_hokusai_19th_century", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 807, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1672263623214763, "time": 1672263623, "md5": "vpn++nt++LO+XtA+XWU2jw==", "fsize": 396770, "resto": 6442987}, {"no": 6443925, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)22:35:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m surprised that I haven&#039;t actually drawn much.

AI is definitely a wakeup call but certainly not the death of the artist. It has its place and use as a tool of convenience.<br><br>I think we&#039;ll have to adapt in much the same way that AI does. Specifically, by rejecting digital mediums for the physical, relearning traditional techniques, and developing a unique style after figuring out some fundies. Many art communities online are having absolute meltdowns because they can&#039;t tell the difference between an AI piece and an original work even though the funny shit is the vast majority of people online are using digital and tablets. There&#039;s a very simple workaround for this: make your art physically. Sure some pajeet can make a robot that can emulate skill, but no pajeet will replace the human soul. Trads don&#039;t have to give a shit, just post timestamp.<br><br>Personally, digital artwork lacks a lot of appeal in the first place. Not to say it isn&#039;t or can&#039;t be good, I just think it&#039;s missing something fundamental to the human soul that goes into it. The mistakes are too easily corrected, the physicality of touching paper, oils, color, spilling shit and just getting weird with it are gone. Spill coffee on your computer and you could lose a keyboard, spill coffee on a canvas and it can be inspiring. AI gives me the feeling people are seeing with their eyes whether or not a piece has appeal, and not their heart. Some of the dumbest shit speaks to me even if it&#039;s not some high ideal, but so far, AI hasn&#039;t. It simply doesn&#039;t have a human soul to connect with.<br><br>I&#039;m predicting a renaissance of physical, traditional, and certainly original art soon as a natural counter to AI and looking forward to it. We&#039;ll end up with a lot of weird growing pains but I truly think it&#039;ll pay off. Once you can show something was made with your own hands, there can be no further doubt to authenticity.

Not that you&#039;re old (you still have a whole unlived life ahead of you), but its from my 20yo perspective. Get your shit together, old man! My best advice if you care enough to take it is to just draw anyway. Life is too short to care what others think. Enjoy the act of creating just for the sake of creating or you&#039;ll inevitably fall off. Its like exercise, you need to be consistent and fall in love with the work in order to get to an advanced level you dream of getting to. Every good artist I&#039;ve met that was advanced in skill had gotten that far because art had been cemented in their life as an escape, as a form of entertainment or therapy. If you don&#039;t want to fail, you have to indulge yourself in art, soak in it, go through cringe phases, and let yourself be cringe and bad because that&#039;s how you grow.

Stories,sketches,I refused to hinder my Whimsy nor structure my projects. Even this story is taking interesting turns. I had to create the look of a character that only existed before as a random sketch in a sketchbook,so I reimagined him,and invented him on the spot. He is the Prince,awkward, adolescent, unsure. I introduced him with a bunch of squiggles that suggested elaborate court costumes, and when I was drawing a full sized rendering of him,I referred to the squiggles as I designed the clothes. When I was doing the other Snowglobe comic,I would take the time to design important things, but now,I am just plunging foward.
