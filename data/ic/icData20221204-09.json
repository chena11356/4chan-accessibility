Sincerity means being genuine, lacking pretense. What does that mean in art? Because art is at its core an expression of one&#039;s consciousness in a deliberate, non-verbal visual format, we can assume the reason someone sincerely draws two characters interacting is because they feel strongly about those characters. And when humans feel strongly about some object or being, they place value on what they perceive to be the defining traits therein. So, regardless of the execution, an artist with sincere interest in their subject would be mindful to deliberately capture what they see as significant about the subject. What&#039;s significant about the subjects in the OP? Besides the horns or whatever those are, it&#039;s effectively just some squiggles representing an action between two humanoid beings.

You can animate them walking in a loop and then tween them from A to B instead of manually placing each keyframe in space. <br>It really doesn\u2019t work for just everything.

Can anyone here tell me how to properly choose colors when shading. My current method of shading is that I usually paint black on Overlay layers with different opacity, constantly switching until I find one that I think is right but usually that method is very time consuming due to how I need to constantly switch around multiple layers. Plus, my art would sometimes look plastic like from the colors.<br>Is there a guide I could use so that I can find the perfect color to shade and make it look less waxy.", "filename": "20221201_181658", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669979864928583, "time": 1669979864, "md5": "PqiMCvApw4PL5XWzPyK9iA==", "fsize": 376158, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shading-help", "replies": 5, "images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 6398584, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)06:25:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6398576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6398576</a><br>because there are technically no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; colors to use, since it all depends on the context of the image, try looking up some images that have color schemes that appeal to you and eyedrop tool those.<br>in general, a lot of the &quot;plastic&quot; feeling comes from the fact that your colors are all very saturated and do not influence each other or are influenced by some sort of environment. a more realistic look would be achieved by muting colors and adapting them to each other.", "filename": "730c7ea1c1edecc3f12bb9ba4e3e4ed6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 511, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1669980357880547, "time": 1669980357, "md5": "FOk55MSEMywhQnJIL06gZw==", "fsize": 51926, "resto": 6398576}, {"no": 6400309, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)07:17:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6398584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6398584</a><br>So what you&#039;re saying is to find shading that I like.

Put down your flats (make them your mid tone), then create a clipping mask layer ontop. Then paint in the ambient shadows with a soft brushsoft, (the general form shadows not the drop shadows). Then on the same layer with the same color lay down your drop shadows using the lasso. Might want to duplicate the ambient layer first for back up incase you screw up. To clean it up I would make another clipping layer ontop of the last one and paint over top sample from underneath. This is a really simple base to start from. The real trick to making great shadows is understanding the your darker skin tones and your shadows are NOT THE SAME. They overlap, so what you want to do is make the base I just explained your darker skin tones then ontop of all you did brush your true shadow color in selectively. The easiest way to find your shadow is to sample from your background. The warm skin cool shadow, cool skin warm shadow thing is more about creating good contrast between the subject and the background then actually making proper shadows. So, before you start dropping in shadows figure out your background. Shadows are also sponges for color so if you want to dial them up even more you can try putting different colors from around the painting in different areas, just don&#039;t get carried away or they won&#039;t gel right. After that it&#039;s high lights, bounce lights, and subsurface scattering. Oh, and I said Lasso and softbruch mainly but every painting is comes down to both soft and hard brush. It&#039;s doesn&#039;t matter which one you start with, it just matters that you know when to soften and when to harden. The Lasso is just best for making perfect gradients that even the best soft brush technique can&#039;t produce as quickly.

The knowledge of anatomy can become an interesting thing for itself without regard to art, but purely anatomical drawings of the figure are like the drawings a botanist without art training might make of flowers. They are good diagrams but are unimportant as far as art is concerned. The student who self-consciously displays his knowledge of anatomy on every occasion is apt to be as boring and as impotent as the kind of person who feels it necessary to parade his information on any other subject.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anatomy is the one study on which I do not advise students to concentrate in the beginning. Rather, approach it lightly and casually in the same way that you would make drawings during a telephone conversation. Think less of the anatomy than of the figure as you know it, fitting the anatomy into your knowledge of the figure even though your knowledge is not yet exactly correct. I have seen so often a lot of waste energy, disillusionment, and disappointment among students because nothing `works&#039; in the beginning.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It takes many drawings, many efforts, to relate the information in anatomy charts to what you know of the figure through your other experience with it.
