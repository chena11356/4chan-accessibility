I am going to assume you have diarrhea IBS like I did and not constipation. Basically I would HIGHLY recommend you to not take the honey and to avoid sugars like the godamn plague. I would even avoid store bought white breads as they are frankly closer to cakes than bread in terms of sugar content. There was a point in my life were I could eat basically nothing but lean chicken and homemade sour dough bread which my mother was making at the time. Anything even remotely sugary would trigger the shit out of me but stuff like fruits and even a lot of veggies like carrots where a borderline death sentence. When you get healthy enough I would recommend stewing your food to make it more digestible and reduce sugar content. Meat and vegg stew has loads of calories and nutrients. I assume your GI told you about the BRAT (banana, rice, applesauce, toast) which is helpful for slowing down diarrhea; the only thing that worked for me there was the toast cause I couldn&#039;t handle the sugars in the fruits and rice had too much fiber and caused extreme intestinal pain for me. <br>It took me about 3 years to go from severely underweight and shitting like a rocket to now being able to eat basically whatever as long as it has no sugar. I took I think 1.5k rfx/day for 1-2 months and had to repeat that I think 4 times in all. First round was the first time I had a solid (non-diarrhea) shit in 7 years. I worked closely with my doctors and we supplemented with very specific probiotics a lot (over the counter probiotics like align actually made my diarrhea and pain about 40x worse). I also ended up taking metronidazole for a protozoan they found in my shit and ivermectin to cover for worms. Anyways about 3 years of antibiotic rotations for basically half the year and then finally the improvement post antibiotic started to stick and now I only take a course a couple times a year for maintenance (while still taking probiotics).", "time": 1669012611, "resto": 6380406}, {"no": 6384555, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)01:39:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6384455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6384455</a><br><a href=\"#p6384554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6384554</a><br>Cont.<br> If you are interested I can look up and post exactly what the probiotics are for you. No GI would take me seriously despite my clinical malnutrition and severely low weight. They kept trying to push antidepressants on me which onlynmade me extremely manic and unstable and did fucking nothing at all for the shitting. They tried to tell me my IBS was because of my anxiety (I have GAD) but ofc that shit is retarded.

Different styles and ways of rendering. Even the most simplified rendering shows attention to detail in their lines. The pines arent scribbled. The leaves arent just random swirls. They have line weights and contrasts. Light isnt uniform thorughout a tree and entire piece either (yours is all from the right and never reflects how other trees or the tree itself should affect lighting). These arent meant to be do it like this either or be this good right now. Just examples for future reference and to show the difference in controlled lines that you htought about vs &#039;get it done&#039; mentality. <br><br>Also note some of these how dark it gets vs use of light. Yours is relatively uniform - black trunks, light leaves, very dark pines. Basically doing edge work. Take the first image - the black trunks in foreground really draw the eye. THe very light center line. The second image is similar - the very dark rendering of shadows dilineated from the rendering of bark. You can tell the bark is dark, but the shadows really pop. Value studies are very important when planning out ink. Ive done literal horus of inking and then realized ive overinked or the values are just fucked and had to start over. Thats before even considering bad lines or anything. Just clearly see value problems. Yours is relatively uniform blacks across. If you are intending to color, this isnt necessarily bad i guess, but for an inked piece, you wont have colors to save the values/it isnt just line art type of deal.<br><br>I recommend trying to do just a single branch or replicate a style you want - literally save it, fade it out or blue line it and print it off. Ink the blue lined art of said piece.

They arent all identical in left to right values. Theres variety. The grass and brush is just thrown lines and some implied flowers or whatever with circles, etc. But the lines arent just up and down/all angled one way. There&#039;s values between the lines in some cases. <br><br>Compare some of this amateur piece to yours - even with how rushed this example looks, consider how their tall grass looks to yours. Both are very similar pieces thematically. Scribbles and simplified inking. I believe this is the effect you were going for, but you arent even taking the time this guy did.

With more care, you can achieve similar effects even &#039;rushing&#039; like this final example has. <br><br>Inking is meticulous and time consuming work.

You are quite spot on on the grass and the back and forth movements and the mindless scribbling. But it is all I have in my arsenal for now, for example I have no idea how to make grass other than making an upward motion from the ground and lifting the pen as I end upwards, supposedly to parrot the natural growth of herbs from bottom to top. But it ends up looking like pubes and nothing pretty to look at, it looks kind of boring and patchy. I understand theoretically all of the basic stuff, like trying to change values and tones, to give depth, realism and making the picture interesting but so far I can only manage to make bigger or smaller scribbles. For now I&#039;m watching some yt videos on specific subjects but obviously every tree is different and for now it is a bit overwhelming so I relied on scribbling as a do all even if it is a let down. I&#039;m completely new to drawing but I love the ink and how it sits on the paper.
