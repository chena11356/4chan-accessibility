You&#039;re only seeing the surface level. The real differences here are<br><br>1.) A far better understanding of form. The face on the right is the most striking example, the way that the eyes are drawn indicates the head as a rounded volume with mass, whereas the left is a flat shape with sticker eyes applied to it. The jacket, clothes and even hair made of distinct, solid masses overlaid upon and wrapping around the body in layers. They all feel like they have weight and force applied to them as well. If you were really paying attention, you&#039;ll also notice very subtle indicators implying forms like the bones and tendons of the hand and the wrist under the skin- like the clothes, there is a feeling of the skin stretched upon and wrapping around these delicate forms.<br><br>2.) Better understanding of subject matter. Not only does the artist have a better understanding of human anatomy, they have an understanding of the anatomy of EVERYTHING in the piece. The jacket, the shirt, the pants, the hair, the skin and bone, they know the parts, the materials, how they fit together, and most importantly WHY that they are the way they are and act the way they do. This is why the clothes, the hair, the skin have such definite mass and purposeful application of forces upon them. See those crisp, chunky folds in the jacket on the right and compare them to the almost vacuum sealed, skintight jacket on the left with muddy indefinite marks indicating the idea of wrinkles that the artist knows should be there but doesn&#039;t understand how they work as 3D form, or the properties of the material that they&#039;re deforming.", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-06 20-17-57", "ext": ".png", "w": 733, "h": 758, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670380263658576, "time": 1670380263, "md5": "5xKi1KIqRsTTW1Hsb4XfjA==", "fsize": 644680, "resto": 6400360}, {"no": 6405564, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6405556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6405556</a><br>(cont&#039;d)<br>Now let&#039;s talk about you, and how you might learn better in the future if you weren&#039;t such a quarrelsome, midwitted know-it-all that defends every stupid hot take you have to the death, argues for the sake of argument, and won&#039;t ever listen to anyone else.<br>First off, the reason why you can&#039;t &quot;get anything&quot; out of the OP pic was because it&#039;s in Korean.
