It would in fact be garbage still. Even the ethics of using this is enough to dissuade most people from ever downloading it.<br><br>I&#039;ll keep creating regardless. And yes I would say I&#039;m a pretty damn good illustrator. Decades of actual work ethic and passion will do that to you. Not that I&#039;m gona post my work or anything. I couldn&#039;t trust you even if I tried and I don&#039;t need to prove anything to you.<br>I&#039;ve tried to engage with you but it&#039;s like this everytime. It&#039;s like talking to a brick wall. Enjoy deluding yourself into thinking you&#039;re anything other than a guy pushing buttons.

I usually do lineart and coloring on top of a very light cool gray (contrasts with skin well and is easier on eyes, and even traditional paper is never pure white due to lighting), and you can leave it that way until you&#039;re done assuming it&#039;s just a figure floating in a void.", "time": 1670223260, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403537, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:43:59", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "sockless_clean_nude_small22", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 938, "h": 928, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1670244239670402, "time": 1670244239, "md5": "WquUZ9yDFZnq84XSYETCow==", "fsize": 80735, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403547, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:01:15", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "ABI 5gkg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1199, "h": 729, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1670245275789164, "time": 1670245275, "md5": "d4cjd1iP38F+veSslysfSA==", "fsize": 111495, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403551, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:08:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "kjhlh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1139, "h": 1351, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670245726000965, "time": 1670245726, "md5": "AJfHypSTKptmK2MDS55KGQ==", "fsize": 278790, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403553, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:09:24", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "dolce2gg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 836, "h": 830, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1670245764877216, "time": 1670245764, "md5": "YqznX7oOPtuLZQRY6IMPVQ==", "fsize": 91475, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403913, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:00:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403547</a><br>really nice faces, any specific inspirations for that kind of style?", "time": 1670270410, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403932, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Animation style design", "filename": "final-003", "ext": ".png", "w": 728, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 59, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670271697130667, "time": 1670271697, "md5": "BdjVycXH6zrH3DcYGwgiog==", "fsize": 212786, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403984, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402107</a><br>I\u2019ve been demoted from art poster to lurker", "time": 1670273661, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404186, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)18:26:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399248</a><br>choco malk", "filename": "gamearabqnnudeshade", "ext": ".png", "w": 937, "h": 865, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1670282805033524, "time": 1670282805, "md5": "I8Ua0f/hvqewH7EjAscSsQ==", "fsize": 522693, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404365, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)21:37:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399248</a><br>Lads I started learning to draw so I can make my own degen fetish art and I&#039;ve got to say I&#039;m having even more fun than I thought.", "filename": "locked_up1", "ext": ".png", "w": 950, "h": 798, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1670294231249579, "time": 1670294231, "md5": "9463t/Agvrw9KTMQerse8Q==", "fsize": 275020, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404620, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)04:04:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Figuring out how to color genitals.

By significant errors, I mean the following. Perspective: the hat seems to be intended to be circular and viewed from below, and if that is the case, we should see most of the underside, but instead we see most of the top. Anatomy: the left and right hands have different finger widths and the right hand could not grip the pole properly in this position. Also there is no shape to the ankles, and a very long torso and upper legs compared to short lower legs. Line work: the line work is all of the same width and is concentrated in areas of higher detail, making them appear darker even when they are not in shadow. Hatching direction is inconsistent without any obvious reason to change directions in different areas. Rendering: the light seems to be coming from the left according to the fence and the clouds, but the grass casts shadows in the opposite direction - unless those are ripples, which is unclear. Some portions of the character are shaded, while the hands, face, and underside of the hat are not shaded. The transition from light to dark is abrupt in all areas without any form of feathering. <br><br>That said, the composition is nice and I like the way that the fishing rod and line bounces the eye back and forth.

There is still room for technical improvement as always - for example, the position of the feet in the middle left image is unnatural - but the errors aren\u2019t glaring. You have enough mastery of the basics that you no longer have to think so much about anatomy, perspective, etc. and can start to focus on finding your personal style and/or the types of subjects and ideas you want to explore, perhaps via multiple styles. I see an exploration of many styles and subjects here, which is great. If you\u2019re in the concept art field, this is a decent portfolio. But each one looks mass produced. Joker smile, big boobs, etc. If you want to rise above being a decently hirable concept artist in a very competitive market, push for more originality and more depth to your subject matter.

Get a real a marker or a pigma color, test how you handle the pressure from soft to hard and see how it reflects on paper, hold that thought on your head and see how you translate that on a digital painting software with an ink or marker brush, are you okay with the pressure transition? too hard? lower it, too snappy? extended the curve to the right.

If you need to work on your hands, copy hands from other artists, and if you&#039;re having trouble with rendering, make careful studies of paintings with lighting you admire. Studies can be quick or long. You can even copy anatomy books like Bridgman, Morpho, and Hogarth.

This was to see if I could get close to the original. It was drawn in 1600x2000 then cropped down mainly with the brush size between 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 depending on what the line thickness is. It&#039;s not a good brush for a single line drawing. Instead, you&#039;ll have to draw over your lines multiple times to get it to be thick. Keep it light and fast for the &quot;skippy&quot; thin lines.

It Works<br><br>2.1. Removing Noise<br>In a normal text-to-image run of Stable Diffusion, we feed the model some random noise. The model assumes, though, that this input is actually a piece of artwork that just had a bunch of noise added.<br><br>So, using the text prompt as a source of \u201chints\u201d for what the (supposed) original looked like, it does its best to recover an image from the static. It does this over a bunch of steps (e.g., 50), gradually removing a little more noise each time.<br><br>With img2img, we do actually bury a real image (the one you provide) under a bunch of noise. And this causes Stable Diffusion to \u201crecover\u201d something that looks much closer to the one you supplied.<br><br>2.2. The Image/Noise Strength Parameter<br>There is a parameter which allows you to control how much the output resembles the input.<br><br>I&#039;m not sure if img2img would be useful.", "filename": "good boy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671507120652390, "time": 1671507120, "md5": "yQqSc5+D8N+qBor/bi+TaQ==", "fsize": 170838, "resto": 6428595}, {"no": 6428648, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:49:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6428595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6428595</a><br>I think I know a way to hedge AI but I&#039;m not going to tell you in case it work.", "time": 1671508145, "resto": 6428595}, {"no": 6428655, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)22:54:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://labs.openai.com/s/dz9HK43lX<wbr>a4CFM8coMANTDeN<br><br>Just got a dragon first try.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal.

If it doesn&#039;t work as a link,look for Confess Your Art Sins. To spare you, I will summarize: what I wanted to do as a webcomic was a newspaper sized strip,something that I could make within a week consistantly, and ready for collating into hard copy collections and syndication. What happened was I got involved with a single mother who devoured my life and time. I couldn&#039;t be near my computer and assemble the strips in Photoshop, so I decided to take a sketchbook to the next waiting room I was marooned in, drew a demon head, and thought about why it was there,and suddenly a new story unfolded, and I spent 180 issues telling it before my website had to go away. But as to &quot;quality&quot;,that is debatable. Like this strip, I was not planning on uploading them to the website as my Content, at first being very quick rough storyboards of what I would eventually redo as a properly processed product, more focused on storytelling and deciding what characters would say than adding real artwork to them. I remember apologizing for the lapse,the processed comic strip was only 4 strips in and I was working on the 5th when life sideswiped me,so I let the story dictate the art,and it was much later that I realized that the complete monopoly of my time was the new paradigm. So I put more effort into the strips,and much later on I found the time to clean up the word balloons and tweak the art in Photoshop. You adapt,because the story must be told.

I would imagine many or most of you could draw something better looking than this, so I hope this pushes you towards doing it yourselves. Got some notes of my own, but I&#039;d like other comments.<br><br>So starting off, I wanted to rectify one of my issues, in which it wasn&#039;t really clear where the characters were. Since that was clear, I wanted to immediately establish the Haunted House. I originally tried to draw the whole thing, but that took up too much space to even try to make it readable, so I cut out everything except the top, I think this was a fine decision. The first issue was the door. I was gonna have the door peeping open, then show the inside of the haunted house, cutting to the characters on the 2nd page. I realized that&#039;d leave me with barely any time for the &#039;plot&#039;, so I kept the door, and had the scaring faces.<br><br>As I was drawing the 2nd page, it felt obvious to me that I should have scrapped the door, to give more space for the scaring, to show more of the ones being scared, cause cutting straight to the scared faces on the 2nd page seems kind of abrupt, the build-up didn&#039;t seem enough for it as it stands.<br><br>If that was fixed, I think the top two panels of the 2nd page would be serviceable. As for the third panel on the 2nd page, I originally had all three of the scarers on the same page, to re-establish the fact that there were three of them. But I realized that with the current plan, I would have had almost a repeat looking structure.

The editor would review your &#039;name&#039; (rough draft), and either reject it or give you feedback to improve it and keep working with you, then have it published as a one-shot in a sub-magazine. it&#039;d get picked up into the main magazine from there based on its popularity with readers.

I wish the bottom image was more INTENSE. The guy on the rights elbow should be slightly further back (like he&#039;s really PULLING left towards him) and with that same pulling motion the angle on his elbow should be closer together and the fist would be quite higher (the elbow going from 90 degree to around 45?). Also humans are really heavy so right would probably be leaning towards left at a stronger more dominant angle, which would make the scene more uncomfortable/tense having their faces closer. With that in mind I&#039;d change lefts posture too, to make them pulling away from right, with an arch in the back. With the stronger more dynamic pose, lefts t shirt would be getting pulled further up the back on the neck with more stretch and tension in the material. But if you are happy with the current pose, the only other suggestion I have is for the clothes. On the bottom image the clothes look quite flat to the character silhouette, especially rights t shirt where it joins the pants.

Neither is self-publishing, or local publishing. If that slovakian really is the best artist and storyteller in the world they can really just take their stuff anywhere and make it work. Yes, that includes japan, and no I don&#039;t mean physically moving there. You have to actually put in the effort and not be afraid of trying things that you aren&#039;t explicitly told you can do though. Nothing is stopping that slovakian from shooting emails to shueisha or kodansha or shogakukan or dc or marvel or dark horse etc with a portfolio, a pitch and/or storyboards/sample works to establish a relationship. You just have to prove to them that it&#039;s going to be worth their time. We have the tools to communicate with anybody, but that means nothing if you don&#039;t bother to actually use them.<br>If you think that&#039;s too much, you can always talk to publishers in europe instead of having to try to work something out overseas. Alternatively, the best storyteller and artist in the world would absolutely be able to succeed online self-published so long as they actually put their stuff where people can see it.<br><br>But we all know none of us are the best artist or storyteller in the world.

In all it took me probably around 2 hours to finish it completely.

Honestly just copy anyone considered a well known old master (Hudson River school, bierstadt etc) and also copy stuff you like. <br><br>Your idea of geometric forms is correct but can be applied to rocks, trees etc. Noah Bradley and Nathan Fowkes have good courses on these. In my opinion you need to understand landscapes on a couple different levels <br><br>1. What is the overall form of what I&#039;m trying to paint? For example tree trunks are cylindrical so if you&#039;re struggling with that, try drawing overlapping forms. <br><br>2. How does process impact an individual element? What I mean is the way you paint a tree from start to finish will drastically alter the outcome. It sounds retardedly simple but it&#039;s so easy to forget. Take someone like Mike McCain and try to understand how his process impacted his final result compared to say someone like Nathan Fowkes. <br><br>Even if the technical understanding is there, the way your process will impact your final element is huge. For example a lot of anime backgrounds follow a process that involves building up shapes and gradients leading to an &quot;authentic&quot; look. Dozens of layers of grass brushes give that makoto shinkai type appearance. <br><br>3. Color is important and it isn&#039;t. When you&#039;re first learning, color is daunting. When you inevitably do those 30 minutes b/w paintings every course wants you to do. It can become hard to paint something without a way of separating elements. Color is good to inject once in a while to help reduce abstractions and see where you need to work on next. <br><br>You&#039;re overwhelmed because you haven&#039;t been given a proper starting point. There isn&#039;t a straight up Loomis guide to landscapes. Many have tried but there isn&#039;t a definitive source. Your best bet is just start copying masters, breaking down good landscape photos( no editing. If it looks like it was shot with a cellphone in 2011 you&#039;re in good shape) into 3-5 values and indivual studies.

The image you drew in another program was probably saved with 24 bit RGB or 32 bit RGBA. Pixel art is normally done with 8 bit or less indexed colors. This means you don&#039;t have a red, blue, and green slider going from 0 to 255 to pick a color for the pixel. You have 1 palette with up to 255 colors and the pixels are assigned to numbers on that palette. If you make color #0 black for example and draw the lineart later you can change the color to red and all pixels drawn with color #0 will change accordingly.<br>So anyway you start by inking with an 1 pixel brush. Take a close look at the pixels. This style doesn&#039;t have anti alias. You draw a line and if it curves you draw a pixel diagonal to the previous pixel which creates a sharp jagged effect. You can avoid this by manually doing the anti alias effect but personally I think the alias is part of the charm.<br>Once you&#039;re done with the lineart you want some flat colors. Just create new color in the palette for the skin for example and use the bucket fill. To shade and texture properly you use a technique called dithering. You take two adjacent colors and in the middle you interlace them using a pattern like checkboards. There are various dithering patterns and graphics gale which is specialized for pixel art lets you select a dithering mode that just draws checkboards with the foreground and background colors.

Most human music follows few sets of tempos that align with our biological mechanisms like breathing or heartrate. Instruments can only do so many sounds, and the same is for electro dubstep. If you let AI loose on music, it would start creating almost the exact copies of songs that listener would not be able to tell apart when listening to them for comparison. With Ai pictures and videos you cant say the same. Ask Ai to generate some public domain painting like the Starry Night from Vincent. It will give you blurry meshes that have incorrect number of clouds, some stars different and so on. Now if you listen to the music, it will become way way harder to notice, especially when the Ai is trained on certain human tempo that funnels certain sounds into their specific holes. If you looked at the diagram of the sound, you could easily see the differences, but when hearing it, not so much.
