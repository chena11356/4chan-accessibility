I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal.

Artists naturally have high egos and to imply that they do not have an ability in a skill that they think is beneath them--in this case, teaching--is far to incomprehensible for them to process. So instead of attempting to improve at the skill of teaching and finding other, more concrete ways of explaining something, they resort to shit-flinging and name-calling anyone who doesn&#039;t immediately understand their shit advice. <br><br>&quot;Just Draw&quot; is another one of those shit advice. It&#039;s pandered by artists who want to seem like they know a thing or two about drawing but are absolutely ignorant on the process of drawing. If you were to ask Kim Jung Gi why he makes the marks he makes, he could pull a bullshit answer out of his ass that will help literally no one except those who are already good at drawing.

Performers tend to not understand the process of being able to learn something and therefore are the worst teachers in that field. They tended to have received their skill by sheer mileage and have often taken decades to get to where they currently are. As they have not properly analyzed their approach and why they do certain things, they have an intuitive understanding of drawing which only helps them. Basically, performers cannot teach and can only perform. This is where you get the advice to &quot;just draw&quot; because performers tend to be the ones that actually take this advice seriously and tend to get good by sheer mileage rather than anything concrete that you can teach to anyone. <br><br>Teachers understand a skill at a much higher level than performers and while they may not be as good as the performers, they will often coach the performers regardless. Note how coaches in sports aren&#039;t usually better than the players on the team. (If they were, they&#039;d be mentors not teachers or coaches.) A teacher must have a very high level of understanding of whatever skill they are pursuing as they have to properly explain each and every step--otherwise, they&#039;re wasting everyone&#039;s time. <br><br>For instance, if we were to bring this back to drawing, lets say a beginner creates a drawing. You notice that the drawing is shit but because you are a performer, you can&#039;t exactly explain why it is shit.

Sometimes this is due to a &quot;copying is bad&quot; mind poison, sometimes it&#039;s due to a false idea that to &quot;be a master&quot; means that drawing entirely from imagination is the skill to practice. <br><br>In general, though, it&#039;s that they haven&#039;t made a conscious effort to examine their own tastes to where they have anything to say. It can be a compartmentalization issue - happens with coomer artists a lot, where they filter everything &quot;not sexy&quot; into a different mental box and so put almost no new inspiration into their &quot;sexy art box&quot; on the daily. <br><br>It could also be a complete disconnect between what they like to consume and what they like to produce - for some, a motivation to create is because of a lack of met desires with what currently exists.

This is hard...but you need to forgive yourself for not meeting your expectation. Work on accepting that you will get better with time but it won&#039;t be now. But everytime you draw you will get there eventually. So stop focusing on what you want your picture to be and focus on the small improvements you make on the way.

Redo values studies and try again etc...<br><br>Well how to motivate yourself is not easy...but it&#039;s possible. <br><br>And the last part is. Accept that what you want and what the client needs aren&#039;t the same thing. The client is happy with mediocre most of the time and you well get what you want...but not now. But if you trust the process and keep at it eventually you&#039;ll get there. <br>You&#039;ll get other clients later. Don&#039;t bet everything you have on this one comission...it won&#039;t happen anyway.<br><br>Be patient. And if you can&#039;t get to work because you avoid feeling bad. Then start with forcing yourself to feel bad and sit with the bad feeling for a while...then stop and do something.

I have a friend of mine who can project anything into his sight, we call that hyperphantasia. btw I do have imagination since my &quot;PC is working well&quot;. It&#039;s different for audio stuff tho. I can hear my thoughts in any voice, imagine music and instruments, sounds and stuff in my head. other senses like smell, touch and taste are less pronounced. I can feel imagined touch to some degree but taste and smell are basically not existent. I do differentiate between the third eye visualization, hypnagogia and dreams. I do dream and I see them just the same as if I&#039;m awake. I do see flashes when tired and shortly before going to sleep. for me that&#039;s working alright. but in the waking state I just see black when closing my eyes, I just see black when thinking of a person or an object.

I do not consider myself an artist. Actually, according to one of my mentors who has been in the industry for almost 30 years, tattoing started to tear off of its origins and traditions around the time some tattooers started calling themselves tattoo &quot;artists&quot;.<br>I feel very sorry for those who have experienced the elders&#039; gatekeeping. I have been incredibly blessed by not one but four ridiculous old monsters who have been tattooing for almost, and in one case, for a longer time than I have been alive, and they have been very generous and kind with their knowledge, experience and wisdom, so just so you know, people like that exist too. But to those who are just squeezed, juiced, used and thrown away, please don&#039;t get discouraged. Dickheads are found in every industry, and unfortunately not only those of sound mind do tattoos or get them. If you enjoy and respect tattooing, you are able to gain a foothold in it, and the more effort you put into it, the more you get out of it, always.<br>To everyone who wants to get into tattoing, I advise to seek out the roots of the craft, learn traditional artforms, be it western guache-illustrations, middle-eastern mural patterns or tibethan thangka painting, copy and master the traditional methods of tattoo designing, learn to value good foundations and technicality, and always, always be humble. If you manage to establish a decent portfolio, and do an as exhausting research on the history of the industry as you can, you will be miles ahead of the average apprentice (that I have met). My apprenticeship has started very shoddily as well, and I was almost completelt crushed by my first studio, but holding on was without a doubt worth it, and I would gladly undergo the 6 (sometimes 7) days of ridiculous 8-12 hours a day unpaid labor and myriads of favours once again to be where I am.

A few hours a day thumbnailing for boards, and a few hours a day life drawing will take you insanely far. By the time you get around to finishing a board you will be better than you were.

Have not the developers of the program you are using designed the software in a way where all you have to do is press knobs and tick boxes to get the brush you want to use and is this not a \u201cmachine\u201d doing the work for you. If we were to get really specific, and even in this case this wouldn\u2019t work, the only valid form of human vs machine would be if the human used a Command Line Interface and therefore controlled each and every aspect of the drawing. However, it is inefficient to use such a thing in order to create digital art so it begs the question how art created by a propriety program is any different from a machine creating derivatives of a piece of artwork. Would a few brush strokes on the result be enough to say that it was then created by said human?

I honestly think you should ignore all these teachers who think you should be a human graphics card. Computers have had a baleful influence on art instruction, in that people look at wireframes and 3D models and think the goal is for you to be able to draw complex 3D constructions in violent perspective from any point of view. It&#039;s absurd. What&#039;s the point, anyway?<br>In most great figurative art of the past, perspective in the figures is not emphasized, because perspective entails distortion that, in depictions of the human figure, isn&#039;t pleasing to the eye. Art instruction books of the past tended to focus on the characteristic forms of the head, torso, limbs, etc. in repose and in action. You can learn this without turning everything into boxes and wireframes.<br>Yes, you should know the fundamentals of perspective (not difficult, read &quot;Perspective Made Easy&quot;). And yes, it is useful to draw cross-contours or think of cylinders and planes when foreshortening a limb, but turning this type of construction into a quasi-religion, as is being done here, is insane.<br>A useful and practical way of learning to draw, say, a thigh from the side view:<br>1. The attachment of the thigh to the trunk is higher in front than behind. So, too is the attachment of thigh to knee.<br>2. The front line is a gentle, convex curve with its peak closer to the top than the bottom, and inclined so the top is slightly forward in relation to the bottom. It runs from a little below the front pelvic point above, to just above the knee cap.<br>3. The back line is nearly straight from its start below the buttocks to its end just below the back of the knee. However, the upper two-thirds of this line bulges in a very subtle, convex curve.<br>And so on. Curved lines, straight lines and angles. If you can write the letter C, you can draw a curved line.

I though it was great, main thing I dislike is the dialogue. You should change the font, have speech bubbles, and also just go over everything to remove unnecessary lines, and edit forced lines. I&#039;m also working on a comic, and it&#039;s definitely a challenge to make dialogue seem natural and not cringe-inducing. Try and act out the interaction in your head, and ask yourself if it would be like that in a real life interaction. Also keep in the mind that the character&#039;s personality plays a role in each interaction (If you haven&#039;t done this already, you should write down a document for yourself that includes your character&#039;s personality, motivations, fears, etc..) And another thing to keep in mind is that not everything has to be vocalized. <br><br>I found it weird how this main character knows English well when she was abandoned as a little kid, I think she should be more mute (Or maybe you could make her dialogue have a purposefully limited choice of words.)

There is no best way. The whole idea is figuring out how to change the way you make art for the better. That vision you have of what that means is an important part of this.<br><br>For studying figure drawing and &quot;human anatomy,&quot; the entire goal is to flesh out your mental model of the human figure and to be able to draw upon that model (i.e. important details of the surface form and/or how muscles overlap or change from movement). You should probably copy (process drawings by copying them); doing so helps you flesh out your mental model. (Don&#039;t go overboard on your copies). <br><br>You then want to use that new detail in other contexts (drawing from imagination and drawing from reference). If you&#039;re at the level where you&#039;re making art on a frequent basis, then try to find ways to directly use it to inform your art. If you do not make use of what you learn in other contexts you are significantly less likely to remember it and use it. Your brain is designed to forget useless information and skills; if what you study from a book is not put to use it is just that, useless.<br><br>Forgetting is also common in the learning process and will vary depending on how much you already know. If you try to remember something you learned and forgot it, re-study it. If you try to remember something you learned and realized what you learned isn&#039;t in-depth or robust enough to be useful, you study it more.

I&#039;m using Krita he&#039;s using photoshop. It took me 3 or 4 weeks before we even got to drawing an apple. Every 5 minute video lecture took me an hour of pausing every sentence to google how to do what he said on krita and follow along. Some lessons are missing the .psd download so I just screenshot his video and upload that to krita to follow along. Use your brain. I am 2k% more fluent in krita now thanks to this guy. There is no shortcut. You have to brute force your way through lots of &quot;boring&quot; to actually learn the program and its capabilities thoroughly. I&#039;m hardly a L33T HAXOR now but I went from literally not knowing how to merge a layer or change the brush tag to making my own custom brushes and being basically fluent in the &quot;photo-editing&quot; aspects of the program. I even know where my resource folder is now!<br><br>Second, I decided to &quot;sail&quot; marc brunet&#039;s art academy. To do this you need to get qBittorent (make sure it&#039;s q when you google it). Then google &quot;rutracker marc brunet&quot;, translate the page etc. use your brain figure it out (cubebrush). magnet link at the bottom of forum post. <br>Sail this course (its 36.8 gb). he says if you &quot;attend class&quot; and study for 3-4 hours a day you should finish his course in ~2 years.

These guys (especially brunet) have thought extremely hard about how to get you from A to B in the quickest way. You should 80% study them and 20% study supplemental stuff that you personally like and want to focus on like anime or specific books like scott robertson - how to draw; which I am using to study vehicle and environment design.<br><br>I am in a lot of pain all the time I can personally maybe squeeze out like an hour or two of productive fucking anything per day. I have made more real progress in 1 month of CtrPaint + brunet than I have in the previous 5 or 6 months of grinding a few loomis heads every day which only demotivated me and made me depressed. Learning Krita so that I can comfortably draw while lying down in bed on my android has been a gamechanger also instead of trying to draw with pencils and pens and sketchbooks at my tiny fucking desk made for toddlers in my tiny rented bedroom. I understand the advice to start learning analog so you have less distractions but in my case I regret avoiding digital for so long. <br><br>Lastly I would say that if you are looking for a specific book you can look up zlibrary on reddit to find out how to access it on the dark web, or you could just google &quot;book name/author name&quot; + &quot;pdf&quot; and I just found like 90% of the books within minutes. Plus check the sticky since the loomis books for example are free (out of copyright?) just get them from there.<br><br>Efficiency is key and the advice people give on this board can be really bad. an advanced artist saying &quot;just draw&quot; to a beg is like saying &quot;just sail&quot; from your floating boat to a guy on the beach who has a massive hole in his raft. <br><br>I am noticeable progress at this point considering my disability.

Starting term 3 there is feedback videos, 4 videos of feedback he is giving to his students literally an hour long each! I obviously didn&#039;t pay for his course so no feedback direct from him or his group but this is the next best thing imo. For me personally when I judge that I am 70-80% of the way there to his example level then I would move on. You keep the material forever so you can always come back to it later if you find you need to go over it again. <br><br>He does say in his introductory video that each term should take 2-3 months at an average pace of 3-4 hours of classes and/or practice per day, so basing it on that it should be between 180 (2x30x3) and 360 (3x30x4) hours per term.<br> <br>His course is extremely beefy.

There will be a link at the bottom of the first forum post of whatever you wanted to download called a magnet.

You can also set the destination of the download (I believe by default it is your downloads folder). <br><br>Once you click okay the download will start, and depending on many factors like the time of day, your internet connection, your geographic location, the ratio of seeders to leeches etc. it may take less or more time.
