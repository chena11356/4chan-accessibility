The book had 5 pages on how to draw square. Also this is first art book which outright said using single confident line is the best and anything else is worse. it also heavily implores using shoulder while drawing. I though about trying it but then i realized i would need to keep my tablet at angle and basically totally change everything about how i draw. So i postponed that. Shoulder makes sense for MASSIVE canvas size (A2), not for A4 tablet. Also this is first art book which starts with you drawing 100 circles instead of contour exercises.

Make the bottom of the lines thicker than the areas facing the light source.<br>2) Gesture. Even a static pose facing the observer can benefit from a slightly tilted shoulder and pelvis.

You can see the death of classical art play out in the late 1800\u2019s between the academic artists and the pastoral \u201clower class\u201d artists. Academic Artists lived in such a culturally conservative Christian world because that\u2019s who their patrons were. So much of their genre work, what we recognize as mythological work, was trapped in the past echoing the same pre approved themes and stories from the Greek and biblical accounts. The work was stale. Take bouguereau for example. The absolute pinnacle of artistic ability but his work is mostly boring as fuck from an emotional or narrative view. The early impressionists we\u2019re addressing that lack of meaning by making work that was real to them and had to do with the world they lived in. It was mostly great for a while but then motherfucking Picasso came along with his god damned cubism and then everyone stopped giving a fuck about the quality of the craftsmanship and wanted work that was more of the pure emotional state and less of the representation of what the emotion was derived from. The fauvists were high as shit. The late impressionists all had heavy metal poisoning from lead white and fake absinthe. The dadaists jumped the shark. The cult of personality period in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s was a blur of coke and ether. The naive artists tried to bring the art world back down to earth. Brutalists didn\u2019t survive the 80\u2019s. Album posters were the only real art in the 90\u2019s. 2000\u2019s were a joke. Now everyone is suddenly an illustrator/graffiti artist and acrylic flows like water. We are trying so hard to recover the identity that was lost. Thankfully ateliers are becoming way more popular but they still lack the ability to teach depth and emotion in art. The west doesn\u2019t have a cultural identity or narrative that people resonate with, and we don\u2019t even like each other that much right now.", "time": 1674889178, "resto": 6493566}, {"no": 6493804, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)02:02:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6493800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6493800</a><br>By western people I mean everyone who participates in western culture so bringing out old welsh, Greek, and Scandinavian mythology won\u2019t work.

However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work.[4] He did not plan the details of his stories in advance. When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters.[4] The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half.[6] Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him.[23] Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks&#039; time travel.[4] The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making it seem to have been foreshadowing.[20] The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, which is exactly what he did.[24]</span><br>I\u2019m believing it and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it", "time": 1674504120, "resto": 6478292}, {"no": 6487279, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:10:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6487271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6487271</a><br>I love this guy<br>You can tell he was starting to get burned out around the time he stopped hatching and stopped filling in blacks, the manga shifted to just plain simple linework that he could draw very quickly.

The examples I listed are works that allowed for a lot more manpower and time, which let the artists to put more quality and do more ambitious things. It&#039;s not about the impact comics had on pop culture but rather the industry makes it so that comic artists must sacrifice art quality all the time. Most comic artists do not have the time to draw each panel on the same level as say Bernie Wrightson or Franklin Booth, none are able to truly realize their peak because of the nature of the industry. Also if you actually think oil painting is easy you are a tradlarper, and probably don&#039;t even draw comics on trad either. Both are tough as hell in their own right, and oil painting is extremely hard to do right if you actually know anything about painting beyond basics, but my point is that because of the way the comic industry is structured in a way it hinders the artist&#039;s growth to go above and beyond. Comic artists always have to settle with what they got and have to cut down their time on each page for speed thus cannot do anything as ambitious as they would want to.<br><a href=\"#p6491225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6491225</a><br>True, I agree comic making is hard but it depends on what you mean by artistic achievement because comic is a medium that requires skill from other areas outside of just visual arts, that&#039;s what I said earlier too.", "time": 1674768138, "resto": 6478292}, {"no": 6491316, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:32:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6491197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6491197</a><br>The oldest art humans ever made were comics painted on cave walls about them hunting mammoths.", "time": 1674768735, "resto": 6478292}, {"no": 6491318, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:33:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6491197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6491197</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Comics are heavily restrained by their consumerist nature, comics are illustration work.</span><br>also you&#039;re an elitist faggot who sounds like you were brainwashed in an elitist art school, or you read too many fine art books.

She mentioned that he seems unhappy, and he shares his feelings with her. She stands up with her hand out and offers to take him somewhere to lighten up his mood. He is reluctant, but something in her is captivating. He follows here into a sketchy looking industrial. When the protagonist thinks he is about to be robbed of his organs, it is revealed that she took him to a rave. Never been to such a place, he feels like a fish out of water. The woman tries to make him feel at ease, and begins to dance. The atmosphere is dreamy and surreal, probably of the drinks he already had. Then she comes close, and they share a kiss. There is a shot of her having her tongue out, revealing a square of LSD. The scene quickly turns psychedelic and morphs into them having sex. Then the protagonist wakes up to the woman making breakfast in his button-up shirt. He leaves quickly, realizing what has happened. Then he notices nothing in the world seems quite the same anymore.

I don&#039;t really think I&#039;m in a position where I can give you good advice, I have a great art friend who taught me a lot and the best thing I can say from what I learned from him is that you should take light fall off seriously. Values fall abruptly right before the light turns into shadow, it can be tricky to see but once you know it you can observe it everywhere and study the phenomenon (I did a poor job with this too by the way). Also, I prefer using opacity jitter rather than flow and another lesson from my friend was to keep the hardness of the round brush at about 50% most of the time, that way you can paint soft brush strokes by making the size bigger and hard brush strokes by making the size smaller. Don&#039;t ask me why but it works.

It entails first drawing a simple view, then projecting parallel lines from various points on the figure at a desired angle to construct a second view. Sometimes, as in picrel, one or more intermediary steps are required to get the desired end result. Picrel is from Jean Cousin&#039;s Livre de Portraiture, which contains many examples. You can also find a few simple (one-step) examples of this method in Burne Hogarthe&#039;s Dynamic Figure Drawing. It shows up mostly in older books, though.<br>Note: This method does not give you size/camera distortion, only foreshortening. For the former, you need to set up a picture plane and have your projecting lines converge towards a point representing the eye of the viewer.<br>This is all fascinating but I don&#039;t recommend it. When it takes more than one step, it&#039;s an enormous amount of labor; furthermore, it&#039;s difficult to predict the end result. It is better to work intuitively and train your eye to what looks right.

Part of the reason I&#039;m familiar with this stuff is because I once tried it as an experiment, animating a character in 8 directions with an idle stance and 6-frame run cycle. It is extremely labor intensive but it does work. With human figures, there is still a lot of artistic intuition involved. The geometry will give you different points but a human body is not a rectangular prism; you still have to draw it yourself.<br>I guess what I&#039;m saying is, some types of drawing have the requirements of both art and math, as in my game example, wherein it was necessary to maintain consistency among multiple frames of animation/directions of movement in difficult foreshortening.

You will go from high regarded normie to nobody overnight. You will most likely not get support from the people you think who would, even worse you will get discouragement throughout.

I&#039;ve been drawing since childhood. Didn&#039;t go in artscool or art classes. I drew cartoons, anime, some of my fantasies. My classmates thought that I was good at drawing, my parents also praised me. I thought I was good, when in reality I just drew like a child who loves to draw. In each class there are at least 1-2 such children. You know these guys, or maybe you were them.<br>With age, I began to draw less and less, by the age of 18-19 I drew maybe a couple of times a year.<br>But one time I needed to draw pictures for my text rpg, and god, I realized how shitty of this i was. <br>This caused me great pain, never in my life i hated and despised myself more.<br>So I took courses in academic drawing and painting. I was 27 at the time.<br>Now I&#039;m 31 and I still continue my education. By no means do I claim that I am a good artist now, I am not even close, but I see my growth with each work.<br><br>So, in my opinion, drawing as a child gives only two good things:<br>1. Fine motor skills develop.<br>2. You go through the drawing phase for fun as a teenager.<br><br>The first catches up very quickly, in just a couple of lessons you will already be good friends with a pencil/stylus.<br><br>The second point is what breaks many adult beginners.<br><br>The realization that before you start drawing your fantasies, you have to go through the hard and boring part. And it may take years. Those who have been drawing since childhood already had their fun. They have drawn cute anime girls, robots, disney princesses and monsters.They understand that it will not get better. And they will have to suffer. And accept it more humbly.<br><br>All this, of course, does not apply to those who studied in art schools as children, and then continued their studies in art at a college or university.

Photoshop simply couldn&#039;t compete anymore for natural/traditional looking line-art.<br>At first I still used Photoshop for coloring and painting my line drawings, but then I completely moved away from it and fully switched to CSP.<br><br>CSP pros (vs Photoshop):<br>- much better line art brushes and engine<br>- canvas rotation (photoshop with his inertia thing is total crap)<br>- better color mixing brushes<br>- better perspective and ruler tools (out of the box at least)<br>- more stable (I haven&#039;t used Photoshop seriously in almost a decade, so this might have changed)<br>- cheaper<br><br>CSP cons (vs Photoshop):<br>- doesn&#039;t support modern multi core processors (when I switched to CSP back in the day, this wasn&#039;t an issue, since Photoshop was a resources consuming always crashing mess)<br>- more limited for custom brushes that involve painting", "filename": "Illustration", "ext": ".png", "w": 1347, "h": 743, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 68, "tim": 1674222792570361, "time": 1674222792, "md5": "24cW7IFF0SPR/Y6fcurjjQ==", "fsize": 127387, "resto": 6476156}, {"no": 6482311, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)09:02:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6482300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6482300</a><br>lol wtf<br>I don\u2019t use either, but can ps actually not mod size by velocity?", "time": 1674223354, "resto": 6476156}, {"no": 6482350, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)09:34:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6482311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6482311</a><br>I have no idea what the new versions can do in that regard.

If you know Photoshop, you know everything. You can literally get hired at lots of places for just being able to show you can use Photoshop well.<br>People say that CSP runs faster but I don&#039;t think this is true. Unoptimized CSP runs faster, but if you just google &quot;Photoshop 60 fps&quot; &quot;Making Photoshop Faster&quot; from Borodante or KNKL you&#039;ll find that Photoshop can fully utilize multithreaded machine setups. Even with higher end PC builds, I&#039;ve noticed Photoshop runs faster than CSP, even after tweaking settings for both. For some reason the cursor on Photoshop just tracks directly behind your pen much more accurately than CSP by a tiny margin, whereas CSP you have to do extensive fuckery to get that to be the close to the same.<br>For CSP The Pen pressure is more customizable meaning I have more options for line brushes and adjusting things. This is not as big of an advantage as you&#039;d think though as for PS the Pen pressure control out of the box works great already, whereas in CSP you usually have to fuck around for a bit to get it feel right. Usually I end up changing all my pens to a straight or slight curve and make everything dependent on my tablet curve pressure anyway. <br>I still use CSP mainly for 2 reasons:<br>The program is constantly getting better and better, whereas the newer versions of Photoshop is actually getting worse than CS6 for painting artwork. With the future updates, it will surpass PS<br>CSP EX has a built in storyboarding feature that is extremely valuable for organizing and making a workflow for making manga/comics and an industry level animation timeline workflow.

It&#039;s different for audio stuff tho. I can hear my thoughts in any voice, imagine music and instruments, sounds and stuff in my head. other senses like smell, touch and taste are less pronounced. I can feel imagined touch to some degree but taste and smell are basically not existent. I do differentiate between the third eye visualization, hypnagogia and dreams. I do dream and I see them just the same as if I&#039;m awake. I do see flashes when tired and shortly before going to sleep. for me that&#039;s working alright. but in the waking state I just see black when closing my eyes, I just see black when thinking of a person or an object.

You misunderstand how the brain works. Visual memory operates outside of the context of mental imagery. &quot;Mental imagery&quot; is just the experience of visualizing something (people with Aphantasia have this, but with 0 vividness). But, mental imagery is really just a meaningless fart of consciousness. The brain&#039;s true mental processes are always subconscious and outside of our own awareness. Drawing also makes use of procedural information and habits, so it would be wrong to think just about visual memory.<br><br>Sometimes when I draw I wonder why it is that I draw so much better now than I used to years ago. Why is this possible? Of course, I trained and made art, but it&#039;s not like when I&#039;m drawing now that I&#039;m conscious of doing anything that special. The drawings I can make effortlessly now are exponentially better. The only obvious answer is that drawing is far more a subconscious activity than a conscious process (rather, everything is). The brain dredges up shit you&#039;re no longer conscious of, and doesn&#039;t even bother to tell you. Your brain jumps through all sorts of hoops for you. <br><br>Aphantasia makes no real difference on the capacity to draw. In reality, everybody starts out so ass. So ass that I cringe at the thought of trying to bring someone all the way from /beg/ into advanced. If you&#039;re a beginner or even int, you still don&#039;t quite understand just how deep your own suckiness goes. If you compare yourself to some other beginner improving faster than you, you might think &quot;wow, that&#039;s unfair&quot; but you&#039;re still both improving at such a snails space and making so many mistakes with how you think about things that it&#039;s painful to watch.

Don&#039;t bother. It&#039;s just not the right way of thinking about things. You want to actually use the things you learn in natural contexts in the days after learning something. That&#039;s natural spaced repetition. And it should be in natural contexts, like you doing a sketching session to relax a bit or to create art pieces or character designs/etc. An issue with Anki is that the learning stays within a strict context. What you learn needs to pour out like a gushing faucet into other art activities. Otherwise it&#039;s still a drag to think about what you&#039;ve learned.<br><br>Furthermore, the encoding process is the key thing here, and doing it right makes it easy to think back to an image you studied and recall information stored related to it. You don&#039;t need to use a spaced repetition algorithm to make spacing happen. You want to process an image so deeply that it would be almost impossible for you to not think about it again.<br><br>The encoding process I recommend requires high cognitive load and meaningful analysis of an image. Cognitive load is essentially how much brain power you&#039;re utilizing. When a lot of brain power is used to manipulate and process information (including images) in a meaningful way (germane cognitive load), robust useful memories are formed in long-term memory.<br><br>This has always been the key to building visual library. Everything that works in efficiently building visual library always uses high germane cognitive load. When people do studies for a work they&#039;re making, or think it&#039;s important to make art pieces from what you study, the reality is that it works because it leads to meaningful processing and high cognitive load going to the right things.<br><br>Going further, you want to start with going overkill on a single image study to get a feel for the effects. Memories always pail in comparison to the real experience; they are thinner and more rough. That&#039;s why you start with going overboard.

It&#039;s just my personal opinion but you want to have fewer, more robust memories in your visual library rather than many weak, shallow memories. I understand the desire to want to be able to draw a lot of different things from memory, but it&#039;s not that important and trying to do too much too fast will just make them flake away. You may have other fundamentals to be working on, or have artwork to make. Those things will take time to come up, too. You have time to build your visual library.

Let me see if I can recall... Basically the creative process is<br><br>1) Inspiration - Gathering ideas by having new experiences, meeting new people, watching / reading / playing media. You can actively seek to do research or just open yourself up to new experiences. Having a notebook on you to quickly write (or draw) down thoughts and ideas comes in handy. Try to keep an open mind, not every idea will be a banger, but we&#039;re not judging them yet.<br><br>2) Iteration - Take some of the ideas you gathered that seem interesting to you. Try to combine them. Try to elaborate on them. Experiment, keep it loose. Come up with one or several outlines, concepts, designs, etc based on your research.<br><br>3) Incubation - Let it sit. Really, just do some other projects for a week or two. Take some walks. A hot shower. Meet friends. Give the ideas some space to breathe, a lot will fall into place. Why is this important? While actively thinking to improve something we&#039;re forming our expectations and limitations - this is crucial to convert the abstract into something tangible but it&#039;s also limiting. It makes us restrained. Purposefully distancing yourself from your work can do wonders. Don&#039;t actively work on it in this period. You will most likely have it in the back of your mind and some new thoughts may arise that help you figure out the direction you want to go in. Take notes.<br><br>4) Evaluation - At this point you should have a pretty good idea what you want to do. This is editing, refining, polishing the idea. Getting feedback, looking at it critically. Judge your work, see how you can improve it. Rinse and repeat.<br><br>The truth is - creativity works different for everyone. Find out what inspires you, what motivates you, what drives you. Get yourself into scenarios that make you want to create, go through the world open minded. Carry around a sketch or notebook.

Cambiaso made loose stereometric studies to help work out the lighting in his paintings.<br>Albrecht Durer experimented with stereometry quite a bit. He also did tons of proportional diagrams. Ultimately, in contrast to Cambiaso&#039;s practical application of stereometry, Durer&#039;s seems to have been what /ic/ calls &quot;autistic&quot; behavior, as in obsessing over things that don&#039;t yield much value to the process of making actual drawings and paintings.<br>There is no evidence to suggest that most Renaissance artists employed stereometry in their work. A few of them experimented with it. But it is clear that all of the old masters thought in terms of what Robert Beverly Hale calls &quot;mass conceptions&quot; -- that is, they conceived of forms in the figure as ovoid, cylindrical, boxlike, etc. They drew cross-contour lines in their sketches.

Reading is supposed to be smooth, clear, and quick. Language evolves to be smooth clear and quick. You want to communicate with as much ease as possible, and so the more visual elements you add the more bogged down that communication becomes. Your eyes become lost in the colors even if they look pretty. I feel the same way about black and white comics that use too many greys and too much detail on every page. I consider the best comics to be the ones where you not only get completely immersed in the story, but you&#039;re also turning the pages quickly so you don&#039;t get a chance to break that immersion or think about anything else. You shouldn&#039;t have to pause the story in your head to think &quot;wow how beautiful&quot; unless it&#039;s deliberately there for the pacing. You should only linger on a page if that is what the story calls for, like to take in the scenery or gravity. Black and white keeps your eyes moving, undistracted, turning the pages, until you hit a beautiful two page spread with intricacies deliberately rendered to make you stop and look carefully. And whatever you&#039;re looking at there, would likely be important.<br>As for skill level in coloring I don&#039;t care. A comic artist is a comic artist. It&#039;s a separate skill from illustration. Learning to speak in sequential imagery is a skill of its own that even the most skillful colorist could fail at. All language, including the language of sequential imagery, should be simple and concise. Highly skilled highly rendered colorful illustrations aren&#039;t simple and concise, they&#039;re just pretty. What you don&#039;t include in your art is just as important as what you do include. Manga is popular because people like it. It&#039;s just that simple. And they like it because it trims all the fat and focuses on easy visual communication and smooth eye movement, while also making its limited black and white look pretty.", "filename": "C3548F01-B0B3-4FC1-8BE2-484C6CCFF95D", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 924, "h": 1387, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674319457754302, "time": 1674319457, "md5": "HpUEbZY+PEYqiVlao85dwQ==", "fsize": 240705, "resto": 6482017}, {"no": 6483832, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)12:26:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I think it depends on the comic.

Artists naturally have high egos and to imply that they do not have an ability in a skill that they think is beneath them--in this case, teaching--is far to incomprehensible for them to process. So instead of attempting to improve at the skill of teaching and finding other, more concrete ways of explaining something, they resort to shit-flinging and name-calling anyone who doesn&#039;t immediately understand their shit advice. <br><br>&quot;Just Draw&quot; is another one of those shit advice. It&#039;s pandered by artists who want to seem like they know a thing or two about drawing but are absolutely ignorant on the process of drawing. If you were to ask Kim Jung Gi why he makes the marks he makes, he could pull a bullshit answer out of his ass that will help literally no one except those who are already good at drawing. If he was being honest, he&#039;d just say to &quot;just draw&quot; because he doesn&#039;t know what specific things you need to do in order to improve and even if he did, he wouldn&#039;t be a good enough teacher to explain it properly. <br><br>This goes to my point in another thread about the PET acronym. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Performer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teacher</span><br>Nearly all of /ic/ are either performers or aspiring performers.

That is exactly why I immediately stopped using Reddit years ago on their LearnArt subreddit because it was literally just a bunch of people who were already good just showing off and asking for advice, and fucking getting it for some fucking reason, while beginners were just ignored or given horrible advice by other retards that can&#039;t draw. <br><br>Of course, after spending time on here, I started to realize that this place is simply a dopamanergic outlet for making you think like you&#039;re being productive when you are in fact not being productive at all.

Performers tend to not understand the process of being able to learn something and therefore are the worst teachers in that field. They tended to have received their skill by sheer mileage and have often taken decades to get to where they currently are. As they have not properly analyzed their approach and why they do certain things, they have an intuitive understanding of drawing which only helps them. Basically, performers cannot teach and can only perform. This is where you get the advice to &quot;just draw&quot; because performers tend to be the ones that actually take this advice seriously and tend to get good by sheer mileage rather than anything concrete that you can teach to anyone. <br><br>Teachers understand a skill at a much higher level than performers and while they may not be as good as the performers, they will often coach the performers regardless. Note how coaches in sports aren&#039;t usually better than the players on the team. (If they were, they&#039;d be mentors not teachers or coaches.) A teacher must have a very high level of understanding of whatever skill they are pursuing as they have to properly explain each and every step--otherwise, they&#039;re wasting everyone&#039;s time. <br><br>For instance, if we were to bring this back to drawing, lets say a beginner creates a drawing. You notice that the drawing is shit but because you are a performer, you can&#039;t exactly explain why it is shit.

But what I have &quot;most&quot; of are over 180 pages of a sprawling tale of Jeremey Prickles and a good 70 pages were literally storyboards of when I was able to Do It Properly, which means everything is made of separately drawn chunks pounded by Photoshop into story, So I drew it using the sketchbooks I was dragging into waiting rooms,and an epic story sprung from a random sketch of a demon head. It has both moments of revelation and whiplash pangs at your heart strings. I ordered a flatbed scanner so I can properly showcase my recent art,and the tale I am now telling,and the decision I have made. I am going to be 58 soon,and I am pondering how to proceed. I want to tell as many stories completely as I can, but I want to give the rendering enough work, to at least give a vague impression of what I was aiming for. To balance the art with the storytelling is a tightrope walk:in a page,I want to inch the story foward, at least from these current crop of characters (I had 3 storylines going at once,and all parties have joined up heading towards the end.). So I am just letting the story take me where it will.

I am thinking about reintroducing the Snowglobe story at some other venue, after I composed a few new strips summarizing the first few dozen of the first entries that were mere storyboards for when I was going to have the time to redo them properly, which never happened. That would mean also having the time to generate new strips,which,according to the news that I had at work,may once again be in short supply. But for now,I am just happy with what I am producing,warts and all, and will forge ahead whatever happens at the job. The other angle of creating/promoting the IP I had was to bundle everything up as the &quot;JP Experience&quot;,explaining that I am a Writer with an Artistic Bent(to offset the unprofessional art),and shop it around to agents hungry for exploitable new franchises to peddle.
