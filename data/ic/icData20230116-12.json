I saw him say that he starts with scribbles and refines from there, but starting with a rough gesture and refining is common practice even for artists who can see images in their mind, and I&#039;d think a true lack of mental imaging would prohibit the placement of even a comprehensible gestural sketch from imagination.<br><br>tl;dr Do creative artists with aphantasia truly exist, or are they just full of shit/don&#039;t actually have thoughts devoid of imagery?", "filename": "eh78bK7c_0308202357411sbpi", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1013, "h": 700, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 172, "tim": 1673825552026852, "time": 1673825552, "md5": "Ubya4BrOYCVhhbkSDsIBsQ==", "fsize": 376162, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "artists-with-aphantasia", "replies": 43, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 16}, {"no": 6475588, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:37:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6475582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6475582</a><br>people will cut off their dicks in order to commodify the perceived scarcity of &quot;their brains being just different, guys&quot;<br>hope this helps, a thread died for this", "time": 1673825835, "resto": 6475582}, {"no": 6475615, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:51:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "aphantasia is a fake disease that can&#039;t be diagnosed by a medical professional.

Every 5 minute video lecture took me an hour of pausing every sentence to google how to do what he said on krita and follow along. Some lessons are missing the .psd download so I just screenshot his video and upload that to krita to follow along. Use your brain. I am 2k% more fluent in krita now thanks to this guy. There is no shortcut. You have to brute force your way through lots of &quot;boring&quot; to actually learn the program and its capabilities thoroughly. I&#039;m hardly a L33T HAXOR now but I went from literally not knowing how to merge a layer or change the brush tag to making my own custom brushes and being basically fluent in the &quot;photo-editing&quot; aspects of the program. I even know where my resource folder is now!<br><br>Second, I decided to &quot;sail&quot; marc brunet&#039;s art academy. To do this you need to get qBittorent (make sure it&#039;s q when you google it).

These guys (especially brunet) have thought extremely hard about how to get you from A to B in the quickest way. You should 80% study them and 20% study supplemental stuff that you personally like and want to focus on like anime or specific books like scott robertson - how to draw; which I am using to study vehicle and environment design.<br><br>I am in a lot of pain all the time I can personally maybe squeeze out like an hour or two of productive fucking anything per day. I have made more real progress in 1 month of CtrPaint + brunet than I have in the previous 5 or 6 months of grinding a few loomis heads every day which only demotivated me and made me depressed. Learning Krita so that I can comfortably draw while lying down in bed on my android has been a gamechanger also instead of trying to draw with pencils and pens and sketchbooks at my tiny fucking desk made for toddlers in my tiny rented bedroom. I understand the advice to start learning analog so you have less distractions but in my case I regret avoiding digital for so long. <br><br>Lastly I would say that if you are looking for a specific book you can look up zlibrary on reddit to find out how to access it on the dark web, or you could just google &quot;book name/author name&quot; + &quot;pdf&quot; and I just found like 90% of the books within minutes. Plus check the sticky since the loomis books for example are free (out of copyright?) just get them from there.<br><br>Efficiency is key and the advice people give on this board can be really bad. an advanced artist saying &quot;just draw&quot; to a beg is like saying &quot;just sail&quot; from your floating boat to a guy on the beach who has a massive hole in his raft. <br><br>I am noticeable progress at this point considering my disability.

I obviously didn&#039;t pay for his course so no feedback direct from him or his group but this is the next best thing imo.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

There is no best way. The whole idea is figuring out how to change the way you make art for the better. That vision you have of what that means is an important part of this.<br><br>For studying figure drawing and &quot;human anatomy,&quot; the entire goal is to flesh out your mental model of the human figure and to be able to draw upon that model (i.e. important details of the surface form and/or how muscles overlap or change from movement). You should probably copy (process drawings by copying them); doing so helps you flesh out your mental model. (Don&#039;t go overboard on your copies). <br><br>You then want to use that new detail in other contexts (drawing from imagination and drawing from reference). If you&#039;re at the level where you&#039;re making art on a frequent basis, then try to find ways to directly use it to inform your art. If you do not make use of what you learn in other contexts you are significantly less likely to remember it and use it. Your brain is designed to forget useless information and skills; if what you study from a book is not put to use it is just that, useless.<br><br>Forgetting is also common in the learning process and will vary depending on how much you already know. If you try to remember something you learned and forgot it, re-study it. If you try to remember something you learned and realized what you learned isn&#039;t in-depth or robust enough to be useful, you study it more.

I do not consider myself an artist. Actually, according to one of my mentors who has been in the industry for almost 30 years, tattoing started to tear off of its origins and traditions around the time some tattooers started calling themselves tattoo &quot;artists&quot;.<br>I feel very sorry for those who have experienced the elders&#039; gatekeeping. I have been incredibly blessed by not one but four ridiculous old monsters who have been tattooing for almost, and in one case, for a longer time than I have been alive, and they have been very generous and kind with their knowledge, experience and wisdom, so just so you know, people like that exist too. But to those who are just squeezed, juiced, used and thrown away, please don&#039;t get discouraged. Dickheads are found in every industry, and unfortunately not only those of sound mind do tattoos or get them. If you enjoy and respect tattooing, you are able to gain a foothold in it, and the more effort you put into it, the more you get out of it, always.<br>To everyone who wants to get into tattoing, I advise to seek out the roots of the craft, learn traditional artforms, be it western guache-illustrations, middle-eastern mural patterns or tibethan thangka painting, copy and master the traditional methods of tattoo designing, learn to value good foundations and technicality, and always, always be humble. If you manage to establish a decent portfolio, and do an as exhausting research on the history of the industry as you can, you will be miles ahead of the average apprentice (that I have met). My apprenticeship has started very shoddily as well, and I was almost completelt crushed by my first studio, but holding on was without a doubt worth it, and I would gladly undergo the 6 (sometimes 7) days of ridiculous 8-12 hours a day unpaid labor and myriads of favours once again to be where I am. Finishing a work you can be proud of is intoxicating.<br>I wish all you the best, please enjoy the journey as much as you can.", "time": 1673652272, "resto": 6469008}, {"no": 6473648, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)16:53:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6470947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6470947</a><br>I see the face of a dog<br>Do I have autism", "time": 1673733186, "resto": 6469008}, {"no": 6473739, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:51:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6471005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6471005</a><br>what do you thinking about self teaching? you believe there&#039;s enough resources on youtube?

Have not the developers of the program you are using designed the software in a way where all you have to do is press knobs and tick boxes to get the brush you want to use and is this not a \u201cmachine\u201d doing the work for you. If we were to get really specific, and even in this case this wouldn\u2019t work, the only valid form of human vs machine would be if the human used a Command Line Interface and therefore controlled each and every aspect of the drawing. However, it is inefficient to use such a thing in order to create digital art so it begs the question how art created by a propriety program is any different from a machine creating derivatives of a piece of artwork. Would a few brush strokes on the result be enough to say that it was then created by said human?

I got hired off of a few action poses and one board. So In my experience, I would say focus on making boards and composition but also focus on life drawing and figure drawing, I mean actually sit down and work through the phases, lay in, contour, values, and finishing. A few hours a day thumbnailing for boards, and a few hours a day life drawing will take you insanely far. By the time you get around to finishing a board you will be better than you were. And on top of that if you always thumbnailing you will have a bunch of thumbs that you can draw upon to make into full boards in the future if you want to. it&#039;s a win-win.

Some people argue that tracing is morally wrong because it&#039;s a form of plagiarism and doesn&#039;t allow the artist to truly learn and grow. When you trace, you&#039;re not really learning how to draw or paint - you&#039;re just copying someone else&#039;s work. Plus, it&#039;s not fair to the original artist whose work is being used without permission. Additionally, it takes away the unique style and voice of the artist.<br><br>Another argument against tracing is that it can lead to a lack of originality in the art world. If everyone is just tracing and not developing their own skills and ideas, it can make for a pretty boring and uninspired art scene.<br><br>I know some people argue that tracing is a great way to learn and improve, but I personally believe that the best way to learn is by experimenting and making mistakes. That&#039;s how you develop your own style and technique. And, it&#039;s not fair to use someone else&#039;s hard work as a crutch for your own.<br><br>Just my thoughts on the matter.

The reason tracing is &quot;bad&quot; is because it breaks the social rules of artists. <br>Those social rules revolve around this fact: &quot;Making art&quot; is being an illusionist, and if you reveal too much you shatter the perception of the magic. But the issue is that artists are also captive in the illusion! Tutorials always leave bits out, they preserve some of that &quot;magic.&quot;<br><br>Plenty of perma-/beg/ artists get pissed off when actual helpful advice is given to others because their own illusion is one where they &quot;did everything they could&quot; and just accept their position as being one of shit. Revealing that they could have been doing more makes them start to regret wasted time. <br><br>The same thing happens for less-shitty artists when you point out things like tracing are fine. They are idolizing the &quot;idea&quot; of being an artist. They strive for it. They hope for it. They look up to people. When you shatter that, break the idea of what they desired down into concrete, worldly processes - the magic vanishes. The meaning vanishes.

Or learn the Grade 1 kanji first using this method because you are bound to have words to use for all of them. <br><br>When you are reading books, you can also do the same with words you want to remember the kanji for.<br><br>You will need to push at the beginning to understand how kanji work. And when you want to really commit a kanji to memory, you need to repeat the process I outlined above. But you are encoding the kanji way more strongly than most people as a result. Remembering becomes the easy part.<br><br>Since most words you end up studying are kanji compounds, you have two chances that at least one of the kanji make a lot of sense.", "time": 1673636166, "resto": 6469461}, {"no": 6473431, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)13:46:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;finish an anime and want S2</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;find out there is a game that will come out soon for it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still can&#039;t read nip and I know it&#039;ll never get localized</span><br><br>Hate this shit so much man.Maybe I should keep learning while drawing.", "time": 1673721971, "resto": 6469461}, {"no": 6473574, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)15:58:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6473431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6473431</a><br>look into the ajatt method.

The way these diffusion models work is they take some random noise, then try to &quot;remove&quot; that noise step by step in order to &quot;reconstruct&quot; an image and the resulting images will be interpolations from the latent space (which was constructed from the LAION dataset during the training process). Typing prompts basically points the algorithm to certain areas in the latent space (so if you type &quot;cat&quot; it will try to interpolate something from the &quot;cat&quot; cluster).

This was to see if I could get close to the original. It was drawn in 1600x2000 then cropped down mainly with the brush size between 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 depending on what the line thickness is.

For example: Depression is a decreased ability to recall good memories, so recall of bad memories takes over. Antidepressants &quot;balance things out&quot; by nuking the recall of bad memories to or below the good-memory frequency. So someone who is REALLY depressed or overmedicated will have horrendous recall.<br>Similarly, some forms of autism can impact recall due to interest and focus being 100% on or 100% off. That&#039;s how autistic children can rattle off everything about their special interest but take an extra long time to learn to tie their shoes, walk funny, etc. They simply are not paying attention to the latter but are the former. It&#039;s also why autists who are newbies (or perma/beg/)make very strange art: They are creative in only a limited range of areas because they only pay attention to a limited range of things.<br><br>In order to &quot;train your visualization&quot; you need to actively pay attention to things and TRY to combine them with others. Personally I have had a lot of issues with idea-generation, but that&#039;s mainly because of some tism causing compartmentalization. For a long time I often thought up ideas that I didn&#039;t want to draw! Not because I thought &quot;my ideas suck&quot; or anything, but I was getting ideas that others would find nice but that I had no care for. What was happening was that I was storing information in mental compartments, and just paying too much attention to things that went into compartments outside what I like to draw.<br>I am still struggling a bit, but it&#039;s better.

Artists naturally have high egos and to imply that they do not have an ability in a skill that they think is beneath them--in this case, teaching--is far to incomprehensible for them to process.

If he was being honest, he&#039;d just say to &quot;just draw&quot; because he doesn&#039;t know what specific things you need to do in order to improve and even if he did, he wouldn&#039;t be a good enough teacher to explain it properly. <br><br>This goes to my point in another thread about the PET acronym. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Performer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teacher</span><br>Nearly all of /ic/ are either performers or aspiring performers.

That is exactly why I immediately stopped using Reddit years ago on their LearnArt subreddit because it was literally just a bunch of people who were already good just showing off and asking for advice, and fucking getting it for some fucking reason, while beginners were just ignored or given horrible advice by other retards that can&#039;t draw. <br><br>Of course, after spending time on here, I started to realize that this place is simply a dopamanergic outlet for making you think like you&#039;re being productive when you are in fact not being productive at all.

Performers tend to not understand the process of being able to learn something and therefore are the worst teachers in that field. They tended to have received their skill by sheer mileage and have often taken decades to get to where they currently are. As they have not properly analyzed their approach and why they do certain things, they have an intuitive understanding of drawing which only helps them. Basically, performers cannot teach and can only perform. This is where you get the advice to &quot;just draw&quot; because performers tend to be the ones that actually take this advice seriously and tend to get good by sheer mileage rather than anything concrete that you can teach to anyone. <br><br>Teachers understand a skill at a much higher level than performers and while they may not be as good as the performers, they will often coach the performers regardless. Note how coaches in sports aren&#039;t usually better than the players on the team. (If they were, they&#039;d be mentors not teachers or coaches.) A teacher must have a very high level of understanding of whatever skill they are pursuing as they have to properly explain each and every step--otherwise, they&#039;re wasting everyone&#039;s time. <br><br>For instance, if we were to bring this back to drawing, lets say a beginner creates a drawing. You notice that the drawing is shit but because you are a performer, you can&#039;t exactly explain why it is shit. You can say something like, &quot;the forms are off&quot; or the &quot;perspective is off&quot; but you can&#039;t really delve exactly as to why the drawing is really bad, much less provide useful resources to practice from. <br><br>The teacher will be able to hyper-analyze a drawing and know exactly what the issues are what that beginner to study. <br><br>Most people on here are performers, NOT teachers.", "filename": "1546597290710", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 719, "h": 720, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673640852599134, "time": 1673640852, "md5": "B3qNRcs5ImxvLmnmvCdGJQ==", "fsize": 52441, "resto": 6460328}, {"no": 6471955, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)15:17:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6471952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6471952</a><br>&quot;Just draw&quot; is the great filter, those who get it will make it and those who don&#039;t will look for that magic tutorial until they eventually get Just draw or give up.<br>Again not reading your pseudo intellectual wall of text but please make another one so I can comment the same thing again.", "time": 1673641025, "resto": 6460328}, {"no": 6471961, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)15:19:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6469399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6469399</a><br>how can i make it a habit to draw every day?", "filename": "20221224_195917", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1216, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673641158241188, "time": 1673641158, "md5": "AvD7lLyj8u9bGdQIg3mytA==", "fsize": 250528, "resto": 6460328}, {"no": 6471963, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)15:21:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6471961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6471961</a><br>Start with an hour and increase the time daily, even as little as 10min more per day will get you up there in a few weeks.", "time": 1673641269, "resto": 6460328}, {"no": 6471970, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)15:24:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6471952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6471952</a><br>So you&#039;re saying that only people who get just draw will become great and those who don&#039;t can become good but not great?", "time": 1673641457, "resto": 6460328}, {"no": 6472003, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)15:43:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6471970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6471970</a><br>Typically. <br>Those who &quot;just draw&quot; have a natural inclination and ability towards drawing which is why it ends up working for them.

In my own case,what I present to the public is usually very different from the source material that I physically draw with ballpoint pens,and pencil for intentionally moulding into two dimensional sculpture that are my finished panels. But what I have &quot;most&quot; of are over 180 pages of a sprawling tale of Jeremey Prickles and a good 70 pages were literally storyboards of when I was able to Do It Properly, which means everything is made of separately drawn chunks pounded by Photoshop into story, So I drew it using the sketchbooks I was dragging into waiting rooms,and an epic story sprung from a random sketch of a demon head. It has both moments of revelation and whiplash pangs at your heart strings. I ordered a flatbed scanner so I can properly showcase my recent art,and the tale I am now telling,and the decision I have made. I am going to be 58 soon,and I am pondering how to proceed. I want to tell as many stories completely as I can, but I want to give the rendering enough work, to at least give a vague impression of what I was aiming for. To balance the art with the storytelling is a tightrope walk:in a page,I want to inch the story foward, at least from these current crop of characters (I had 3 storylines going at once,and all parties have joined up heading towards the end.). So I am just letting the story take me where it will.
