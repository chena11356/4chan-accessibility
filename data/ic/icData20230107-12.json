It&#039;s not supposed to be self-sufficient, just like a stabilizer in your drawing software of choice is not supposed to automatically solve all your lineart issues. <br>First of all, AI is the (potentially) ultimate referencing tool.

That is certainly good enough. The clothes are all wrong, but you&#039;re not an artist for nothing, you can fix that yourself. So copy it, add your own flavor, or try something else entirely, do whatever you want.<br>Second, AI is really good at inpainting. If you need a quick fix, or you don&#039;t like how something looks - consult the AI and see what it gives you, it takes seconds and maybe you&#039;ll find something inspiring.<br>Third, AI is really good at backgrounds. It paints huge complicated scenes of any variety in seconds.

It seems that you just have to kinda go for it, but blobs of paint scare me because of how messy it looks before you clean it up. The precision you get from lines just aren&#039;t there from the start.

Attached is a page from when I was in the feet section, the memory drawing and corrections are both there, so it&#039;s great we both had the idea of correcting the drawing after the fact. The chapter I struggled the most on was the beginning chapter, with all the full figures, but once you start getting into the body parts it goes a lot quicker. <br><br>My end goal was to get my drawing EXACTLY like how Bridgman had it, but of course I often fell short. In the beginning, I would stare at the drawing for 15-20 minutes, drawing it in my head over and over again, then I would bang out the sketch really quickly, to not lose any information. When I was doing the full figures in the first chapter, I could only do 1-2 drawings at a time before my brain went caput, but it really does get a lot easier after that.<br><br>My one criticism of your process is to use pencil, and then ink on top. imo it&#039;s important to give yourself the room to make mistakes.

For you, don&#039;t worry about how long you&#039;re taking, 1-2 hrs a day is plenty to progress. I think you&#039;re doing it right, I might&#039;ve rushed Bridgman, to my own detriment.<br><br>Anyways, do your 30 mins of gestures, and your Bridgman, and you&#039;ll do fine.

You&#039;re leaving small light spots that attract our attention where it shouldn&#039;t be (if the tummy should be the highlight you&#039;d need a different composition.) <br><br>When you think about values and light you should think of the painting as a whole. Unless it&#039;s concept art, a middle range value lile the one you picked for your painting is a pretty bad place to start, because already the whole composition is pretty much in the same value range. Especially early you shouldn&#039;t be afraid of really pushing the value range, somdare to go much darker and much lighter. <br><br>Keep your light sourse in mind. And what the light itself /is/. Different types of light will cause different shadows to be created. Harsh sunlight, for example, causes fairly dark but warm coloured shadows and might cause light to bounce off large surfaces. So a chin, which is pointing downwards but juts out might cast a lighter shadow than the nect area, as light is being reflected off of the ground.

This was to see if I could get close to the original. It was drawn in 1600x2000 then cropped down mainly with the brush size between 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 depending on what the line thickness is. It&#039;s not a good brush for a single line drawing. Instead, you&#039;ll have to draw over your lines multiple times to get it to be thick. Keep it light and fast for the &quot;skippy&quot; thin lines.

At seventy-three, I began to grasp the structures of birds and beasts, insects and fish, and of the way plants grow. If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by the time I am eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential nature. At one hundred, I may well have a positively divine understanding of them, while at one hundred and thirty, forty, or more I will have reached the stage where every dot and every stroke I paint will be alive.

I am more of a male tomboy so to speak, I enjoy womens clothes from time (not in public though) and I can pass for female If I really wanted to, but these are all minute urges that go away whenever I meet a girl I really like, I fall into the typical male role. <br><br>DXM is a dissociative, and the higher plateaus you go into, the more you see how much of sense of self has been constructed by society, class and ultimately yourself. It can all be eroded away in an &quot;ego death&quot; which some liken to spiritual awakening. Once I saw that the universe is ultimately nothing, it would only make sense that the desire to be a good person, truly, comes from an innate desire to add meaning to a meaningless universe through kind acts. <br><br>I am half jewish and not accepted by the jews because my mother is not jewish. I am also clearly different from my non-jewish peers. Russian is my native language but I do not fit in the typical mold of Russian because I was raised in America, etc you get the idea. To me, Jesus was a jew who did not fit in the typical mold and was bold enough to question the status quo through a union with the spiritual god, then was to put to death for his belief. The resurrection, which I was not raised to believe in, is just something allegorical to me. I find comfort and poetic meaning in Christ, my favorite work of literature on the subject is Chapter 2 of The Master and Margarita, which depicts a more brutal and realistic picture of what may have transpired in Christs life: <br><br>https://www.weblitera.com/book/?id=<wbr>205&amp;lng=1&amp;ch=2&amp;l=", "time": 1672856651, "resto": 6442987}, {"no": 6456256, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:26:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6456254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6456254</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.weblitera.com/book/?id<wbr>=205&amp;lng=1&amp;ch=2&amp;l=</span><br><br>&#039;I think,&#039; replied the Procurator with a strange smile, &#039; that there is someone else in this world for whom you should feel sorrier than for Judas of Karioth and who is destined for a fate much worse than Judas&#039;! ...

I can&#039;t imagine doing that crap and I&#039;ve been drawing for years. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll help but I&#039;ll lend you some of my advice. Pick your favorite artist you want to draw like and start copying their stuff. Not serious 1:1 studies, just make some shitty doodles with whatever looks cool to you. In my case I just copied Akira panels because I always loved it. I must&#039;ve copied half the series at some point. After a while I began to understand how Otomo drew figures. I didn&#039;t realize then that I was basically just doing figure studies, just not with irl people. Some time later I got confident enough to learn from other artists I admired and got better at copying, then I actually went over the fundies books that everyone pushes on prebegs. I felt like I learned in reverse but there is no wrong way to learning as long as you&#039;re making progress. Another piece of advice is to grow some skin and learn to take and LISTEN to advice from your superiors and apply it. Don&#039;t assume you know better when someone tells you this shading is inconsistent or this fold doesn&#039;t make sense etc. <br><br>Point is, while art is practice and hard work, it doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t have fun.

If price is a big factor any medium works well with a limited palette of 6 or more colors. There are many ways to make a certain medium more expensive and cheap, which is why I would also consider oil. For example, oil paint covers huge areas easily with very little paint and there are inexpensive oil painting papers to paint on. Another example is if you compare gouache and watercolor, the gouache paint is a little bit more expensive, because you will finish it faster, but on the other hand, you don&#039;t need good paper for gouache. All of them have their difficulties and advantages, but if I would recommend an all rounder that&#039;s forgiving I would suggest oil even though it&#039;s not in your list. If this is not an option for you, I would choose gouache over acrylic, because it&#039;s forgiving in brush quality and maintanence and it&#039;s better for sketching and making smaller pieces. The emulsion is not as strong as with acrylic, which makes it easier to handle the paint on the brush and canvas. Go for watercolor only if you love watercolor or you going to have a bad time. Watercolor is an outlier and has some specific qualities that you only should put up with if you really want to go for the watercolor look and feel. I agree that it&#039;s inexpensive to get into though, but it benefits from higher quality paper. So all in all, I would suggest gouache if you don&#039;t want to consider oil, but personally I don&#039;t like the Himi gouache, it has a strange consistency and it has too many colors. Consider a high quality brand like W&amp;N, Holbein, Schmincke, Graham, but getting a small limited palette of 5-7 colors plus a big tube of white. Get those air tight wet palettes that everyone uses for gouache nowadays (I use them too, they are great) and you are good to go with a couple of synthetic taklon brushes. While you need thick paper to prevent buckling, you don&#039;t need 100% cotton, gouache is fine on cheap, thicker paper.", "time": 1672574481, "resto": 6367918}, {"no": 6450908, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)07:45:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "on the subject of least expensive medium<br>technically, it would be using dry pigments mixed with gum arabic or egg yolk.<br>egg tempera is cheaper if you take a bit of the yolk from when you cook with eggs. a whole yolk is too much waste.<br>gum arabic is cheaper when you consider a bag of the dry powder can last for years upon years.<br>extra expenses are that egg tempera should be done on stiff support that is covered with traditional gesso ground which can be intimidating for a lot of beginners. i have tricks for anyone who actually cares to use it. watercolor paper can be more expensive if you don&#039;t have access to scrap wood. but if you don&#039;t egg or gum paint, then you can try out other media with the pigments. <br>for both, kolinsky is considered the best which can be quite expensive. but great thing for either is that they are not hard on the brushes unlike how oil can be and especially acrylic, and brush clean up is easier.", "time": 1672577111, "resto": 6367918}, {"no": 6450992, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:00:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6450908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6450908</a><br>Just a quick comment: this is insane advice for a beginner.

Wear drawing gloves (or in my case, a sock). This is important so that your hand can glide; it makes a difference.<br>2. Flip canvas horizontal or rotate canvas for awkward drawing angles. Everybody has a natural angle they&#039;re better at drawing lines with.<br>3. Stabilizer. Crank that shit up so your lines are smooth even when drawing with your arm (drawing with the arm can sometimes cause wobbles). Use this to a second pass on your drawings since stabilizer can mess up the flow of sketching.<br>4. Too much pressure sensitivity on a brush can be a noob trap. Try using stiffer brush sensitivity until you&#039;ve gotten control of that.<br>5. Practice re-inking manga (tracing but you&#039;re going for a high level of reproduction). Have a window open of the reference to refer to as well. Doing 3-4 of these with a high level of precision will teach you a lot.<br>6. Hopefully you have a medium-sized tablet; the small models are a bit cramped.<br>7. If you have a wacom model, go for the flex nibs. They&#039;re softer and so have a superior feel over the hard plastic nibs.<br>8. Have patience with yourself, there&#039;s a lot that goes into linework.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

Sure, they might come up with results that look similar but the process in itself is so different that one person would most likely not enjoy what the other is doing and vice versa. Are there some people who like both painting and photography?

I&#039;m just confused on how this works on anime characters as small as these, there&#039;s very little muscle, normal necks have smooth transition and curve to show the muscles going up the neck, this one just has a large gap from the neck to the clavicle so it would just be sitting on the top or the torso, there is sometimes a curve but when at rest there&#039;s nothing. <br><br>It&#039;s confusing sorry, i also don&#039;t know how much you&#039;re mean to shrink the neck by according to anime standard before it works well and when it&#039;s just a stick.

I though it was great, main thing I dislike is the dialogue. You should change the font, have speech bubbles, and also just go over everything to remove unnecessary lines, and edit forced lines. I&#039;m also working on a comic, and it&#039;s definitely a challenge to make dialogue seem natural and not cringe-inducing. Try and act out the interaction in your head, and ask yourself if it would be like that in a real life interaction. Also keep in the mind that the character&#039;s personality plays a role in each interaction (If you haven&#039;t done this already, you should write down a document for yourself that includes your character&#039;s personality, motivations, fears, etc..) And another thing to keep in mind is that not everything has to be vocalized. <br><br>I found it weird how this main character knows English well when she was abandoned as a little kid, I think she should be more mute (Or maybe you could make her dialogue have a purposefully limited choice of words.)

AI is definitely a wakeup call but certainly not the death of the artist. It has its place and use as a tool of convenience.<br><br>I think we&#039;ll have to adapt in much the same way that AI does. Specifically, by rejecting digital mediums for the physical, relearning traditional techniques, and developing a unique style after figuring out some fundies. Many art communities online are having absolute meltdowns because they can&#039;t tell the difference between an AI piece and an original work even though the funny shit is the vast majority of people online are using digital and tablets. There&#039;s a very simple workaround for this: make your art physically. Sure some pajeet can make a robot that can emulate skill, but no pajeet will replace the human soul. Trads don&#039;t have to give a shit, just post timestamp.<br><br>Personally, digital artwork lacks a lot of appeal in the first place. Not to say it isn&#039;t or can&#039;t be good, I just think it&#039;s missing something fundamental to the human soul that goes into it. The mistakes are too easily corrected, the physicality of touching paper, oils, color, spilling shit and just getting weird with it are gone. Spill coffee on your computer and you could lose a keyboard, spill coffee on a canvas and it can be inspiring. AI gives me the feeling people are seeing with their eyes whether or not a piece has appeal, and not their heart. Some of the dumbest shit speaks to me even if it&#039;s not some high ideal, but so far, AI hasn&#039;t. It simply doesn&#039;t have a human soul to connect with.<br><br>I&#039;m predicting a renaissance of physical, traditional, and certainly original art soon as a natural counter to AI and looking forward to it. We&#039;ll end up with a lot of weird growing pains but I truly think it&#039;ll pay off. Once you can show something was made with your own hands, there can be no further doubt to authenticity.

Personally when it comes to male characters, any type is fair game to me as long as I find them interesting and have more personality or dimension to them. For example, manly fictional characters that have some sort of gap moe or other side to them rather than to just look manly and act manly are popular with women, example being the gentle giant or tough guy is actually cute or into cute things. It&#039;s also the same way around like cute looking guys actually being psycho or having a polarizing personality, tumblr sexyman example, although I personally don&#039;t like how they look they do fit this gap trope of pretty boys who are actually psycho. Girls are also naturally drawn to humor so a guy with a sense of humor will be popular (golden kamuy). Girls will like any male character as long as they are physically attractive in some way and have a personality trait they can relate to. I like fighting and war stories but not for the men but instead for the actual plot and themes because most war story boys don&#039;t really focus or explore any personality that isn&#039;t related to the fighting itself.
