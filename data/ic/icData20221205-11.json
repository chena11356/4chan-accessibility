You can animate them walking in a loop and then tween them from A to B instead of manually placing each keyframe in space. <br>It really doesn\u2019t work for just everything.

For the walk cycle example I gave, it\u2019d be equivalent to moving the character walk loop as cels through a painted environment if we were using pre-digital animation techniques, and just moving the whole loop through the shot very slow. Still the same number of frames looping. <br>Like the panning shots in Akira\u2019s opening doesn\u2019t have every single asset redrawn, they were very strategic about what could be kept static and what needed to move, for some shots there\u2019s no animation at all and they\u2019re just sliding cels around.<br><a href=\"#p6399995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399995</a><br>I kneel", "filename": "55E45D21-E4EA-444D-97A0-07B55596C926", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 185, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 46, "tim": 1670073126756046, "time": 1670073126, "md5": "C1q1sk8QpLxdwL49pDMc6g==", "fsize": 981183, "resto": 6399942}, {"no": 6401652, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)23:20:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399942</a><br>as someone said<br>SHAPE GO WEEEE", "time": 1670127654, "resto": 6399942}, {"no": 6401677, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)23:48:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399942</a><br>Still requires the animator to actually draw<br><br>Still requires the artist to manually manipulate their work for the animation to come out right<br><br>And still you will never be an artist", "filename": "neco-arc-dance", "ext": ".gif", "w": 473, "h": 498, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670129309300327, "time": 1670129309, "md5": "F7l7aQXStW6H3dU/gMqlNA==", "fsize": 1137365, "resto": 6399942}, {"no": 6402523, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)13:22:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6401677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6401677</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still requires the artist to manually manipulate their work for the animation to come out right</span><br>So like img2img", "time": 1670178144, "resto": 6399942}], "last_modified": 1670178144}, {"no": 6402147, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)07:19:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Guys.
