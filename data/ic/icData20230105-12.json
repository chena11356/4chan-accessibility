Especially early you shouldn&#039;t be afraid of really pushing the value range, somdare to go much darker and much lighter. <br><br>Keep your light sourse in mind. And what the light itself /is/. Different types of light will cause different shadows to be created. Harsh sunlight, for example, causes fairly dark but warm coloured shadows and might cause light to bounce off large surfaces.

Attached is a page from when I was in the feet section, the memory drawing and corrections are both there, so it&#039;s great we both had the idea of correcting the drawing after the fact. The chapter I struggled the most on was the beginning chapter, with all the full figures, but once you start getting into the body parts it goes a lot quicker. <br><br>My end goal was to get my drawing EXACTLY like how Bridgman had it, but of course I often fell short. In the beginning, I would stare at the drawing for 15-20 minutes, drawing it in my head over and over again, then I would bang out the sketch really quickly, to not lose any information. When I was doing the full figures in the first chapter, I could only do 1-2 drawings at a time before my brain went caput, but it really does get a lot easier after that.<br><br>My one criticism of your process is to use pencil, and then ink on top. imo it&#039;s important to give yourself the room to make mistakes. Even all my ballpoint pen sketches I did from manga in /msg/, I used pencil underneath.<br><br>About me taking only 1 month to go through Bridgman versus how long you&#039;ve been doing it, I just chalk that up to the fact that I already had several years of drawing experience before doing Bridgman, so I could do my studies very quickly, and i did it for 8 hours a day, like a maniac. For you, don&#039;t worry about how long you&#039;re taking, 1-2 hrs a day is plenty to progress. I think you&#039;re doing it right, I might&#039;ve rushed Bridgman, to my own detriment.<br><br>Anyways, do your 30 mins of gestures, and your Bridgman, and you&#039;ll do fine.

I became an artist, and from fifty on began producing works that won some reputation, but nothing I did before the age of seventy was worthy of attention. At seventy-three, I began to grasp the structures of birds and beasts, insects and fish, and of the way plants grow. If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by the time I am eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential nature. At one hundred, I may well have a positively divine understanding of them, while at one hundred and thirty, forty, or more I will have reached the stage where every dot and every stroke I paint will be alive.

It can all be eroded away in an &quot;ego death&quot; which some liken to spiritual awakening.

I am also clearly different from my non-jewish peers. Russian is my native language but I do not fit in the typical mold of Russian because I was raised in America, etc you get the idea. To me, Jesus was a jew who did not fit in the typical mold and was bold enough to question the status quo through a union with the spiritual god, then was to put to death for his belief. The resurrection, which I was not raised to believe in, is just something allegorical to me. I find comfort and poetic meaning in Christ, my favorite work of literature on the subject is Chapter 2 of The Master and Margarita, which depicts a more brutal and realistic picture of what may have transpired in Christs life: <br><br>https://www.weblitera.com/book/?id=<wbr>205&amp;lng=1&amp;ch=2&amp;l=", "time": 1672856651, "resto": 6442987}, {"no": 6456256, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:26:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6456254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6456254</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.weblitera.com/book/?id<wbr>=205&amp;lng=1&amp;ch=2&amp;l=</span><br><br>&#039;I think,&#039; replied the Procurator with a strange smile, &#039; that there is someone else in this world for whom you should feel sorrier than for Judas of Karioth and who is destined for a fate much worse than Judas&#039;! ...

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

I&#039;m just confused on how this works on anime characters as small as these, there&#039;s very little muscle, normal necks have smooth transition and curve to show the muscles going up the neck, this one just has a large gap from the neck to the clavicle so it would just be sitting on the top or the torso, there is sometimes a curve but when at rest there&#039;s nothing. <br><br>It&#039;s confusing sorry, i also don&#039;t know how much you&#039;re mean to shrink the neck by according to anime standard before it works well and when it&#039;s just a stick.

Wear drawing gloves (or in my case, a sock). This is important so that your hand can glide; it makes a difference.<br>2. Flip canvas horizontal or rotate canvas for awkward drawing angles. Everybody has a natural angle they&#039;re better at drawing lines with.<br>3. Stabilizer. Crank that shit up so your lines are smooth even when drawing with your arm (drawing with the arm can sometimes cause wobbles). Use this to a second pass on your drawings since stabilizer can mess up the flow of sketching.<br>4. Too much pressure sensitivity on a brush can be a noob trap. Try using stiffer brush sensitivity until you&#039;ve gotten control of that.<br>5. Practice re-inking manga (tracing but you&#039;re going for a high level of reproduction). Have a window open of the reference to refer to as well. Doing 3-4 of these with a high level of precision will teach you a lot.<br>6. Hopefully you have a medium-sized tablet; the small models are a bit cramped.<br>7. If you have a wacom model, go for the flex nibs. They&#039;re softer and so have a superior feel over the hard plastic nibs.<br>8. Have patience with yourself, there&#039;s a lot that goes into linework.

I though it was great, main thing I dislike is the dialogue. You should change the font, have speech bubbles, and also just go over everything to remove unnecessary lines, and edit forced lines. I&#039;m also working on a comic, and it&#039;s definitely a challenge to make dialogue seem natural and not cringe-inducing. Try and act out the interaction in your head, and ask yourself if it would be like that in a real life interaction. Also keep in the mind that the character&#039;s personality plays a role in each interaction (If you haven&#039;t done this already, you should write down a document for yourself that includes your character&#039;s personality, motivations, fears, etc..) And another thing to keep in mind is that not everything has to be vocalized. <br><br>I found it weird how this main character knows English well when she was abandoned as a little kid, I think she should be more mute (Or maybe you could make her dialogue have a purposefully limited choice of words.)

You also need to have better understanding of your own software since this method relies 90% on it.

PC-98 games typically run at 640x400 resolution with 16 colors (although in practice there are often only 15 colors because one is indexed as transparent). There are actually rules as to which color values can be used, but there&#039;s no need to be so hardcore because the color choices are *practically* unlimited and nobody would be able to tell whether or not your colors would truly be possible on a PC-98 without analyzing the RGB values for each one.<br>There isn&#039;t one way these images were made. some artists sketched line art on paper, scanned, touched up and colored in a paint app. Some drew their lines directly in the paint app. What&#039;s needed from the paint app is:<br>1. Indexed painting mode, which assigns each pixel in your image to an index of your palette. If you change the color at that index, all the pixels in the image assigned to that index also change color.<br>2. Dithering tools. At a bare minimum, you need the ability to paint and fill using different patterns. Usually the standard dithering patterns are included but you can also create your own (helpful for doing textures, etc.). Some apps let you create custom gradients from your palette and automatically have dithering applied between each color.<br>Probably the two best Windows apps for doing this type of art are ProMotion and GrafX2. ProMotion is sort of the pixel art equivalent of Photoshop, as in being feature-rich and &quot;industry standard&quot; among serious pixel artists. It has everything you need, but can be overwhelming to use because of all the stuff you might not need. GrafX2 is simple and lightweight (and FREE) but its interface is a holdover from the 1990s and lacks some of the quality-of-life features people nowadays are used to having in their software. Both of these programs are based on Deluxe Paint 2, a very different paradigm from Photoshop that will take some getting used to if that&#039;s your frame of reference.", "time": 1672164710, "resto": 6437747}, {"no": 6441224, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)13:14:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6441221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6441221</a><br>You could also use Aseprite, which is easier for those familiar with Photoshop.

I\u2019d say they are pretty hard to learn. Micron being the easiest. Ink and brush being the hardest. The consistency of the ink and the type of paper make a huge difference in what is achievable with dip pen.<br><br>Some general tips<br>- clean your nib between each dip<br>- try lots of different papers, cheap paper can tear and bleed so doing detailed work is hard. Water color paper can be too textured so doing detailed work is hard<br>- change your nib often especially if you arent using the zebra gold nibs or if you are about to use an old nib that you havent used in over a month.<br>- add water to your ink if its too thick, let your ink air out for a few days if it is too thin. Thick ink pools on the nib and it \u2018whiffs\u2019 and no lines are made. Thin ink bleeds on the paper. <br>- dirty nibs wont draw and the ink pools on the nib and wont run. Clean with soapy water and / or use a lighter to burn off the oils. Don\u2019t touch the nib with your fingers, use pliers.<br>- if you are right handed work from left to right and top to bottom to avoid smearing<br>- use a shot glass or something for the ink to avoid contamination<br>- get a feel for the direction you can draw in. nibs dont like moving side to side or making up strokes like you can with a micron or brush.

Blind leading the blind!<br>Perspective (linear perspective, to be precise) is a set of rules that govern the drawing of a subject *from a single point of view.* One of the characteristics of perspective is that parallel lines which recede from the viewer appear to converge toward a vanishing point; put another way, any object, or the distance between any two points, will appear smaller the farther away it is from the viewer.<br>People often misuse the word perspective, as in &quot;isometric perspective.&quot; This is like saying &quot;square circle.&quot; Isometric projection is a type of orthographic drawing. In orthographic drawing, there is no size diminution as objects recede in space. But there may still be foreshortening, because foreshortening and perspective are not the same! Foreshortening is simply the effect of viewing a particular plane or surface in such an aspect that it does not appear at its full length or width, i.e. it is turned away from the picture plane. When you see a human face from the front, the sides of the head are foreshortened.<br>In picrel (hexagonal prism in isometric projection, grabbed from YouTube), distances UP and SR are equal, which would not be the case in a perspective drawing because SR is further back in space. But the face TU is clearly foreshortened.<br>If you were to draw a subject as seen from a theoretically infinite distance, there would be no trace of perspective, but there would still be foreshortening. The size distortion of perspective is greater the closer you get to the subject. Look at a very distant cityscape, versus a view of the buildings from within the city.

AI is definitely a wakeup call but certainly not the death of the artist. It has its place and use as a tool of convenience.<br><br>I think we&#039;ll have to adapt in much the same way that AI does. Specifically, by rejecting digital mediums for the physical, relearning traditional techniques, and developing a unique style after figuring out some fundies. Many art communities online are having absolute meltdowns because they can&#039;t tell the difference between an AI piece and an original work even though the funny shit is the vast majority of people online are using digital and tablets. There&#039;s a very simple workaround for this: make your art physically. Sure some pajeet can make a robot that can emulate skill, but no pajeet will replace the human soul. Trads don&#039;t have to give a shit, just post timestamp.<br><br>Personally, digital artwork lacks a lot of appeal in the first place. Not to say it isn&#039;t or can&#039;t be good, I just think it&#039;s missing something fundamental to the human soul that goes into it. The mistakes are too easily corrected, the physicality of touching paper, oils, color, spilling shit and just getting weird with it are gone. Spill coffee on your computer and you could lose a keyboard, spill coffee on a canvas and it can be inspiring. AI gives me the feeling people are seeing with their eyes whether or not a piece has appeal, and not their heart. Some of the dumbest shit speaks to me even if it&#039;s not some high ideal, but so far, AI hasn&#039;t. It simply doesn&#039;t have a human soul to connect with.<br><br>I&#039;m predicting a renaissance of physical, traditional, and certainly original art soon as a natural counter to AI and looking forward to it. We&#039;ll end up with a lot of weird growing pains but I truly think it&#039;ll pay off. Once you can show something was made with your own hands, there can be no further doubt to authenticity.

I can&#039;t imagine doing that crap and I&#039;ve been drawing for years. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll help but I&#039;ll lend you some of my advice. Pick your favorite artist you want to draw like and start copying their stuff. Not serious 1:1 studies, just make some shitty doodles with whatever looks cool to you. In my case I just copied Akira panels because I always loved it. I must&#039;ve copied half the series at some point. After a while I began to understand how Otomo drew figures. I didn&#039;t realize then that I was basically just doing figure studies, just not with irl people. Some time later I got confident enough to learn from other artists I admired and got better at copying, then I actually went over the fundies books that everyone pushes on prebegs. I felt like I learned in reverse but there is no wrong way to learning as long as you&#039;re making progress. Another piece of advice is to grow some skin and learn to take and LISTEN to advice from your superiors and apply it. Don&#039;t assume you know better when someone tells you this shading is inconsistent or this fold doesn&#039;t make sense etc. <br><br>Point is, while art is practice and hard work, it doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t have fun.

This was to see if I could get close to the original. It was drawn in 1600x2000 then cropped down mainly with the brush size between 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 depending on what the line thickness is. It&#039;s not a good brush for a single line drawing. Instead, you&#039;ll have to draw over your lines multiple times to get it to be thick. Keep it light and fast for the &quot;skippy&quot; thin lines.

Well, the reason I ask is because it&#039;s weird that you don&#039;t know how to answer my question about the armpit. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s 4 lines or not, you can represent forms with few lines. As for &quot;what I&#039;m trying to achieve&quot; it should be pretty obvious - representing the coracobrachialis, axillary fossa, deltoids, teres major, and latissimus in a pleasing and somewhat accurate way. That&#039;s what I&#039;m asking about. You bring up reference - the armpit is in shadow in the reference so it&#039;s largely invented, and anyway if it was that obvious in the reference I wouldn&#039;t really need to ask, I could just copy what I see. Calling something &quot;low effort&quot; because it&#039;s a block in is pretty weird, if I posted a fully rendered piece that had issues at the fundamental stage people would just shit on me that I polished a turd. That&#039;s WHY you ask for feedback in the early stages. If you know what you&#039;re talking about, show me your work and I&#039;ll eat my words but I hope you at least understand why I&#039;m skeptical of this response. Not even trying to be a dick.

I think the other anon just correctly saw that your 3-dimensional understanding of the forms in the figure was lacking. So definitely take the advice given to you about breaking the figure into forms, practice your boxes etc. But, as far as I can see, doing studies faithfully reproducing the shapes you see on the figure will do you no harm. <br>Rather, symbol drawing is the subconscious refusal to draw the figure as you actually see it. And that\u2019s something that\u2019ll haunt you well outside of being a beg.

I find I draw to cope with the fact I find life never measures up to my expectations of what is &quot;interesting.&quot; I have traveled, seen cultures, made friends but easily I lose interest in all these things afterwards. It&#039;s fun to learn about someone for the first few days, but afterwards I get bored once I already learn what makes people tick and I use this in my own stories. I know it&#039;s sociopathic and narcissistic so I&#039;ve stopped making friends knowing I discard pretty much everyone I meet and it probably hurts them so I don&#039;t want to do that anymore to people. Fiction makes life and people more interesting than it really is. The only people I would find interesting are the 1% of people, but even then I can&#039;t be friends with interesting people as I only see socializing as a way to gain something out of it for my stories. When I start to really get to know someone I start to think I&#039;m wasting my time and my life is unfulfilled, it only feels fulfilled when I write my stories. Fiction lets me cope with my boredom as I can create the most fantastical worlds and build off of pre-existing cultures, concepts, history, philosophy, legends, and make them more intriguing in my eyes. It&#039;s like an endless playground for me. I think it&#039;s because the real world is not romantic enough for me, I like stories of epic battles, glory, strange things, and the exotic. The real world is very interesting in that it is spiritual and mystical with strange tales to tell, but real people are not interesting. I build off what I find interesting in the real world, and make it even more fascinating or perfect in my eyes. If I don&#039;t write about my OCs I feel like I&#039;m going to die while being around friends or makes me feel more unfulfilled.

If price is a big factor any medium works well with a limited palette of 6 or more colors. There are many ways to make a certain medium more expensive and cheap, which is why I would also consider oil. For example, oil paint covers huge areas easily with very little paint and there are inexpensive oil painting papers to paint on. Another example is if you compare gouache and watercolor, the gouache paint is a little bit more expensive, because you will finish it faster, but on the other hand, you don&#039;t need good paper for gouache. All of them have their difficulties and advantages, but if I would recommend an all rounder that&#039;s forgiving I would suggest oil even though it&#039;s not in your list. If this is not an option for you, I would choose gouache over acrylic, because it&#039;s forgiving in brush quality and maintanence and it&#039;s better for sketching and making smaller pieces. The emulsion is not as strong as with acrylic, which makes it easier to handle the paint on the brush and canvas. Go for watercolor only if you love watercolor or you going to have a bad time. Watercolor is an outlier and has some specific qualities that you only should put up with if you really want to go for the watercolor look and feel. I agree that it&#039;s inexpensive to get into though, but it benefits from higher quality paper. So all in all, I would suggest gouache if you don&#039;t want to consider oil, but personally I don&#039;t like the Himi gouache, it has a strange consistency and it has too many colors. Consider a high quality brand like W&amp;N, Holbein, Schmincke, Graham, but getting a small limited palette of 5-7 colors plus a big tube of white. Get those air tight wet palettes that everyone uses for gouache nowadays (I use them too, they are great) and you are good to go with a couple of synthetic taklon brushes.

It&#039;s shit that everyone has seen a million times before and the reason that it doesn&#039;t pull any attention outside of druggie circles is that there&#039;s really nothing deep or innovative about it after the first time around. The thing that a lot of cookie-cutter &quot;creative&quot; types fail to understand is that you can&#039;t achieve depth only from dwelling at length on an emotion or a sentiment or a surface-level notion of what is &quot;significant&quot;; nor from focusing exclusively on the craft of conveyance without developing a critical eye for what is worthy to be conveyed. You need quality and breadth of learning and experience in order to develop the discernment to know which topics are genuinely avant-garde and which are rightfully beneath the contempt of even the most glassy-eyed bydlo. It&#039;s a simple matter of combinatorial complexity\u2014no matter how strongly you may feel about something or how adroitly you may symbolise it, a single word, image, or concept encodes very little information (therefore value) on its own. Complexity, nuance, comes from the multiplicity and multifarity of its associations with other words, images, and concepts; and especially from the wealth of accumulated such associations to be found within the collective human oeuvre.<br><br>Drugs are not a shortcut because all they fundamentally do is permute what is already in your brain in slightly novel ways, whilst amplifying the emotional significance of them entirely out of proportion with their actual merit. If you had nothing of worth in there before, then that is also what you will have afterwards; except you will be falsely and intensely convinced of otherwise.
