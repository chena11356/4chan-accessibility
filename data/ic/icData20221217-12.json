By significant errors, I mean the following. Perspective: the hat seems to be intended to be circular and viewed from below, and if that is the case, we should see most of the underside, but instead we see most of the top. Anatomy: the left and right hands have different finger widths and the right hand could not grip the pole properly in this position. Also there is no shape to the ankles, and a very long torso and upper legs compared to short lower legs. Line work: the line work is all of the same width and is concentrated in areas of higher detail, making them appear darker even when they are not in shadow. Hatching direction is inconsistent without any obvious reason to change directions in different areas. Rendering: the light seems to be coming from the left according to the fence and the clouds, but the grass casts shadows in the opposite direction - unless those are ripples, which is unclear. Some portions of the character are shaded, while the hands, face, and underside of the hat are not shaded. The transition from light to dark is abrupt in all areas without any form of feathering. <br><br>That said, the composition is nice and I like the way that the fishing rod and line bounces the eye back and forth.

I would imagine many or most of you could draw something better looking than this, so I hope this pushes you towards doing it yourselves. Got some notes of my own, but I&#039;d like other comments.<br><br>So starting off, I wanted to rectify one of my issues, in which it wasn&#039;t really clear where the characters were. Since that was clear, I wanted to immediately establish the Haunted House. I originally tried to draw the whole thing, but that took up too much space to even try to make it readable, so I cut out everything except the top, I think this was a fine decision. The first issue was the door. I was gonna have the door peeping open, then show the inside of the haunted house, cutting to the characters on the 2nd page. I realized that&#039;d leave me with barely any time for the &#039;plot&#039;, so I kept the door, and had the scaring faces.<br><br>As I was drawing the 2nd page, it felt obvious to me that I should have scrapped the door, to give more space for the scaring, to show more of the ones being scared, cause cutting straight to the scared faces on the 2nd page seems kind of abrupt, the build-up didn&#039;t seem enough for it as it stands.<br><br>If that was fixed, I think the top two panels of the 2nd page would be serviceable. As for the third panel on the 2nd page, I originally had all three of the scarers on the same page, to re-establish the fact that there were three of them. But I realized that with the current plan, I would have had almost a repeat looking structure. The vampire girl would have asked the last question in this panel, by the way.<br><br> I ended up changing the last panel as well. It was originally two, where the pumpkin head was going to ask who the girl was talking to, and it would cut to a similar looking panel as the current last, just a bit more squeezed. Speaking of that last panel, my lack of ability in perspective showed itself, I feel the idea (that the ghost disappeared) wasn&#039;t portrayed well.", "filename": "Comic7_005", "ext": ".png", "w": 1155, "h": 746, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1670297120893740, "time": 1670297120, "md5": "If4E5CZprTuTDf9fLg42kA==", "fsize": 543394, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404383, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:26:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403991</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://medibang.com/mpc/</span><br>is he the only consistent creator on manga dex ?<br><br>I mean pumping out 40 pages is pretty fucking impressive .", "time": 1670297201, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404390, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:33:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404383</a><br>fuck , forgot picrel", "filename": "Consistent", "ext": ".png", "w": 654, "h": 448, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1670297621886711, "time": 1670297621, "md5": "SQi2r9DKIKM4db7EZmEBMA==", "fsize": 306282, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404395, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:38:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404174</a><br>Aside from a convention, is there any more formal way to go about it? It might not apply here, but in the manga Bakuman, which was a relatively faithful portrayal of the manga industry (at least at the time), you would go into the offices of Jump and set up a meeting with an editor. The editor would review your &#039;name&#039; (rough draft), and either reject it or give you feedback to improve it and keep working with you, then have it published as a one-shot in a sub-magazine. it&#039;d get picked up into the main magazine from there based on its popularity with readers.

The guy on the rights elbow should be slightly further back (like he&#039;s really PULLING left towards him) and with that same pulling motion the angle on his elbow should be closer together and the fist would be quite higher (the elbow going from 90 degree to around 45?). Also humans are really heavy so right would probably be leaning towards left at a stronger more dominant angle, which would make the scene more uncomfortable/tense having their faces closer. With that in mind I&#039;d change lefts posture too, to make them pulling away from right, with an arch in the back. With the stronger more dynamic pose, lefts t shirt would be getting pulled further up the back on the neck with more stretch and tension in the material. But if you are happy with the current pose, the only other suggestion I have is for the clothes. On the bottom image the clothes look quite flat to the character silhouette, especially rights t shirt where it joins the pants.

The way to avoid it is to add some kind of blur affect after. In print a &quot;blur&quot; naturally occurs during the printing process, where the ink bleeds on the page very slightly. There&#039;s no direct equivalent to this in digital since digital ink doesn&#039;t bleed, but you can minimize the effect by applying a blur before you export. Also export settings affect moire, make sure you&#039;re not exporting the page too large.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve seen some works with screentones that it doesn&#039;t happen at all tho</span><br>Plenty of hi-res digital releases have moire out the ass.

In all it took me probably around 2 hours to finish it completely.

I would be very surprised if we don&#039;t reach AGI by 2030 since the road to it is incredibly clear and anything stopping people from taking it is purely money, but each day that passes the cost goes down and things get easier.", "time": 1671260491, "resto": 6423117}, {"no": 6423671, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:02:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6423664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6423664</a><br>Yes.", "filename": "3021907579", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671260527529835, "time": 1671260527, "md5": "EIrQDzQ8PoKXtwXdUNGkhA==", "fsize": 1325427, "resto": 6423117}, {"no": 6423672, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:02:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6423670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6423670</a><br>So anyway, your bleak simple view, every little thing gets automated, everyone out of a job, boo hoo, you starve.<br>More realistic is that capitalism as we know it won&#039;t survive and you are partially into some fully automated luxury gay space communism (in fiction imagined as something like &quot;The Culture&quot; series) sort of situation.

When you get AGI (let&#039;s say in 3 to 6 years from now), what happens is a lot more. It can automate science and technology, it can think much faster than you, can parallelize insanely much. You get to crack technologies that are possible physically, but which would take us too long to do, like molecular nanotechnology (atomically precise manufacturing/APM), and other things. If you end up being able to cooperate with said AGIs, from that tech it&#039;s not much further for instant mass production of as much compute as you&#039;d want and of course easily digitizing anything you&#039;d want and simulating it, so you will get mind uploads, meaning you do get a lot of speedup from running on a faster substrate than biology, but still probably an order or more of magnitude slower than AGI due to various biological simulation overheads. At that point with the ability to control matter &quot;directly&quot; with said APM is at your fingertips and you get to live forever and do whatever you want, the universe is yours!

AI bros use copyrighted pictures all the time without any shame. The reason that music gets pass is because there is less amount of frequencies in a song then there is pixels in picture. And there is way less desirable combinations of sound then there is combinations of shapes and colors. Most human music follows few sets of tempos that align with our biological mechanisms like breathing or heartrate. Instruments can only do so many sounds, and the same is for electro dubstep. If you let AI loose on music, it would start creating almost the exact copies of songs that listener would not be able to tell apart when listening to them for comparison. With Ai pictures and videos you cant say the same. Ask Ai to generate some public domain painting like the Starry Night from Vincent. It will give you blurry meshes that have incorrect number of clouds, some stars different and so on. Now if you listen to the music, it will become way way harder to notice, especially when the Ai is trained on certain human tempo that funnels certain sounds into their specific holes. If you looked at the diagram of the sound, you could easily see the differences, but when hearing it, not so much.

Then, after &quot;&quot;&quot;da grind&quot;&quot;&quot; their artwork receives a buff.<br>Honestly, the two things I haven&#039;t broken down to it&#039;s core is appealing and balanced coloring and composition, and curiously enough, I don&#039;t even have to go too deep into the later because is not a precise matter, just balance the elements, try to make sense of the spacing, whatever, get a vague sense for the feeling you want to portray. The former though, if you want some nice tones you got to do your optics homework, as basic as it is for art. I&#039;ll play guilty and say that I put more effort into the values rather than the tones, not having a precise palette has affected my quality and that&#039;s because I don&#039;t sit down and place core tones in the digital canvas to grab from.<br><br><a href=\"#p6422831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6422831</a><br>Believe me anon, I know how a stemlord&#039;s brain operates, and mine isn&#039;t one of them.

What I mean seriously take off is most studios kicking out all all of the art team and 60+% of commercial artist jobs being lost. We are nowhere near that, but I can assure you that we will get there after prompting becomes easier to the point of you needing to just write perfect description of the scene and the AI perfectly placing each object there, and easily allowing you to change that with drag and drop features.

The picture might look soulful in any way you could compare with other pictures, but once you namedrop the AI, it will quickly lose the interest of certain chunk of the demographic. When AI becomes widely accessible to everyone of no skill level, and it gets revealed that most artists are in fact just AIs that dont tag their images as AI generated, people will quickly hop on the train, every normie will become artist, and then the fad will go away and people will be no longer interested in it, but they will also lose interest with real art as well, since why even bother caring about something that every idiot with internet connection can do in 5 seconds.

Most of online success is marketing.<br>Which is funny because the majority of these AI images struggle to gain more than 20 likes, where as even an artist with terrible self promotion and worse art skills can get more likes on average.<br><a href=\"#p6415324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6415324</a><br>Being an attention whore is not inherently wrong, but it&#039;s pointless. I think people are just flabbergasted that that would be an actual motivation for you, because at least with art attention whores, taking away the attention part they still draw because they&#039;re honing their skills and are proud of the fact they are able to capture a vision they had in their head by working hard and learning how to translate that accurately to paper. The same is not true here, there is no grind, nothing crafted that&#039;s actually intrinsically and unmistakably your own creation that could only be made by you. It&#039;s a weird motivation to waste your own time like this, to larp as someone who can make something like this solely for the praise/attention part and absolutely none of the gratification aspect. It&#039;d be less hassle to be a camwhore or something.", "time": 1671152066, "resto": 6414728}, {"no": 6420275, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:01:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Imagine being a cuck for AI art, lmao.

Of course there&#039;s people who are a lot more serious about anime and manga but overall it&#039;s just treated as entertainment so you should be making proper comparisons to similar western media.", "time": 1670824309, "resto": 6410024}, {"no": 6412044, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)01:17:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411976</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CSM baby thinks it&#039;s seinen</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t even understand his own manga not even the subtext</span><br>You can go to bed now", "filename": "6sgzmw6ho43a1", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1670825873754564, "time": 1670825873, "md5": "dxN0HBriwfePJjiMpDalJg==", "fsize": 742309, "resto": 6410024}, {"no": 6412134, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)02:24:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6410024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6410024</a><br>By firing everyone in management, half of the people in marketing, and everyone that can&#039;t animate a convincing walk for 3+ characters, on-model.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

There&#039;s something to be said for people who go out of their way to draw ugly things, it makes this point to capture realism at the cost of appeal. I kind of like it in theory. I always got the feeling it caused such a knee-jerk reaction from people because of the rise of social justice at the time, people were tired of hearing how much of oppressors they were just for having preferences and beauty standards so the artstyle was only pouring salt into the wound.

I would rather have my stuff appreciated by a small group of people that actually give a shit about what I create, rather than being fawned over by a bunch of randoms that see my art<br>as something they are entitled to feed to their AIs so they can copy it and earn clout.<br>Just do whatever makes you happy and fuck those social media niggers.", "time": 1671079778, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418387, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:52:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6414342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6414342</a><br>because your prompts probably suck", "time": 1671079925, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418398, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:57:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6418387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6418387</a><br>New midjourney doesn&#039;t need complex prompts, the og proompters whine that it&#039;s too easy compared to the &quot;good old days&quot;", "time": 1671080258, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418460, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)00:32:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6418398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6418398</a><br>Like pottery, it chimes", "time": 1671082371, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418464, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)00:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "is this the thread?", "filename": "00103", "ext": ".png", "w": 1792, "h": 2304, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671082496216253, "time": 1671082496, "md5": "sC/U/di+Z97iGPn83NgBHw==", "fsize": 3174120, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418467, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)00:37:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6414976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6414976</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;toilet in a museum bullshit commentary is rejected by most</span><br>I didn&#039;t know art was conducted as a democracy<br>lmao<br>duchamp even made cover boy<br>lmao", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 300, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671082632222941, "time": 1671082632, "md5": "rYvsgcAj9Gok5emOP/ujPA==", "fsize": 180933, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418473, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)00:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6416481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6416481</a><br><a href=\"#p6416476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6416476</a><br><a href=\"#p6416498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6416498</a><br>lol", "filename": "crabs-bucket", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671082797867782, "time": 1671082797, "md5": "TEYn/AJhfWHgbY5uAQ74FQ==", "fsize": 542263, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418475, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)00:40:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6414342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6414342</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;midjourney</span><br>imagine paying to make soulless machine shit", "time": 1671082858, "resto": 6414342}, {"no": 6418478, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)00:46:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6418379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6418379</a><br>The good old days are over.

That pursuit of self mastery, and the satisfaction of having created something with your own hands and mind, is exactly what gives the artist pleasure, and it&#039;s exactly what the industry encourages and rewards. Now you&#039;re saying, forget all the reasons you became an artist in the first place, become a code monkey like me, and Master a &quot;skill&quot; that takes an afternoon of tinkering to get good at, rather than a lifetime of dedication. The entire process of making AI &quot;art&quot; is completely at odds with what making actual art is like, and where artists find their inspiration. Your posting of pretty pictures wouldn&#039;t exist in the first place if you didn&#039;t have thousands of people who devoted their lives toward that aesthetic pursuit. Something an AI cannot do, at all. Because an AI cannot actually think for itself. The artist knows they didn&#039;t make that. That&#039;s why they&#039;re not satisfied with it. And despite your efforts to legitimize yourself with the title of &quot;prompter&quot; you didn&#039;t make it either. The machine did. But in order to validate the machine as a creative entity, you must first prove that the machine can think for itself.
