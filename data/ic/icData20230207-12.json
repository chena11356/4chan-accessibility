It carries over to efforts to drae from imagination as well - the man who can copy Bridgman with 80% accuracy by way of quickly executed sketches will complete the study in a few days with fewer barriers between his observation and understanding, while the guy who has to carefully plan, observe, and measure in order to reach maybe 60% accuracy might take many weeks, if he ever finishes at all, and at some point the intent becomes lost as he resorts to brute-force copying, the images he&#039;s observing becoming the observational equivalent of hearing a word repeated too many times - images without meaning. The first guy is left with a clearer, better memory of the whole of what he copied and can therefore better carry it over to his own work, while the second guy is left with a pile of drawings that were ultimately an effort of labored copying as opposed to actual learning.", "time": 1674925696, "resto": 6490932}, {"no": 6494247, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:11:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6494240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6494240</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no adjusting until it looks right</span><br>I&#039;m very guilty of this<br>Especially eyelashes are my ultimate sin, as I can get extremely autistic with them.", "time": 1674925917, "resto": 6490932}, {"no": 6494250, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6494240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6494240</a><br>I&#039;ll add that I think this ability is where talent lies.

Look at Proko, the guy can make some great stuff when engaged in careful observational work, but when it came to applying his knowledge through creative drawing and cartooning, he immediately struggled (though I think he&#039;s since worked on this).

Instead of knowing how to take away from the paint and be decisive with my actions, I kept adding more over my mistakes up only to end up with my layers, texture, surface, and brushstrokes all fucked up so I had to use my thinner to wipe layers of wasted paint and repaint over after destroying all the preexisting paint.

I would have said you&#039;re comfortably int due to the mans grasping hand stylization, but as I look at it more I realize a few things. The truth is, the stylization disrupts certain things but what makes it obvious for me is the clothing.

I understand the shading style you are going for, but just understand it&#039;s a hard shading style to get right. A few lines shy and the image feels flat. Looking at your anatomy, it doesn&#039;t exactly off, just more stiff than anything else. Especially around the upper chest to neck region, which might be where your anatomy falls a bit short of everything else. At first I thought her left arm was shorter than the right, but I realized it&#039;s just slightly further back than the rest. The reason why it feels this way though is your choice of shading. Line shading can look super cool but remember you&#039;re telling a story with the lines, they wrap around their forms. One of the only bits of advice from a Proko video I actually thought was decent was him explaining poses, and when to exaggerate. Tuck her arm back a bit more, have her lean more heavily on that sword. Arch hee back a bit, twist her hips. Even if it&#039;s subtle, it goes a long way. Your job as an artist is to convey a story without saying a word. I don&#039;t expect you to change her now at this stage in your drawing, but just try to keep it in mind when you start your next piece.<br><a href=\"#p6508096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6508096</a><br>You&#039;re welcome!

And because most of their work is often going to include skin tight clothes or none at all, their well rendered drawings make for pretty good references. Not to suggest I wouldn&#039;t use the more reliable IRL references, but fictional art sparks a lot more inspiration out of me and it&#039;s much more appealing to stare at than real porn imo. Violent scenarios are also easier for me to look at if fictionally depicted.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think coom art will be like in the next 5 years?</span><br>I&#039;m going to bet on the regression bit as <a href=\"#p6508005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6508005</a> suggested, or at least hope so.

No interest in consooming or creating loli shit whatsoever, however seeing as it can be considered as legally questionable as actual children being abused and the filmed distribution of such, I wouldn&#039;t put past the possibility anon stated.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What are your coom art goals?</span><br>Well, I want to attract a decently sized audience of whom I&#039;m looking for, without much pandering. Sticking to creating vanilla fanart is good enough for me. I also want to try animation once I get the hang of it.

I mainly make profits from selling my books and original page art at art shows and comic and anime conventions. I fund my print runs with crowdfunding campaigns, and then sell the books for pure profit at shows. My evergreen bestseller is Purrvana, a colorful watercolor painted psychedelic cat graphic novel that appeals to normies of all ages and all demographics from bikers to gangsters to grannies to crazy cat ladies. I have sold over 2,500 copies of Purrvana to date. I also make money from commissions, both my OCs and other people. Most of my commissions are catfight wrestling matches featuring my OCs or other people&#039;s OCs. I advertise mainly on pixiv, discord, twitter and my webcomic also works as an advertisement. I also drew animal coloring books years ago that still sell, at shows and online. After a bad experience working with a publisher several years ago, I began self publishing and now that&#039;s all I want to do.<br><br>I read that Image creators are in the red and go in to debt with Image unless their book sells a certain amount of copies. I recently read tweets from an image artist who says that after his book he worked on sold 5 issues at 15,000 issues each, he only made $1100 in profit and he got paid months after the final issue came out, after the profit share was split with image, the writer and colorist. I don&#039;t sell a high volume of copies, and my crowdfunders don&#039;t go crazy, but I still make a lot more profit than that Image artist whose book was selling 15,000 copies each issue for example because I keep all the profit of sales for myself. I also do freelance work. Advertising and marketing is not really something I&#039;m good at, but I&#039;m getting by and trying to improve at it. I&#039;m also going to start a life drawing class at my local Junior College next week and I hope it will up my skills so I can charge more for commissions, and it will also improve my comic pages.

It&#039;s a 15.6 inch screen drawing tablet.<br>I have been very fortunate that it doesn&#039;t seem to have any hardware issues (some scary reviews out there lmao) so far, but holy sweet mother does its software suck. <br>Coming from an ancient wacoom bamboo from like 2012 I just cannot believe how bad the software is. In general I am extremely grateful that the tablet was so cheap because I was that guy who thought that a screen less one would be just as good but let me tell you now that I&#039;ve seen the light I can never go back. <br>The problem is that the D16&#039;s drivers are being held together with duct tape and cum and it just barely works even having lots of strange issues like I can&#039;t use the two side buttons on the pen because pressing one even for a second will remap the stylus to half way between my main monitor and the d16 display which I sometimes can&#039;t even fix upon several restarts of the computer. Loads of little headaches and setting it up for left handed use was hell. <br><br>Basically I never want another Chinese tablet again. I&#039;m still running windows 10 and the driver to this tablet hasn&#039;t been updated since 2018 so I am mentally preparing myself for this tablet to just stop working when I&#039;m forced to upgrade to win11 probly within the next year. <br>I dont use pen tilt and I&#039;ve found that 15.6 inches I about all the space I have on my tiny desk and so far I haven&#039;t found that I wished the tablet was bigger (only that it worked better).<br>I have no idea about any of this tech stuff but all I want is a functional tablet with good software and support. I dont use pen tilt or even need buttons on the tablet (I have a keyboard). Because if this I&#039;m heavily leaning to a less feature packed Wacom. I really don&#039;t want to buy used.

The hikki kid was really talented and displayed strong technique early on, but their work tended toward life drawings and environments - pictures without people in them. On the other hand, Fuji&#039;s stand-in, while not as skilled, displayed a strong affinity and aptitude for crafting narratives; they were always looking for some way to tell a story through drawings. <br><br>Their reasons for taking up drawing are also believable, and, to a certain extent, relatable. The hikki girl draws all day every day because it&#039;s a viable form of escapism and there&#039;s not much else to do; Fuji&#039;s stand-in (I think, can&#039;t remember) does so partly because of the praise it earns her from peers. <br><br>In terms of which character /ic/ embodies best, I think the board leans slightly toward the former due to the lingering influence of the concept art era. It should be noted that quite a few people here see art as a means by which to secure a livelihood, usually through the patronage of a dedicated fanbase; this entails a focus on producing art that is very accessible, usually pin-ups and the like. I won&#039;t go so far as to say that an (erotically charged) illustration of a character against a simple background is entirely lacking in narrative, but a emotional response is certainly the foremost prerogative, whether it be in the form of a libidinal response or an appeal to the viewer&#039;s particular tastes.", "filename": "Look Back - c001 - p006 [dig] [VIZ Media]", "ext": ".png", "w": 784, "h": 1145, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675736085294854, "time": 1675736085, "md5": "9OY6hAxdK+YCzWfDGmA+JQ==", "fsize": 423520, "resto": 6509133}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 6509098, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)18:38:31", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Imagination", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Always thought I had good imagination</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Could lose myself daydreaming</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Think that the aphantasiafags are coping retards or whatever.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Come upon this </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Its exactly how I imagine things unless I am going balls deep in a daydream</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is aphantasia.</span><br>Is it over?", "filename": "FoE8tpzWIAIg9wW", "ext": ".gif", "w": 480, "h": 480, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675726711308413, "time": 1675726711, "md5": "cpBB4s17lBnBrbPalb/rLQ==", "fsize": 68078, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "imagination", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 6509195, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)19:52:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Aphantasia is supposed to be a rare condition.

Therefore, to say that pornography is the highest form of pure visual art is a narrow and misguided perspective that fails to fully appreciate the depth and breadth of what art can accomplish.", "filename": "1655511719421", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 717, "h": 1017, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675207157645333, "time": 1675207157, "md5": "8yDk46Xvo71xOb+/TUG0cg==", "fsize": 273105, "resto": 6493174}, {"no": 6499044, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)18:24:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6493174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6493174</a><br>how do people come up with simple drawings like this which have erotic gesture?

Stone masons, carpenters, sculptors, gilders, and of course painters who were expected to be able to do everything from picture like portraits to fresco murals. This would depend on the specialties of the studio, just like an architecture firm today, but the idea of a solitary craft person in their studio is a modern concept. The apprentice would learn to do the basics to assist everyone and be guided by their aptitudes. At the time all of these crafts used things like rabbit skin glue, gypsum, linseed oil, charcoal, and all kinds of pigments so there were a lot of transferable skills. If the student showed promise as a painter by stretching canvases, figure sketching, and all of the chemistry involved with preparing pigments and chemicals, they were then put into a common education structure. This started by learning to draw. Perspective, lighting, composition, narrative, humans, horses, buildings, etc. Once again depended on the demand of the studio. Once that was done satisfactorily, they then moved onto black and white paintings and monochromatic paintings. The goal of this stage was to achieve a lifelike tangible quality. Once that was done the student then moved onto color and all of the complications that we still face in conveying meaning with color.", "time": 1675723879, "resto": 6507824}, {"no": 6509039, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)17:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6509036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6509036</a><br>That is the basic idea.

As far as books go, I would recommend picking up a copy of davinci&#039;s notebooks if you want to go for the whole classical approach from the beginning. If you want a reference from the 19th century then the bargue plates are a must. Materials of the artist is great. The painters secret geometry is a good guide. Color and light by James Gourney is great. There are a ton of drawing books and yes loomis is just fine. Andrew Tischler on youetube is fun to watch. Paint coach has a lot of good tips. Florent Farge does great work. <br><br>The best resource is the Art Renewal Center for learning who is in this realist art traditional craft world. There aren&#039;t a ton of us but plenty of a community to learn from. Start taking a look at artists from Ateliers you like. Most of all just draw and paint.

I&#039;ve been focusing on artists like Freddie Moore, John K, and Anna Cattish. I&#039;m trying to practice a sort of &quot;classic Disney&quot; style with little hints of new stuff. Borrowing from Manga a little, but not going full weeb (they just seem to have their technique down to an exact science and it&#039;s hard to not be drawn to that).<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;ve been practicing drawing heads for a week and I feel like I&#039;ve hit a wall. I don&#039;t know what other rules or tips I need to be applying. I also don&#039;t quite know how to reconcile the Loomis method with Disney heads, Anna Cattish heads and manga style heads.

Guess niche fetish art pays because more passionate fans needing to scratch that spefic itch. Draw basic pin ups of basic anime girls and you will be lost in the sea of artists doing it. Spice it up with personal niche and you get devoted fans willing to pay you", "time": 1675378887, "resto": 6429056}, {"no": 6503148, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)21:24:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.instagram.com/navarysar<wbr>t<br>https://twitter.com/lunarbadger<br><br>I don\u2019t post as much as I should.

It happened, it was new, it overtook the entire world and it was really fucking good, or at least the artstyle. Anime is not all this generic shit that OP posted, it influenced tons of people drawing cartoonish styles and semi-realistic styles. Both normies and artists loved it and it was fucking awesome for most people. Now that it happened it is on its way out. It is becoming too generic and is overstaying its welcome. Anons saying it is too generic are right, just like how every artstyle was generic for its time period and then people got bored of it and replaced it with something now. Now we are entering the dark ages of art, if not end of it. It could be considered sort of anti-renaissance where renaissance was a rebirth of something great from dark ages, this one is something great appearing out of nowhere, being better then what was before and now we are entering the dark ages.<br><br>The new age of art, the dark and horrible age will be the AI age. Zoomers who could have made it next year or somewhere else in the future are giving up, those who made it are still riding the ride, but will soon retire, and gen alpha will never learn how to draw. It is a pessimistic and horrible future ahead, one where people who once liked art and refuse to like AI are forced to like it, because there are no artists left. Even if you try to be artist in this age, one catering to anti-AI crowd, you would still lose because nobody trusts anybody. What proof do you have that you have made that art? You dont have any, because all proof can be falsified with another AI. People will become more and more disinterested with social media and media in general as the value of media will be 0 when you can generate all of it at your finger.

People cannot mimic soul, because if human tried to mimic soul, they would either have to copy too much resulting in soullessness, or they would give it soul because their talent and meaning would translate there inside of their work, thus giving it soul. AI cannot do hard work and show its learning, it cannot give its art meaning, but it sure as hell can make it look like it does, hence why so many people got dooped by it on this site.

Everything in the world is a rhythm. Up and down. High and low. Hot and cold. Those are all the same thing but at different degrees. Before a true Renaissance there is always a dark, cold and decrepit fall of common sense and beauty, not only would it apply to art but a society itself, after having lived the greatest high you would experience the greatest low eventually. The most primal example is Life and Death. If you have lived physically, you will die. That is the ultimate cycle/rhythm for us. When this place turns into a technocracy and you have unlimited pleasure generated at your fingers. When post-apocalyptic scenarios are actually prophecies, remember that one day it will all be okay, even if you are not there anymore. Everything aligns again, art is perfect, humans are perfect. Everything sad and horrible is due to these cycles that make up everything. Why is there a rhythm? Why can&#039;t it be one thing, always good, can men always be great, wake up to a Renaissance every single day?

People look at those films more critically than others because the product insists to be examined by the way it is filmed, by the creative decisions made, by the marketing material, etc. Scale this down to an indie artist and you have the same thing. For example, If your &quot;brand&quot; is to make porn of popular characters, then no one gives a single fuck how it&#039;s made because the end result is what people want to jerk off to, not the process. Another example; if you style your work as being made be someone who is young, then that implies to the audience that the art is more impressive because it was made by someone young, even if it&#039;s not that great. Replace &#039;young&#039; with &#039;woman&#039; or &#039;disabled&#039; and you have the same effect. You can also market the process more than the actual art, showing off speedpaints or sketches along with the art. The more content you give people to examine, the more people examine it, its really that simple. For example, some of the marketing material for A24 films prominently features director interviews, behind the scenes stuff and so on.<br><br>Normies are easy to manipulate. You feed them information, then they spit that information back out but also say &quot;I&#039;m smart for making these connections,&quot; when in reality they are making a connection between 2 and 1+1. if you want people to care about your art process, make the process more prominent in your &quot;marketing&quot; and also in the stylistic choices you make in your art, like making it more painterly or making the limitations of the program you are using be more noticeable.

Obviously if I regularly get commissions my art at least has appeal, but I don&#039;t consider myself highly skilled. It&#039;s just not all about aimlessly grinding and hoping people will care that you did. I get commissions because of networking, targeting a specific niche, and because once you start getting things off the ground, you&#039;ll end up with clients who regularly come back.
