Ed, on the other hand, almost always tries to be reasonable and to play the good cop, but will sometimes use Daisy\u2019s methods if necessary. <br><br>I\u2019m hoping to get some feedback for how to make the project more interesting.

Even the most successful professionals only get a tiny bit more attention per person per drawing than a teenager who picked up the pencil yesterday and posted a stick figure.<br>Anyone else feels the same way?<br>I used to draw lots for fun, but when I think if I posted something on the internet it wouldn&#039;t captivate a single person, drawing feels meaningless. What is the point? Upload this and it&#039;s just a waste of space in someone&#039;s servers. A waste of data and of time.<br>In thousands of illustrations I have seen only a handful made me stop and look for longer than one second. This is my goal now. I&#039;ll study them to figure out what they did different and maybe I&#039;ll realize something and be able to do the same. If I can make people stop clicking and pause just to stare what I drew, I&#039;ll know I&#039;ve made it.<br>I guess this makes me an attention whore. Maybe sovl comes from drawing what you want and not from caring about what other people think. But then what if &quot;what I want&quot; is to make others feel the same way I was made feel those handful of times?", "filename": "unique_by_emberghost", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669334441621962, "time": 1669334441, "md5": "eIAjgTmRRApYWqACpH3EjA==", "fsize": 91807, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "would-you-look-at-it-for-longer-than-one-second", "replies": 38, "images": 10, "omitted_posts": 33, "omitted_images": 8, "last_replies": [{"no": 6392761, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)13:50:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6389403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6389403</a><br>nigga there&#039;s some drawings that I think about and look at multiple times.

Trad media are physical things. Mimicking simpler media like graphite, charcoal, ink, marker, and even watercolor to an extent isn&#039;t so hard, since the pigments or dyes are only applied in a relatively thin layer on the drawing surface and their interactions are fairly simple to emulate with some exceptions (which I&#039;ll get to shortly). However, when you&#039;re getting into anything that has to do with applying pigment with a bristle brush, especially paints that you can layer and apply thick globs of to the canvas, and of which its properties change when wet or dry, a 2D pixel-manipulation-based engine probably isn&#039;t going to cut it. Paint is a 3D medium, a physical fluid, and for truly accurate emulation, would most likely need to be simulated and modeled in 3D. The pigment mixing you mentioned is only a small step in that direction, and very few programs support that- to my knowledge, only Rebelle 5, MyPaint, and an obscure paint app for iOS devices (developed by the same guy responsible for the pigment mixing algorithm in MyPaint) even have this feature.", "time": 1669569185, "resto": 6392021}, {"no": 6392684, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:14:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6392682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6392682</a><br>(Cont&#039;d) Furthermore, the very hardware that we use to interface with digital art programs are flawed to begin with. Putting aside the fact that we&#039;re interacting with a flat, textureless 2D screen, our only tool for drawing and painting is a pen with a plastic nib. How can you adequately emulate a brush, laden with ink or paint, with that? You really can&#039;t.<br>Digital mimicking traditional is a niche thing. The old stamp brush paradigm ain&#039;t broke, so few people care to fix it. Most are fine with digital painting being its own flavor and don&#039;t feel the need for it to really emulate traditional. However, digital pigment mixing does seem like a very good step forward which has been received very well by all who have tried it, since it allows for intuitive on-canvas mixing that results in much more rich and vibrant colors.
