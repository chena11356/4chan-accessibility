In the meantime, the reflected foliage on the water&#039;s surface has less of this variation, but is far more blurry in the background than the foreground. Watercolour is a medium I admit I am terrible with (oils are my preferred medium) but I would suggest that if you want to make the trees in the background not blend into the middle distance you should make them less saturated, maybe use lighter washes or even lay down an EXTREMELY thin glaze of payne&#039;s grey before painting them in. Your trees in the middle distance should instead use more saturated and slightly warmer mixes of the colours used on the background. <br>Your eye picked this up for your water reflections and that made the two groups of trees look distinct as reflected in the water, but your colours were too close on the trees themselves. You also blended quite a few of the yellows from the sky into your background trees, which makes them read as bright, and we tend to read brighter things as closer.<br><br>I still really like the piece anon, I would happily send a postcard with that on it.

Today i had a revelation. While i was copying gesture / sketch from this old master called Delacroix i wondered why ALL THREE art books i have been through included such simple crude sketches from him (while he made mighty grand stuff) and put it on full page as the best piece ever (while showing way more complex and better pieces in smaller areas). And while i was copying it i realized the grand truth of gesture. When master does gesture, it floats, it moves, it uses minimum amount of strokes to tell as much as possible, it even exaggerates the object. <br><br>I am so pitiful beg in comparison all my 3050 gestures i made so far are utterly shit and broken. They arent drawings. They arent even diagrams. They are broken diagrams. The only saving grace is that the time wasnt complete waste. I wouldnt understand this without the prior grind. When i first saw Delacroix sketches in KtD or DoRSoB i only saw curious scribbles. I think i now understand why people can point out when some drawing was made by tracing photo or model. Its stiff, lifeless, a diagram.<br><br>Now all whats left is to figure out how to actually apply any of this into actual drawing process. To draw more than what i just observe. Or how to observe the reference on deeper level.

By flats, I literally mean flats. Colors. Not the dimensionality of the image. You put flats down, then come in with more with digital rendering. Yours looked like simple flat colors with no gradients or change in colors beyond what the ink provided. The image itself has perspective and does lead you to the back a bit with the road and shrinking trees, etc. <br><br>However, the linework fails you. It is rushed, even if this likely took you a long time. Take our pine trees on the left. You literally scribble left and right without even apparently taking the pen off the page. The branches also have dimensionality and arent left-right only, yet all the lines scream left-right and, while I said flats related to the colors only, this actually flattens those trees on the page when examined closely. There should be different clusters of needles depending on if the branch is coming at us, going away, angled one way or another. The lighting would reflect this and provide differing levels of black - not uniform back and forth lines. The far left tree is also broken. The very bottom goes up and then you can see the tree is off after the first wave of black scribbles - the trunk is literally not connected to the stump. A tree in background to the righ tof this has same effect, though could literally be broken and angled, but unlikely. I&#039;m not sure how you did this. Like youd have underdrawing in pencil and do the trunk and pine needles/leaves over top or at same time. the through line of the trunk should be the same and not break liek this.<br><br>Another issue is simple anatomy. Yes, trees have anatomy. Branches do not get thicker as they go up.

This branch cannot support that weight. There are minor examples of real life trees getting these large growths, but the physical sub branch isnt going to be liek double the thickness of the main branch off the trunk. The trunk that split off and goes highest on the same tree is massively thicker than it could possibly get. It is almost identical to the bottom base of the trunk where it should be thickest. The weight would topple the tree when factoring in how much higher it goes. <br><br>For leaves on this and other leaf trees, the squiggle effect is common for filling in trees, but this is way too haphazard. it reads as a mess. the line weights dont imply anything. while common to not put stems and tiny branches for this type of inking, many float in space and just look like random swirls with no leaf implied at any point. much of hte center and right side read like you just wanted this done as fast as possible after doing all the trunks. whether it took forever or not, these pieces typically take days. yes, days. if i was to draw this piece, map it out and begin inking, it owuld take me probably 10-20 hours depending on size of image and level fo detail i wanted. Thats a minimum estimate. Inking one square inch of something this intricate can take literal hours.

Different styles and ways of rendering. Even the most simplified rendering shows attention to detail in their lines. The pines arent scribbled. The leaves arent just random swirls. They have line weights and contrasts. Light isnt uniform thorughout a tree and entire piece either (yours is all from the right and never reflects how other trees or the tree itself should affect lighting). These arent meant to be do it like this either or be this good right now. Just examples for future reference and to show the difference in controlled lines that you htought about vs &#039;get it done&#039; mentality. <br><br>Also note some of these how dark it gets vs use of light. Yours is relatively uniform - black trunks, light leaves, very dark pines. Basically doing edge work. Take the first image - the black trunks in foreground really draw the eye. THe very light center line. The second image is similar - the very dark rendering of shadows dilineated from the rendering of bark. You can tell the bark is dark, but the shadows really pop. Value studies are very important when planning out ink. Ive done literal horus of inking and then realized ive overinked or the values are just fucked and had to start over. Thats before even considering bad lines or anything. Just clearly see value problems. Yours is relatively uniform blacks across. If you are intending to color, this isnt necessarily bad i guess, but for an inked piece, you wont have colors to save the values/it isnt just line art type of deal.<br><br>I recommend trying to do just a single branch or replicate a style you want - literally save it, fade it out or blue line it and print it off.
