Trad media are physical things. Mimicking simpler media like graphite, charcoal, ink, marker, and even watercolor to an extent isn&#039;t so hard, since the pigments or dyes are only applied in a relatively thin layer on the drawing surface and their interactions are fairly simple to emulate with some exceptions (which I&#039;ll get to shortly). However, when you&#039;re getting into anything that has to do with applying pigment with a bristle brush, especially paints that you can layer and apply thick globs of to the canvas, and of which its properties change when wet or dry, a 2D pixel-manipulation-based engine probably isn&#039;t going to cut it. Paint is a 3D medium, a physical fluid, and for truly accurate emulation, would most likely need to be simulated and modeled in 3D. The pigment mixing you mentioned is only a small step in that direction, and very few programs support that- to my knowledge, only Rebelle 5, MyPaint, and an obscure paint app for iOS devices (developed by the same guy responsible for the pigment mixing algorithm in MyPaint) even have this feature.", "time": 1669569185, "resto": 6392021}, {"no": 6392684, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:14:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6392682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6392682</a><br>(Cont&#039;d) Furthermore, the very hardware that we use to interface with digital art programs are flawed to begin with. Putting aside the fact that we&#039;re interacting with a flat, textureless 2D screen, our only tool for drawing and painting is a pen with a plastic nib. How can you adequately emulate a brush, laden with ink or paint, with that? You really can&#039;t.<br>Digital mimicking traditional is a niche thing. The old stamp brush paradigm ain&#039;t broke, so few people care to fix it. Most are fine with digital painting being its own flavor and don&#039;t feel the need for it to really emulate traditional. However, digital pigment mixing does seem like a very good step forward which has been received very well by all who have tried it, since it allows for intuitive on-canvas mixing that results in much more rich and vibrant colors.
