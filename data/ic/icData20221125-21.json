When you follow someone else&#039;s guidelines to the letter, you end up drawing as their 2nd set of hands, not your own.<br><br>Normie art has more &quot;soul&quot; because it&#039;s drawn for the sake of fun; they&#039;re not sitting there treating it like a science project and, in that, they&#039;re sometimes better artists than someone who&#039;s spent many years studying. You gotta learn to draw what you want and feel, not what you&#039;ve been told to want, because art is ultimately a form of expression - if you are shallow when you draw, then shallow will be all you get. Also not using references, relying solely on imagination, is the best way to get raw creative expression, because you&#039;re then presenting YOUR inner ideas about what something is and should be rather than adhering to external rules.<br><br>Here&#039;s an experiment; draw something entirely from imagination, zero references, especially no tracing or photobashing.
