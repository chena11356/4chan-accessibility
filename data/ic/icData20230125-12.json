What I think it means in reality is that if you want to do anything, you must consistently practice it. Over the last few months, I&#039;ve been learning a fighting game and besides just playing the game and getting raw experience, I&#039;ve also had to read about mechanics and practice combos. I think that&#039;s what drawing is like, and I&#039;m going to apply the same philosophy once I get my hands on a book. That is, doodle if I want, since that gets you familiar with the pencil and lines and shapes just like just playing got me familiar with my character and the game, and spend a dedicated amount of time reading and practicing the contents of the book, just like I practiced combos and mechanics I read about. When I first tried to draw, all I&#039;d ever do is study the book, but that&#039;s like if I watched videos of people doing combos and practiced those combos, but never actually played the game and applied them. Of course it&#039;s not fun sitting there grinding shit, I wouldn&#039;t have fun if all I ever did was practice combos, either.<br>Really, you spend so much time rationalizing and agonizing over the simple action of drawing, that &quot;just draw&quot; is all you need to do at the end of the day.", "time": 1674529040, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487759, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:04:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6487737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6487737</a><br>https://davidfinchart.com/where-to-<wbr>start-and-where-to-go-from-there-a-<wbr>roadmap-to-professional-quality-art<wbr>/<br>this might help", "time": 1674529487, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487761, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:07:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6487759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6487759</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get \u201cHow To Draw Comics The Marvel Way\u201d by Stan Lee and John Buscema</span><br>&#039;jak spotted", "filename": "ironman", "ext": ".png", "w": 377, "h": 201, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 66, "tim": 1674529657176546, "time": 1674529657, "md5": "E0/aSIqCVxoNLOohCaSzIg==", "fsize": 31749, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487769, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:10:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6487737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6487737</a><br>You get better at drawing by drawing. Many people here procrastinate by trying to find the perfect resource or method but in reality, the only way to get better is by actually drawing and figuring things out yourself. Teachers and books, that suit your personality and goals, can help guide you in the right direction, but all of the hard work depends on you putting pencil on paper. Most things people want to draw are quite difficult, figures, faces, animals, landscapes, cars, mechs, buildings, etc. So it&#039;s a long road ahead.<br>Ideally you would be drawing things you want to draw, that are just slightly outside your comfort zone. If it is too challenging then you may give up in frustration. If it&#039;s too easy it can be boring and unproductive.<br>Like the other Anon suggested, FZD&#039;s video is pretty good for getting ideas for what is easier and harder to draw. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLq<wbr>WX7onVmU", "time": 1674529817, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487791, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:27:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Here\u2019s your inspo, new generation of artists.<br><br>https://soundcloud.com/lx87/pastel-<wbr>ghost-dark-beach-speed-up-reverbed-<wbr>by-lx", "filename": "EB2F19E4-F082-425C-9F95-78830E3C82D4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1563, "h": 1555, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674530829971177, "time": 1674530829, "md5": "Z/cT1GSLvADmopWLcQcoUw==", "fsize": 704871, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487798, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:30:50", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "jan232023", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1079, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674531050929715, "time": 1674531050, "md5": "DK9LsrIru5ElwTQ6vsEq5Q==", "fsize": 668483, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487822, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:48:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Mid 2022 art of Saitama vs Garou.", "filename": "Saitama vs Cosmic Fear Garou6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1673, "h": 1977, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674532122591386, "time": 1674532122, "md5": "K31pwlJkgJFLOvcIl36R7Q==", "fsize": 769508, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487828, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)22:52:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6487822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6487822</a><br>Late 2022 art of my OC named Jason Skyfall.<br><br>The question I want to ask you is: Did I improve?", "filename": "Illustration40", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1700, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1674532375274973, "time": 1674532375, "md5": "JeNmNNqM1OiRZMtXljCgjw==", "fsize": 342983, "resto": 6486913}, {"no": 6487836, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)23:02:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I want to learn rendering.

It entails first drawing a simple view, then projecting parallel lines from various points on the figure at a desired angle to construct a second view. Sometimes, as in picrel, one or more intermediary steps are required to get the desired end result. Picrel is from Jean Cousin&#039;s Livre de Portraiture, which contains many examples. You can also find a few simple (one-step) examples of this method in Burne Hogarthe&#039;s Dynamic Figure Drawing. It shows up mostly in older books, though.<br>Note: This method does not give you size/camera distortion, only foreshortening. For the former, you need to set up a picture plane and have your projecting lines converge towards a point representing the eye of the viewer.<br>This is all fascinating but I don&#039;t recommend it. When it takes more than one step, it&#039;s an enormous amount of labor; furthermore, it&#039;s difficult to predict the end result. It is better to work intuitively and train your eye to what looks right.

Part of the reason I&#039;m familiar with this stuff is because I once tried it as an experiment, animating a character in 8 directions with an idle stance and 6-frame run cycle.

I started at the age of 29 and even went to art school after. The difficulties are mostly psychological in nature. I was already established in my field, made good money and was regarded as a high achiever in things that required a logic/math oriented mind. Starting out people chuckled at my trash art, they saw it in contrast to my wagie achievements and also even felt safe to shit talk me, because &quot;I could take it right?&quot;.<br>Things got worse when I went to art school to try to become pro at some point. The school itself was great, and I didnt mind meeting younger people better than me, it was actually a blast. The bad part are family, partners, friends who actively discourage you &quot;from throwing your life and talent away&quot;. This continues to this day, I am 36 now and a decent artist. Yes I don&#039;t earn nearly as much as I did, but I am happy and don&#039;t feel depressed anymore. Still get offers from people in STEM &quot;to come work&quot; with them. It&#039;s meant well, but I can&#039;t help but feel hurt by the fact that the people closest to me think what I am doing is kind of a joke and they are still waiting for me to &quot;snap out of it&quot; and get a real job.<br>Just be prepared to find new art friends and be humble again. You will go from high regarded normie to nobody overnight. You will most likely not get support from the people you think who would, even worse you will get discouragement throughout. This, paired with the fact that you will have low confidence at first (because you are bad and even young kids are better than you) makes it incredibly hard to make it.

I&#039;ve been drawing since childhood. Didn&#039;t go in artscool or art classes. I drew cartoons, anime, some of my fantasies. My classmates thought that I was good at drawing, my parents also praised me. I thought I was good, when in reality I just drew like a child who loves to draw. In each class there are at least 1-2 such children. You know these guys, or maybe you were them.<br>With age, I began to draw less and less, by the age of 18-19 I drew maybe a couple of times a year.<br>But one time I needed to draw pictures for my text rpg, and god, I realized how shitty of this i was. <br>This caused me great pain, never in my life i hated and despised myself more.<br>So I took courses in academic drawing and painting. I was 27 at the time.<br>Now I&#039;m 31 and I still continue my education. By no means do I claim that I am a good artist now, I am not even close, but I see my growth with each work.<br><br>So, in my opinion, drawing as a child gives only two good things:<br>1. Fine motor skills develop.<br>2. You go through the drawing phase for fun as a teenager.<br><br>The first catches up very quickly, in just a couple of lessons you will already be good friends with a pencil/stylus.<br><br>The second point is what breaks many adult beginners.<br><br>The realization that before you start drawing your fantasies, you have to go through the hard and boring part. And it may take years. Those who have been drawing since childhood already had their fun. They have drawn cute anime girls, robots, disney princesses and monsters.They understand that it will not get better. And they will have to suffer. And accept it more humbly.<br><br>All this, of course, does not apply to those who studied in art schools as children, and then continued their studies in art at a college or university.

This talent will allow you to be able to draw for hours and learn from your work and mistakes without any instruction whatsoever--though instruction could never hurt.

Artists naturally have high egos and to imply that they do not have an ability in a skill that they think is beneath them--in this case, teaching--is far to incomprehensible for them to process.

It&#039;s pandered by artists who want to seem like they know a thing or two about drawing but are absolutely ignorant on the process of drawing. If you were to ask Kim Jung Gi why he makes the marks he makes, he could pull a bullshit answer out of his ass that will help literally no one except those who are already good at drawing. If he was being honest, he&#039;d just say to &quot;just draw&quot; because he doesn&#039;t know what specific things you need to do in order to improve and even if he did, he wouldn&#039;t be a good enough teacher to explain it properly. <br><br>This goes to my point in another thread about the PET acronym. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Performer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teacher</span><br>Nearly all of /ic/ are either performers or aspiring performers.

Performers tend to not understand the process of being able to learn something and therefore are the worst teachers in that field. They tended to have received their skill by sheer mileage and have often taken decades to get to where they currently are. As they have not properly analyzed their approach and why they do certain things, they have an intuitive understanding of drawing which only helps them. Basically, performers cannot teach and can only perform. This is where you get the advice to &quot;just draw&quot; because performers tend to be the ones that actually take this advice seriously and tend to get good by sheer mileage rather than anything concrete that you can teach to anyone. <br><br>Teachers understand a skill at a much higher level than performers and while they may not be as good as the performers, they will often coach the performers regardless. Note how coaches in sports aren&#039;t usually better than the players on the team. (If they were, they&#039;d be mentors not teachers or coaches.)

In my own case,what I present to the public is usually very different from the source material that I physically draw with ballpoint pens,and pencil for intentionally moulding into two dimensional sculpture that are my finished panels. But what I have &quot;most&quot; of are over 180 pages of a sprawling tale of Jeremey Prickles and a good 70 pages were literally storyboards of when I was able to Do It Properly, which means everything is made of separately drawn chunks pounded by Photoshop into story, So I drew it using the sketchbooks I was dragging into waiting rooms,and an epic story sprung from a random sketch of a demon head. It has both moments of revelation and whiplash pangs at your heart strings. I ordered a flatbed scanner so I can properly showcase my recent art,and the tale I am now telling,and the decision I have made. I am going to be 58 soon,and I am pondering how to proceed. I want to tell as many stories completely as I can, but I want to give the rendering enough work, to at least give a vague impression of what I was aiming for. To balance the art with the storytelling is a tightrope walk:in a page,I want to inch the story foward, at least from these current crop of characters (I had 3 storylines going at once,and all parties have joined up heading towards the end.). So I am just letting the story take me where it will.

I don&#039;t really think I&#039;m in a position where I can give you good advice, I have a great art friend who taught me a lot and the best thing I can say from what I learned from him is that you should take light fall off seriously. Values fall abruptly right before the light turns into shadow, it can be tricky to see but once you know it you can observe it everywhere and study the phenomenon (I did a poor job with this too by the way). Also, I prefer using opacity jitter rather than flow and another lesson from my friend was to keep the hardness of the round brush at about 50% most of the time, that way you can paint soft brush strokes by making the size bigger and hard brush strokes by making the size smaller. Don&#039;t ask me why but it works.

Nobody said that they should be able to &quot;claim credit&quot;, nor did anybody imply it, so I don&#039;t see why you jumped to that conclusion.<br>And being able to claim credit or not is irrelevant to the influence this person&#039;s work had on the successful work, and neither is whether or not the influential work was successful. The concept of &quot;influence&quot; is an objective one. Person A makes Work A, Person B sees Work A and says &quot;That&#039;s cool, I like the way x and y&quot; and goes on to make Work B, with x and y. Factually speaking, Work B was influenced by Work A. Person A can be cool with it, or want to claim at least partial credit for x and y, and Person B may or may not acknowledge it and give credit, none of this actually matters toward whether or not Work A influenced Work B.", "time": 1674449144, "resto": 6482353}, {"no": 6486438, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)01:38:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6486055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6486055</a><br>you are mom lol", "time": 1674455939, "resto": 6482353}, {"no": 6486439, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)01:40:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6486204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6486204</a><br>wrong, reilly is considering extremely influential in american art, and nobody knows what he taught, let alone any of his work", "time": 1674456037, "resto": 6482353}, {"no": 6486466, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)02:14:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Now this is peak SOUL", "filename": "9fzzp0izf1upcG2d4WMQy3p1pX87jpbcE121KjhEbjk", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 927, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674458071659998, "time": 1674458071, "md5": "lYn6bJZM08xWteq8V+9oSA==", "fsize": 250814, "resto": 6482353}, {"no": 6486531, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:54:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6486466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6486466</a><br>so this is the power of tenure", "time": 1674464064, "resto": 6482353}, {"no": 6486761, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:29:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6482371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6482371</a><br>I envy that cross-hatching so much.", "time": 1674480551, "resto": 6482353}, {"no": 6486816, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)09:26:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6482353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6482353</a><br>What&#039;s your guys opinion on clean outlines and core details paired with quick/messy hatching?

I never had trouble coming up with the basic idea, but sometimes I\u2019d get stuck on the storyboard \u2013 that\u2019s the rough panel work. But if you get stuck on that part, you\u2019ll get a lot of sleepless nights later! The basic storyboard idea usually takes about a week. In that case, I\u2019d have two weeks for drawing, which was quite easy \u2013 it was safe. But sometimes storyboards took an extra half-week, or even a week longer, and then it got very hard.

Reading is supposed to be smooth, clear, and quick. Language evolves to be smooth clear and quick. You want to communicate with as much ease as possible, and so the more visual elements you add the more bogged down that communication becomes. Your eyes become lost in the colors even if they look pretty. I feel the same way about black and white comics that use too many greys and too much detail on every page. I consider the best comics to be the ones where you not only get completely immersed in the story, but you&#039;re also turning the pages quickly so you don&#039;t get a chance to break that immersion or think about anything else. You shouldn&#039;t have to pause the story in your head to think &quot;wow how beautiful&quot; unless it&#039;s deliberately there for the pacing. You should only linger on a page if that is what the story calls for, like to take in the scenery or gravity. Black and white keeps your eyes moving, undistracted, turning the pages, until you hit a beautiful two page spread with intricacies deliberately rendered to make you stop and look carefully. And whatever you&#039;re looking at there, would likely be important.<br>As for skill level in coloring I don&#039;t care. A comic artist is a comic artist. It&#039;s a separate skill from illustration. Learning to speak in sequential imagery is a skill of its own that even the most skillful colorist could fail at. All language, including the language of sequential imagery, should be simple and concise. Highly skilled highly rendered colorful illustrations aren&#039;t simple and concise, they&#039;re just pretty. What you don&#039;t include in your art is just as important as what you do include.

However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work.[4] He did not plan the details of his stories in advance. When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters.[4] The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half.[6] Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him.[23] Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks&#039; time travel.[4] The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making it seem to have been foreshadowing.[20] The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, which is exactly what he did.[24]</span><br>I\u2019m believing it and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it", "time": 1674504120, "resto": 6478292}, {"no": 6487279, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:10:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6487271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6487271</a><br>I love this guy<br>You can tell he was starting to get burned out around the time he stopped hatching and stopped filling in blacks, the manga shifted to just plain simple linework that he could draw very quickly.

I can feel imagined touch to some degree but taste and smell are basically not existent. I do differentiate between the third eye visualization, hypnagogia and dreams.

Two- and more-point perspective was avoided by almost all artists until mid-seventeenth century.<br><br>&quot;The remarkable feature of angular perspective is that, although it was well-understood by geometers such as P\u00e9l\u00e9rin (1505) and Vredemann de Vries (1605), it was avoided by virtually all artists until the middle of the seventeenth century. Aside from two paintings of doubtful attribution painted around 1440, the first successful use of full angular perspective was by Dutch artist Gerard Houckgeest in 1650. (There was limited use of the angular construction in floor tiling throughout the period, but this could easily be achieved by connecting the corners of a one-point perspective grid, and did not require an understanding of the rules of two-point construction.) Inspired to develop a radical design for his painting of the tomb of William the Silent, the king whose efforts united Holland in 1581, Houckgeest turned to Vredemann\u2019s architectural representation technique of the oblique construction for the interior of the church at Delft. This dramatic shift from the unremitting one-point perspectives of the church interiors of Saenredam and Neeffs gained Houckgeest immense popularity in The Netherlands, but it was to be another half-century before the two-point construction appeared in Italy in the hands of Canaletto.&quot;<br>https://www.webexhibits.org/sciartp<wbr>erspective/raphaelperspective6.html<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6483887</span><br>Is this mental illness?", "time": 1674325056, "resto": 6483529}, {"no": 6484058, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)15:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vermeer was also involved in fraud, forging his mother-in-law&#039;s name to borrow money, then right after that dying mysteriously at age 43.

If you know Photoshop, you know everything. You can literally get hired at lots of places for just being able to show you can use Photoshop well.<br>People say that CSP runs faster but I don&#039;t think this is true. Unoptimized CSP runs faster, but if you just google &quot;Photoshop 60 fps&quot; &quot;Making Photoshop Faster&quot; from Borodante or KNKL you&#039;ll find that Photoshop can fully utilize multithreaded machine setups. Even with higher end PC builds, I&#039;ve noticed Photoshop runs faster than CSP, even after tweaking settings for both. For some reason the cursor on Photoshop just tracks directly behind your pen much more accurately than CSP by a tiny margin, whereas CSP you have to do extensive fuckery to get that to be the close to the same.<br>For CSP The Pen pressure is more customizable meaning I have more options for line brushes and adjusting things. This is not as big of an advantage as you&#039;d think though as for PS the Pen pressure control out of the box works great already, whereas in CSP you usually have to fuck around for a bit to get it feel right. Usually I end up changing all my pens to a straight or slight curve and make everything dependent on my tablet curve pressure anyway. <br>I still use CSP mainly for 2 reasons:<br>The program is constantly getting better and better, whereas the newer versions of Photoshop is actually getting worse than CS6 for painting artwork. With the future updates, it will surpass PS<br>CSP EX has a built in storyboarding feature that is extremely valuable for organizing and making a workflow for making manga/comics and an industry level animation timeline workflow.

Wage war on society, on art, on the notion of skill, of talent, abandon the fear, the pressure, pick up the brush, the knife, the gun. Dance.
