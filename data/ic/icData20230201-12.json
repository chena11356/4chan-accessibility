Many artists draw inspiration from their own desires, dreams, and experiences when creating their works. They often use their art as a means of exploring and expressing these desires in a creative and imaginative way.<br><br>It&#039;s not uncommon for writers, painters, and other creatives to use their art as a way to escape the realities of their lives, and to bring their deepest desires and fantasies to life.

You can see the death of classical art play out in the late 1800\u2019s between the academic artists and the pastoral \u201clower class\u201d artists. Academic Artists lived in such a culturally conservative Christian world because that\u2019s who their patrons were. So much of their genre work, what we recognize as mythological work, was trapped in the past echoing the same pre approved themes and stories from the Greek and biblical accounts. The work was stale. Take bouguereau for example. The absolute pinnacle of artistic ability but his work is mostly boring as fuck from an emotional or narrative view. The early impressionists we\u2019re addressing that lack of meaning by making work that was real to them and had to do with the world they lived in. It was mostly great for a while but then motherfucking Picasso came along with his god damned cubism and then everyone stopped giving a fuck about the quality of the craftsmanship and wanted work that was more of the pure emotional state and less of the representation of what the emotion was derived from. The fauvists were high as shit. The late impressionists all had heavy metal poisoning from lead white and fake absinthe. The dadaists jumped the shark. The cult of personality period in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s was a blur of coke and ether. The naive artists tried to bring the art world back down to earth. Brutalists didn\u2019t survive the 80\u2019s. Album posters were the only real art in the 90\u2019s. 2000\u2019s were a joke. Now everyone is suddenly an illustrator/graffiti artist and acrylic flows like water. We are trying so hard to recover the identity that was lost. Thankfully ateliers are becoming way more popular but they still lack the ability to teach depth and emotion in art. The west doesn\u2019t have a cultural identity or narrative that people resonate with, and we don\u2019t even like each other that much right now.", "time": 1674889178, "resto": 6493566}, {"no": 6493804, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)02:02:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6493800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6493800</a><br>By western people I mean everyone who participates in western culture so bringing out old welsh, Greek, and Scandinavian mythology won\u2019t work.

Forms are simplified and monumentalized, and accidental or distracting details are omitted. Also, violent perspective, with its size distortion, is not a part of this art.

Classical art favors a depiction of the human figure in which the parts are seen in their true forms and relationships, and the posing of figures reflects that.<br>The subject matter was Greek myth, and later Biblical stories and historical events, all rendered in the classical style.

I used gray paper too for the first time so I guess that added to the grey soupyness of the thing, no white paper to shine through.", "filename": "fucking glare reeee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2437, "h": 3769, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675115451153282, "time": 1675115451, "md5": "6rI0Hu3CxsrNPi/74cm+6g==", "fsize": 1686469, "resto": 6496910}, {"no": 6497348, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:54:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6497246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6497246</a><br><a href=\"#p6497275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6497275</a><br>good job anon drawing is about simplifying things https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TX<wbr>EZ4tP06c", "time": 1675115684, "resto": 6496910}, {"no": 6497357, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)17:06:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I DON&#039;T GET IT!

I draw, I try and work on construction and when I struggle to do that, I think the problem is my lines. So I sit there for hours drawing lines like a insane person for hours and I get... nowhere. When I wonder if this is even what I should focus on I check the sticky. I watch all the videos in it over an over again getting a brief overview of things I can&#039;t even do because I can&#039;t even do a circle right. But maybe I need a break anyways, so I do gesture and have no idea if I&#039;m doing something right or not since my drawings don&#039;t really look like gesture drawings and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m grasping the concept. So I try construction since that seems more straightforward, but I can&#039;t do that either. I&#039;ve been stuck in this loop for a month.

All three ultimately leads to the same end result, but the way you get there is mad different. I wouldnt know this if i didnt do multiple beg books.

Experiment with colors: Use a color wheel and different media to experiment with color combinations and see how colors interact with each other.<br><br>2. Practice color mixing: Try mixing colors to create new shades and tints, and learn how to create different color schemes, such as complementary, monochromatic, and analogous.<br><br>3. Observe color in real life: Study the colors in nature, architecture, and everyday objects to gain a better understanding of how colors work together in the real world.<br><br>4. Use references: Study the work of artists you admire and see how they use color in their art. This can help you understand how to create moods, evoke emotions, and create depth in your own artwork.<br><br>5. Apply what you\u2019ve learned: Start incorporating color theory into your artwork by planning color schemes, experimenting with different color combinations, and making color a conscious part of your creative process.<br><br>6.

It&#039;s a 15.6 inch screen drawing tablet.<br>I have been very fortunate that it doesn&#039;t seem to have any hardware issues (some scary reviews out there lmao) so far, but holy sweet mother does its software suck. <br>Coming from an ancient wacoom bamboo from like 2012 I just cannot believe how bad the software is. In general I am extremely grateful that the tablet was so cheap because I was that guy who thought that a screen less one would be just as good but let me tell you now that I&#039;ve seen the light I can never go back. <br>The problem is that the D16&#039;s drivers are being held together with duct tape and cum and it just barely works even having lots of strange issues like I can&#039;t use the two side buttons on the pen because pressing one even for a second will remap the stylus to half way between my main monitor and the d16 display which I sometimes can&#039;t even fix upon several restarts of the computer. Loads of little headaches and setting it up for left handed use was hell. <br><br>Basically I never want another Chinese tablet again. I&#039;m still running windows 10 and the driver to this tablet hasn&#039;t been updated since 2018 so I am mentally preparing myself for this tablet to just stop working when I&#039;m forced to upgrade to win11 probly within the next year. <br>I dont use pen tilt and I&#039;ve found that 15.6 inches I about all the space I have on my tiny desk and so far I haven&#039;t found that I wished the tablet was bigger (only that it worked better).<br>I have no idea about any of this tech stuff but all I want is a functional tablet with good software and support. I dont use pen tilt or even need buttons on the tablet (I have a keyboard). Because if this I&#039;m heavily leaning to a less feature packed Wacom. I really don&#039;t want to buy used.

Once you have a final draft (or very close to it) you can start working on the artwork- character design, setting, wardrobes, hairstyles, etc. Once you have decided on final designs, it helps to make a reference sheet of each major character so you can draw them consistently (VERY important). Next, you do storyboards or thumbnails which have little detail but allow you to plot out each panel/scene in advance. Once you&#039;re happy with that, you can start doing the pencils, where you essentially draw the final image in a loose, sketchy form which is refined in the next step... which is inking. Inking is where you determine lineweight, line quality as well as other things to produce a clean looking outline of your characters, backgrounds, etc. If your comic is in black and white, you can keep it as is or add screentones to increase the illusion of 3 dimensionality. If you want to color, this is where you do so. Finally, you can do the speech bubbles and dialogue followed by sound effects. Congrats, you just made a comic! <br>As you can tell, it&#039;s a lot of work which is why it&#039;s very time consuming and difficult for a single person to produce a work on par with major or even indie studios. I entered the call to action webtoons contest last year and it took me a little under two months to produce ~60 pages, working 40 hours a week.

If you know Photoshop, you know everything. You can literally get hired at lots of places for just being able to show you can use Photoshop well.<br>People say that CSP runs faster but I don&#039;t think this is true. Unoptimized CSP runs faster, but if you just google &quot;Photoshop 60 fps&quot; &quot;Making Photoshop Faster&quot; from Borodante or KNKL you&#039;ll find that Photoshop can fully utilize multithreaded machine setups. Even with higher end PC builds, I&#039;ve noticed Photoshop runs faster than CSP, even after tweaking settings for both. For some reason the cursor on Photoshop just tracks directly behind your pen much more accurately than CSP by a tiny margin, whereas CSP you have to do extensive fuckery to get that to be the close to the same.<br>For CSP The Pen pressure is more customizable meaning I have more options for line brushes and adjusting things. This is not as big of an advantage as you&#039;d think though as for PS the Pen pressure control out of the box works great already, whereas in CSP you usually have to fuck around for a bit to get it feel right. Usually I end up changing all my pens to a straight or slight curve and make everything dependent on my tablet curve pressure anyway. <br>I still use CSP mainly for 2 reasons:<br>The program is constantly getting better and better, whereas the newer versions of Photoshop is actually getting worse than CS6 for painting artwork. With the future updates, it will surpass PS<br>CSP EX has a built in storyboarding feature that is extremely valuable for organizing and making a workflow for making manga/comics and an industry level animation timeline workflow.

It could help to start with bigger shapes and two values first (your main light and shadow) then go into the smaller details and more nuanced values later. Another way to clean it up would be paying more attention to your edge control. To me it seems as if you went first with a small brush, which would explain the white spaces, but you don&#039;t seem to have a clear image of what the final product would look like.<br><br>I agree with the guy that a two stone study would be good but I don&#039;t know if I would agree with treating your current progress as an underpainting because the layers look very rough and thick to me the more you add the more uneven it will become. This was my mistake with my first oil painting 4 years ago. Instead of knowing how to take away from the paint and be decisive with my actions, I kept adding more over my mistakes up only to end up with my layers, texture, surface, and brushstrokes all fucked up so I had to use my thinner to wipe layers of wasted paint and repaint over after destroying all the preexisting paint. Thinking you can just correct your mistakes by painting over like with digital is a common mistake for people painting for the first time.<br><br>I also don&#039;t know if I would agree with the comment on warm tones, because temperature is more advanced than values. If you don&#039;t know your light and shadows adding more varied temperature will most likely make things even more confusing (mistake I do a lot the time).

It entails first drawing a simple view, then projecting parallel lines from various points on the figure at a desired angle to construct a second view. Sometimes, as in picrel, one or more intermediary steps are required to get the desired end result. Picrel is from Jean Cousin&#039;s Livre de Portraiture, which contains many examples. You can also find a few simple (one-step) examples of this method in Burne Hogarthe&#039;s Dynamic Figure Drawing. It shows up mostly in older books, though.<br>Note: This method does not give you size/camera distortion, only foreshortening. For the former, you need to set up a picture plane and have your projecting lines converge towards a point representing the eye of the viewer.<br>This is all fascinating but I don&#039;t recommend it. When it takes more than one step, it&#039;s an enormous amount of labor; furthermore, it&#039;s difficult to predict the end result. It is better to work intuitively and train your eye to what looks right.

Part of the reason I&#039;m familiar with this stuff is because I once tried it as an experiment, animating a character in 8 directions with an idle stance and 6-frame run cycle.

In jurisdictions where the ages are not the same, the marriageable age for females is more commonly two or three years lower than that for males. &quot;<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marri<wbr>ageable_age", "time": 1675237959, "resto": 6496933}, {"no": 6499710, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)03:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6499418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6499418</a><br>Is young Natalie Portman pretty much the go-to reference girl for aspiring hebe artists?", "time": 1675238681, "resto": 6496933}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 6433586, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)16:40:01", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/draw/ where is draw thread", "filename": "el", "ext": ".png", "w": 1234, "h": 807, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 163, "tim": 1671745201283552, "time": 1671745201, "md5": "sRb2d6U4GGmfPW/IYdCAaA==", "fsize": 480350, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "draw-where-is-draw-thread", "replies": 288, "images": 153, "unique_ips": 134}, {"no": 6434135, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)19:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "spaceship man bad", "filename": "lon", "ext": ".png", "w": 1018, "h": 807, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1671757172665960, "time": 1671757172, "md5": "LOKpmjZr8Eo/1rcuts1wuw==", "fsize": 836287, "resto": 6433586}, {"no": 6434152, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:06:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6433586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6433586</a><br>prompt?", "time": 1671757601, "resto": 6433586}, {"no": 6434170, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6434152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6434152</a><br>hm persons places things or events from 2022", "time": 1671758045, "resto": 6433586}, {"no": 6434283, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:19:25", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "20221222_181831", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1650, "h": 1584, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1671761965102355, "time": 1671761965, "md5": "NayZm8LlmC1ILkr5joB7Ig==", "fsize": 666794, "resto": 6433586}, {"no": 6434294, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:25:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6434283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6434283</a><br>Blog?", "time": 1671762304, "resto": 6433586}, {"no": 6434409, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)22:23:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6434283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6434283</a><br>brian?

It happened, it was new, it overtook the entire world and it was really fucking good, or at least the artstyle. Anime is not all this generic shit that OP posted, it influenced tons of people drawing cartoonish styles and semi-realistic styles. Both normies and artists loved it and it was fucking awesome for most people. Now that it happened it is on its way out. It is becoming too generic and is overstaying its welcome. Anons saying it is too generic are right, just like how every artstyle was generic for its time period and then people got bored of it and replaced it with something now. Now we are entering the dark ages of art, if not end of it.

It is a pessimistic and horrible future ahead, one where people who once liked art and refuse to like AI are forced to like it, because there are no artists left. Even if you try to be artist in this age, one catering to anti-AI crowd, you would still lose because nobody trusts anybody. What proof do you have that you have made that art? You dont have any, because all proof can be falsified with another AI. People will become more and more disinterested with social media and media in general as the value of media will be 0 when you can generate all of it at your finger.

People cannot mimic soul, because if human tried to mimic soul, they would either have to copy too much resulting in soullessness, or they would give it soul because their talent and meaning would translate there inside of their work, thus giving it soul. AI cannot do hard work and show its learning, it cannot give its art meaning, but it sure as hell can make it look like it does, hence why so many people got dooped by it on this site.

I mainly make profits from selling my books and original page art at art shows and comic and anime conventions. I fund my print runs with crowdfunding campaigns, and then sell the books for pure profit at shows. My evergreen bestseller is Purrvana, a colorful watercolor painted psychedelic cat graphic novel that appeals to normies of all ages and all demographics from bikers to gangsters to grannies to crazy cat ladies. I have sold over 2,500 copies of Purrvana to date. I also make money from commissions, both my OCs and other people. Most of my commissions are catfight wrestling matches featuring my OCs or other people&#039;s OCs. I advertise mainly on pixiv, discord, twitter and my webcomic also works as an advertisement. I also drew animal coloring books years ago that still sell, at shows and online. After a bad experience working with a publisher several years ago, I began self publishing and now that&#039;s all I want to do.<br><br>I read that Image creators are in the red and go in to debt with Image unless their book sells a certain amount of copies. I recently read tweets from an image artist who says that after his book he worked on sold 5 issues at 15,000 issues each, he only made $1100 in profit and he got paid months after the final issue came out, after the profit share was split with image, the writer and colorist. I don&#039;t sell a high volume of copies, and my crowdfunders don&#039;t go crazy, but I still make a lot more profit than that Image artist whose book was selling 15,000 copies each issue for example because I keep all the profit of sales for myself. I also do freelance work. Advertising and marketing is not really something I&#039;m good at, but I&#039;m getting by and trying to improve at it. I&#039;m also going to start a life drawing class at my local Junior College next week and I hope it will up my skills so I can charge more for commissions, and it will also improve my comic pages.

This can lead to a lack of variety in the artist&#039;s portfolio and difficulty when trying to create dynamic and expressive compositions.<br><br>3. Stylization: Action figures are often designed with a specific style in mind, which may not align with the artist&#039;s personal style or desired aesthetic.

Practice regularly: The key to improving drawing skills is consistent practice. Set aside time each day or week to draw, and gradually increase the difficulty of the subjects you tackle.<br><br>2. Study anatomy: A strong understanding of anatomy is crucial for creating convincing and believable character animations. Consider taking a class or studying anatomy books specifically geared towards artists.<br><br>3. Study the principles of animation: Familiarize yourself with the 12 principles of animation and put them into practice in your own drawings and animations.<br><br>4. Experiment with different mediums: Experiment with different mediums, such as pencils, charcoal, or digital tools, to find what works best for you and expand your skillset.<br><br>5. Learn from others: Seek out tutorials, workshops, or online communities of animators and artists. Observe the work of experienced animators and ask for feedback on your own work.<br><br>6. Take breaks and have fun: Don&#039;t get too caught up in perfecting every drawing. Remember to take breaks and have fun, as this will help you stay motivated and avoid burnout.<br><br>By consistently following these steps, your friend can gradually improve their drawing skills and work towards becoming an animator.", "time": 1675205869, "resto": 6498394}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 6494518, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)15:16:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Just draw for yourself 4head", "com": "God i hate this &quot;advice&quot; like, &quot;bro just draw for yourself, not for the others&quot; when your art does zero fucking numbers like bro, what will this change, i dont want to draw anything for ME this is shit and its always people that have thousands of followers i hate the art sphere online like holy shit", "filename": "WHATISGOINGON", "ext": ".png", "w": 223, "h": 238, "tn_w": 223, "tn_h": 238, "tim": 1674936963854115, "time": 1674936963, "md5": "33vjM3ruV1pRkwyVbf8yAw==", "fsize": 89693, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "just-draw-for-yourself-4head", "replies": 93, "images": 20, "unique_ips": 35}, {"no": 6494525, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)15:19:17", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "kim jung brap", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1365, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674937157645701, "time": 1674937157, "md5": "N98L6ur2pTHW5kWQm8yxJQ==", "fsize": 260881, "resto": 6494518}, {"no": 6494527, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)15:21:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "just cope", "time": 1674937271, "resto": 6494518}, {"no": 6494539, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)15:27:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You must be 18 to post here buddy", "time": 1674937666, "resto": 6494518}, {"no": 6494542, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)15:29:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Death to normies.", "filename": "like n subsesffeegegeryasa", "ext": ".png", "w": 608, "h": 604, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674937764248779, "time": 1674937764, "md5": "xHfTA3+oCWh56a3W66EP0g==", "fsize": 142043, "resto": 6494518}, {"no": 6494544, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)15:29:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6494518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6494518</a><br>maybe you should draw better for yourself", "time": 1674937782, "resto": 6494518}, {"no": 6494545, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)15:29:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Put it in another perspective; you made this thread asking &gt;&gt;others&lt;&lt; about this sound advice thinking &gt;&gt;others&lt;&lt; are on standby ready to upvote your thinking.

Would you rather just be someone who follows trends, algorithms, and constantly in fear of being \u201cnot enough\u201d by your audience? Or would you rather your art having meaning and have an audience who loves your art rather than loving some trend. The former makes more money, sure, yet the latter is both more sustainable for your own well-being. I RARELY, if at all, draw fan art. The closest I\u2019ve done has been draw characters inspired by Touhou or what not yet that has been years ago. I once had the mindset of wanting to impress people with my art. I would be so harsh on myself if I didnt make some beautiful masterpiece every time I had a pencil in my hand. Guess what? I was stuck for years. I stagnated. I couldnt get shit done. I\u2019ve since changed my mindset the past 6 months and found my own meaning in making art, and I\u2019ve improved dramatically. What seperates a good artist and a great artist is the meaning they put behind their works. Think of any great art piece in the last few centuries and it usually has something more than just a canvas filled with pretty colors and compositions. The one thing AI art will never be able to take is meaning behind a piece. If you\u2019re chasing followers, then expect to be a slave to trends and always feeling anxious about staying relevant. If you find meaning in your own craft, then any issues that arise won\u2019t be as dreadful.", "time": 1674951067, "resto": 6494518}, {"no": 6494795, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:15:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6494518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6494518</a><br>Then go draw for others but don&#039;t come back crying with a new thread years later down the line about how unfulfilled you feel about your art despite all the validation you receive, I see it happen too often.

I&#039;ve seen people with no apparent regard for anything but status become humble and genuinely caring. And there&#039;s no small share of veterans and others- with absolutely traumatic experience who still become successful. <br>All of them won&#039;t, but there are few true hard barriers to the mind, even physiologically. And that is both terrifying and awesome. Because everything you do multiplies, to come back to either hunt you or turn you into a beast -and that, I can absolutely personally vouch for. <br>Do you want to be fickle prey to your own devices,(and anyone else who smells your weakness) or a demon hunter?

I don&#039;t really think I&#039;m in a position where I can give you good advice, I have a great art friend who taught me a lot and the best thing I can say from what I learned from him is that you should take light fall off seriously. Values fall abruptly right before the light turns into shadow, it can be tricky to see but once you know it you can observe it everywhere and study the phenomenon (I did a poor job with this too by the way). Also, I prefer using opacity jitter rather than flow and another lesson from my friend was to keep the hardness of the round brush at about 50% most of the time, that way you can paint soft brush strokes by making the size bigger and hard brush strokes by making the size smaller. Don&#039;t ask me why but it works.

Basically, I\u2019d have five to seven days off where I\u2019d just vaguely be thinking of ideas while relaxing. The remaining three weeks are for work. I never had trouble coming up with the basic idea, but sometimes I\u2019d get stuck on the storyboard \u2013 that\u2019s the rough panel work. But if you get stuck on that part, you\u2019ll get a lot of sleepless nights later! The basic storyboard idea usually takes about a week. In that case, I\u2019d have two weeks for drawing, which was quite easy \u2013 it was safe. But sometimes storyboards took an extra half-week, or even a week longer, and then it got very hard. We had to produce 40 to 50 pages for each issue. Forty pages in two weeks with an assistant is easily done.</span><br><br>https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2018<wbr>/06/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-manga-ar<wbr>tist/", "time": 1674586395, "resto": 6484125}, {"no": 6489055, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:34:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I read what&#039;s available on webtoon and its okay<br><br>Nothing too memorable<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The girl signs up to be an idol and it turns out it&#039;s a kind of danganronpa killing game. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some pretty panels but it&#039;s otherwise a nothingburger</span><br><br>Good luck to her I guess?

Artists naturally have high egos and to imply that they do not have an ability in a skill that they think is beneath them--in this case, teaching--is far to incomprehensible for them to process. So instead of attempting to improve at the skill of teaching and finding other, more concrete ways of explaining something, they resort to shit-flinging and name-calling anyone who doesn&#039;t immediately understand their shit advice. <br><br>&quot;Just Draw&quot; is another one of those shit advice. It&#039;s pandered by artists who want to seem like they know a thing or two about drawing but are absolutely ignorant on the process of drawing. If you were to ask Kim Jung Gi why he makes the marks he makes, he could pull a bullshit answer out of his ass that will help literally no one except those who are already good at drawing. If he was being honest, he&#039;d just say to &quot;just draw&quot; because he doesn&#039;t know what specific things you need to do in order to improve and even if he did, he wouldn&#039;t be a good enough teacher to explain it properly. <br><br>This goes to my point in another thread about the PET acronym. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Performer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teacher</span><br>Nearly all of /ic/ are either performers or aspiring performers.

That is exactly why I immediately stopped using Reddit years ago on their LearnArt subreddit because it was literally just a bunch of people who were already good just showing off and asking for advice, and fucking getting it for some fucking reason, while beginners were just ignored or given horrible advice by other retards that can&#039;t draw. <br><br>Of course, after spending time on here, I started to realize that this place is simply a dopamanergic outlet for making you think like you&#039;re being productive when you are in fact not being productive at all.

Performers tend to not understand the process of being able to learn something and therefore are the worst teachers in that field. They tended to have received their skill by sheer mileage and have often taken decades to get to where they currently are. As they have not properly analyzed their approach and why they do certain things, they have an intuitive understanding of drawing which only helps them. Basically, performers cannot teach and can only perform. This is where you get the advice to &quot;just draw&quot; because performers tend to be the ones that actually take this advice seriously and tend to get good by sheer mileage rather than anything concrete that you can teach to anyone. <br><br>Teachers understand a skill at a much higher level than performers and while they may not be as good as the performers, they will often coach the performers regardless. Note how coaches in sports aren&#039;t usually better than the players on the team. (If they were, they&#039;d be mentors not teachers or coaches.) A teacher must have a very high level of understanding of whatever skill they are pursuing as they have to properly explain each and every step--otherwise, they&#039;re wasting everyone&#039;s time. <br><br>For instance, if we were to bring this back to drawing, lets say a beginner creates a drawing. You notice that the drawing is shit but because you are a performer, you can&#039;t exactly explain why it is shit.

But what I have &quot;most&quot; of are over 180 pages of a sprawling tale of Jeremey Prickles and a good 70 pages were literally storyboards of when I was able to Do It Properly, which means everything is made of separately drawn chunks pounded by Photoshop into story, So I drew it using the sketchbooks I was dragging into waiting rooms,and an epic story sprung from a random sketch of a demon head. It has both moments of revelation and whiplash pangs at your heart strings. I ordered a flatbed scanner so I can properly showcase my recent art,and the tale I am now telling,and the decision I have made. I am going to be 58 soon,and I am pondering how to proceed. I want to tell as many stories completely as I can, but I want to give the rendering enough work, to at least give a vague impression of what I was aiming for. To balance the art with the storytelling is a tightrope walk:in a page,I want to inch the story foward, at least from these current crop of characters (I had 3 storylines going at once,and all parties have joined up heading towards the end.). So I am just letting the story take me where it will.

I am thinking about reintroducing the Snowglobe story at some other venue, after I composed a few new strips summarizing the first few dozen of the first entries that were mere storyboards for when I was going to have the time to redo them properly, which never happened. That would mean also having the time to generate new strips,which,according to the news that I had at work,may once again be in short supply. But for now,I am just happy with what I am producing,warts and all, and will forge ahead whatever happens at the job. The other angle of creating/promoting the IP I had was to bundle everything up as the &quot;JP Experience&quot;,explaining that I am a Writer with an Artistic Bent(to offset the unprofessional art),and shop it around to agents hungry for exploitable new franchises to peddle.

It is ludicrous to assign them with the daunting task of reinventing the wheel when you could just as easily offer direction or list off resources you have used. Any veteran in any field of interest is able to do this, apparently save for artists. You want to say &quot;start small,&quot; but instead you say nothing, and falsely assign yourself the status of an intellectual superior to a human being doing what in most circumstances SHOULD be the wisest course of action: asking for advice from someone more experienced; and instead they find themselves cursed to interact with halfwits who literally cannot use their words (except to project their own self-contempt onto you for no reason). <br>You are not some aristocratic elite.
