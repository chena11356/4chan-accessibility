By flats, I literally mean flats. Colors. Not the dimensionality of the image. You put flats down, then come in with more with digital rendering. Yours looked like simple flat colors with no gradients or change in colors beyond what the ink provided. The image itself has perspective and does lead you to the back a bit with the road and shrinking trees, etc. <br><br>However, the linework fails you. It is rushed, even if this likely took you a long time. Take our pine trees on the left. You literally scribble left and right without even apparently taking the pen off the page. The branches also have dimensionality and arent left-right only, yet all the lines scream left-right and, while I said flats related to the colors only, this actually flattens those trees on the page when examined closely. There should be different clusters of needles depending on if the branch is coming at us, going away, angled one way or another. The lighting would reflect this and provide differing levels of black - not uniform back and forth lines. The far left tree is also broken. The very bottom goes up and then you can see the tree is off after the first wave of black scribbles - the trunk is literally not connected to the stump. A tree in background to the righ tof this has same effect, though could literally be broken and angled, but unlikely. I&#039;m not sure how you did this. Like youd have underdrawing in pencil and do the trunk and pine needles/leaves over top or at same time. the through line of the trunk should be the same and not break liek this.<br><br>Another issue is simple anatomy. Yes, trees have anatomy. Branches do not get thicker as they go up.

This branch cannot support that weight. There are minor examples of real life trees getting these large growths, but the physical sub branch isnt going to be liek double the thickness of the main branch off the trunk. The trunk that split off and goes highest on the same tree is massively thicker than it could possibly get. It is almost identical to the bottom base of the trunk where it should be thickest.

Value studies are very important when planning out ink. Ive done literal horus of inking and then realized ive overinked or the values are just fucked and had to start over.

I love the process and if I end up with a shitty drawing I can always just try again. I personally don&#039;t care about making a lot of money, but I want to make money off my hard work even if it isn&#039;t much. Here&#039;s the way I think about it, almost every career path you go down requires hard work and effort for some end reward. You could work some meaningless server job and in that case your reward is just money. But if we&#039;re talking about actually fulfilling careers that someone is passionate about, the rewards vary. Why does a no name scientist go out into the world collecting rock samples from a volcano in blazing heat for 8 hours? He probably gets paid next to nothing but the fulfillment of helping the world of science in the future. He doesn&#039;t care to pick up rocks for 8 hours because he loves rocks, loves understanding their formations and composition. Sure there will be times where he just wants to say fuck it and leave, but then he reminds himself of his goals and vision and presses on, until he finds the perfect rock and it&#039;s all worth it. For him it isn&#039;t torture, but for me I&#039;d fucking kill myself if I had to go to guatamala to pick rocks off a fucking volcano. Perhaps you just haven&#039;t found your passion yet, or you&#039;re just looking at art in a way that&#039;s false. For an artist the end result is just one step of the process equal or even lesser in importance than the previous steps.", "filename": "1668494049272238", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1282, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668708479051761, "time": 1668708479, "md5": "0RFQ2oHz30ryTHFx63i0Mg==", "fsize": 860156, "resto": 6373710}, {"no": 6379385, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)14:05:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6377752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6377752</a><br>Yeah that one art contest no one heard of cared about or would&#039;ve known existed if not for AI tech shills propping it up, even when AI was producing less-coherent images<br><br>Totally not an elaborate scam like NFT &quot;galleries&quot;", "time": 1668711926, "resto": 6373710}], "last_modified": 1668711926}, {"no": 6369277, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)01:05:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "when did you start drawing<br>what made you start drawing<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be 22</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;about to finish my degree</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;realize i don&#039;t give a fuck about what i studied</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;take a boring desk job</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8hrs a day editing spreadsheet</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;please kill me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get really good at visual basic</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;automate most of my job</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;use my free time to start doodling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drawing becomes a form of escapism</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;decide i want to take art seriously</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;been for about 2 years now</span><br><br>still a beg but w/e we&#039;re all gonna make it.", "filename": "Screenshot 2022-11-10 at 21-50-36 drawing kid - Google Search", "ext": ".png", "w": 650, "h": 434, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668146745241557, "time": 1668146745, "md5": "VVF+K+jnI1jz8+M+lNMZvg==", "fsize": 353615, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "when-did-you-start-drawing", "replies": 53, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 48, "omitted_images": 11, "last_replies": [{"no": 6374828, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)14:43:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6369277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6369277</a><br>&quot;loli&quot;", "time": 1668455027, "resto": 6369277}, {"no": 6377371, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)08:13:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6369277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6369277</a><br>I&#039;m literally you except I&#039;m 31.
