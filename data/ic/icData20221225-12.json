This was to see if I could get close to the original. It was drawn in 1600x2000 then cropped down mainly with the brush size between 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 depending on what the line thickness is. It&#039;s not a good brush for a single line drawing. Instead, you&#039;ll have to draw over your lines multiple times to get it to be thick. Keep it light and fast for the &quot;skippy&quot; thin lines.

And that affects the discussion around AI too.<br><br>I&#039;ll explain:<br>Take pic related, a famous painting today. This painting was controversial at its time, and panned, as it&#039;s not good art and even plain embarrassing.<br>Why?<br>Because it&#039;s silly, pathetic and juvenile. Think of what the artist, a young Cabanel, is saying with this pic. &quot;Lucifer was just like me, a young misunderstood genius who was wronged!&quot; and he painted it with all of his skill as big as he could make it, and made Lucifer as buff as a caricature, even compared to classic greek sculptures of Zeus. Lucifer being more buff than Zeus shows him as physically powerful and &quot;healthful&quot;, which is a failure to understand the classical worship of beauty as virility and might. Lucifer is crying miserably, it doesn&#039;t make sense for him to exude power and health to such extreme extent. It rightfully made the masters of the time cringe.<br><br>In degenerate, uneducated post-modernity none of this matters. Only the &quot;product&quot; and the &quot;skill&quot; matters, that&#039;s why most people have very little skill at all, and you become a &quot;master&quot; with a third of the skill of a 21 year old artist from centuries ago, when pursuing a purpose is what forces you to gain the skill to represent it. And that&#039;s always recognition from other humans, not master in itself.<br><br>In conclusion, skill was never what mattered. You can find examples of doodles and memes being far more popular than skillful art that took dozens of hours. Art was always about the artist, the message his art tries to convey, the communication. How the skill is used and for what purpose, rather than how much skill is used. This should frame how AI art is viewed. Art can win in skill, but it can&#039;t win in message because it has none.

All the AI would do is just watch from far away, and then upon death upload us into the matrix paradaise that techbros cream about. The future will be like the past where people were religious, but now they will know that there is 100% a god, god we made ourselves in order to save ourselves from all the sins of modern world and industrializations while keeping all of its benefits, all thanks to the magic arbitrary rules put in place by the ASI.<br><br>Yes, AI fucking sucks and world without it would be better one in not just arts, but all fields.

Well, the reason I ask is because it&#039;s weird that you don&#039;t know how to answer my question about the armpit. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s 4 lines or not, you can represent forms with few lines. As for &quot;what I&#039;m trying to achieve&quot; it should be pretty obvious - representing the coracobrachialis, axillary fossa, deltoids, teres major, and latissimus in a pleasing and somewhat accurate way. That&#039;s what I&#039;m asking about. You bring up reference - the armpit is in shadow in the reference so it&#039;s largely invented, and anyway if it was that obvious in the reference I wouldn&#039;t really need to ask, I could just copy what I see. Calling something &quot;low effort&quot; because it&#039;s a block in is pretty weird, if I posted a fully rendered piece that had issues at the fundamental stage people would just shit on me that I polished a turd. That&#039;s WHY you ask for feedback in the early stages. If you know what you&#039;re talking about, show me your work and I&#039;ll eat my words but I hope you at least understand why I&#039;m skeptical of this response. Not even trying to be a dick. And as for the greyscale to color study, I was just looking for anything glaringly wrong with it or some pointers from people more familiar with the workflow.<br><a href=\"#p6435854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6435854</a><br>Thanks!

Using reference is also suggested, just don&#039;t go blind expecting to create a final result right off the bat if you have no mental image or an idea of how things actually look like.<br>Also watch Vandruff&#039;s 1994 perspective lectures, it deals with different kind of measurement systems that may be useful for you, like projecting measurements on space based on translating divisions from 2D measurements.", "time": 1671274112, "resto": 6413264}, {"no": 6423990, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)07:21:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there a way to disable &quot;recent file list&quot; in Photoshop/pureref?<br>I can set it to 0 but it still saves the thumbnails so if u change it to any other number, it will show those recently open files", "time": 1671279693, "resto": 6413264}, {"no": 6424042, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)08:13:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6423798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6423798</a><br>It&#039;s mostly just requires patience that zoom zooms tend to struggle with.", "time": 1671282827, "resto": 6413264}, {"no": 6424288, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)10:51:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "how do I select just the guy, not the lines, so I can do a solid fill", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 979, "h": 746, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1671292268340836, "time": 1671292268, "md5": "WRrnqGo5qpy2rQTvaiSmuA==", "fsize": 128052, "resto": 6413264}, {"no": 6424291, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)10:52:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6424288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6424288</a><br>(in CSP)", "time": 1671292329, "resto": 6413264}, {"no": 6424299, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)10:54:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why is starting for the day so painful but I can draw for hours after?

I just downloaded that book, and on CGP there were higher quality scans of just the plate images so i will use those as reference.<br><br>One thing i heard on the draftsmen podcast was you&#039;re supposed to print out the plate and tape it up on a wall, then stand away from it and measure from some distance (using the same measuring location each time) and then go up to your own drawing and replicate the line. Do i need to do this?<br><br>Is it okay to copy these using procreate/photoshop where the plate is just off to the side, or should i be separating the plate from my drawing to force me to really get the proportion down?<br><br>this is how proportion was taught in DOTRS", "time": 1671901039, "resto": 6430229}, {"no": 6438243, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)22:00:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6437528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6437528</a><br>need is very relative, if I remember right the draftsman&#039;s postcase was proko right? keep in mind what they usually do, as in reference a real model or a real life object, so for them to keep themselves in practice, or just to keep sharp for when they use a real model, they would print it off and put it about as far away as they would normally draw form. <br><br>I also assume that them printing it off gives them enough distance from it to not be able to just copy side by side, I mean they are still copying it sure, but there is a massive fucking difference between copying with referencing lines for proportion and a grid. <br><br>Personally I have a multi monitor setup, 1 4k 55 inch tv and one 22 inch penable display, so I could easily put the image on the 4k and then work on the second monitor, im also getting a tablet soon as a gift to myself which again would put me a step or two away from one of the displays, but even if I worked off one display my 4k has enough resolution i could take 1/3rd the screen for the image and work on the other 2/3rds of the screen.<br><br>now if I work exclusively from my 1080p... the reference images are a little on the small side, so printing them off would probably help just for clarity sake, but like I said need is relative.

You homogenize details in a similar fashion. I\u2019d say if you want to get better at translating the AI images into oil paintings next summer you should get out and do some plein air work.

Also the arms and overall pose of the creature have a weird read, it&#039;s both perspective and pose to be honest, I&#039;d advice drawing the overall structure before even rendering it, thinking about the creature size and it&#039;s relationship with other elements should be a priority as well.<br>The christmas tree is interesting and detailed but next to the creature is competing for the attention, as it&#039;s an overcast setting it becomes hard to balance things out but a cheap trick is lowering the saturation on less important elements. <br>Those snowflakes and other photoshop effects bring down the quality of the image, I&#039;d remove them.

creative painting with ryan o&#039;rourke is really good to follow along with and learn. i dont really watch now that ive learned to paint, but it was by far the best youtube channel for learning acrylic painting, mixing paint, and, most importantly, how much fucking water you need to do anything. if you struggle with painting, you probably dont use enough water. most do speed paint no commentary. he has hours long videos step by step explaining exact brush, showing how much water, how to mix the paint by parts (1 part white, 1 part red, 2 parts blue, etc) and how that helps you make bigger amount or recreate the color or how to go from the one color to a lighter one or bring back contrast, etc as you are trying to match a color. very informative and well worth doing some paint alongs if you want to get into it.<br><br>bradwynn jones seems to have given up on his channel, but the videos are still there. if you struggle with drawing portraits or loomis, he is a godsend. youll learn so much from following along. has loomis plate videos, but usually just uses a pintrest/instagram portrait and draws from that reference. combines loomis with reilly rhythms and explains every step hes making, how he measures relative distances and how they relate back to loomis or reilly or basic anatomy. goes from construction to finished lines to rendering for most videos. another well worth checking out if you want to learn to draw using these techniques. <br><br>richard friend is comic book inker and arguably one of the best. from a time when it was skill based and not just digital tracing of tumblr artists at marvel and dc that they have today. he mostly does art books and creator spotlights for his favorite artists. go to archives and he has insanely good inking

I resolved instead to adjust my characters and their narrative world in a way that mogs those cartoons(in my opinion,) and makes my characters even more distinctly my own.

All they do is literally just make 3 pictures of thing from imagegen, then they use those images to photoscan the object and then deliver you your shitty model. You know how imagegens suck at making the same thing 2 times in a row, it will take at least half a year to perfect this, which would basically also mean that videos are now fully possible to make at high quality with no interpolation needed. How will you tell the AI that some parts of the object have multiple parts? You wont by current metrics.<br><br>Also, dont forget that while pictures only require you to put pixels on the roughly correct places to be fully passable, 3D objects cannot just be shapes with texture. Maybe for static background objects, but not for animated characters. You need to give the model good topology, which is low skill technical thing you can only manage to make if you make the object by hand from simple geometry (kinda like if you had to force artbot to replicate manually all the brushstrokes instead of just making it denoise stuff and find patterns). You will then also have to rig the model, which is already kinda possible in humanoid models, but to rig dinosaur properly will probably take some time to figure out. Then you will have to give it proper drivers and shape keys for good animations, and finally animate it. Animating humanoids with words will be possible next year thanks to there being lot of data on it, but animating alien octopus with swords for tentacles will be near impossible since there is no training data for this.

Right now the 3D modelling AI is about in the same stage where image AI was in 2017 when anons made these old threads posted here. 3D models have way less data, but at the same time the amount of money being put inside of AI research now and before is incomparable. AI has shown that it works and it is really impressive, and that it is not just a dumb fad like crypto. When you explain AI, it ranges from research with limitaded use, to something that is so effective it makes people around you shiver in fear. Crypto on the other hand is either horribly ineffective ponzi scheme, or horribly ineffective way of doing transactions, since their decentralized nature makes their transaction consume something like 2000 or whatever times more power. My pain point however should not be to think about how long it will take for 3D models to be automated, but rather how many jobs will be automated beforehand.<br><br>Once chatbots learn how to make really really long texts to replace writers, they will also replace many other professions. AI still cannot replace technical artists. Speculative evolution? Scientific artwork like cryptozoology and microorganism artwork? Intriquate sci fi? Fantasy with historical references? All it can do now is either make something already existing, or make cool looking designs. This is the main flaw of the current methods, and these methods are several years old. To get rid of these methods, you would either need to give the user far more control over the AI, which then artists will be the ones best suited for using it (unlike prompts where the main skill is testing prompts, weights and remembering artist names), or you will need to also automate the scientists and historians themselves, at which point you will basically have AGI, since AI that can critically think and find solutions to any kind of problem is also able to collect its own data and invent its own learning methods", "time": 1671940536, "resto": 6438043}, {"no": 6438290, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:06:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6438265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6438265</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REEEEEEEEE I CAN&#039;T DOODLE ANYMORE HUMANITY IS IN DECLINE</span>", "time": 1671941193, "resto": 6438043}, {"no": 6438295, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6438290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6438290</a><br>Yes, but I actually mean it", "filename": "__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__mnn__images__2016__10__Hand-Stencils-Cueva-de-las-Manos-1c4faac631494c9588853580c7cc866d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 562, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671941540288607, "time": 1671941540, "md5": "9ZP+u4/QrlgA0nd6pDOlxw==", "fsize": 116238, "resto": 6438043}, {"no": 6438300, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:15:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "based anon where&#039;d you go", "filename": "Screen Shot 2022-12-24 at 11.14.04 PM", "ext": ".png", "w": 1295, "h": 230, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 22, "tim": 1671941734230143, "time": 1671941734, "md5": "p3kx7rc8w0gNcUA8DqajIg==", "fsize": 108006, "resto": 6438043}, {"no": 6438302, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:19:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6438300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6438300</a><br>In the face of profits and costs, creativity is expendable as the workforce", "time": 1671941983, "resto": 6438043}, {"no": 6438304, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:21:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6438290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6438290</a><br>soulless drone", "time": 1671942091, "resto": 6438043}, {"no": 6438312, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:25:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6438302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6438302</a><br>Not if you are the director demanding real people to work on shit.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal.

They&#039;re also very difficult to control. The difficulty can be a good thing if you want to challenge yourself and train your dexterity, but it could get frustrating for a beginner.<br>Felt tip brush pens are comparatively really easy to control and you can still get good line variety out of them. I&#039;ve never used the Micron one but it&#039;s probably fine.<br>A lot of manga artists do use fineliners, but it&#039;s usually for details, hatching or speech bubbles. Maru nibs produce similarly thin lines, but they can thicken a bit if you press harder. You can still get super delicate lines out of a pen or brush if you&#039;re skilled enough, Akihito Yoshitomi does a lot of detailed machine drawings with dip pens on YouTube if you&#039;re interested in watching someone ink in real time.<br>That&#039;s not to say nobody ever inks mainly with fineliners, and I think they were common in shoujo manga in the 2000s.

They eventually worm their way into a lot of people&#039;s workflows, so there&#039;s no harm getting some experience with them now if you want to.

Such people who are very sensitive to this internal process have a hard time letting lose and drawing something they internally value negatively since the result they see ends up being linked to their self-worth, which is discouraging. So to sprout motivation they end up making these &quot;overly complex style-copying/construction&quot; in order to slowly rewrite this physical habit within themselves in a way which feels good to them.<br>Eventually they&#039;ll be able simplify the construction the more the target style is &quot;achieved&quot; (cont)", "time": 1671653765, "resto": 6420939}, {"no": 6431195, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)15:19:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "(cont) since it&#039;s likely what they initially set out for wasn&#039;t necessarily something final in itself anyway.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This was not meant to be an attack on others&#039; preferred methods of making art.

By significant errors, I mean the following. Perspective: the hat seems to be intended to be circular and viewed from below, and if that is the case, we should see most of the underside, but instead we see most of the top. Anatomy: the left and right hands have different finger widths and the right hand could not grip the pole properly in this position. Also there is no shape to the ankles, and a very long torso and upper legs compared to short lower legs. Line work: the line work is all of the same width and is concentrated in areas of higher detail, making them appear darker even when they are not in shadow. Hatching direction is inconsistent without any obvious reason to change directions in different areas. Rendering: the light seems to be coming from the left according to the fence and the clouds, but the grass casts shadows in the opposite direction - unless those are ripples, which is unclear. Some portions of the character are shaded, while the hands, face, and underside of the hat are not shaded. The transition from light to dark is abrupt in all areas without any form of feathering. <br><br>That said, the composition is nice and I like the way that the fishing rod and line bounces the eye back and forth.

The one on the left is named Boris and he&#039;s Russian. The only on the right is named Valerie and he&#039;s Finnish. The thing is Boris only speaks Russian so Val often has to speak Russian to him and even act as a interpreter for the Americans around them. I don&#039;t care much about Boris but I love Valerie&#039;s outfit and design. It looks so chic and stylish. The hair, the beret, the coat, the gloves, the boots. What else do I even have to say? I usually don&#039;t like fembois but I think I will make a exception just for this one because his design actually looks appealing.

Prior to treatment, the subjects (aged 8 to 17) were only able to discriminate between light and dark, with two of them also being able to determine the direction of a bright light. The surgical treatments took place between 2007 and 2010, and quickly brought the relevant subject from total congenital blindness to fully seeing. A carefully designed test was submitted to each subject within the next 48 hours. Based on its result, the experimenters concluded that the answer to Molyneux&#039;s problem is, in short, &quot;no&quot;. Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could distinguish between objects visually almost as effectively as they would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between an object perceived using the two different senses.

The method is just that. You can use tracing paper to check accuracy on your practice paper and that&#039;s what most traditional artists had been doing in the past. This method of study is usually called Master study but can be done as soon as you are just a beginner. It builds your ability to draw things correctly, transfering 3d objects onto 2d paper as well as building up your visual library. It&#039;s what artist had been doing for hundereds of years and a foolproof method. I know that this is hard when you just start out but be patient and you&#039;ll harvest sweet fruits in no time. Keep your way of methodology practice drawing as simple and direct as possible, consume solid knowledge from books written by foolproof professional artists (knowledge heavy based stuff like Color and Light by James Gurney rich visual enhhancement heavy based stuff like Monster Hunter Illustrations book). <br><br>See?
