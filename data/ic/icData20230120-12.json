I started at the age of 29 and even went to art school after. The difficulties are mostly psychological in nature. I was already established in my field, made good money and was regarded as a high achiever in things that required a logic/math oriented mind. Starting out people chuckled at my trash art, they saw it in contrast to my wagie achievements and also even felt safe to shit talk me, because &quot;I could take it right?&quot;.<br>Things got worse when I went to art school to try to become pro at some point. The school itself was great, and I didnt mind meeting younger people better than me, it was actually a blast. The bad part are family, partners, friends who actively discourage you &quot;from throwing your life and talent away&quot;. This continues to this day, I am 36 now and a decent artist. Yes I don&#039;t earn nearly as much as I did, but I am happy and don&#039;t feel depressed anymore. Still get offers from people in STEM &quot;to come work&quot; with them. It&#039;s meant well, but I can&#039;t help but feel hurt by the fact that the people closest to me think what I am doing is kind of a joke and they are still waiting for me to &quot;snap out of it&quot; and get a real job.<br>Just be prepared to find new art friends and be humble again. You will go from high regarded normie to nobody overnight. You will most likely not get support from the people you think who would, even worse you will get discouragement throughout. This, paired with the fact that you will have low confidence at first (because you are bad and even young kids are better than you) makes it incredibly hard to make it.

I&#039;ve been drawing since childhood. Didn&#039;t go in artscool or art classes. I drew cartoons, anime, some of my fantasies. My classmates thought that I was good at drawing, my parents also praised me. I thought I was good, when in reality I just drew like a child who loves to draw. In each class there are at least 1-2 such children. You know these guys, or maybe you were them.<br>With age, I began to draw less and less, by the age of 18-19 I drew maybe a couple of times a year.<br>But one time I needed to draw pictures for my text rpg, and god, I realized how shitty of this i was. <br>This caused me great pain, never in my life i hated and despised myself more.<br>So I took courses in academic drawing and painting. I was 27 at the time.<br>Now I&#039;m 31 and I still continue my education. By no means do I claim that I am a good artist now, I am not even close, but I see my growth with each work.<br><br>So, in my opinion, drawing as a child gives only two good things:<br>1. Fine motor skills develop.<br>2. You go through the drawing phase for fun as a teenager.<br><br>The first catches up very quickly, in just a couple of lessons you will already be good friends with a pencil/stylus.<br><br>The second point is what breaks many adult beginners.<br><br>The realization that before you start drawing your fantasies, you have to go through the hard and boring part. And it may take years. Those who have been drawing since childhood already had their fun. They have drawn cute anime girls, robots, disney princesses and monsters.They understand that it will not get better. And they will have to suffer. And accept it more humbly.<br><br>All this, of course, does not apply to those who studied in art schools as children, and then continued their studies in art at a college or university.

They look putrid. In general it&#039;s less unpleasant to sit through mediocre BW, because mediocre colour like digital airbrush or garish webtoon shit lowers the art as a whole, just look at the butchered right version in picrel.<br>So to answer the question, I prefer BW or simple on grounds of how comfortable they are to read, since they&#039;re harder to fuck up and I prefer comics that prioritise the flow of the narrative over making good individual &quot;illustrations&quot;(Alex Ross is a good artist but his comics feel very awkward to me)<br>Colour can be good but it&#039;s a whole new dimension of complexity added on top and if rushed it&#039;s often too generic to add to the storytelling, and by necessity if it doesn&#039;t have anything of meaning to add to the whole it&#039;ll detract from it.", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 850, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674204443699833, "time": 1674204443, "md5": "tNV0bxi6kcB95IhozhSlaw==", "fsize": 2289769, "resto": 6482017}, {"no": 6482084, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)03:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6482075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6482075</a><br>yeah, holy shit, that&#039;s awful.

It&#039;s very captivating and a whole tradition in and of itself, even back from the days of oldtimey book illustrations, and I think it&#039;s one of the reasons japanese comics are so successful. It makes for very immersive reading, I suggest checking out the bit about colour and BW in McCloud&#039;s Understanding Comics. I think it ties into the whole bit at the start about cartoonier characters being closer to meaning and text than they are to literal representations, so BW leaves more room for imagination and thus emotional attachment from the reader. Colour is more flashy and eye-catching to the general public, but it&#039;s not like they&#039;re a very enduring audience and anyone familiar with comics will be receptive to BW unless they&#039;re some capeshit consoomer.", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 861, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674205920862104, "time": 1674205920, "md5": "dPCkTbpDQdRLzUMI66I9jw==", "fsize": 2133387, "resto": 6482017}, {"no": 6482096, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)04:15:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6482017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6482017</a><br>mike mignola is one of the few modern artists who knows how to do color pages that don&#039;t hurt my eyes. <br>this isn&#039;t a problem with physical books though", "time": 1674206148, "resto": 6482017}, {"no": 6482098, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)04:20:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I think readers only value the color more based on the investment for reading.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them.

Follow big creators on Twitter and subscribe to webcomic related subreddits. Sometimes big creators need help with background assistants, inks, color flats, etc. Even Webtoons posts jobs for assistants. Don&#039;t expect a lot of cash from this though, working in webcomics is a lot of work with crunch deadlines. Even creators (like pic related) take advantage of their assistants, too. If you want to go through this route, have a portfolio of examples. If you 100% want a webcomic job, learn 3D modeling and get good at Sketchup and 3D modelling to make backgrounds.

Have not the developers of the program you are using designed the software in a way where all you have to do is press knobs and tick boxes to get the brush you want to use and is this not a \u201cmachine\u201d doing the work for you. If we were to get really specific, and even in this case this wouldn\u2019t work, the only valid form of human vs machine would be if the human used a Command Line Interface and therefore controlled each and every aspect of the drawing. However, it is inefficient to use such a thing in order to create digital art so it begs the question how art created by a propriety program is any different from a machine creating derivatives of a piece of artwork. Would a few brush strokes on the result be enough to say that it was then created by said human?

Both ink pen and wash are nice and I love the smell of ink.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oil</span><br>So much you can do with it from simple to incredibly complex. The luminosity of paints and the way layers shine through each other is beautiful. A medium that really is fantastic but takes a lot of thought and consideration into brush strokes, colors, temperature, drying time, even how much paint you load to make a good painting. Can start to become very expensive when buying mediums and more colors. Using a few tubes limits the color range you can get as you lose chroma from mixing but I&#039;m pretty sure there are some painters who use translucent layering from pure colors to get bright effects and having layers shine through together without needing to mix colors directly at all that they wouldn&#039;t be able to get from mixing. Slow drying.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Acrylic</span><br>Hard medium but a great challenge. I don&#039;t like the way colors look through layering but it might be a competency issue.

When I paint opaque with it my brush picks up the layer underneath because gouache reactivates very easily from water, which gives me awful colors, and trying to get around this with a thicker paint stroke makes my surface and layers uneven and thick giving them unintended texture. When using opaque strokes I lose values and chroma so I cannot reach the color notes I could get with translucent layering over the whiteness of the paper, or maybe I just don&#039;t know how to mix gouache I don&#039;t know.

I don&#039;t like using digital for lineart either, prefer to use a real pen instead.

Artists naturally have high egos and to imply that they do not have an ability in a skill that they think is beneath them--in this case, teaching--is far to incomprehensible for them to process. So instead of attempting to improve at the skill of teaching and finding other, more concrete ways of explaining something, they resort to shit-flinging and name-calling anyone who doesn&#039;t immediately understand their shit advice. <br><br>&quot;Just Draw&quot; is another one of those shit advice. It&#039;s pandered by artists who want to seem like they know a thing or two about drawing but are absolutely ignorant on the process of drawing. If you were to ask Kim Jung Gi why he makes the marks he makes, he could pull a bullshit answer out of his ass that will help literally no one except those who are already good at drawing. If he was being honest, he&#039;d just say to &quot;just draw&quot; because he doesn&#039;t know what specific things you need to do in order to improve and even if he did, he wouldn&#039;t be a good enough teacher to explain it properly. <br><br>This goes to my point in another thread about the PET acronym. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Performer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teacher</span><br>Nearly all of /ic/ are either performers or aspiring performers.

That is exactly why I immediately stopped using Reddit years ago on their LearnArt subreddit because it was literally just a bunch of people who were already good just showing off and asking for advice, and fucking getting it for some fucking reason, while beginners were just ignored or given horrible advice by other retards that can&#039;t draw. <br><br>Of course, after spending time on here, I started to realize that this place is simply a dopamanergic outlet for making you think like you&#039;re being productive when you are in fact not being productive at all.

Performers tend to not understand the process of being able to learn something and therefore are the worst teachers in that field. They tended to have received their skill by sheer mileage and have often taken decades to get to where they currently are. As they have not properly analyzed their approach and why they do certain things, they have an intuitive understanding of drawing which only helps them. Basically, performers cannot teach and can only perform. This is where you get the advice to &quot;just draw&quot; because performers tend to be the ones that actually take this advice seriously and tend to get good by sheer mileage rather than anything concrete that you can teach to anyone. <br><br>Teachers understand a skill at a much higher level than performers and while they may not be as good as the performers, they will often coach the performers regardless. Note how coaches in sports aren&#039;t usually better than the players on the team. (If they were, they&#039;d be mentors not teachers or coaches.) A teacher must have a very high level of understanding of whatever skill they are pursuing as they have to properly explain each and every step--otherwise, they&#039;re wasting everyone&#039;s time. <br><br>For instance, if we were to bring this back to drawing, lets say a beginner creates a drawing. You notice that the drawing is shit but because you are a performer, you can&#039;t exactly explain why it is shit.

But what I have &quot;most&quot; of are over 180 pages of a sprawling tale of Jeremey Prickles and a good 70 pages were literally storyboards of when I was able to Do It Properly, which means everything is made of separately drawn chunks pounded by Photoshop into story, So I drew it using the sketchbooks I was dragging into waiting rooms,and an epic story sprung from a random sketch of a demon head. It has both moments of revelation and whiplash pangs at your heart strings. I ordered a flatbed scanner so I can properly showcase my recent art,and the tale I am now telling,and the decision I have made. I am going to be 58 soon,and I am pondering how to proceed. I want to tell as many stories completely as I can, but I want to give the rendering enough work, to at least give a vague impression of what I was aiming for. To balance the art with the storytelling is a tightrope walk:in a page,I want to inch the story foward, at least from these current crop of characters (I had 3 storylines going at once,and all parties have joined up heading towards the end.). So I am just letting the story take me where it will.

I am thinking about reintroducing the Snowglobe story at some other venue, after I composed a few new strips summarizing the first few dozen of the first entries that were mere storyboards for when I was going to have the time to redo them properly, which never happened. That would mean also having the time to generate new strips,which,according to the news that I had at work,may once again be in short supply. But for now,I am just happy with what I am producing,warts and all, and will forge ahead whatever happens at the job. The other angle of creating/promoting the IP I had was to bundle everything up as the &quot;JP Experience&quot;,explaining that I am a Writer with an Artistic Bent(to offset the unprofessional art),and shop it around to agents hungry for exploitable new franchises to peddle.

This is the base of your painting, the building blocks, the sauce on the pizza. Colors are toppings, decoration, sprinkles of accent and emotion - but the base values need to be there. <br><br>Check out Airi Pan&#039;s Fool Proof Concept Art course.

If you want very detailed HD sprites, and don&#039;t wanna take forever nor spend a fortune hiring talent, is to cut back on animations. Work smart, adapt your ideas to a medium that will let you get away with shortcuts. <br>Visual novels. <br>TCGs. <br>Something like Paper Mario, where all characters are paper cut-outs and the animations are intentionally only a couple frames + some programmed stretched and squashing to give them life. <br>Another example of Stylistic shortcuts can be seen in Vanillaware&#039;s 13 sentinels, in the gameplay portions. They use super simple 3D models, and only HD high quality sprites and animations for the unit portraits and close ups of their attacks. <br>Fire Emblem/Advance Wars also worked like this, overworld units are like 2-3 frames only, even most of the animation attacks are only a couple keyframes, then they went all-in for the special attacks.<br>Another idea could be to do what games like Rayman, Drawn to Life, or the NDS Spore game did, where the body parts are straight up separate objects mostly moved around for animation rather than individually drawn animations. A lot of early 3D era games also worked in chunks, like you can see on games like Ocarina of Time that everyone&#039;s arms and legs are separate sausages clipping into each other rather than fully animated meshes.<br>Go for one of those shortcuts, and if need be, incorporate it into the art style and concept of the game. Make everyone be a puppet, or papercraft doll.<br>One last example of a clever shortcut: Return of the Obra Dinn. Guy learned 3D modeling from scratch, made some very simple and butt ugly models, but was smart to kinda cover them with stylistic filters so it&#039;s not too noticeable, and also made the smart call of making every scene be frozen in time, with the only real animation work needed done on the first person hand animations.", "time": 1673977451, "resto": 6478111}, {"no": 6478273, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)12:46:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6478260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6478260</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;clearly an elite artist could do better.</span><br>Most artists could do better.

A few hours a day thumbnailing for boards, and a few hours a day life drawing will take you insanely far. By the time you get around to finishing a board you will be better than you were.

They work hard or work for a long time to become this thing they want to be however because of this they become cynical, jaded, Do they truly love it? Are they creators, Artists or just people who can draw very well. <br>They spend a lot of money and time on the BEST NEW equipment thinking it will make them better and it does produce a better product but at the end of the day, there are two realms when it comes to professions like these (To put it simply, Call them abstract and then traditional) and one needs to respect the other whichever they reside in <br>It&#039;s much like /mu/ when you post music.<br>Your art is awesome OP, whoever this is. The use of white is incredibily impressive . I&#039;m always interested in art that needs to be closely looked at and when I draw, sometimes I try to draw something that is a bit &quot;tricky&quot; to discern what it truly is, Opening the work to multiple interpretations other than the artists.", "time": 1668912195, "resto": 6368757}, {"no": 6384524, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)00:56:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "These are actually great,

After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser. Then a honey-almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub. Then I apply an herb mint facial masque, which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.<br>I don\u2019t smoke. I only drink occasionally.

It&#039;s different for audio stuff tho. I can hear my thoughts in any voice, imagine music and instruments, sounds and stuff in my head. other senses like smell, touch and taste are less pronounced. I can feel imagined touch to some degree but taste and smell are basically not existent. I do differentiate between the third eye visualization, hypnagogia and dreams. I do dream and I see them just the same as if I&#039;m awake. I do see flashes when tired and shortly before going to sleep. for me that&#039;s working alright. but in the waking state I just see black when closing my eyes, I just see black when thinking of a person or an object.

Also i switched to new app which i need to learn and get feel for the different brush engine. The pics may look trivial but i dont feel trivially at all while doing them.

I honestly think you should ignore all these teachers who think you should be a human graphics card. Computers have had a baleful influence on art instruction, in that people look at wireframes and 3D models and think the goal is for you to be able to draw complex 3D constructions in violent perspective from any point of view. It&#039;s absurd. What&#039;s the point, anyway?<br>In most great figurative art of the past, perspective in the figures is not emphasized, because perspective entails distortion that, in depictions of the human figure, isn&#039;t pleasing to the eye. Art instruction books of the past tended to focus on the characteristic forms of the head, torso, limbs, etc. in repose and in action. You can learn this without turning everything into boxes and wireframes.<br>Yes, you should know the fundamentals of perspective (not difficult, read &quot;Perspective Made Easy&quot;). And yes, it is useful to draw cross-contours or think of cylinders and planes when foreshortening a limb, but turning this type of construction into a quasi-religion, as is being done here, is insane.<br>A useful and practical way of learning to draw, say, a thigh from the side view:<br>1. The attachment of the thigh to the trunk is higher in front than behind. So, too is the attachment of thigh to knee.<br>2. The front line is a gentle, convex curve with its peak closer to the top than the bottom, and inclined so the top is slightly forward in relation to the bottom. It runs from a little below the front pelvic point above, to just above the knee cap.<br>3. The back line is nearly straight from its start below the buttocks to its end just below the back of the knee. However, the upper two-thirds of this line bulges in a very subtle, convex curve.<br>And so on. Curved lines, straight lines and angles. If you can write the letter C, you can draw a curved line.

I need to feel passionate about something and anxiety blocks me completely.<br><br>First you need to get rid of your anxiety. This is hard...but you need to forgive yourself for not meeting your expectation. Work on accepting that you will get better with time but it won&#039;t be now. But everytime you draw you will get there eventually. So stop focusing on what you want your picture to be and focus on the small improvements you make on the way.

If i&#039;m not...everything seems insurmentable.<br>But i&#039;m not motivated.

Redo values studies and try again etc...<br><br>Well how to motivate yourself is not easy...but it&#039;s possible. <br><br>And the last part is. Accept that what you want and what the client needs aren&#039;t the same thing. The client is happy with mediocre most of the time and you well get what you want...but not now. But if you trust the process and keep at it eventually you&#039;ll get there. <br>You&#039;ll get other clients later. Don&#039;t bet everything you have on this one comission...it won&#039;t happen anyway.<br><br>Be patient. And if you can&#039;t get to work because you avoid feeling bad. Then start with forcing yourself to feel bad and sit with the bad feeling for a while...then stop and do something.
