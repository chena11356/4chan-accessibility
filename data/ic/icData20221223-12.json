OpenAI is pretty good with this as they have many of their technologies closed source and keep them locked in a cage away from the public for long time before releasing them. They should focus more on researching the endgame AI asap instead of focusing on researching ways to use already invented AI to replace jobs and create mass unemployment.

Lets say that the training data was limited and only contained pictures of spiderman, batman and superman. If I showed a child what all of these are, explained what they do, and then asked the kid to make me a new superhero, the kid would associate characteristics like superpowers and shiny spandex with superheroes and make me original superhero. It is still derivative, but if I asked the same from Stable Diffusion, it will give me spiderman wearing black cape with superman logo on it. It is mishmash of the characters and some of the generations would contain just weird looking superman, thus copying the source material. This will keep happening because the AI model does not learn like human, it just sees images and names given to them, while humans can understand characteristics and can know more then just the images themselves. In this case it would not be actual copyright infringement, but you get the point. Even if you dont ask it to make Mickey the Mouse, it will still have tendency to sometimes create Mickey the Mouse. Also lot of the models are kind of trained by your output. Like for example if some cloud imagegen makes you 5 images and you choose the best one looking, that app will take that image and conclude that this is the best one out of them, so it will then use it as reference and learn better from it. This is also the reason why ChatGPT is better then GPT-3 despite being smaller mode. GPT-3 is just fed crapped data from the internet, while ChatGPT is thought trough human interaction, and then that human interaction fed into another AI that then trains the ChatGPT and so on.

I&#039;ve never used the Micron one but it&#039;s probably fine.<br>A lot of manga artists do use fineliners, but it&#039;s usually for details, hatching or speech bubbles. Maru nibs produce similarly thin lines, but they can thicken a bit if you press harder. You can still get super delicate lines out of a pen or brush if you&#039;re skilled enough, Akihito Yoshitomi does a lot of detailed machine drawings with dip pens on YouTube if you&#039;re interested in watching someone ink in real time.<br>That&#039;s not to say nobody ever inks mainly with fineliners, and I think they were common in shoujo manga in the 2000s.

watch now that ive learned to paint, but it was by far the best youtube channel for learning acrylic painting, mixing paint, and, most importantly, how much fucking water you need to do anything. if you struggle with painting, you probably dont use enough water. most do speed paint no commentary. he has hours long videos step by step explaining exact brush, showing how much water, how to mix the paint by parts (1 part white, 1 part red, 2 parts blue, etc) and how that helps you make bigger amount or recreate the color or how to go from the one color to a lighter one or bring back contrast, etc as you are trying to match a color. very informative and well worth doing some paint alongs if you want to get into it.<br><br>bradwynn jones seems to have given up on his channel, but the videos are still there. if you struggle with drawing portraits or loomis, he is a godsend. youll learn so much from following along. has loomis plate videos, but usually just uses a pintrest/instagram portrait and draws from that reference. combines loomis with reilly rhythms and explains every step hes making, how he measures relative distances and how they relate back to loomis or reilly or basic anatomy. goes from construction to finished lines to rendering for most videos. another well worth checking out if you want to learn to draw using these techniques. <br><br>richard friend is comic book inker and arguably one of the best. from a time when it was skill based and not just digital tracing of tumblr artists at marvel and dc that they have today. he mostly does art books and creator

It builds your ability to draw things correctly, transfering 3d objects onto 2d paper as well as building up your visual library.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

If it doesn&#039;t work as a link,look for Confess Your Art Sins. To spare you, I will summarize: what I wanted to do as a webcomic was a newspaper sized strip,something that I could make within a week consistantly, and ready for collating into hard copy collections and syndication. What happened was I got involved with a single mother who devoured my life and time. I couldn&#039;t be near my computer and assemble the strips in Photoshop, so I decided to take a sketchbook to the next waiting room I was marooned in, drew a demon head, and thought about why it was there,and suddenly a new story unfolded, and I spent 180 issues telling it before my website had to go away. But as to &quot;quality&quot;,that is debatable. Like this strip, I was not planning on uploading them to the website as my Content, at first being very quick rough storyboards of what I would eventually redo as a properly processed product, more focused on storytelling and deciding what characters would say than adding real artwork to them. I remember apologizing for the lapse,the processed comic strip was only 4 strips in and I was working on the 5th when life sideswiped me,so I let the story dictate the art,and it was much later that I realized that the complete monopoly of my time was the new paradigm. So I put more effort into the strips,and much later on I found the time to clean up the word balloons and tweak the art in Photoshop. You adapt,because the story must be told.

This painting was controversial at its time, and panned, as it&#039;s not good art and even plain embarrassing.<br>Why?<br>Because it&#039;s silly, pathetic and juvenile. Think of what the artist, a young Cabanel, is saying with this pic. &quot;Lucifer was just like me, a young misunderstood genius who was wronged!&quot; and he painted it with all of his skill as big as he could make it, and made Lucifer as buff as a caricature, even compared to classic greek sculptures of Zeus. Lucifer being more buff than Zeus shows him as physically powerful and &quot;healthful&quot;, which is a failure to understand the classical worship of beauty as virility and might. Lucifer is crying miserably, it doesn&#039;t make sense for him to exude power and health to such extreme extent.

And that&#039;s always recognition from other humans, not master in itself.<br><br>In conclusion, skill was never what mattered. You can find examples of doodles and memes being far more popular than skillful art that took dozens of hours. Art was always about the artist, the message his art tries to convey, the communication. How the skill is used and for what purpose, rather than how much skill is used. This should frame how AI art is viewed. Art can win in skill, but it can&#039;t win in message because it has none.

By significant errors, I mean the following. Perspective: the hat seems to be intended to be circular and viewed from below, and if that is the case, we should see most of the underside, but instead we see most of the top. Anatomy: the left and right hands have different finger widths and the right hand could not grip the pole properly in this position. Also there is no shape to the ankles, and a very long torso and upper legs compared to short lower legs. Line work: the line work is all of the same width and is concentrated in areas of higher detail, making them appear darker even when they are not in shadow. Hatching direction is inconsistent without any obvious reason to change directions in different areas. Rendering: the light seems to be coming from the left according to the fence and the clouds, but the grass casts shadows in the opposite direction - unless those are ripples, which is unclear. Some portions of the character are shaded, while the hands, face, and underside of the hat are not shaded. The transition from light to dark is abrupt in all areas without any form of feathering. <br><br>That said, the composition is nice and I like the way that the fishing rod and line bounces the eye back and forth.

You&#039;ll see that there is a large range from white to black<br><br>Second, try a smaller brush size. Your lines are much thicker than the art that you have sent.<br><br>my only other advice to give is.. hwve you studied color theory yet? It comes naturally to some people, but if it hasn&#039;t for you, I&#039;d try one of those tumblr era color pallete challenges where you only use the 5-6 colors in a pallete that you like. Over time, it will come naturally. I still copy colors from existing pieces, because some times it helps when i have no clue what to do for the colors.", "time": 1670209933, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403270, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)23:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403190</a><br>This is all really helpful!

Anime tends to be very saturated so until you get a feel for recognizing how to pick the colors yourself in your program of choice without cheating, you can do that. Personally I tend to underestimate how saturated something is when I pick colors. Another thing that might throw you off is working on a white background. I usually do lineart and coloring on top of a very light cool gray (contrasts with skin well and is easier on eyes, and even traditional paper is never pure white due to lighting), and you can leave it that way until you&#039;re done assuming it&#039;s just a figure floating in a void.", "time": 1670223260, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403537, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:43:59", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "sockless_clean_nude_small22", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 938, "h": 928, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1670244239670402, "time": 1670244239, "md5": "WquUZ9yDFZnq84XSYETCow==", "fsize": 80735, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403547, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:01:15", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "ABI 5gkg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1199, "h": 729, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1670245275789164, "time": 1670245275, "md5": "d4cjd1iP38F+veSslysfSA==", "fsize": 111495, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403551, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:08:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "kjhlh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1139, "h": 1351, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670245726000965, "time": 1670245726, "md5": "AJfHypSTKptmK2MDS55KGQ==", "fsize": 278790, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403553, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:09:24", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "dolce2gg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 836, "h": 830, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1670245764877216, "time": 1670245764, "md5": "YqznX7oOPtuLZQRY6IMPVQ==", "fsize": 91475, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403913, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:00:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403547</a><br>really nice faces, any specific inspirations for that kind of style?", "time": 1670270410, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403932, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Animation style design", "filename": "final-003", "ext": ".png", "w": 728, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 59, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670271697130667, "time": 1670271697, "md5": "BdjVycXH6zrH3DcYGwgiog==", "fsize": 212786, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403984, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402107</a><br>I\u2019ve been demoted from art poster to lurker", "time": 1670273661, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404186, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)18:26:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399248</a><br>choco malk", "filename": "gamearabqnnudeshade", "ext": ".png", "w": 937, "h": 865, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1670282805033524, "time": 1670282805, "md5": "I8Ua0f/hvqewH7EjAscSsQ==", "fsize": 522693, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404365, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)21:37:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399248</a><br>Lads I started learning to draw so I can make my own degen fetish art and I&#039;ve got to say I&#039;m having even more fun than I thought.", "filename": "locked_up1", "ext": ".png", "w": 950, "h": 798, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1670294231249579, "time": 1670294231, "md5": "9463t/Agvrw9KTMQerse8Q==", "fsize": 275020, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404620, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)04:04:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Figuring out how to color genitals.

Removing Noise<br>In a normal text-to-image run of Stable Diffusion, we feed the model some random noise.

It does this over a bunch of steps (e.g., 50), gradually removing a little more noise each time.<br><br>With img2img, we do actually bury a real image (the one you provide) under a bunch of noise. And this causes Stable Diffusion to \u201crecover\u201d something that looks much closer to the one you supplied.<br><br>2.2.

Right now the general process I&#039;m using is as follows:<br>1. Rough pencil sketch with reference, has guide lines for volume<br>2. Rough outline of that with thicker line for clarity, might add some facial features<br>3. Another outline, maybe adding a few more details<br>4.

But I&#039;m not sure if this is the best approach or if I should be focusing in something else, I did a lot of shapes(boxes, cubes, circles, etc) from different angles and played stacking them up as a starting excercise.
