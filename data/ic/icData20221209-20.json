Many were entered at an age young enough that they wouldn&#039;t&#039;ve shown much skill at all. Andrea del Sarto was apprenticed at 7 years of age. He was a son of a tailor, and was apprenticed to a goldsmith because he liked to draw.

It sets out to tell a story with epic fights and it does that pretty well, and the writing and art works together to achieve that. You&#039;re what I&#039;m talking about when I say &quot;missing the appeal&quot;. If somebody wants a good story, they read a book. If somebody wants good art, they look at an artbook. When somebody wants art and story working together, they read a comic. Obviously individuals are going to have preferences for what art they like and what stories they like, but this doesn&#039;t change the fact that art and story are inseparable in comics and the result of trying to separate them is uncanny.<br><br><a href=\"#p6406785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6406785</a><br>Again, you&#039;re missing the point.

You&#039;d understand this if you ever made comics, or movies, or really any storytelling medium that blends other mediums to tell a story. It&#039;s not as simple as throwing some text or audio on an image, there&#039;s much more to it than that. Choosing what image, how you draw it, how you phrase the text, if you use text at all or a lot of it etc are all STORYTELLING choices that are not STORY choices. Do you understand? It&#039;s a fundamental part of making comics to tell a story with visuals, and it takes skill to do so.<br>To use another medium as an example to help clarify: moviemakers are not necessarily photographers, because shooting a movie uses multiple mediums to tell a story, while a photographer&#039;s primary (and perhaps only) goal is capture a single moment or a series of single moments, to show off a bunch of pretty pictures. They are fundamentally different, and a movie can succeed at telling a story with visuals and sound and movement while not having very many pretty pictures at all, or not having very good writing or whatever.", "time": 1670459161, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6408458, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)06:42:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402047</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;/ic/ who draws once a week at best thinks it&#039;s easy to draw a weekly or biweekly manga</span><br>Yeah good luck", "time": 1670586167, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6408499, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)07:46:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6406802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6406802</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When somebody wants art and story working together</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they consume animation, or video games, not comics</span><br>Dumbest poster I&#039;ve read so far today", "time": 1670590008, "resto": 6402047}], "last_modified": 1670590008}, {"no": 6367918, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)01:11:21", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Art Supplies Thread: AI fags drowned us again edition.", "com": "Previous: &gt;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;6302747</span><br>No art supplies thread so I made one.<br>Is artist grade Gouache worth it?

Even then, it&#039;s really hard to monetize the content you produce. And yes, if you&#039;re managing your own company, you won&#039;t have much time to draw at all. That&#039;s business work and therefore done by businessmen. You should also keep in mind that doing your own indie projects won&#039;t net you much gain unless you get the funds to make em in the first place, market them, and then strike a deal to sell them somewhere. Even then, pirating animation is like the easiest shit, so be aware of that. And be prepared to work as a third party for bigger companies, you&#039;ll be doing a lot of ads and shit. Nothing really that creative. I&#039;ve thought long about this all because I have the same dream, but lets be realistic here. You&#039;d be better off joining some indie studio and pitching your stuff to them with the expectation that they MIGHT give you the greenlight, and then you have to actively work on your project but it most likely wont legally belong to you, so you have to fight with other people for the right to decide what should and shouldn&#039;t be done in your projects. You&#039;d be real lucky if they also don&#039;t fire your ass afterwards, even if the IP turns out to be very profitable, leaving you with jack shit for all the work you put.

It&#039;s not that interesting and it doesn&#039;t really help you, unless you&#039;re teaching or trying to source/formulate an argument.<br><br>Here&#039;s the main points:<br><br>1.) Draw what you see. This is easier said than done, but it&#039;s the hard truth. The head isn&#039;t a circle, so don&#039;t draw it that way. We&#039;re not doing smiley faces unless we&#039;re illustrators and deliberately want that.<br><br>2.) Reset your eyes. Your brain and eyes are constantly trying to deceive you. So don&#039;t let them. Flip the page, take a break, whatever.<br><br>3.) You can learn to draw. It&#039;s an acquired skill. HOWEVER, interest and ability seem to be strongly correlated. Interest is likely innate/nature -- therefore making talent seem like a God-given trait. The longer you work, the more progress you will see. Just like lifting weights or doing math. If you can persevere, you can learn art. But you may not have an inherent interest in shapes and color, just as I have no interest in moving iron and dating.<br><br>4.) No rules, only tools.

Its pretty common for characters who are not native English speakers to drop words from their native language in dialogue. But it&#039;s also possible he&#039;s not French at all and just likes dropping French words in order to seem classy and sophisticated. But he&#039;s too well dressed. Only French people dress that well in general.
