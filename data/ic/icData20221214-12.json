AI bros use copyrighted pictures all the time without any shame. The reason that music gets pass is because there is less amount of frequencies in a song then there is pixels in picture. And there is way less desirable combinations of sound then there is combinations of shapes and colors. Most human music follows few sets of tempos that align with our biological mechanisms like breathing or heartrate. Instruments can only do so many sounds, and the same is for electro dubstep. If you let AI loose on music, it would start creating almost the exact copies of songs that listener would not be able to tell apart when listening to them for comparison. With Ai pictures and videos you cant say the same. Ask Ai to generate some public domain painting like the Starry Night from Vincent. It will give you blurry meshes that have incorrect number of clouds, some stars different and so on. Now if you listen to the music, it will become way way harder to notice, especially when the Ai is trained on certain human tempo that funnels certain sounds into their specific holes. If you looked at the diagram of the sound, you could easily see the differences, but when hearing it, not so much. This alone is enough to discourage the AI trainers from putting there copyrighted music, not because music copyright has privilege, but because they are too scared of overfitting that is much easier with music then with pictures.", "time": 1670890775, "resto": 6413359}, {"no": 6413623, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)19:22:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6413359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6413359</a><br>learning animation is still extremely important. the platforms available now can barely grasp a coherent image.

It\u2019s an escape to a world where we can fill that void for a mere moment in time, to maybe stave off the pain just a little bit.<br><br>I don\u2019t know about anyone else but creating shit has been therapeutic more than anything else. Life is hard and people get left behind. I think expression frees you from the shackles of being left behind, maybe not all the way but a little bit. It at least gives you enough room to breathe. A way to offload some of the pain.idk", "filename": "A89DA446-C774-46AF-9DA1-1CDB37279639", "ext": ".gif", "w": 476, "h": 333, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1670282155364202, "time": 1670282155, "md5": "kCMt464prV0hsG/uEgJMiA==", "fsize": 2924191, "resto": 6403728}, {"no": 6404169, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)18:17:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403728</a><br>I genuinely believe I&#039;m better than all of you.", "time": 1670282221, "resto": 6403728}, {"no": 6404172, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)18:18:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403728</a><br>I keep falling for my art friends and it&#039;s fucking with my head. <br><br>I used to be more resilient in keeping my feelings in check around women, especially when it comes to art communities, but lately it&#039;s been going out of control.

I usually do lineart and coloring on top of a very light cool gray (contrasts with skin well and is easier on eyes, and even traditional paper is never pure white due to lighting), and you can leave it that way until you&#039;re done assuming it&#039;s just a figure floating in a void.", "time": 1670223260, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403537, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:43:59", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "sockless_clean_nude_small22", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 938, "h": 928, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1670244239670402, "time": 1670244239, "md5": "WquUZ9yDFZnq84XSYETCow==", "fsize": 80735, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403547, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:01:15", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "ABI 5gkg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1199, "h": 729, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1670245275789164, "time": 1670245275, "md5": "d4cjd1iP38F+veSslysfSA==", "fsize": 111495, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403551, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:08:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "kjhlh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1139, "h": 1351, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670245726000965, "time": 1670245726, "md5": "AJfHypSTKptmK2MDS55KGQ==", "fsize": 278790, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403553, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:09:24", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "dolce2gg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 836, "h": 830, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1670245764877216, "time": 1670245764, "md5": "YqznX7oOPtuLZQRY6IMPVQ==", "fsize": 91475, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403913, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:00:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403547</a><br>really nice faces, any specific inspirations for that kind of style?", "time": 1670270410, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403932, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Animation style design", "filename": "final-003", "ext": ".png", "w": 728, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 59, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670271697130667, "time": 1670271697, "md5": "BdjVycXH6zrH3DcYGwgiog==", "fsize": 212786, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6403984, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402107</a><br>I\u2019ve been demoted from art poster to lurker", "time": 1670273661, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404186, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)18:26:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399248</a><br>choco malk", "filename": "gamearabqnnudeshade", "ext": ".png", "w": 937, "h": 865, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1670282805033524, "time": 1670282805, "md5": "I8Ua0f/hvqewH7EjAscSsQ==", "fsize": 522693, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404365, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)21:37:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6399248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6399248</a><br>Lads I started learning to draw so I can make my own degen fetish art and I&#039;ve got to say I&#039;m having even more fun than I thought.", "filename": "locked_up1", "ext": ".png", "w": 950, "h": 798, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1670294231249579, "time": 1670294231, "md5": "9463t/Agvrw9KTMQerse8Q==", "fsize": 275020, "resto": 6399248}, {"no": 6404620, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)04:04:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Figuring out how to color genitals.

Sure you could draw literally whatever and say that&#039;s your artistic rendition of it, but so you could link a randomness function to atmospheric noise and then tell computer to make lines on canvas based on the random numbers. Both results would be drawn without any sort of reference, and both would be bullshit scribbles. Only way you are going to draw it properly is if you have photos and references of it, same for AI, you have to feed it photos of ultraviolet spectrometer to get an output of said ultraviolet spectrometer. And if you overfit it, you&#039;ll get images very close to original input since it works on basis of denoising.

I would imagine many or most of you could draw something better looking than this, so I hope this pushes you towards doing it yourselves. Got some notes of my own, but I&#039;d like other comments.<br><br>So starting off, I wanted to rectify one of my issues, in which it wasn&#039;t really clear where the characters were. Since that was clear, I wanted to immediately establish the Haunted House. I originally tried to draw the whole thing, but that took up too much space to even try to make it readable, so I cut out everything except the top, I think this was a fine decision. The first issue was the door. I was gonna have the door peeping open, then show the inside of the haunted house, cutting to the characters on the 2nd page. I realized that&#039;d leave me with barely any time for the &#039;plot&#039;, so I kept the door, and had the scaring faces.<br><br>As I was drawing the 2nd page, it felt obvious to me that I should have scrapped the door, to give more space for the scaring, to show more of the ones being scared, cause cutting straight to the scared faces on the 2nd page seems kind of abrupt, the build-up didn&#039;t seem enough for it as it stands.<br><br>If that was fixed, I think the top two panels of the 2nd page would be serviceable. As for the third panel on the 2nd page, I originally had all three of the scarers on the same page, to re-establish the fact that there were three of them. But I realized that with the current plan, I would have had almost a repeat looking structure. The vampire girl would have asked the last question in this panel, by the way.<br><br> I ended up changing the last panel as well. It was originally two, where the pumpkin head was going to ask who the girl was talking to, and it would cut to a similar looking panel as the current last, just a bit more squeezed. Speaking of that last panel, my lack of ability in perspective showed itself, I feel the idea (that the ghost disappeared) wasn&#039;t portrayed well.", "filename": "Comic7_005", "ext": ".png", "w": 1155, "h": 746, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1670297120893740, "time": 1670297120, "md5": "If4E5CZprTuTDf9fLg42kA==", "fsize": 543394, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404383, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:26:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6403991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6403991</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://medibang.com/mpc/</span><br>is he the only consistent creator on manga dex ?<br><br>I mean pumping out 40 pages is pretty fucking impressive .", "time": 1670297201, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404390, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:33:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404383</a><br>fuck , forgot picrel", "filename": "Consistent", "ext": ".png", "w": 654, "h": 448, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1670297621886711, "time": 1670297621, "md5": "SQi2r9DKIKM4db7EZmEBMA==", "fsize": 306282, "resto": 6403987}, {"no": 6404395, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)22:38:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404174</a><br>Aside from a convention, is there any more formal way to go about it?

I wish the bottom image was more INTENSE. The guy on the rights elbow should be slightly further back (like he&#039;s really PULLING left towards him) and with that same pulling motion the angle on his elbow should be closer together and the fist would be quite higher (the elbow going from 90 degree to around 45?). Also humans are really heavy so right would probably be leaning towards left at a stronger more dominant angle, which would make the scene more uncomfortable/tense having their faces closer. With that in mind I&#039;d change lefts posture too, to make them pulling away from right, with an arch in the back. With the stronger more dynamic pose, lefts t shirt would be getting pulled further up the back on the neck with more stretch and tension in the material.

There&#039;s no direct equivalent to this in digital since digital ink doesn&#039;t bleed, but you can minimize the effect by applying a blur before you export.

Like on the feet you have some double wide lines right on the end of them and it just looks messy so get rid of those. You have that too at the bottom of your character&#039;s head which could be seen as shadowing, but unless you emphasize it a bit more to me it just looks like a blob of messy linework.<br><br>In addition you have lots of doubling going on with your linework in general and while it can be a stylistic choice, typically it looks better to get rid of them. The pic here shows what I&#039;m talking about and no I don&#039;t know what it says, it was just the best image I could find to display it.<br><br>You also want to generally avoid outlines from different elements of a character intersecting. Like the outlines of the dude&#039;s eyes and hair meet and it looks messy so try and keep the lines one pixel in width so the lines are clean or provide a gap between the two elements so each part is distinct.<br><br>Other than some simple line cleanup your little dude looks good! I always have trouble getting eyes to look good with pixels and those look nice.

(although any on-brand types of clay should be safe from toxins, there used to be a toxic plastic mixed in but most brands has removed this.) <br>When buying clay there is a typical difference between more expensive and cheaper brands, FIMO is a good lower cost brand, which does have some flexibility in the finished items.<br>I personally am planning to bulk buy cosclay, cosclay is even more flexible than Fimo.<br>When buying polymer clay you may notice there is a soft, medium and harder type - harder is more difficult to form, however it keeps details and frankly the soft clay will just fall apart if you are trying to make a standing clay sculpture.<br>For painting the sculpture I recommend using acryllic paint, fitting as that too is artificial plastics<br>Good luck with the arts anon", "time": 1670702435, "resto": 6409615}, {"no": 6410094, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)15:46:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6410055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6410055</a><br>Hello there.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The clay you are looking for is Polymer Clay</span><br>I&#039;m not really interested in baking clay.<br>I&#039;m using it to practice sculpting ultimately I plan on going into a mixed process where some things I sculpt in Chavant and then scan into the computer to fix or model further in the PC. <br><br>Like you can see there is no real need for baking it for me.<br><br>I plan on using plastic pins to hold some parts of the sculpture together. and their nature will make it trivial to simply assemble the sculpt for scanning (the horns can be problematic) and reassemble it in the PC.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Good luck with the arts anon</span><br>Thanks.<br><br>Does literally anyone know how to work with monster clay ?

To understand why it&#039;s as such you&#039;d need to study Japanese society and the psychological aspect behind the evolution of such artistic style. Once you do you then understand the groups of people in the West who like it vs. those who don&#039;t like it and the differences between their respective cognitions. One key reason is how much the average American/Westerner cares about how they are seen by others and whether they abide to what&#039;s &quot;objective&quot; or not, and thus how much they themselves get subconsciously shaped by others in the process.<br><br>That&#039;s one perspective. Others exist and continue to come through.<br>For example it&#039;s been a few years now that Western women artists (and those who identify with them) have been vehemently against anime because it often represents youth and beauty at a level which makes them personally feel uncomfortable at a less conscious level. This is a not a popular or nice thing to say (the truth never is really), but women&#039;s value are still very rooted in their appearance. As women get into their mid-20s and approach their 30s they watch their value decay and they come to understand that they simply cannot match the intuitive idealized expectation of most men anymore from a beauty standpoint (which anime showcases well on a certain level). The opposite isn&#039;t true: I don&#039;t think there are many guys feeling envious of anime guys. They appear cool and that&#039;s it, or if anything they can inspire growth.<br>This is why we&#039;re now witnessing an epidemy on social medias (and even this board now) with them calling any artist who dares to like anime &quot;pedos&quot; and whatnot, as a way to try and shape the norms, to shape reality, in a way that is more comfortable to them and can bring power back to them in this gender dynamic seen from a larger scale.", "time": 1670616243, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408884, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)15:54:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "watercolor practice", "filename": "221209", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1115, "tn_w": 112, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670619270032144, "time": 1670619270, "md5": "958gzWBKoIS8MV+6d4uEXQ==", "fsize": 414201, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408908, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:26:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6408772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6408772</a><br>Which tablet are you getting?", "time": 1670621196, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408909, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:27:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6408908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6408908</a><br>one of the screenless wacom ones", "time": 1670621267, "resto": 6396505}, {"no": 6408928, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:55:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6404199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6404199</a><br>Post your work first asshole then I will honestly post mine.

I have to try and larp as my characters whenever I try to write dialogue between them. I like to put two characters in a conversation and usually have them talk about whatever. I think putting characters together and having them discuss their ideas on whatever topics can help flesh them out as individuals rather than just character tropes. I usually like to put characters with opposing beliefs against each other. I think something helpful is also having someone to bounce ideas off of. I used to &quot;roleplay&quot; with other people, but it&#039;s not like the typical weird ERP roleplaying. It was more similar to writing an actual story where you choose a setting and each person takes turn writing full paragraphs and improv. There was a much stronger focus on writing an actual story and dialogue. You could consider it as writing a story with a partner rather than roleplaying. It&#039;s sounds cringe but it did help me empathize more with my characters and try to understand them. It also helped me understand how other people characterize and write their own characters.

She&#039;s also mexican, but a cosplayer. And also has massive jugs, that she doesn&#039;t really show. And her style is pretty meh, just some chubby anime-esque bitches.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OG alcohol based brush marker, but it&#039;s basically the standard. I would have recommended Prismacolor last year if you didn&#039;t want to splurge on Copics, but I think they&#039;re discontinuing the line since I&#039;ve been seeing them on major clearance at every art store. With that being said, you could easily get a good deal. I personally prefer Copics over all of the alternate brands (Ohuhu is my least favorite and I think they give Instagram/YouTube artists free sets for the good reviews because they kinda suck in person). If you want new, you can buy them for cheapest on Blick. After Christmas, you&#039;ll see a lot of sets for sale on sites like Mercari and that&#039;s where I got mine for a really good deal. I like that Copics are refillable, and they get a lot cheaper to use when you&#039;re refilling them. Other good Copic alternate brands I like are Kuretake and Tombow (make sure not to accidentally get their water markers).

The picture might look soulful in any way you could compare with other pictures, but once you namedrop the AI, it will quickly lose the interest of certain chunk of the demographic. When AI becomes widely accessible to everyone of no skill level, and it gets revealed that most artists are in fact just AIs that dont tag their images as AI generated, people will quickly hop on the train, every normie will become artist, and then the fad will go away and people will be no longer interested in it, but they will also lose interest with real art as well, since why even bother caring about something that every idiot with internet connection can do in 5 seconds.

In fact, it&#039;s the type of artstyle normies are usually most impressed by. What I think will happen is that people will indeed lose interest in ai shit (they already are) and more and more art related communities will start kicking ai prompters out, until all they have left is their subreddits and discords. People will put disclaimers like &quot;100% human created&quot; when posting artwork (I&#039;ve already seen twitterfags do it), 4chan drawthreads will put &quot;no ai&quot; into their OP (I&#039;ve already seem that on /co/) and eventually, it will simply turn into an obscure niche that only certain dedicated autists will care about. <br><br>The reason why the &quot;globohomo artstyle&quot; is so hated it&#039;s because coorporations overuse it RIGHT NOW.

Huge industries, like the entire entertainment business, would risk getting replaced by algorithms. Coorporations might be evil but they still care about self-preservation, not to mention the political implications of millions of people losing their income.

It&#039;s not as simple as throwing some text or audio on an image, there&#039;s much more to it than that. Choosing what image, how you draw it, how you phrase the text, if you use text at all or a lot of it etc are all STORYTELLING choices that are not STORY choices. Do you understand? It&#039;s a fundamental part of making comics to tell a story with visuals, and it takes skill to do so.<br>To use another medium as an example to help clarify: moviemakers are not necessarily photographers, because shooting a movie uses multiple mediums to tell a story, while a photographer&#039;s primary (and perhaps only) goal is capture a single moment or a series of single moments, to show off a bunch of pretty pictures. They are fundamentally different, and a movie can succeed at telling a story with visuals and sound and movement while not having very many pretty pictures at all, or not having very good writing or whatever.", "time": 1670459161, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6408458, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)06:42:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402047</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;/ic/ who draws once a week at best thinks it&#039;s easy to draw a weekly or biweekly manga</span><br>Yeah good luck", "time": 1670586167, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6408499, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)07:46:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6406802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6406802</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When somebody wants art and story working together</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they consume animation, or video games, not comics</span><br>Dumbest poster I&#039;ve read so far today", "time": 1670590008, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6411296, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)16:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402047</a>", "filename": "32d", "ext": ".png", "w": 680, "h": 976, "tn_w": 87, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1670795405068593, "time": 1670795405, "md5": "Z0mfP0bDUqV3s7jgjBLU5A==", "fsize": 261905, "resto": 6402047}, {"no": 6411298, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)16:52:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6402639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6402639</a><br>That&#039;s a very hard artstyle, Anon.

Here&#039;s my shitty translation of a random passage:<br>&quot;The size of the male outer genitalia as we see them in the works of the old masters varies quite a lot. Firstly because they are from different geographic locations, secondly because we have to measure them by the dimensions of other parts of the body, such as the length of the fingers, the width of the palm, forearm, thigh, calf etc. For instance, Egyptian sculptures have rather large phalluses, straight or slightly bent. Characters on Grecian urns have phalluses of a similar size as what we have noted in a contemporary context; but many phalluses are abnormally large, grotesque, and some erect; the foreskin tends to be pulled back over the glans.&quot;", "time": 1670780768, "resto": 6411031}, {"no": 6411152, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)14:42:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411031</a><br><a href=\"#p6411039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411039</a><br>post the name of the book, i bet if you put it into google it will find it easily.", "time": 1670787764, "resto": 6411031}, {"no": 6411168, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:00:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411031</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not like racial shit or anything like that</span><br>yeah, not racist but speciesist.<br>the reason why physiognomy went out of fashion is for the same reason why phrenology went out of fashion - because when people start noticing patterns and studying these things too much then they might arrive at *certain conclusions*, just like how hitler arrived at *certain conclusions*", "filename": "z", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 242, "h": 400, "tn_w": 75, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670788840582208, "time": 1670788840, "md5": "IsLyRmY9DfUaWvbIFoRl1w==", "fsize": 25421, "resto": 6411031}, {"no": 6411170, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:02:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411168</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;white&quot; is represented as a literal marble statue</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;african is some ugly bushman fucker</span><br>kek<br>really?", "time": 1670788960, "resto": 6411031}, {"no": 6411210, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:29:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411170</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;does phsyiognomy </span><br>&quot;woah, that&#039;s so cool!&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starts incorporating different humans types and monkeys into the practice</span><br>&quot;yikes, that&#039;s problematic&quot;", "filename": "z", "ext": ".png", "w": 444, "h": 544, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670790562297841, "time": 1670790562, "md5": "+uvcc9fdJM3Qgm+UvnkaTg==", "fsize": 300105, "resto": 6411031}, {"no": 6411212, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:31:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411031</a><br>those are some scary fucking eyes", "time": 1670790694, "resto": 6411031}, {"no": 6411220, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:37:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411210</a><br>you are talking about prognathism, not some crazy new thing.", "time": 1670791058, "resto": 6411031}, {"no": 6411224, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:43:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6411210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6411210</a><br>Censorship is good if it shuts up people like you.

Really, learn to use it as a tool and a way to improve what you make by hand. Its simply a way for artists to make things much more efficiently. Its the democratization of art. <br>I&#039;m sure catholic priests had a similar angst about the Bible being translated so that laypeople could read it without having to use them as an intermediary. Like with the church, artists seem to be more worried about losing control and losing their place in the world, about no longer being needed or special. But if they really had the ideals they claimed to they would support this fully. It allows people to manifest their visions without going through a repetitive process of learning a technical skill that often limits them as much as it helps them. Everyone can be an artist now, that should make you happy. And if you learn how to use AI well, you can still have a place in the world. But if you remain stubborn and hostile to it, you&#039;ll end up an old grandma crocheting scarves alone in your house for distant family members that will throw them in a closet to gather dust while they wear a superior store-bought product. <br>The only person you harm is yourself by letting fear and anger control you.

You&#039;re only seeing the surface level. The real differences here are<br><br>1.) A far better understanding of form. The face on the right is the most striking example, the way that the eyes are drawn indicates the head as a rounded volume with mass, whereas the left is a flat shape with sticker eyes applied to it. The jacket, clothes and even hair made of distinct, solid masses overlaid upon and wrapping around the body in layers. They all feel like they have weight and force applied to them as well. If you were really paying attention, you&#039;ll also notice very subtle indicators implying forms like the bones and tendons of the hand and the wrist under the skin- like the clothes, there is a feeling of the skin stretched upon and wrapping around these delicate forms.<br><br>2.) Better understanding of subject matter. Not only does the artist have a better understanding of human anatomy, they have an understanding of the anatomy of EVERYTHING in the piece. The jacket, the shirt, the pants, the hair, the skin and bone, they know the parts, the materials, how they fit together, and most importantly WHY that they are the way they are and act the way they do. This is why the clothes, the hair, the skin have such definite mass and purposeful application of forces upon them. See those crisp, chunky folds in the jacket on the right and compare them to the almost vacuum sealed, skintight jacket on the left with muddy indefinite marks indicating the idea of wrinkles that the artist knows should be there but doesn&#039;t understand how they work as 3D form, or the properties of the material that they&#039;re deforming.", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-06 20-17-57", "ext": ".png", "w": 733, "h": 758, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670380263658576, "time": 1670380263, "md5": "5xKi1KIqRsTTW1Hsb4XfjA==", "fsize": 644680, "resto": 6400360}, {"no": 6405564, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6405556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6405556</a><br>(cont&#039;d)<br>Now let&#039;s talk about you, and how you might learn better in the future if you weren&#039;t such a quarrelsome, midwitted know-it-all that defends every stupid hot take you have to the death, argues for the sake of argument, and won&#039;t ever listen to anyone else.<br>First off, the reason why you can&#039;t &quot;get anything&quot; out of the OP pic was because it&#039;s in Korean.

The right pic changes the type of coat completely, its now more of a rain coat made of a heavier material. The sleeves are way wider, and it looks too big for her, that creates appeal. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jeans</span><br>The left pic has very basic wrinkles added as a halfasssed attempt, just being more careful with sticking to proper anatomy makes a huge difference in tight clothes. The pic on the right has her legs closer to the correct length, and it wrinkles only where it bends. Which is mostly better to do.The waist of her jeans also dip down as it can in real life, instead of being perfectly horizontal as I would have drawn it. It has a 3d form as it goes aroudn her waist, and you can see it with the belt loops, so it goes in a circle AND it dips down, creating a whole lot of depth. In the left pic, its all obscured by the long sweater which is not drawn to be round at all if you look at the hem.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;body</span><br>the head is tilted on two axis, down and away, she&#039;s not facing the camera, which adds appeal.

If you really want to improve, then studying anatomy is not the next step, in my opinion. You should learn how to represent 3D space in 2D. That&#039;s the most basics of all basics. Several different ways to do this. Drawing from life is one way, others recommend grinding boxes and other simple 3D shapes. This type of practice exposes you to the basics of the fundamentals of drawing. These drawing fundamentals are how artists make good work. That holds true even for abstract artists and ones with heavily stylized work; it all comes from a place of understanding of the fundamentals. These are mental tools that must be practiced until you &#039;get it&#039;. For some people, this takes a long time, while it clicks for others relatively quickly. I think anatomy is a more advanced topic to tackle a little bit later.<br><br>Doing all of that means ditching this &#039;abstract&#039; stuff for the time being and changing your perspective on drawing.

To give an example, I invested 1200$ in a tech stock that had bullish sentiment a few years back, after a year I have made a total of 200$ overall despite it&#039;s price value going up, except that if you zoomed out on the chart you could see that it&#039;s being hedged down over and over to a consolodiation every 2nd month to maintain a slow steady pace. For an entire year. Welcome to stocks. If you do not have a lot of money you will not make money. Same with crypto and all the shitcoins that pop up, flavor of the month on coinmarketcap I see them literally every month there&#039;s the next Mooncoin. It&#039;s all bullshit.

Before that, I completed Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Now that I have a decent exposure to the basics using traditional materials I finally sprang for that iPad i&#039;ve been eyeing for a couple years now. I got a really good deal on a used 12.9&quot; iPad Pro (2020) and got procreate, but since i&#039;m a complete beginner to digital i was hoping I could follow a course to learn how to use digital tools. It&#039;s okay if it goes over the same beginner topics such as form, value, light and shadow, etc since I need to practice all this anyway.<br><br>There are so many courses to choose from, after doing a bit of research i&#039;ve found the following:<br><br>- CtrlPaint<br>- Med&#039;s Map<br>- RossDraws Digital Art Bootcamp<br>- Digital Painting Fundamentals by Jon Neimeister<br><br><br>There&#039;s still a ton I need to practice. <br><br>I&#039;ve never done any Figure Drawing which I do want to learn since I&#039;m very interested in learning character art. But even after the two beginner courses i&#039;ve completed I still feel like a total beginner in terms of perspective, light, and form and i&#039;m wondering if I need to continue using traditional materials with some other courses that dives into something specific to get better at one of those topics.<br><br>Maybe I can slowly do a digital course while also learning something like figure drawing using traditional materials and a different course?<br><br><br>feeling overwhelmed, what do?", "time": 1669082894, "resto": 6358211}, {"no": 6385810, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)22:53:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p6385695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;6385695</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CtrlPaint</span><br>Good but uses a lot of layer-heavy, technical methods and is very Photoshop specific.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Med&#039;s Map</span><br>Great course, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it for a complete beginner.

Actually teaches you the digital painting fundamentals thoroughly so you can apply it to different software.<br><br>If you liked Brent Eviston, you could do his figure drawing course as well. If you think you are not ready yet for figure drawing, going over the fundamentals again in a Procreate course wouldn&#039;t hurt. <br>There are loads of Procreate courses on skillshare/udemy/domestika etc. but the instructors aren&#039;t very good. Some YouTube videos on the basics of Procreate might prove more useful. Sinix and Ergojosh should be enough to get you started. Nikolai Lockertsen has two Procreate courses on Schoolism. His first one is for beginners and goes over some fundamentals, you can skip the animation stuff if you are not interested in that. Once you&#039;ve got Procreate down, the best digital painting tutorials are in Photoshop, so you&#039;ll have to learn to adjust for Procreate. I would recommend Jon Neimeister and Med&#039;s Maps courses.<br>With regards to digital vs. traditional, that depends on your goals. If digital painting is you main goal, it&#039;s fine to just focus on that. A lot of traditional courses would work fine doing them digitally. If you want to do a mix of both, the skills transfer over so it&#039;s fine. As long as you have the time, doing two courses at once is fine too. The fundamentals overlap, so it will actually help. You can split it up, like 1 hours of trad and 1 hour of digital, or 1st day trad and 2nd day digital.
