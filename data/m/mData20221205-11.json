The only new character from Neon Dynasty that seems to be relevant for the this current story arc is Kaito, and somehow the Wandering Emperor made it to Dominaria. All the new characters in New Capenna are literal who&#039;s that exist to shuffle the plot along, including a girl named Giada is who is a living plot device that reveals Elpseth&#039;s origins and brings back New Capenna&#039;s angels. It&#039;s a mess. I&#039;m not expecting high literature from the backstory of a children&#039;s card game, but that&#039;s no reason to half-ass basically everything.

This is one, supposed, epic and honestly looking back on them, I can&#039;t for the life of me remember where any of the time actually went. Like i can probably remember specific instances, but the same way I can recall actual events and dungeons from other games. It certainly wasn&#039;t all spent on the characters, at least the CS games weren&#039;t, they have the same problem persona has where characters cant even so much tie their shoes if the MC isn&#039;t around for them to orbit. Hell CS1 suffered from so much character bloat that at most turns half the roster was just punted to the off screen. They absolutely wasted what the whole premise of Class 7 was supposed to be when outside maybe a single moment or pair they don&#039;t interact worth a damn at all because every single one of them has to exist in a vacuum so HAHAH man can do all their development for them. The series broke double digits but the actual meat and potatoes of the plot probably wouldn&#039;t even fit a shorter game.

But the movie site just says the GN-XIV is comparable to Gundams. It&#039;s a little unlikely, but it&#039;s possible they&#039;re comparable to the movie gundams. They did get access to the Innovade&#039;s technology, which should have included the Reborns and 1 and 1.5 Gundams, which were superior to CB&#039;s tech in S2, enough for the Reborn&#039;s to match the 00R using fake drives. Considering the Raphael was also built using Innovade (and CB) data and it&#039;s considered a 5th gen gundam, I think it&#039;s possible the basic performance of the GN-XIV was within earshot of the movie gundams. The ESF also took control of Veda on the CB mothership, so they could have also leveraged it to help design new weapons.

I don&#039;t think you can argue Amuro only started rapidly growing after Ral either, because there&#039;s several bits of evidence showing it well before he even encounters Ral. Amuro is taking out Zaku II&#039;s with his off hand while battling Char by episoe 4, we find out in episode 6 or 7 that he&#039;s done dozens of hours of practice in the simulator and Gundam itself over the few days the show has taken by that point, he&#039;s personally studying the Gundam to understand how it works all along, he designs combat routines for the Gouf once he encounters it because the Gundam&#039;s computer can&#039;t keep up etc.<br><br>Ramba was the first proper ace Amuro outright defeated, but he was training and improving at a similar pace way before he defeated him. He also fights all 3 Black Tri-Stars within a few days of defeating Ral too, and while none of them are up to Ral&#039;s standard alone, they&#039;re at least as much of a threat together.", "time": 1670114357, "resto": 21306230}], "last_modified": 1670114357}]}, {"page": 8, "threads": [{"no": 21277200, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)15:28:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If Gunpla battle was real, what would you think the Meta would be like, the player community, and would you stick to the Meta?", "filename": "A08D170B-D892-43E5-9D66-EDA2F116EBFF", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1668457690023695, "time": 1668457690, "md5": "c9QkuAX5y/aHUIq7kL/AHQ==", "fsize": 1177183, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "if-gunpla-battle-was-real-what-would-you-think", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 326, "images": 59, "omitted_posts": 321, "omitted_images": 58, "last_replies": [{"no": 21319853, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)23:54:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21319779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21319779</a><br>IIRC, wasn&#039;t that one of the big issues with them in the OYW?

The series centers around an evangelical superhero who fights evil, often by quoting scripture, as well as breaking the fourth wall. The show had three incarnations: The Bibleman Show, The Bibleman Adventure, and Bibleman: Powersource. The series&#039; titular character was played by Willie Aames from 1995 to 2003 and by Robert T. Schlipp from 2004 to 2010. Originally owned by Pamplin Entertainment, then sold to Tommy Nelson, the series is currently owned by B&amp;H Kids. It was re-launched in CGI format in 2016 (new title Bibleman: The Animated Adventures).", "filename": "bibleman", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669680079960919,

The show would have ended with Char having wiped out the heads of the Federation personally, before Judau directly inspired the people remaining on Earth to move off the planet and then leaving to help lead the colonization efforts on Mars. Char is largely acting to punish the people of Earth and to help Spacenoids in Char&#039;s Counterattack; which would be impossible when there are few if any people left on Earth, and those few moving to leave within short order anyway. He&#039;d also presumably have been bested by Judau, and even if he was alive, have more of a recent rivalry with him than with Amuro.<br><br>ZZ was never meant to lead into Char&#039;s Counterattack, and the two works basically existed as opposing possibilities. It&#039;s probably worth pointing out that, despite people&#039;s views, Char&#039;s Counterattack is not the culmination of early UC, and some kind of cap to 0079, Zeta and ZZ. It&#039;s a movie Tomino made solely and specifically to address Amuro and Char&#039;s relationship. If anything is taken from Zeta in your opinion, then it&#039;s only in so far as it serves that narrative.
