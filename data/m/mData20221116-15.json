Amuro continues to lament her death though, even while he and Sayla hook up, and his final scene in the novel is his spirit fading alongside Lalahs once he dies.

Nowhere in the original show, movies, novels etc. does Gihren ever talk about caring for the future of Spacenoids as a whole, but they are convinced that he&#039;s some kind of revolutionary God and are so repulsed by the rest of his family that they literally abandon ship the second they even think he might be dead.

The revolution bit at least matches some rhetoric that is in 0079, though I&#039;m not sure anyone in the show itself calls the war a revolution and I only remember the narrator calling it that, but neither Gihren nor any of the other Zabis gave a single solitary fuck about any of the other Sides beyond Side 3.

I wanted to make the visualization as soon as possible, but I thought it would be difficult at this time. I myself am not as strong as I was back then. However, I&#039;m not the type of person who can just be the general director and leave it to someone else, so it&#039;s difficult to make an anime. Hakaioh is also a heavy work, and if I were to direct every detail myself, I would run out of time. If technological innovation progresses, and if by some miracle the truly talented staff can come together and say, &quot;Let&#039;s do it! I might be able to make it happen. At the time of the first &quot;GaoGaiGar&quot;, the number of anime productions was decreasing, and staff from other studios were often free. When I asked for help, everyone came and helped me. I was really touched by that. It was like a story in an anime, where an elite group of people came to help us in a pinch. I was so moved that I got goosebumps. I was so moved that I got goosebumps. In that sense, I think my life as a director was lucky. There is a serious shortage of human resources these days, so if something miraculous like that happens in the future, I feel that I might be able to make another work.", "time": 1668564852, "resto": 21265214}, {"no": 21279858, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)21:24:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21279816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21279816</a><br>Can&#039;t overlook poor GaiGar, thank you!<br><a href=\"#p21279838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21279838</a><br>It hurts a bit<br><s>It hurts a lot</s>", "time": 1668565487, "resto": 21265214}, {"no": 21279912, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)22:15:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21279838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21279838</a><br>Okay", "filename": "1584996371499", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668568508157512, "time": 1668568508, "md5": "DESdGYDt58tgWulWS+LHsQ==", "fsize": 71476, "resto": 21265214}, {"no": 21279921, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)22:22:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21279912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21279912</a><br><a href=\"#p21279858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21279858</a><br>On the other side, Yuichiro Takeda (Hakaioh novel and the Comic&#039;s writer) is wanting/hoping for a Hakaioh anime<br>https://twitter.com/yuichiro_takeda<wbr>/status/1476747577307856898<br>https://twitter.com/yuichiro_takeda<wbr>/status/1476747578926858240<br>I&quot;t&#039;s the end of the year 2021.

Yes, Char as Quattro benefits from the audience knowing his previous act as an antagonist, but pretty much every other returning element is fairly superficial. I mostly just dislike how the setting does not feel remotely like it follows on less than a decade from an apocalyptic war that killed more than of humanity and destroyed hundreds of city-state/colony cylinders though, because the Sides never seem like they&#039;re actually affected by it at all. The Earth does, if only because Blex talks about environmental concerns, but watching Zeta you&#039;d never realize that hundreds of colony cylinders and billions of people inhabiting them had been killed a little more than a handful of years previously.<br><br>I don&#039;t really mind it personally, since the name &quot;Gundam&quot; means very little beyond some persistent themes and hasn&#039;t since at least the early 90s, but if it&#039;s a problem then it&#039;s a problem with UC as well as AUs.", "time": 1668535279, "resto": 21247407}, {"no": 21279299, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)16:37:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21247414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21247414</a><br>That&#039;s an incredibly low-bar as a standard to have, anon.", "time": 1668548264, "resto": 21247407}], "last_modified": 1668548264}, {"no": 21009184, "now": "07/22/22(Fri)07:11:24", "name": "SUN WUKONG @ msv.wtf.dev", "sub": "/m/SV Season 3 #5 - &quot;Prelude&quot;", "com": "Previous Thread <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;20631385</span><br><br>Welcome to /m/SV Season 3!
