It&#039;s kind of difficult to pin down, since the specific history is never explicitly shown so far as I know but the Episode Zero manga chapter about Quatre&#039;s past does have him talk to Instructor H after meeting the Maganac Corp, before Instructor H says that he&#039;ll take refuge in Quatre&#039;s home and Quatre bidding the Maganac Corp farewell with the promise that he&#039;ll meet them again in future. It doesn&#039;t confirm anything, but it does imply that Quatre envisioned himself as working with the Maganac Corps, that Instructor H was funded by the Winner family and that he built the Sandrock with Quatre specifically in mind as well as Quatre&#039;s wish to be part of the Maganac Corps.", "time": 1668683257, "resto": 21258391}], "last_modified": 1668683257}, {"no": 21270750, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)09:48:54", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Godzilla &amp; Kong", "com": "What are your hopes/wishes for the next Monsterverse kino?", "filename": "168051857_3995584107154681_8025539836184502538_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1235, "h": 1978, "tn_w": 156, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668178134153207, "time": 1668178134, "md5": "B7vY8IYlzWqJH03xuZBz+w==", "fsize": 293047, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "godzilla-kong", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 76, "images": 13, "omitted_posts": 71, "omitted_images": 12, "last_replies": [{"no": 21278860, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:47:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21277166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21277166</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Being this wrong</span><br>I unironically love the Showa Gamera movies and think most of them are insanely underrated, especially Barugon, Gaos, and Jiger.

I prefer the TV show to it personally, but that&#039;s because I really like the TV show generally. The novels still do some cool things though and if you prefer things to have a more military bent, they probably scratch that itch since the crew of the White Base is enlisted from the start and drop all the refugees they take on from Side 7 at Luna II almost immediately; including Fraw and the 3 orphan kids. Who don&#039;t have much of a part in the story after that. The novels also skip some things in the show or change them entirely. It never goes to Earth for instance, and the war may not even have touched it beyond the colony drop (i.e. no invasion), Sayla never becomes a pilot and so on.<br><br>Amuro is more of a soldier too, and becomes the White Base&#039;s flight commander as well as it&#039;s central mobile suit pilot, leading a small group including obviously Kai and Hayato, but also including some fighter craft for much of the second novel. I found it quite interesting to see him become more of a military man; especially when the occasional appearance Fraw makes is her working in a military factory on Luna II while taking care of the kids. There&#039;s less focus on Amuro&#039;s relationship with Bright etc. because of it, but more on how Amuro relates to other characters, Sayla especially; though she&#039;s never presented as his primary love interest despite how much people act like it.

Works well for its purpose but since it&#039;s an early design and made out of luna titanium, it&#039;s an expensive prototype like the Gundam that isn&#039;t good for mass production. So to develop a cheaper fire support MS, the Feds decide to start differently and look toward the GM. The GM Cannon takes some ideas from the Guncannon but is cheaper and easier to mass produce. Like the GM it&#039;s a light-weight MS and has economical titanium armor, so in order to better fit the fire support role they had to give it thicker and stronger legs for more stability on the ground and even then it only has one cannon to save costs and reduce recoil. There&#039;s a version of the GM Cannon that removes the heavy legs and adds extra leg thrusters for better space mobility.<br><br>The GM Cannon II is the pinnacle of the line and the very last model they built, it&#039;s built with heavy armor all over but still made of titanium so it&#039;s not too expensive, has lots of extra thrusters so it&#039;s not too sluggish in space movement, and the twin beam cannons are much more destructive than the old projectile cannons, although they lose the ability for indirect-fire.
