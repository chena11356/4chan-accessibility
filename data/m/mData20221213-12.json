The series centers around an evangelical superhero who fights evil, often by quoting scripture, as well as breaking the fourth wall. The show had three incarnations: The Bibleman Show, The Bibleman Adventure, and Bibleman: Powersource. The series&#039; titular character was played by Willie Aames from 1995 to 2003 and by Robert T. Schlipp from 2004 to 2010. Originally owned by Pamplin Entertainment, then sold to Tommy Nelson, the series is currently owned by B&amp;H Kids. It was re-launched in CGI format in 2016 (new title Bibleman: The Animated Adventures).", "filename": "bibleman", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669680079960919, "time": 1669680079, "md5": "/VauTnjEVxj84HhvV2HwOA==", "fsize": 104254, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "bmg-bibleman-general-1", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 57, "images": 15, "omitted_posts": 52, "omitted_images": 12, "last_replies": [{"no": 21326526, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)11:32:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21326375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21326375</a><br><a href=\"#p21326384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21326384</a><br><br>https://www.youtubetrimmer.com/view<wbr>/?v=X6jYFSVtNVE&amp;start=458&amp;end=463&amp;l<wbr>oop=1<br><br>sure it does... i mean, we are talking prison rape here!", "time": 1670517145, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21333737, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:01:18", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Bibleman", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1090, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670706078261302, "time": 1670706078, "md5": "NyFMwc4IFSk/ZMoQIhzxiw==", "fsize": 139282, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21342515, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)22:23:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21307819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307819</a><br>I remember watching this with my little sister and there was plot where one of the villains were giving out atheism bubblegum that turned anyone who chew the gum into a non believer.", "time": 1670901795, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21342967, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)02:15:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I remember being like 7 and raised catholic and going to a friend&#039;s birthday party, who was raised born again christian and it was bibleman themed everywhere.

enemy and if they try to surprise attack around a corner you&#039;re well aware<br>Stick close with the team and use your thrusters to get closer to the enemy in small spaces<br>Use the axe throw to stun an enemy or knock down their shield, save it for when you run into an enemy GM or Sazabi or Gundam, you can also test your luck and throw it at transforming or flying MS, if you manage to hit a Turn A using its G-Maneuver special or a Methuss flying in the air with the axe it will stop them, its a game changer if you can properly aim it<br>The G-Maneuver is pretty ass imo, the Funnels are good for targeting one enemy, while it can hit all enemies in the area, the more enemies the less damage it does, with one enemy the funnels will focus all the damage on a single target but with

Very unrefined sketches. Like I said I&#039;m more of a writer than an artist.

The &quot;transformation&quot; doesn&#039;t make much sense, I was gonna go over the logistics of it with the artist friend. I had read that underwater the things that dictate speed is how round something is and how long it is, which is why submarines are pill shaped, that&#039;s why I thought of making the legs slim and long.<br><br>Worth noting that I&#039;ve avoided seeing Mars Daybreak on purpose but I&#039;ve caught glances at the main mech occasionally and I know it also has long legs.

This release translates the rest of the main AEUG campaign meaning at this point more than half of the game is translated. All that&#039;s left are the main Titans and Axis campaigns and the small extra campaigns.<br><br>This release took longer than expected since it turns out the AEUG campaign actually has more dialogue in it than either the Federation or Zeon campaigns which took me by surprise. Next on the list I&#039;ll be doing the extra campaigns since those are all just intro, an event, and endings so they can all be translated quickly. After that, it will be the main Titans and Axis campaigns which are both shorter than any of the campaigns translated so far.<br><br>For those who aren&#039;t familiar with this translation the main Federation, Zeon, and AEUG campaigns and the majority of the UI are all translated. The only things I have left to translate are the remaining campaign dialogue and some UI elements.
