Literally each and every one of them (yes, literally all) just grab video from the release people already use, then run it through Handbrake (sometimes MeGUI or StaxRip if they&#039;re feeling spicy) on higher CRF than the originals, oftentimes using HEVC for good measure (clueless downloaders slurp that shit down). As long as people see HD or 1080p or something, and notice it&#039;s smaller than the original, most people just grab it without thinking it&#039;s worse video quality (since many still seem to equate resolution with quality).<br><br>The rationale they use is that not everyone has a computer that can decode higher quality releases, or have enough HDD space, or that they&#039;re playing it on a phone that can&#039;t decode it. But those excuses fall flat - any PC in the past decade (or phone in the past half if not more) can decode anything you throw at it just fine, and HDD space is literally dirt cheap. If you can&#039;t afford it, unironically get a job. Besides, using Yamato III as an example, their source (I&#039;m assuming Sandaphon?) is only less than 4GiB larger.

Even though it was serialized in TV Land (a monthly magazine) from April 1981 to February 1982 (\u662d\u548c56\u5e744\u6708\u53f7 through \u662d\u548c57\u5e742\u6708\u53f7), a span of 10 months. Given how the only chapter of the Golion manga completely found is only 15 pages long, it&#039;s safe to assume each chapter is shorter than your average 19-page-long shounen manga chapter. For example, pic related is a ToC from July 1981 (\u662d\u548c56\u5e747\u6708\u53f7). That month&#039;s chapter of the Golden manga lasts from page 183 to 195, or 12 pages long. <br>We don&#039;t know which issue the found 15-page chapter is from.

I prefer the TV show to it personally, but that&#039;s because I really like the TV show generally. The novels still do some cool things though and if you prefer things to have a more military bent, they probably scratch that itch since the crew of the White Base is enlisted from the start and drop all the refugees they take on from Side 7 at Luna II almost immediately; including Fraw and the 3 orphan kids. Who don&#039;t have much of a part in the story after that. The novels also skip some things in the show or change them entirely. It never goes to Earth for instance, and the war may not even have touched it beyond the colony drop (i.e. no invasion), Sayla never becomes a pilot and so on.<br><br>Amuro is more of a soldier too, and becomes the White Base&#039;s flight commander as well as it&#039;s central mobile suit pilot, leading a small group including obviously Kai and Hayato, but also including some fighter craft for much of the second novel. I found it quite interesting to see him become more of a military man; especially when the occasional appearance Fraw makes is her working in a military factory on Luna II while taking care of the kids. There&#039;s less focus on Amuro&#039;s relationship with Bright etc. because of it, but more on how Amuro relates to other characters, Sayla especially; though she&#039;s never presented as his primary love interest despite how much people act like it.

The series were heavily associated with him, so there&#039;s an element of respect for the deceased in there, as well as the fact of him not being around to keep directing in the 80s/90s means there&#039;s no easy way for new fans to come in. <br><br>Like, Tomino kept directing, so he has this huge body of work and if you get in through any of it you&#039;ll probably wander back to Zambot/Daitarn/Ideon eventually. If Nagahama had lived, he&#039;d probably have an equally huge body of work drawing in new people throughout the 80s/90s/00s. That keeps the old works in the public consciousness and encourages later investment. Instead the only way for potential new fans to come in is SRW. Which works, as most people here can probably attest, but it&#039;s not as high-profile. <br><br>Then there&#039;s the part where Gundam got huge and changed everything. Gundam 0079 owes a massive amount to the Robot Romance series, but Gundam got the movies and the New Anime Century, it got the gunpla, and it got the sequels.

So to develop a cheaper fire support MS, the Feds decide to start differently and look toward the GM. The GM Cannon takes some ideas from the Guncannon but is cheaper and easier to mass produce. Like the GM it&#039;s a light-weight MS and has economical titanium armor, so in order to better fit the fire support role they had to give it thicker and stronger legs for more stability on the ground and even then it only has one cannon to save costs and reduce recoil. There&#039;s a version of the GM Cannon that removes the heavy legs and adds extra leg thrusters for better space mobility.<br><br>The GM Cannon II is the pinnacle of the line and the very last model they built, it&#039;s built with heavy armor all over but still made of titanium so it&#039;s not too expensive, has lots of extra thrusters so it&#039;s not too sluggish in space movement, and the twin beam cannons are much more destructive than the old projectile cannons, although they lose the ability for indirect-fire.
