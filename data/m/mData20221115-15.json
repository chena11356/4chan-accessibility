Meanwhile, Sentinel takes place in UC 0088. The reason some of the designs look similar is because they are roughly the same tech level. There is most definitely some overlap in unit role. Keep in mind that Zeta Gundam takes place in 0087 and ZZ takes place in 0088, and the big picture becomes more clear - units like the Byarlant and Messala are just refined and stylized designs developed from the Titans Test program.

That minor quibble aside, a lot of the changes you talked about were already in evidence even just in Okawara&#039;s art as early as the MS-V line from 1983, before Zeta Gundam was even proposed and not born of the Mk2. The Full Amor Gundam Okawara designed for the MS-V line has more facets on the shoulder, vents on the legs, oblong vents on the chest and the crotch changed to more of a normal shape than the indented one the RX-78-2 has for instance. The vents don&#039;t have yellow on them, but that&#039;s going to be because the Full Armor uses a different color scheme rather than the white and blue with yellow and red highlights of the standard Gundam mold. The GM II has ports on it&#039;s shoulders in Zeta Gundam too.<br><br>The bigger point is that after the simplistic designs of the first Gundam show, Okawara&#039;s mechanical design evolved a good bit over the next few years as he did more mechanical design. And basically everyone else followed from that, with a lot of things now in use being things he was the first to do in the early 80s. Nothing that you listed is unique to the Mk2, or even really first seen on the Mk2; that&#039;s just the thing you know it best from by the sounds of it. It&#039;s all stuff you can see all over the place though, in Gundam, in Okawara&#039;s other mech designs outside Gundam and often even in non-Gundam stuff by other designers entirely and much of it in evidence going back to even before Zeta Gundam.", "filename": "Fa-78-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 403, "h": 700, "tn_w": 71, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668470040949298, "time": 1668470040, "md5": "t6pKnLCzQXTiN3GcZUwYgg==", "fsize": 100710, "resto": 21233557}, {"no": 21277712, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)20:43:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21233557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21233557</a><br>I like it, clean design, has a utilitarian, military feel to it as opposed to some of the goofy transformable stuff that came out of Zeta.", "filename": "RX-178 ", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1668476588106474, "time": 1668476588, "md5": "0kWp1RKwgv4uYQSqew+YNQ==", "fsize": 2647844, "resto": 21233557}], "last_modified": 1668476588}, {"no": 21276503, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)07:23:43", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/krg/ - Kamen Rider General #3192: Scheming Punk Edition", "com": "Previous Thread: <a href=\"/m/thread/21273178#p21273178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21273178</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How to get into KR and where to start?</span><br>https://kamenriderguide.weebly.com<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;List of subbed series</span><br>http://tokusubs.wikia.com/wiki/Toku<wbr>subs_Wiki<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Direct Download Links</span><br>https://pastebin.com/uynBpq35<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1iAaxZsRy5ZBUExP_kg21PwFHzK9l8UljCk<wbr>K2u6hNIfU<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>19wl37LsDD4J_yqR7usLNkXA4hGAXngnlI3<wbr>HgSgMN2Kk<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1W3nlhtioorLWE8g5HJSKCAUoTGicFKeLh5<wbr>d4JXZmAKs<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;/krg/ archives</span><br>https://desuarchive.org/m/search/su<wbr>bject/Kamen%20Rider%20General", "filename": "1668414681768109", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668428623320662, "time": 1668428623, "md5": "LY04h6ouNMKfRq60cKvVrQ==", "fsize": 667515, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "krg-kamen-rider-general-3192-scheming-punk", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 549, "images": 132, "omitted_posts": 544, "omitted_images": 131, "last_replies": [{"no": 21279114, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:26:43", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "FdvSFI-VQAAIRDx", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1638, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1668540403414524, "time": 1668540403, "md5": "epU+wsJQbeycDA7MhdRP/A==", "fsize": 506974, "resto": 21276503}, {"no": 21279157, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:00:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21278966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21278966</a><br>Nobody you porn addicted faggot", "time": 1668542418, "resto": 21276503}, {"no": 21279163, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:05:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21279114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21279114</a><br>Like fucking night and day (respectively) <s>I&#039;m saying Kenzan is shit</s>", "time": 1668542715, "resto": 21276503}, {"no": 21279169, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:10:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21279163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21279163</a><br>Oh no!
