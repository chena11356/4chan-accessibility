The series centers around an evangelical superhero who fights evil, often by quoting scripture, as well as breaking the fourth wall. The show had three incarnations: The Bibleman Show, The Bibleman Adventure, and Bibleman: Powersource. The series&#039; titular character was played by Willie Aames from 1995 to 2003 and by Robert T. Schlipp from 2004 to 2010. Originally owned by Pamplin Entertainment, then sold to Tommy Nelson, the series is currently owned by B&amp;H Kids. It was re-launched in CGI format in 2016 (new title Bibleman: The Animated Adventures).", "filename": "bibleman", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669680079960919, "time": 1669680079, "md5": "/VauTnjEVxj84HhvV2HwOA==", "fsize": 104254, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "bmg-bibleman-general-1", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 41, "images": 10, "omitted_posts": 36, "omitted_images": 10, "last_replies": [{"no": 21311852, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)22:38:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "GOD DID", "time": 1669865931, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21315199, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)18:45:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21309778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21309778</a><br>i have only one Savior, and his name is Jesus Christ", "time": 1670024710, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21322821, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)13:38:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21307819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307819</a><br>This is surprisingly entertaining.", "time": 1670351894, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21322828, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)13:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21307865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307865</a><br>Where&#039;s the Prostitute of Lust?", "time": 1670352312, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21322837, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)13:57:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Holy shit I forgot this thread was still in existence", "time": 1670353032, "resto": 21307819}], "last_modified": 1670353032}, {"no": 21317917, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)02:25:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fan<wbr>OJFPG72U", "filename": "maxresdefault", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1670138743847977, "time": 1670138743, "md5": "+I4kj53vwS5E+Vdg8bFcyg==", "fsize": 113227, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 318, "images": 42, "omitted_posts": 313, "omitted_images": 40, "last_replies": [{"no": 21322865, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)14:19:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Did she really just say &quot;puru puru&quot;?", "filename": "nothingtopuruabout", "ext": ".png", "w": 1841, "h": 1037, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670354378319780, "time": 1670354378, "md5": "eIS/a1zaaD5tYZXz/oH6vQ==", "fsize": 1551553, "resto": 21317917}, {"no": 21322878, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)14:24:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Did you guys hear about the delays?

It was probably partly based on how the japanese saw Americans going into ww2. America gave japan modern industry with new factories like Harley Davidson plant (the SDF-1). And the Americans were seen as these giant mobsters/cowboys because of films. And Americans saw japanese people as war obsessed little monkeys too. But after the war, lots of Americans and Japanese got married after they learned about each other&#039;s culture. Sure, some people still kept hate in their heart. But others learned about the other&#039;s culture and fell in love. There were plenty of Americans that loved japanese stuff, and Japanese people that loved American stuff. <br><br>You can see something similar with american black people. Some white people loved black food, music and art and it helped them let go of racism against black people. If you want to get deep into it, black culture even helped white people reclaim things lost from their pagan past,. The sexual nature of black dancing and music had been purged by the church in most white communities. <br><br>It either happened in DYRL or sometime after, but everything was shifted to a more romantic message of &quot;love and music&quot; saves us all.

Like i can probably remember specific instances, but the same way I can recall actual events and dungeons from other games. It certainly wasn&#039;t all spent on the characters, at least the CS games weren&#039;t, they have the same problem persona has where characters cant even so much tie their shoes if the MC isn&#039;t around for them to orbit. Hell CS1 suffered from so much character bloat that at most turns half the roster was just punted to the off screen. They absolutely wasted what the whole premise of Class 7 was supposed to be when outside maybe a single moment or pair they don&#039;t interact worth a damn at all because every single one of them has to exist in a vacuum so HAHAH man can do all their development for them. The series broke double digits but the actual meat and potatoes of the plot probably wouldn&#039;t even fit a shorter game.
