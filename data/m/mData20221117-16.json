It just doesn&#039;t actually do much; just as it didn&#039;t do much in 0079 when he slapped Amuro, or when he put him in the brig, because corporeal punishment has been proven a terrible idea in basically every study ever on the subject in the real world, and militaires locking civilians up for acting like civilians is also a stupid idea on the face of the matter.

Fraw would be signing any sprog she shoots out up for military service at 6 months of age if there was a war, then crying crocodile tears as she waves off the basinett.<br><br><a href=\"#p21281076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21281076</a><br><br>I don&#039;t, but mostly because while I do think Amuro saw another life he could have had with Fraw at the end, I don&#039;t think he was particularly sad that it was a path not travelled and that he was way, way more heart broken over Lalah, and possibly into Sayla; which even Fraw herself recognized. Nothing comes of it, but I think Amuro was more down about that then anything with Fraw.<br><br>The unrequited Fraw relationship in the animation never did anything for me though, and the only time I think the Fraw thing works is in the novels where she barely even appears after staying on Luna II to work in a munitions dump while taking care of the orphan kids while the White Base goes off on it&#039;s missions, but keeps Amuro in mind the few times the story does revisit her. She sends him messages saying she doesn&#039;t care if he&#039;s hurt or anything, she just wants him to come home, and there&#039;s another scene where she saves up to buy some lipstick she can wear just for him etc. Amuro&#039;s spirit visits a collapsed Fraw in a hospital just before it disippates, with Fraw begging him not to leave, and the narrative has made it clear that Amuro barely thouht of her all along and was in love with Lalah, as well as in a relationship of convenience with Sayla after Lalah dies; but the plaintive nature of Fraw&#039;s feelings in comparison to Amuros, the mundanity of her life and her small dreams makes it hit far harder than anything in the animation ever did for me.", "time": 1668641234, "resto": 21279704}, {"no": 21282639, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)14:00:05", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "39431b4be770e7a38b1ea59f84c591b2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668711605635220, "time": 1668711605, "md5": "wDVSC+mtf0Pu+HwcghdJFw==", "fsize": 249260, "resto": 21279704}], "last_modified": 1668711605}, {"no": 21258787, "now": "11/04/22(Fri)18:17:15", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Wtf was Nina thinking?", "com": "I didn&#039;t remember this whole NTR from when I saw this years ago.<br><br>Then later Kou seems to not care.

The series were heavily associated with him, so there&#039;s an element of respect for the deceased in there, as well as the fact of him not being around to keep directing in the 80s/90s means there&#039;s no easy way for new fans to come in. <br><br>Like, Tomino kept directing, so he has this huge body of work and if you get in through any of it you&#039;ll probably wander back to Zambot/Daitarn/Ideon eventually. If Nagahama had lived, he&#039;d probably have an equally huge body of work drawing in new people throughout the 80s/90s/00s. That keeps the old works in the public consciousness and encourages later investment. Instead the only way for potential new fans to come in is SRW. Which works, as most people here can probably attest, but it&#039;s not as high-profile. <br><br>Then there&#039;s the part where Gundam got huge and changed everything. Gundam 0079 owes a massive amount to the Robot Romance series, but Gundam got the movies and the New Anime Century, it got the gunpla, and it got the sequels.

I prefer the TV show to it personally, but that&#039;s because I really like the TV show generally. The novels still do some cool things though and if you prefer things to have a more military bent, they probably scratch that itch since the crew of the White Base is enlisted from the start and drop all the refugees they take on from Side 7 at Luna II almost immediately; including Fraw and the 3 orphan kids. Who don&#039;t have much of a part in the story after that. The novels also skip some things in the show or change them entirely. It never goes to Earth for instance, and the war may not even have touched it beyond the colony drop (i.e. no invasion), Sayla never becomes a pilot and so on.<br><br>Amuro is more of a soldier too, and becomes the White Base&#039;s flight commander as well as it&#039;s central mobile suit pilot, leading a small group including obviously Kai and Hayato, but also including some fighter craft for much of the second novel. I found it quite interesting to see him become more of a military man; especially when the occasional appearance Fraw makes is her working in a military factory on Luna II while taking care of the kids. There&#039;s less focus on Amuro&#039;s relationship with Bright etc. because of it, but more on how Amuro relates to other characters, Sayla especially; though she&#039;s never presented as his primary love interest despite how much people act like it.

Works well for its purpose but since it&#039;s an early design and made out of luna titanium, it&#039;s an expensive prototype like the Gundam that isn&#039;t good for mass production. So to develop a cheaper fire support MS, the Feds decide to start differently and look toward the GM. The GM Cannon takes some ideas from the Guncannon but is cheaper and easier to mass produce. Like the GM it&#039;s a light-weight MS and has economical titanium armor, so in order to better fit the fire support role they had to give it thicker and stronger legs for more stability on the ground and even then it only has one cannon to save costs and reduce recoil. There&#039;s a version of the GM Cannon that removes the heavy legs and adds extra leg thrusters for better space mobility.<br><br>The GM Cannon II is the pinnacle of the line and the very last model they built, it&#039;s built with heavy armor all over but still made of titanium so it&#039;s not too expensive, has lots of extra thrusters so it&#039;s not too sluggish in space movement, and the twin beam cannons are much more destructive than the old projectile cannons, although they lose the ability for indirect-fire.
