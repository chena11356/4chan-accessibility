A protagonist just being the character a story follows, and not inherently tied to the character&#039;s morality, personality, goals etc. at all. A protagonist does not need to be a &quot;meek good guy&quot;, and I wouldn&#039;t describe any of the previous Gundam protagonists beyond perhaps Al as that anyway. I definitely wouldn&#039;t describe Amuro, Kamille or Judau as &quot;meek&quot; for one, even if they&#039;re &quot;good guys&quot;.<br><br>If the audience is supposed to be rooting for the highly motivated antagonist and not the poorly motivated protagonist though, then the antagonist is the more interesting character and the story should be following him because he&#039;s the more interesting character who is doing more interesting things. If you want a reason why more stories don&#039;t do things like that then it&#039;s probably because more stories follow the interesting character, whether they&#039;re a good guy or not, and not the less interesting one. The antagonist is often cooler in a lot of stories, but usually isn&#039;t notably more interesting; though then again, I&#039;d say the same is broadly true of Gato. I say broadly, because while I can certainly see why someone would think he&#039;s cooler, I definitely don&#039;t think he&#039;s interesting. I don&#039;t think any of 0083&#039;s cast are interesting though.

They&#039;d draw the mobile armors to more isolated locations and keep them there while they were shot with danslief from a safe distance (like space. Just look at Hashmal&#039;s excavation).</span><br><br>This makes no sense for basically the same reason that the use of dainsleifs to take out the Barbatos and Gusion in the finale makes no sense, because dainsliefs and hypersonic kinetic impactors like them don&#039;t travel that fast when talking about launching them from fucking orbit. If the units were in low orbit then they could be as high up as 2,000km (assuming terraformed Mars&#039; gravity is anything like Earths), but even if they were just 100km above sea level; a hypersonic impactor usually only travels about mach 5. Which would take maybe 10 seconds to cover that distance. Which is almost certainly far lower than the actual height the Graze&#039;s were shooting at, since none of them appeared to be using thrust to adjust for height and/or combat gravity.<br><br>So the Barbatos, Gusion and/or any theoretical mobile armors that the Gundams fought during the Calamity War would have had to stand stock still for 10 seconds plus for any kinetic impactor shot from orbit to hit them, not moving by more than a couple of meters in any cardinal direction, because the shot would whiff if the target moved by more than it&#039;s own body dimension. Which is...unlikely unless you are literally sitting on top of it. At which point you&#039;ll get pinned down too. Barbatos and Gusion standing stock still for that long, if not for several minutes if the Graze&#039;s were at any reasonable height is just so silly/lazy that I can&#039;t give it any credit as a tactic personally.
