Plus, it was a more ubiquitous element of SDF Macross than of Raideen. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a reputable source for either however. Personally though, I&#039;m not a fan of transformable mobile suits, both because I don&#039;t think the vast majority of them have interesting transformations and because the shows rarely make good use of them regardless. They mostly just transform to go to and from a battlefield, and then fight as mobile suits. The variable fighters in Macross are cool on the other hand because the transformation is generally pretty slick and both forms usually look at least decent, while the choreography often takes advantage of the multiple forms.<br><br>I think a transformation could work in a series taking place in a more dramatic/exaggerated setting like G or Wing, if it has a very stylistic base. The Epyon having a twin dragon transformation could have been really cool for instance, especially if it first appears fighting in that more monstrous form. It doesn&#039;t have a notably monstrous transformation though; it just folds it&#039;s legs over the rest of the body.
