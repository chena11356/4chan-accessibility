They did get access to the Innovade&#039;s technology, which should have included the Reborns and 1 and 1.5 Gundams, which were superior to CB&#039;s tech in S2, enough for the Reborn&#039;s to match the 00R using fake drives.

The series centers around an evangelical superhero who fights evil, often by quoting scripture, as well as breaking the fourth wall. The show had three incarnations: The Bibleman Show, The Bibleman Adventure, and Bibleman: Powersource. The series&#039; titular character was played by Willie Aames from 1995 to 2003 and by Robert T. Schlipp from 2004 to 2010. Originally owned by Pamplin Entertainment, then sold to Tommy Nelson, the series is currently owned by B&amp;H Kids. It was re-launched in CGI format in 2016 (new title Bibleman: The Animated Adventures).", "filename": "bibleman", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1669680079960919, "time": 1669680079, "md5": "/VauTnjEVxj84HhvV2HwOA==", "fsize": 104254, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "bmg-bibleman-general-1", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 37, "images": 10, "omitted_posts": 32, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 21311510, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)19:04:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I\u2019m on a mission from God.", "filename": "1BBC0AAD-93FF-4E11-B6AD-7B00461874F1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 728, "h": 455, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1669853084332549, "time": 1669853084, "md5": "w3A3thn6t1cllDRqYdloaA==", "fsize": 48604, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21311519, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)19:09:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21309616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21309616</a><br>Sacred Sentai Saviorman(but they&#039;ll pronounce it Seibaman)", "time": 1669853362, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21311534, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)19:18:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21307819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307819</a><br>Makes the Power Rangers look like the Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills", "time": 1669853936, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21311826, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)22:12:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21307979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307979</a><br><a href=\"#p21307984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307984</a><br>Sounds badass.", "time": 1669864373, "resto": 21307819}, {"no": 21311852, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)22:38:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "GOD DID", "time": 1669865931, "resto": 21307819}], "last_modified": 1669865931}, {"no": 21149932, "now": "09/21/22(Wed)15:46:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "ITT: Cloaks, Capes and other kinds of clothes", "com": "What it says on the subject, post /m/ stuff with cloaks, capes and other types of clothes.", "filename": "Crossbone", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 941, "h": 1100, "tn_w": 213, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1663789563047288, "time": 1663789563, "md5": "BK7mwKNHH7ZydDp5mgzksQ==", "fsize": 643559, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "itt-cloaks-capes-and-other-kinds-of-clothes", "custom_spoiler": 4, "replies": 92, "images": 67, "omitted_posts": 87, "omitted_images": 64, "last_replies": [{"no": 21300982, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)06:48:56", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1583354840322[1]", "ext": ".png", "w": 924, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669376936868679, "time": 1669376936, "md5": "ORK+HOsbwmg/ouT/2BdX4w==", "fsize": 849798, "resto": 21149932}, {"no": 21303331, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)15:56:14", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "vHkdUWN", "ext": ".png", "w": 470, "h": 626, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669496174707253, "time": 1669496174, "md5": "WvXdziMwVeFEZ0KvR174Tw==", "fsize": 783342, "resto": 21149932}, {"no": 21304692, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)07:25:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21199806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21199806</a><br>Those are two separate robots.", "time": 1669551914, "resto": 21149932}, {"no": 21311321, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)15:27:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21253833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21253833</a><br>I really enjoyed it, but things got pretty odd.
