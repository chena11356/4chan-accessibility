Basically the analog stick started dropping inputs, so for example if you were running forward as Link in OoT he would stop and start - essentially unusable. Both had the exact same problem. <br>Unfortunately they both had fallen just outside the warranty window, and their support didn&#039;t even reply when I sent them like a &quot;Hey, anything I can try to do to fix these?&quot; <br>About a year later someone on twitter was asking about them, and I outlined that whole chain of events to them and said that I don&#039;t recommend them at all. From that tweet, their PR/customer support team reached out to me and ultimately actually shipped me two of the newer wireless versions by way of apology. And the wireless one has held up a lot better than the originals. At least, so far. <br>So maybe the takeaway is, they used to be utter crap, and now are (hopefully) a lot better. The analog stick on all of these these is just kind of weird though. <br><br>In the interim I used the wired Retro-Bit Tribute64 (which is modeled after the famous Hori N64 controller) and I actually liked this a lot better than any of the Brawler64s.

It had evolved from a question of permissions to a question of facilitation. It was the Switch/PS4/FaggotboxOne generation where all three companies had fully committed to modern rot concepts. Their hardware angle was set and leaned into, their policy and strategy on the brave new werld of microtransactions, unfinished beta AAA releases, bloatgramming, and various other consumer abuses that old games lack were set and normalized.<br><br>Maybe retro can be defined by exactly in which ways companies abused consumers. Back in the day your lives were tied to a real life quarter that you popped into the machine, so the market wanted HARD games that you learned to play by dying repetitively. When the move to console came it wasn&#039;t long till this shifted. Instead of incessantly killing you (unpopular with millenials), the games were filled with meaningless content and time wasters.

Half-Life 2 can&#039;t really be considered retro, while Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines could, since it inherits so much from 2000&#039;s Deus Ex.", "time": 1670845193, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485279, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ITT", "filename": "proxy-image", "ext": ".png", "w": 865, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670845425056418, "time": 1670845425, "md5": "YHUOB1zfGFVwmEFgLY1AXQ==", "fsize": 791422, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485289, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:51:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9484880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9484880</a><br>But the Japanese have notoriously bad taste, so this is not a good argument.", "time": 1670845874, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485306, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)07:00:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9483448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483448</a>", "filename": "mpv-shot0567", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 959, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670846420040463, "time": 1670846420, "md5": "ocrkW2W0jb9vApN5Cnv3bA==", "fsize": 174444, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485364, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)07:56:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9485275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9485275</a><br>Nah that&#039;s dumb.", "time": 1670849776, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485402, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)08:24:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9485364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9485364</a><br>Cope<br>It&#039;s the closest you&#039;ll ever get to an objective definition of retro", "time": 1670851450, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485415, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)08:33:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I honestly don&#039;t mind the 6th generation being considered retro, but I do understand the complaints.

I just feel like the actual core gameplay in 2k4 is meh, meaning the deathmatching. The actual team-based modes are actually really fun, and great! ...but they don&#039;t feel like Unreal.

It punishes failure heavily, but it never ends the game for you. A determined player can easily kill MB without taking a hit, if they choose to keep trying the fight rather than stock up on health. It&#039;s really a big defenseless creature, once you figure out how to freeze the spaghetti-o beams.

You&#039;re playing a stealth game, so the inability to kill guards is important to make sure you stay undetected and be more careful instead of: &quot;Oh well, I was careless and got caught, time for a sword fight!&quot; Having to get in a sword fight (or run away on difficulties that prevent killing) works, because Thief (or more accurately Thief 1) is meant to evoke tension and fear of getting caught and to stray you away from confrontation. The blackjack (note: there is no specific spot you have to hit guards with it, you can do it from any direction, even the front, provided they aren&#039;t in combat) works as a mechanic, because the choice to use it or not use it changes the way the game it played, if you knock guards out you get the burden of hiding their bodies, so other AI don&#039;t see them.

It&#039;s been known since forever ago that Woolsey didn&#039;t deliver the most faithful translation, not to mention all the censorship, which is why we got that old Sky Render fan translation over twenty years ago (that we now know to be amateurish as fuck). Then the GBA game came out, and its translation was recognized to be much more accurate, but it had two problems: first, by that point, Woolsey&#039;s script had obtained meme status, and while the GBA script kept some of his lines, it changed or tossed enough of them out to piss a vocal part of the fanbase off. Second, the GBA version had problems of its own, namely shit music, slowdown and lower resolution, among others. So now you have a bunch of Woolsey fanboys who like the idea of a more accurate script while still staying true to the Woolsey &quot;flavor&quot;, all on the mostly superior SNES version, and before long, we got the Ted Woolsey Uncensored hack. Problem is, its creator didn&#039;t know a lick of moon, so all he did was mix and match bits and pieces of the Woolsey, GBA and Sky Render scripts as he pleased, and to top it off, he decided to also make it an overarching &quot;game improvement&quot; hack that fixed a gorillion longstanding bugs and added QoL changes. This effectively set the mold for all like-minded hacks that followed, all of which were made by people with no nip-speaking credentials, and all of which were convinced they could do it better than the last, especially given they&#039;re not constrained to just script changes, but outright game changes as well, so every new release is just feature creep.

By the time thedid rapidly expand, it was younger people making the stories, who had a different perception of WWII and Japan as a whole. since the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s Japan has just very heavily leaned into using young people in media. <br><br>On the contrast to what the west was doing. The growth of hollywood never stopped during the war, only shifted. And the stream of stories was always on the middle aged. It wasn&#039;t till the 50&#039;s that the west also started incorporating young people into their stories. <br><br>I think FFX suffers from some slight issues, as far as intent and facts though. Auron is supposed to old at age 35 and even refers to himself as young 10 years ago, when he was 25. Yet we have a maester who has served for some 70 years. I think what happens is characters get designed and created and then put into a story and not organically written. So it&#039;s part of the overall media franchise machine.", "time": 1670852896, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485524, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:21:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9469583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9469583</a><br>I have caused multiple hookups to lactate by sucking on their tits long enough", "time": 1670854905, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485536, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:36:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9483121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483121</a><br>IIRC, doesn&#039;t Kimahri just carry her during that sequence?", "time": 1670855801, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485890, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)12:23:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9469583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9469583</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><s>You realize milk only comes after childbirth right</s><br>You do realise that men can also lactate without having given birth?", "time": 1670865797, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485970, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)12:59:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9484332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9484332</a><br>So I&#039;m replaying X-2 and it just dawned on me, does the HD version of X-2 still use Wakka&#039;s old model when X doesn&#039;t?

But the game has some slowdowns. Check the overclock mod if you care about more performance.<br>- The fan is NOISY, if you care about noise check the noctua fan mod. <br>- Lightgun games, if you have CRT TV go for it, LCD lightgun mods are expensive.<br>- Fighting games, worth playing, look and sound great, go for it unless you want to use an arcade stick. <br>- Resident Evil, Skies of Arcadia, Jet Set Radio, worth it. <br>- Soul Reaver has better models and effects that the PC version, worth it. <br>- Tony Hawk 2 runs at 30fps. Xbox has better textures and it&#039;s a different game (2X), better version, but dreamcast has the &quot;proper classic&quot; version. <br>- Rayman 2 worth it because it&#039;s closer to the &quot;classic&quot; version. <br>- The 480p picture quality makes this console a MUST. It&#039;s amazing to play 90s games in this resolution. <br>- DCHDMI isn&#039;t worth it. I got a $25 usd VGA box from AliExpress that also outputs HDMI and the picture quality is amazing, I have an OLED B7 that actually does a great job upscaling the 480p output. <br>- The controller is a hit and miss, the camera control in Soul Reaver with the D-pad is just horrendous with that layout. <br><br>So: small library, but amazing picture quality, and iconic games, IMO expensive mods like DCHDMI and GDEMU are a waste of money, check the library, you will have a great time with this console, but probably just with a dozen of games lol, currently playing Skies of Arcadia and Soul Reaver.", "time": 1671209519, "resto": 9484987}, {"no": 9495835, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)13:26:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9486143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9486143</a><br>the NAOMI Arcade game Dynamic Golf was supposed to be ported to Dreamcast as Virtual Golf but was also cancelled as the plug was pulled on the DC. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sL<wbr>Th2Jyhb4<br>https://segaretro.org/Virtua_Golf<br>Which is a same as it looks really good and fun to play like the Viertua Tennis games are;<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ8<wbr>elSxGjCw<br>There is a version of it in GDI format on a Dremcast full collection of games on archive.org but I have never been able to get it to work with any DC emulator.

And looks like Sonic was quite popular on it, ending the meme that &quot;no one knows Sonic in Japan&quot;\u2014MD simply sold like shit, and Sonic with it. <br>That said, the top was clearly dominated by RPGs, with Shining and Phantasy Star, and even games like Langrisser 2.

Also perhaps explains the perception that N64 was bigger than PSX that some people have. <br>However, this also went the other way: PSX had 50+ games that sold 1 million copies or more in North America, while N64 had less than 30.

If you can do that youre only 1-2 attempts from beating the game. I find your philosophy on save states for practice interesting. Giving youself the freedom to break a challenge into rehersable chunks instead of a blind gaunlet really only has one difference in that it takes less time to master. The end result once you do the full run is the same so i&#039;d argue that its fine.

To upgrade them you need to collect the same colour repeatedly without collecting the other colours, otherwise you go back to the lv1 version of the collected weapon. Try it, it will make a huge difference. Melee enemies that get close because itll either oneshot them or knock them back giving you room for a charge shot. They have very basic patterns to play around once you know how they work. Boss of stage 1 is a bit of a pain if you dont know the patterns and some require you get into position before the attack comes out. If the turret is spinning one way try to be one the end of that rotation so you have enough time to read the pattern before youre expected to dodge. Shifting levels and ducking is effective.

It has cool scaling and is one of the better looking games for the add-on. The animation is original, and made for the game. Even if it is a bit grainy. They don&#039;t use any licensed music, for whatever reason, so its all original composition. I think it&#039;s good. Cool looking arcade style shooter. It was like a sequel to Batman Returns driving sections. Batman returns for the Sega CD is a port of the Genesis game, but contains a CD soundtrack, these scaling driving sections ad some cutscenes using the scaling hardware. The driving sections in Batman Returns could be played on their own. I honestly think it is harder than the Genesis game overall.

Pattern recognition is a form of puzzle solving, where the player is rewarded for how quickly they can recognize and adapt to a challenge with an equal amount of skill execution thrown on top. The appeal of a single player action game is that once you&#039;ve passed a skill check you move onto the next one in increasing levels of difficulty and complexity. Pvp and multiplayer in general is great for creating dynamic and evolving scenarios but it also doesnt give the player and clear linear progression of their skills or promise any variety to foster it. Theres a reason at uni I mostly made couch multiplayer games. It was a cheap shorthand to getting emergent play out of a few design elements. Put a character controller in a room with a ball they have to roll into a basket? Boring. Put two character controllers in a room with baskets for each of them? Watch the strategies emerge, add a few rock paper scissors elements and boom. good grades. As a player you feel more intelligent but as a designer you come to appreciate how brilliant a well designed single player game is.

It was latter half of thunderforce iv. I prefer games give me a decent level of power by default but give me more power through skilled play which requires that i maintain that skill to keep the power from decaying in some way. I see a lot of shmups where the skill needed actually declines to more powerful you become. The scrolling sections become pushovers and the only threats being anything that can live to get a shot off and the bosses that can tank the damage. Its easy to develop bad habits when you spend most of a stage not seeing a single attack pattern. When a threat comes around that does challenge your damage output losing that output is a death sentence when you have so little familiarity with the stage. I think its more a case of power being to static 100-0 than a smooth gradient that causes the issue.

Perhaps it&#039;s part of an appeal to the genre but so many other games in this genre generally feel more along the lines of &quot;passion projects&quot; with a number of apparent flaws that would turn off average consumers, only RE and SH really feel like true &quot;big budget&quot; experiences. I was only born in 98 but to anyone that grew up with it just how long did RE stay relevant?

Even Silent Hill, its greatest rip-off, is absolutely nothing like Resident Evil. It has virtually no item management, and ammo is not scarce at all. Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist.

SH3 both tries to tell a deeper narrative happening around the protagonist and those around her but also have her experience her own personal journey, it&#039;s a very ambitious narrative that, overall, I would say works out well but doesn&#039;t feel quite as cohesive as the prior two entries. Generally I think people see SH3 as having &quot;less meaning&quot; in what the game, and this is true in a few regards but still pretty inaccurate to the overall. Honestly I think the symbolism and themes go over people&#039;s heads because they&#039;re so heavily based in the feminine experience. If you&#039;re a guy I feel like it&#039;s likely you just kind of don&#039;t think about things like the game&#039;s various menstrual imagery, though some things like the hole leading to the final boss are hard to miss.<br><br>I always have a hard time deciding between SH1 and SH3 as my personal favorite. SH3 has a lot going for it with the most refined gameplay and graphics of the series, but it&#039;s also the most obviously compromised of the first three games. The game has essentially no exploration outside of the dungeons and a handful of &quot;grab thing, walk a room over, use thing&quot; moments. It&#039;s a great game on its own merits, but how it compares to prior entries and their strengths gives a lot of differing thoughts. I would say that, as simply a &quot;video game&quot;, that SH3 is the best, as to be expected being the newest, but it&#039;s clear pure gameplay is not why people love horror games.", "filename": "Ffn6nbWVQAAigcN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670955746219477, "time": 1670955746, "md5": "PMYuoi9u29tzPP5ZgPM7Cg==", "fsize": 63545, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488604, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Allow me to put this retarded discussion to rest.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 wikipedia is wrong </span><br>Okay school teacher.", "filename": "1649719663676", "ext": ".png", "w": 552, "h": 32, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 7, "tim": 1670955848062248, "time": 1670955848, "md5": "SWb5cKYBsciKWJJ4uj/yWQ==", "fsize": 5896, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488609, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488604</a><br>I know you must be genuinely retarded but yes, that is why wikipedia is generally agreed to be a fucking non source for anything unless wikipedia directly links to the actual source, literally fucking anyone can write in it and unless someone decides that what was written was wrong (and the cucks in charge agree with the changes) then that is the information present <br><br>fuck off literal NPC", "time": 1670956080, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488610, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *actual*, real thing that separates a &quot;survival horror&quot; game from something else is the true permanence of consequence</span><br>That has literally nothing to do with survival horror.

Normally you would say the sub-genre, but if you said &quot;action game&quot; then you know what the gameplay will revolve around: hand-eye coordination challenges. There are action games that are also horror. Not survival horror. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; notice how you again conceded the inventory management point. </span><br>You never finished your point or responded to mine. What does moving the items around do fundamentally to the gameplay? You aren&#039;t prevented from continuing the game if you don&#039;t move them around. The reason it&#039;s even mentioned as a thing in other RE games is because you have to make sure that you have space for key items, which requires sacrificing already limited space. <br>When I mentioned RE4 has unlimited inventory space for key items, you said it would be absurd to try to play the game otherwise. Why? Because then you&#039;d have to balance your weapons and ammo with the key items. Crazy? For a game that emphasizes combat, not for a survival horror game.", "time": 1671052283, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9491469, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)16:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9475249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9475249</a><br><br>are you me, im 35 now and have a daughter and i suddenly got the urge to play all silent hill. i was to scared to when i was younger, also bought original re and dino crisis", "time": 1671052650, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9492090, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9491454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9491454</a><br>ok fine, re4 isn&#039;t survival horror because there&#039;s unlimited space in your inventory for key items. i guess i&#039;ll go play REAL survival horror like silent hill or fatal frame with their re1-inspired inventory syste-...uh oh", "time": 1671071460, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9492118, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:47:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "For me?

If I can add my two cents, SH 2 had the best story of the 3 games in my opinion, but only because the personal and &quot;simple&quot; nature of it all really suited the gameplay of Silent Hill. As in, minimal cutscenes and exposition dumps and long stretches of just pure gameplay. <br><br>However, Heather is my one of my favorite protagonists ever and I still really enjoyed SH3. <a href=\"#p9482770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482770</a><br><a href=\"#p9482789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482789</a><br><a href=\"#p9482861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482861</a><br>If I could add, I&#039;d say the biggest issue SH3 had was the pacing.

I realize the mall alone is supposed to be that, but you go straight from the mall <s>to the subway, then straight to the sewers, then straight to the construction yard, and then the office building, all with no interruption, story elements or anything to essentially let the player &quot;catch their breath&quot;</s>. You get one minor moment with Vincent in the office, and then that&#039;s it until the apartments. And by that point? <s>You basically hit the halfway mark of the game, you get the big reveal immediately, and then everything kicks into overdrive as you finally get to Silent Hill itself</s>.

Battling itself actually helps remove monsters stress. As you accumulate larger amounts of cash, it&#039;s definitely good to prioritize buying all the more expensive stress relieving, fatigue relieving, and sleep helping items you&#039;ll see in the shop like the cups and gems, as can afford them of course, don&#039;t skip out on them, they&#039;ll make it easier for new monsters. Also don&#039;t let your monster get fat or malnourished, fat monsters get fatigued more and underweight monsters get stressed more.<br><br>Also take it easy on baby monsters, just do the most basic training until its more mature aka when Holly tells gives you that cue that it&#039;s an &quot;important time&quot; or whatever she says, that&#039;s when you start the coach routines<br><br>Always focus on like 3, maybe 4 main stats to train your monster in.

Probably the best map design in the franchise too.<br><br>Sixth one is the first one made after Kaga, the creator of the series, left, and it shows. Barebones compared to the previous two. I actually prefer it to the other two GBA games because it&#039;s harder, but some maps can be tedious. Some get filtered by the low accuracy of your attacks but it&#039;s fine.<br><br>Also, play Tear Ring Saga and Berwick Saga, the games made by Kaga after he left IS. TRS is pretty much a FE game and it&#039;s better than most of the series, and BS is a contender for the title of best SPRG ever made imo, it&#039;s a masterpiece.<br><br>So if you&#039;re in a hurry, only play Genealogy, Thracia, TRS and BS, because they&#039;re very good.

However, I did buy lots of PS1 magazines. (yes they were still making PS1 magazines in 01-03). Those magazines had demos in it. So I got to play lots of demos and I was 100% invested in the PS1 scene and its many titles.... even though I had never really played any of them. I ended up having lots of PS2 games but I never saw the PS2 as being as good as the PS1. It&#039;s just difficult to explain, despite not having hands-on experience with practically any PS1 games, there is still something incredibly soulful about PS1 that PS2 never reached.

The devs designed Star Fox around its awful framerate. In order to make Star Fox look right at 60fps, the game would have to be modified to match the timing of the new framerate.

Put it this way, a V30 or 286 can run games that need a 386 in the PC Compatible world to run, and to make things more interesting there were games from 1996 that could run on a V30 (basically an 8086).

The logical conclusion is to get the correct controller for each of the consoles you plan to emulate. Because of the gulf in quality between first party controllers and third party USB clones, you&#039;re going to want first party original controllers and of course because there is no way to connect them to a PC, high quality adapters for them so for every emulator you&#039;ll have to drop around $25-50 + $25-45 for controllers and adapters. Before you know it you&#039;ll be knee deep in a bin full of controllers with different dongles. Hope you got high quality ones, chink ones don&#039;t even last 5 cycles.<br><br>So the cost of free emulation after a $1000 + PC is pretty high. That&#039;s about $80 for each console you want to emulate. Now you just have to spend time configuring every game for every emulator, setting up hacks so they actually run, pining for fixes in nightly releases and tweaking CRT shaders.<br><br>Will it be worth it?", "time": 1671074102, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490758</a><br>dogshit dpad", "time": 1671075021, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492292, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:35:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490375</a><br>Why didn&#039;t they go all out and give it triggers?

It&#039;s objectively the PS3 controller and I&#039;ll tell you why. Xbox controllers don&#039;t have the gyroscope or whatever it&#039;s called (six axis motion?) and the PS4 controller comes close, but it doesn&#039;t have pressure sensitive face buttons. Most controllers have pressure sensitive triggers, but that&#039;s it. Basically, this is the only controller that allows you to lightly press any button and also registers tilt. Why does this matter you ask? Because there are a few games where this is absolutely needed. If I remember correctly, the Metal Gear solid games from the ps2 needed this and when they were ported to xbox they needed to redo these mechanics. Also you can emulate the ps3 nowdays so there&#039;s Heavely Sword, etc. The only downside is that it doesn&#039;t use a micro usb like the PS4 controller, it uses a mini usb.

Going from being the King&#039;s Field and AC devs to then hitting there stride with the Souls formula and getting themselves out of that perception of being a lower tier company. I guess filling in that mecha niche helped them to be carried as you put it. Just think of all those other companies that were in their shoes at one point. Most didn&#039;t make it to today. They either got bought out and completely gutted until they were a soulless in name only company or they just were outright made defunct. Lets take EA for example, you got Bioware which was actually honestly at the time of EA&#039;s acqusition a much bigger and more known company than From. People loved Bioware even prior to EA.

However it&#039;s still a good game and gets credit for establishing the new setting and having a memorable cast and campaign. <br>The second game fleshes out and expands upon pretty much every aspect while also having more subtle and mature writing, although the game&#039;s conclusion was clearly rushed and in need of a sequel that never happened. <br>I especially liked how your actions and choices in 2 will affect your companions, turning them further to the dark or light side depending on whether they like you or not. You also get a lot more chances to roleplay your character&#039;s backstory and motivations.<br>Basically all you need to identify the tone and direction of both games is to listen to their respective soundtracks. They sound almost completely different from each other while also staying faithful to Star Wars. 1 is a classic hero&#039;s journey which is very satisfying by the end, while 2 is more of an introspection on the player character and their actions and beliefs throughout the game. They offer different roleplaying experiences from each other, which I would urge people to embrace rather than wishing one was more like the other. 2 for example doesn&#039;t have an epic satisfying ending like 1 does which leaves a sour taste in peoples&#039; mouths, which is sad because they should really be appreciative of the amazing role-playing journey present in that game. <br>Anyway, both are really good games and worth playing for RPG fans even if you don&#039;t give a shit about Star Wars.

The characters and story feel forced, HL did not have a linear story you had to follow, the story was just a backdrop to the action.

Rolls give banjo acceleration. You then jump mid roll to shoot a decent chunk further and to stop the slowdown from the roll. Speedrunners also have a technique to cycle between the two continuously. That, and there also triple jump tricks to stay in the air longer, where Banjo moves quicker than on the ground. The talon trot is actually not the best speed technique even though it looks like it. Also, people don&#039;t realize there are techniques used to climb and scale vertical platforms, which all involve precision jumping.
