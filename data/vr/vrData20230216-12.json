RPGs especially but all genres and retro console generations, handhelds and computers are welcome.<br><br>An obvious one is Shadowrun on SNES, though personally I prefer Shadowrun on Genesis/Megadrive that is literally an open world sandbox adaptation of the tabletop game, presented as a top down action RPG with a main story campaign included. You can also jack into the matrix and battle ICE with various programs to obtain data which can be sold for tons of cash. And with various patches for the rom, you can change your characters race to any other race in Shadowrun, which changes your characters stats, movement speed, character portrait, sprites and abilities. The main story will still be the same but this essentially allows you to create a fully custom character for the game. I don&#039;t think these patches are on RHDN but they a quick Google search should lead you to them.<br><br>And while they can&#039;t all be as ambitious as a complete adaptation of a tabletop game as above, any genre is welcome. One good one that would be considered retro due to it&#039;s age is the first Cyberpunk 2020 video game, Cyberpunk: The Arasakas Plot, an old cell phone game that runs on JAVA. It&#039;s a great game that had a tie in website with extra lore and passwords that could unlock extra gear and content in the game. You can actually still play it on your Android devices today using an app call J2ME a Java emulator. Just download it and then download the Cyberpunk .jar or .jad game file (also easily found) and load it up in J2ME.

Growing up without really using the internet I didn\u2019t even know there was a console war. I played gameboy and NES and later on N64 and Gameboy Color and then GameCube and Gameboy Advance then Wii and DS and I just never ran out of things to play. I also wasn\u2019t exactly rich so I hardly even came close to playing everything. Looking back at PS1 and 2s vast library I nor any of my friends, even my well off ones, had even half the games on those lists and knew of maybe only a couple of the larger ones like Metal Gear Solid they never got. Comparing something retroactively to its potential versus its actuality is a bit foolish. Games were expensive when you were a kid, piracy hardly golden. Hell, one of my friends wanted to borrow a game to pirate a copy for himself and he ended up destroying my disk, so I was very piracy averse after that experience for years. If you want to compare and argue about it now potential matters, but I don\u2019t think it matters when you actually talk about the reality of the situation. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had Symphony of the Night growing up, nowadays it\u2019s my second favorite Castlevania behind Rondo of Blood and only slightly beating out Castlevania 3. But I didn\u2019t play any of these games before I was an adult, what I played growing up was was Castlevania 1 and 2 on my dads NES, and I didn\u2019t play any of the ones on my N64 because. Well I never actually saw any at GameStop or at a yard sale. I played rogue squadron and army men and Mario and Zelda. My pals with their PlayStations played Spyro and Crash and a lot of shitty shovelware I don\u2019t really remember (like army men Kek)<br><br>And we all played on our game boys and gameboy advances because that\u2019s just what you did.

Plus we would skirmish and no one ever unlocked everything (except me I eventually finished everything in AW2 years after they had all moved on lmao) so some games you just had to get for yourself so you\u2019d wait for your birthday or do yard work and mow grass to get it. But seriously even my pal who\u2019s dad was a doctor who would continually buy and update his computer to play the newest games on PC, and then would give his son his hand me downs, didn\u2019t get every game. I mean they had an Xbox even? And he had a lot of games for it but not everything that would show up on a top 10 best Xbox games list. Even if they could technically have afforded them all he had neither infinite time nor infinite knowledge and my friend was playing on his gameboy as much as his fancy Alienware computer or fancy new Xbox none of us had. We\u2019d all go over to his house to play halo or some of his exclusive four player party games, because that\u2019s just what you did. You played games and shared with your friends.

This thread is all about Nintendo licensing, and any 3rd party game publisher that had a contract with Nintendo pre-1991/ 1992 were locked down to Nintendo&#039;s hardware and could not publish their games on any competing console. I think the FCC cracked down on Nintendo by 1991 and Nintendo had to change their contracts and remove the exclusivity deal. EA was never a Nintendo publisher and worked with Konami/ Ultra on the NES. They jumped over to the Genesis/ MD in 1990. LJN created a separate company called Arena Games, so they could publish Genesis/ MD games and work around Nintendo&#039;s contracts. Acclaim created the company Flying Edge, which would publish Genesis/ Sega games exclusively. Flying Edge was a division of Acclaim, and Arena was a division of LJN. But Acclaim purchased LJN and all of LJN&#039;s subsidiaries. in the end, Acclaim owned LJN, Flying Edge and Arena Games. Jack Friedman started fresh with THQ. Tengen was a division of Atari Games.

Though, less of a deal seeing Capcom. Street Fighter II SCE was one of the first actual Genesis/MD games that Capcom made in-house. But there were Capcom games on the Genesis that were ported by Sega before that. From 1989-1990, Sega has very few third party publishers for the Genesis. TENGEN was one of them. TENGEN going unlicensed on the NES, they did get a third party license from Sega for the Genesis/ MD and were one of the first western third party publishers for the console. <br><br>For me, the first TENGEN game I ever had was Pac-Man for the NES.

Or at least closer to the arcade game, but still not exact. the NES game is still at a smaller resolution compared to the arcade game. the Cherry sprites missing details. But, it was a solid enough port. Namco used the same port too? I also remember renting the TENGEN Ms. Pac-Man NES port too. It looks closer to the arcade game, but the screen has to scroll. Giving you 3/4th of the screen. But still, not a big annoyance. But the game does have co-op option, and the option for smaller and more compressed maps that fit the screen, and the option for larger maps. Namco game has the whole map viable on screen, like the Pac-Man NES port, but graphics are less than arcade accurate. The TENGEN game has to scroll to use arcade resolution graphics.

It was found that if you sent a voltage spike to the chip it disables it until you power cycle the console. The NES10 basically does the equivalent of pressing the reset button if the other chip on the cart ever fails it&#039;s security check (Hence why the NES keeps resetting if there is no cart inserted), so disabling it works for bypassing the DRM. The Famicom never had it, so it could not be integrated that well into the console unlike later Nintendo systems, which is why just simply removing the pin from the chip that sends the reset signal disables the DRM completely instead of prevents the console from working at all.<br><br>No idea if it could cause damage, but it likely was not good for it.

The &quot;survival horror&quot; tension is incredibly effective. Every time I enter a new room my ass is clenched listening for zombies because I don&#039;t want to get bit or waste bullets. You don&#039;t know what&#039;s going to come next, especially when there are enemies like giant spiders that you wouldn&#039;t necessarily expect to be in a zombie game. And on top of that the game is extremely well designed so that you can anticipate what comes next based on the items you found in the area you&#039;re currently in, due to familiarity with games in general, but you still don&#039;t know exactly. So it creates a very satisfying give and take where you feel like you&#039;re using your brain to survive while at the same time reacting in the moment to the unexpected.<br>It&#039;s also interesting to think about how this was the game that started the franchise. I know all about Umbrella and the t-virus and the characters etc. but if you played this game when it came out that would&#039;ve been completely new, off the cuff, no big plan to create a franchise that would spawn a million more games. You would have no idea that there was a laboratory hidden under an elevator disguised as an ornate fountain, it would&#039;ve been mind blowing.

But you can easily use Charmander to solo the game, or Squirtle to build a team around. <br>Personally, when I want to not use a starter I usually go with Charmander to grind through with ember, get a nidoran as a support until I can lean more on him and get to Cerulean and have access to all the Pokemon around there.", "time": 1675984541, "resto": 9642534}, {"no": 9647656, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)18:31:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9643619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9643619</a><br>Bulbasaur is the best one not just because of the early game but also because Razor Leaf is literally busted and also there aren&#039;t any better grass types than Venusaur in the game.

Of course Disney isn&#039;t an entity focused on bringing joy or anything like that, though many people there had that intention back then, and maybe even today, but still, a company has a single true goal, making money and staying on top, and a way to do that is expand into different markets to make more money somewhere else. In the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s Disney truly caught on to video games and their growth, and we got many gems thanks to that.<br><br>I&#039;m mostly familiar with SEGA&#039;s Illusion series, which is what I grew up with, on my good old Mega Drive, though that series also had plenty of releases on both Game Gear and Master System, which I&#039;ve played now that I&#039;m all grown up and thoroughly enjoyed for what they were. I didn&#039;t grow up with just Mickey and Donald though, there were also tons of video games based on Disney films, like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King, which are the ones I remember most fondly, though there were many others like Aladdin. Disney&#039;s video games kept being made when the jump to 3D happened, on PS1 and N64, and quality was still good.<br><br>Nowadays though... we&#039;ve got Kingdom Hearts and not much else, so if you&#039;re not into that series then there&#039;s not much to see, back then when Disney would put out a new film it was a matter of time before we got a video game adaptation, regardless of how good or bad they were, we had them at least. Of course, this could all change with the new Disney Illusion Island, for Nintendo Switch, it looks like a modern World of Illusion and I&#039;m really into that, hopefully it lives up to the name.

Special and super moves are intentionally more difficult to do than basic punches and kicks to balance their usefulness and power. So say, doing Zangief&#039;s spinning pile driver. It&#039;s one thing to be able to do the move while practicing, but it&#039;s another to be able to do the move consistently at just the right time and under the pressure of fightingyour opponent.

You&#039;re nothing without your B&amp;Bs with most characters. A combo considered &quot;easy&quot; in smash: in a specific percentage range, with Mario, grab, throw downwards, and right as the opponent bounces from the floor, shorthop -&gt; up tilt -&gt; up tilt -&gt; up B. The opponent can escape the combo with DI, so you have to follow the direction where he moves as you execute the combo, and you may have to turn that up b into nair or something else. This is WAY harder than a combo you would call easy in SF.

Hell from our perspective, this is how traditional fighting games are, since with command inputs the character does everything for you as long as you have those inputs memorized. Smash is, like basketball, easy to get into but hell to get good at, and is much harder to predicts. The ball doesn&#039;t just. get in the basket if you throw.

Just that their problem of accessibility has nothing to do with skill. I just got into traditional fighting games, and initially it felt impossible to play due to my shitty dpad. Got a good controller and read up on what people use - now what initially felt impossible feels trivial with ZERO practice. That&#039;s legacy, not skill. I had to immediately jump into training mode and memorize the b&amp;bs cause fighting games don&#039;t really have an accessible beginner pipeline. there&#039;s no items mode on to play with experienced players so we all have fun (while in basketball I played a ton of &quot;throw here, then from 3, then half-court&quot; games with my more experienced friends), the inputs can&#039;t really be learned on the fly (as you would learn basketball or football or boxing), you have no choice but to commit to the game before you even see what it&#039;s about. Unless you&#039;ve played fighting games before, there&#039;s absolutely no reason why a quarter circle -&gt; punch would throw a projectile. It&#039;s just not intuitive. That&#039;s legacy, and that&#039;s the sort of learning path that would&#039;ve made sense in the arcade days were people met face to face and you could get tutorials IRL.

What it comes down to is CRT being at its core an analog technology. It affects everything, even how frame rate works (modern monitors literally pause and hold the frame, they don&#039;t blast the field in and out leaving an afterglow the way a CRT would). The fidelity of the image is only limited by that of the human eye and the capacity of the tube. If you tone down the visibility of the scanlines to account for people seated at a healthy distance, then you get what probably just looks like a mild bloom effect. It&#039;s like trying to get the polaroid you took to look like the oil painting you saw in the museum. At the end of the day you&#039;re still looking at a polaroid and not a painting.<br>Something else people don&#039;t mention often is that it&#039;s one thing to imitate a CRT in a still image, but it&#039;s quite another to do it in motion. And I think that&#039;s almost certainly impossible for the above reasons. The concept of frame rate is very different for a CRT to that of an LCD.

However the brighter pixels blend together to some degree, so trying to emulate this effect might be more accurate then simple line doubling. What is term for this, bloom?

Shinra&#039;s end goal was to create Neo Midgar by finding The Promised Land, a place with allegedly infinite Mako, and putting a reactor on top of it. And their goal with Jenova&#039;s corpse was to take cells from it and artificially create a human with the abilities of the Cetra. So the hybrid could speak to the Planet, point the way to The Promised Land, and Shinra could print infinite money. Which is just deranged. Imagine reading the Bible and getting to the scripture that speaks of Heaven having streets of gold. And rather than seeing that as God&#039;s promises to encourage you to get closer to God and reach a spiritual enlightenment, instead you decide to take the information you can find and make a lab baby that can possibly infiltrate heaven.

And that Jenova was the enemy of the Planet. Hojo didn&#039;t give a fuck though. Even after finding Hojo and Ifalna he forged ahead with his experiments out of curiosity of what Jenova would do. And since no one updated Gast&#039;s notes from when they were still working in the Mansion, Sephiroth got the wrong idea after reading them. Believing that Jenova was a Cetra that was done dirty by humans and the world belonged to her. Just like his father though, Sephiroth didn&#039;t care and forged ahead after finding out the truth and went with his own insane Meteor plan.

Clive, for better or worse, cannot hinge on the reputation of previous characters to succeed. He has to tell his own story in his own setting. Everyone already fucking likes Cloud.

And it doesn&#039;t stop here because it leads to a lot of questions about why the world is the way it is. Why did the crisis from the sky happen? Why did the Cetra die? Why did fate or whatever choose humans over the Cetra knowing where history would lead them? I really fucking hope the Whispers don&#039;t come from the Planet itself because that means now that Aeris died for what is now no reason. She went to pray to the Planet to spare humanity once it fires Holy when the planet never had any intention of destroying humanity from the beginning and has a gang of agents in the background to ensure things happen according to plan. Why was the Planet screaming in pain when the Whispers could&#039;ve just... not let Mako energy happen? Plots centered around fate, determinism, and destiny really need to be planned out.

Like 7 leans heavily into the unreliable narrator concept. Because it&#039;s just a video game right? Why would you ever doubt what the main character says? Even before you get to the Northern Crater there are parts of Cloud&#039;s character that makes no sense. Like how he claimed to be a 1st class SOLDIER yet he&#039;s at lv1 in the flashback. Weaker than the lv4 he starts the game with and only slightly stronger than the lv3 you meet Barrett at. Or how he starts finding plotholes in his own story when you first reach Junon. On the 2nd playthrough FF7 gets better because you start to realize how it all falls into place. Like with the level thing. Despite everything Cloud said, he didn&#039;t know what it actually felt like to be as strong as a SOLDIER 1st class. So he couldn&#039;t replicate the feeling of that strength in his memory. So you have Cloud walking around dressed up as SOLDIER but he doesn&#039;t have the strength to go with it.

I can offer some of their thoughts. <br><br>Some arcade machines kept track of how much they earned in the hidden operator test settings. Data would display on how much money/quarters that players put inside the machine on each difficulty. You could track the data. <br><br>If you made the difficulty too high, then casual players would give up and stop playing because it was too hard.<br><br>If you made it too easy, then the game wouldn&#039;t be seen as a challenge and your casual players would easily beat the on less quarters. Which means you earn less money.<br><br>The idea was to find the perfect middle ground. You could adjust default CPU difficulty on a scale from level 1 to level 10 in many games.<br><br>If your arcade was in an area with mostly casual players and children, then you kept the difficulty on moderate. You go easy on the kids to lure more quarters out of them. Give them just enough hope and they will give you more quarters. <br><br>For an arcade that had a lot of &quot;pro players&quot;, operators kept the difficulty on high because they would be more of a challenge to pro players. <br><br>For some games like Fighting games, you could even adjust the default damage level.<br><br>For example, in the Philippines the the damage level was actually kept on 50% instead of the normal 100%. Kids didn&#039;t have a lot of money, so arcade owners would lower the damage so the players that visited often would be able to &quot;feel&quot; like they got their money&#039;s worth. Matches would be extra long due to lower damage. But this kept visitors coming to arcades. This happened in many countries in Asia, South America, and the Pacific Islands where kids had less money. <br><br>In America and Europe the damage was set to 100%<br><br>This led to an interesting scenario in &quot;Marvel VS Capcom 2&quot; when they were trying to host worldwide tournaments.

Emulation does not (and will never) count. <br><br>There is a reason that official record holder websites like Twin Galaxies and other websites exist. And the rule is that it must be on original hardware. It&#039;s to hold everyone to same rules and same standards.<br><br>Games like Donkey Kong require a 4 way joystick (original manufacturer design). And Using other joysticks with more available directions actually give an unfair advantage in game. There are active lawsuits right now in the real world about records being false because of using the wrong joystick. <br><br>PC computers are not universal. Everyone has different setups. Emulation can be used to cheat and there have been numerous cases of people cheating. Like with DDR and Guitar Hero record holders who&#039;ve been caught faking their records. They record themselves with the gameplay speed reduced to around 90% or 80% (because they can&#039;t do it at 100% speed), then use a video editing program to speed it back up to 100%. <br><br>Or people trying to claim &quot;Shoot Em up&quot; or &#039;Run and Gun&#039; game records, but use autofire.

First thing first, I am not into multiplayer because I am very bad when under pressure. I only played some Red Alert 2 on LAN with my friends 20 years ago. I don&#039;t care about esports and SC2. I am Westwood C&amp;C fanboy and I have been hesitating to try Blizzard games for a long time. Tiberian Sun is my favorite and it is usually seen as thematically and visually close to Starcraft but now I see how different they are.<br>Campaign wise I still think that TS has better missions and maps. Neutral buildings, scripting, secrets etc. Starcraft missions are more like skirmish maps with minimum scripts. TS also has cooler technical stuff like deformable ground, debris doing damage, destructable bridges, working gates, flying units actually taking off and landing instead of always floating in the air. And tech tree looks more logical and less convoulted.<br>But the core gameplay of Starcraft is something else. Actually good hotkeys. So many rock-paper-scissor matchups, possibilities and little quirks. Marines on health-damaging drugs. Protoss units with rechargable shields and a building for fast charging. Zerg making suicide bombers out of humans. The joy of a Reaver drop and the chaos it causes. Manually building nukes and sending cloaked ghosts to guide them is actually fun unlike Tiberian Sun one click on cooldown superweapons. And the aforementiomed tech tree, while makes less sense in logical way, is less linear and greatly affects your gameplay choices.<br>Also I have noticed that Starcraft has some Dune 2 DNA in it that is not present in later Westwood games - upgrades, unit production facilities working in parallel, reliance on hotkeys (or visible command menu if you forget a key).<br>So, what&#039;s your opinion on Starcraft gameplay in comparison with C&amp;C?", "filename": "348028-starcraft-macintosh-advertisement", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1256, "tn_w": 159, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676452644997075, "time": 1676452644, "md5": "j8gWrlyPfvT5nGm3wROalA==", "fsize": 124437, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "starcraft-singleplayer", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 18, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 9663286, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)04:51:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9663254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9663254</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;opinion on Starcraft</span><br>Starcraft is the only good game the usa has ever produced.

Similarly, the AI is not very good in SC but it builds quickly, so the way to win is to hotkey all of your production facilities (major design error: you cannot hotkey multiple of these at once until Warcraft III) and just sit in the base, growing your economy and spamming units to the front-line as fast as possible. This is more active, but it&#039;s the same on every mission with unit production available, and it&#039;s not very exciting because you aren&#039;t involved in the fighting at all; you only periodically have to go to the battlefield to regroup forces that are standing around.<br>Wait until you get to Warcraft III, that&#039;s the peak of RTS to me and it isn&#039;t even close.

So when you play the remaster with twin stick control, it&#039;s super fucking easy. Like I am on Normal and have not come even close to dying at any point. I think the remaster supports a control option that mimics the original though, but I haven&#039;t tested it. It also has the Wiimote aiming controls if you&#039;re into that. If you have a Switch-compatible GC controller, it can be used to control the game exactly as it was on the original hardware. Visually the remaster is exceptional, and runs at 60FPS somehow despite the Switch&#039;s dogshit hardware.<br><br>Ultimately, I would recommend the remaster without any caveats, unless your mission is specifically to play the original code of the game in its purest form. The remaster is a straight visual upgrade without sacrificing any of the original&#039;s art direction or atmosphere. Control options are varied enough to give you whatever you want. It&#039;s got extra accessibility options, and some bonus features like concept art and 3D model viewers that the original didn&#039;t have. <br><br>TL;DR The remaster is definitely worth the purchase", "time": 1676349182, "resto": 9644914}, {"no": 9660218, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)23:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9644914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9644914</a><br>Really I don&#039;t know which is the best version between the original and the remaster.

Really they removed the credits sequences entirely, including from Halo 4, and have the credits on their website which you can access through a link in the game. But even on that external website, the names of the original Bungie teams who made these games are nowhere to be found. <br>Frankly disgusting. <br>Prime remaster apparently has a similar problem, not crediting the original team.", "time": 1676415038, "resto": 9661297}, {"no": 9662194, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:24:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661297</a><br>The Halo 1 remake in your screenshot was originally sold stand alone for $60 on 360, <br>it didn&#039;t have even multiplayer outside of co-op (just a map pack for Halo Reach).", "filename": "1657789592809", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 709, "h": 1001, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676417073750330, "time": 1676417073, "md5": "bjkaWWnVP6UvmIdnyF+XtA==", "fsize": 179483, "resto": 9661297}, {"no": 9662206, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:30:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661689</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i can&#039;t be bothered to learn map control</span><br>the post<br><br><a href=\"#p9662134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9662134</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doom is designed for keyboard arrows</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this shit again</span><br><br>even the fucking attract demos id recorded were done with mouse aim", "filename": "thisshitagain", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 800, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676417403658982, "time": 1676417403, "md5": "iB+FzZ0ZZuGgnyD5DuHisg==", "fsize": 402744, "resto": 9661297}, {"no": 9662247, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:49:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661297</a><br>To be fair we metroidfags have to overcompensate so they don&#039;t continue to undervalue us as an audience, the series was THIS fucking close to the same fate as Star Fox, F-Zero and Mother had people both not raised an insurmountable outcry over FedForce and bought like 10m copies of Dread.

Then you get characters like Razzly who have maybe 5 minutes of story relevance despite clearly being more interesting than that, leaving you with plot blue balls.", "time": 1676511588, "resto": 9664129}, {"no": 9666049, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)02:47:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9665235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9665235</a><br>god damn that&#039;s a lot of candy-colored uglies", "time": 1676533638, "resto": 9664129}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9652054, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "NSO Multiplayer", "com": "I know not many are fans of Nintendo Switch Online but I was wondering if we could have a thread to share Friend Codes to play any of the games available on it (I&#039;d like to try some N64 games or GBA Mario Bros).", "filename": "Nintendo-Switch-Online-Gameboy-Advance", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1800, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676132675218023, "time": 1676132675, "md5": "jtMlihPM/Igyx8ketUGprw==", "fsize": 98010, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "nso-multiplayer", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 63, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 37}, {"no": 9652130, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:59:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;paying for roms</span>", "time": 1676134780, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652143, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)12:04:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652054</a><br>Threads about Switch Online usually get deleted on this board but sure why not<br>SW 7546 0332 3132<br>I have the Expansion thingie", "time": 1676135086, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652617, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:23:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Always confused me how apparently no one plays masterpieces like F Zero, Wave Race or 007 online together now that you can", "time": 1676146995, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652623, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:24:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652617</a><br>Because they&#039;re memes.", "time": 1676147067, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652636, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:27:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652623</a><br> I&#039;d play them online with a friend non-stop if I had a Switch", "time": 1676147253, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652638, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:28:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652617</a><br>Its because you have to add people to host games instead of being able to play with Randos.<br>And from my experience, most people don&#039;t have the Expansion due to the price and for how bad it was at launch (right now its much better but still has some issues).", "time": 1676147315, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652640, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:29:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652638</a><br>So Switch owners literally don&#039;t have friends?", "time": 1676147354, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652646, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:31:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652640</a><br>They rather pay the regular sub to play MK8D, Splatoon and Smash Ultimate than pay extra for N64 games they probably gonna go &#039; ooh the clunkyness i can&#039;t stand the clunkyness&quot;.", "time": 1676147507, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652667, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:39:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652143</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Threads about Switch Online usually get deleted on this board</span><br>jannies may be sony fags but this doesn&#039;t make sense, its literally an emulator", "time": 1676147942, "resto": 9652054}, {"no": 9652683, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:49:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652667</a><br>Maybe they think these threads are gonna turn into emulation shitposting (like most threads about NSO on /v/) so better delete them?

But of course the Genesis only has a dinky little 1-channel DAC for sample playback that relies heavily on the CPU for playback, and that combined with the low storage space meant instrument samples sounded harsh and robotic.<br><br>tldr: changing tastes in music production and poor sample playback on the Genesis is likely the reason MJ pulled out of Sonic 3, in terms of disliking the soundchip.", "time": 1676477828, "resto": 9662545}, {"no": 9663881, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)11:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9663872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9663872</a><br>Though, I think the real reason is that simple didn&#039;t have the time to crank out a full soundtrack, considering how time crunched Sonic 3&#039;s development was and how seemingly late the MJ music was implemented into the game (the earliest proto from like 2 months before the final build still doesn&#039;t have any of the MJ music).", "time": 1676478097, "resto": 9662545}, {"no": 9664126, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)13:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9663850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9663850</a><br>Apart from the ones done by Sega Sound Team?<br><br>https://youtu.be/6PPR7HXVnIk", "time": 1676484703, "resto": 9662545}, {"no": 9664745, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:14:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9664126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9664126</a><br>Love that song", "time": 1676499265, "resto": 9662545}, {"no": 9664785, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:25:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9663872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9663872</a><br>If only it had a Sega CD version", "time": 1676499935, "resto": 9662545}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9661742, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)15:20:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "these games are like really good looking NES games, neat stuff. you know about the remaster versions? they are on Archive.org btw, even had an update a while back.", "filename": "retro", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676406018940202, "time": 1676406018, "md5": "nOmwsQ0rrrOXTr5EYxCJ9g==", "fsize": 99253, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "these-games-are-like-really-good-looking-nes", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 28, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 18}, {"no": 9661768, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)15:30:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661742</a><br>I always liked the hand-painted digitized backgrounds, but honestly the gameplay in these is not nearly fun or rewarding enough to put up with it otherwise.", "filename": "09-616x442", "ext": ".png", "w": 616, "h": 442, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1676406655332080, "time": 1676406655, "md5": "p0JZr3gfEO8H9OY+8SLvQg==", "fsize": 429078, "resto": 9661742}, {"no": 9661804, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)15:46:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661768</a><br><br>It plays like a ZX Spectrum game with the stiff one-button controls and randomly appearing enemies", "time": 1676407587, "resto": 9661742}, {"no": 9661812, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)15:47:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I never played more than five minutes of the originals, but the remasters turn them into legitimately fun games for Zelda fans.

Upon trying to load the game in this newer version, without a server, I get an error stating &quot;failed to compile CON files&quot;, which to me seems as though the application itself for YN3D was changed to accomodate the new files.<br>Is there any way I can fix this and help my friend run a server to experience comfy?", "filename": "polymer", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676222075295673, "time": 1676222075, "md5": "TFhKUbLsTsKFWwMSwfceZQ==", "fsize": 862131, "resto": 9649139}, {"no": 9655383, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)12:18:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9653108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9653108</a><br>I&#039;ll be honest, I played FEAR 2 and 3 because I like to mine &quot;modern era&quot; shooters for inspiration for my tabletop games, usually Delta Green.

The wood ceiling that&#039;s completely flush with the sky by the red key area looks wrong since it implies the ceiling is ridiculously thin. The blood pools that rise when you enter them serve no mechanical purpose at all. The extensive use of sound blocking lines is weird and makes the monsters look especially dumb. If you want to divide up areas it&#039;s generally better to use distinct rooms separated by doors/lifts etc. and to give monsters the ambush flag while positioning them in a way where they won&#039;t immediately see the player. The optional plasmagun area feels pointless since there&#039;s another plasmagun nearby. The teleporter in the lava pool is pointless since the surrounding floor is short enough to walk back up. In general it feels like there&#039;s an excess of ammo and health for what you&#039;re up against.
