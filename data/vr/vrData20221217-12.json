You also get a lot more chances to roleplay your character&#039;s backstory and motivations.<br>Basically all you need to identify the tone and direction of both games is to listen to their respective soundtracks. They sound almost completely different from each other while also staying faithful to Star Wars. 1 is a classic hero&#039;s journey which is very satisfying by the end, while 2 is more of an introspection on the player character and their actions and beliefs throughout the game. They offer different roleplaying experiences from each other, which I would urge people to embrace rather than wishing one was more like the other. 2 for example doesn&#039;t have an epic satisfying ending like 1 does which leaves a sour taste in peoples&#039; mouths, which is sad because they should really be appreciative of the amazing role-playing journey present in that game. <br>Anyway, both are really good games and worth playing for RPG fans even if you don&#039;t give a shit about Star Wars.

Looking back with the benefit of hindsight regarding what I hate the most about games &amp; consoles today, I see that generation as being relatively pure.

It had evolved from a question of permissions to a question of facilitation. It was the Switch/PS4/FaggotboxOne generation where all three companies had fully committed to modern rot concepts. Their hardware angle was set and leaned into, their policy and strategy on the brave new werld of microtransactions, unfinished beta AAA releases, bloatgramming, and various other consumer abuses that old games lack were set and normalized.<br><br>Maybe retro can be defined by exactly in which ways companies abused consumers. Back in the day your lives were tied to a real life quarter that you popped into the machine, so the market wanted HARD games that you learned to play by dying repetitively. When the move to console came it wasn&#039;t long till this shifted. Instead of incessantly killing you (unpopular with millenials), the games were filled with meaningless content and time wasters. Companies believed that time spent playing on a home console was a sales leader driving new game purchases. Sounds right to me.

Basically the analog stick started dropping inputs, so for example if you were running forward as Link in OoT he would stop and start - essentially unusable. Both had the exact same problem. <br>Unfortunately they both had fallen just outside the warranty window, and their support didn&#039;t even reply when I sent them like a &quot;Hey, anything I can try to do to fix these?&quot; <br>About a year later someone on twitter was asking about them, and I outlined that whole chain of events to them and said that I don&#039;t recommend them at all. From that tweet, their PR/customer support team reached out to me and ultimately actually shipped me two of the newer wireless versions by way of apology. And the wireless one has held up a lot better than the originals. At least, so far. <br>So maybe the takeaway is, they used to be utter crap, and now are (hopefully) a lot better. The analog stick on all of these these is just kind of weird though. <br><br>In the interim I used the wired Retro-Bit Tribute64 (which is modeled after the famous Hori N64 controller) and I actually liked this a lot better than any of the Brawler64s. The only problem with these is that the connector has an absolute death grip on the controller port, which is why I switched back to the wireless Brawler64 for right now - since I didn&#039;t want to be unplugging and replugging that controller all the time, and wireless controllers just keep things a bit more tidy. You know how it is. <br><br>There is an N64 controller purist on this board who will tell you that the analog stick sensitivity and deadzones of any of these 3rd party controllers is crap compared to the original - he&#039;s got charts and whatnot to back it up.

The logical conclusion is to get the correct controller for each of the consoles you plan to emulate. Because of the gulf in quality between first party controllers and third party USB clones, you&#039;re going to want first party original controllers and of course because there is no way to connect them to a PC, high quality adapters for them so for every emulator you&#039;ll have to drop around $25-50 + $25-45 for controllers and adapters. Before you know it you&#039;ll be knee deep in a bin full of controllers with different dongles. Hope you got high quality ones, chink ones don&#039;t even last 5 cycles.<br><br>So the cost of free emulation after a $1000 + PC is pretty high. That&#039;s about $80 for each console you want to emulate. Now you just have to spend time configuring every game for every emulator, setting up hacks so they actually run, pining for fixes in nightly releases and tweaking CRT shaders.<br><br>Will it be worth it?", "time": 1671074102, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490758</a><br>dogshit dpad", "time": 1671075021, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492292, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:35:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490375</a><br>Why didn&#039;t they go all out and give it triggers?

It&#039;s objectively the PS3 controller and I&#039;ll tell you why. Xbox controllers don&#039;t have the gyroscope or whatever it&#039;s called (six axis motion?) and the PS4 controller comes close, but it doesn&#039;t have pressure sensitive face buttons. Most controllers have pressure sensitive triggers, but that&#039;s it. Basically, this is the only controller that allows you to lightly press any button and also registers tilt. Why does this matter you ask? Because there are a few games where this is absolutely needed. If I remember correctly, the Metal Gear solid games from the ps2 needed this and when they were ported to xbox they needed to redo these mechanics. Also you can emulate the ps3 nowdays so there&#039;s Heavely Sword, etc. The only downside is that it doesn&#039;t use a micro usb like the PS4 controller, it uses a mini usb.

The characters and story feel forced, HL did not have a linear story you had to follow, the story was just a backdrop to the action.

You&#039;ll have to read about how to force them back on in the advanced preferences menu of the engine if they get disabled.<br><br>Unreal Tournament has a full campaign ladder mode for solo play that takes you through pretty much all the game&#039;s content. UT:GOTY features a new Skaarj hybrid team and a revised campaign ladder with different maps, omitting an iconic map &#039;Barricade&#039; that I actually kind of liked. There&#039;s a one line setting in an .ini file for switching the game back into its original 1999 state if you want. All maps can be found in the practice menu for custom matches.<br><br>UT2k4 has a slightly less developed campaign mode that only gives you a fraction of the total content.

But the game has some slowdowns. Check the overclock mod if you care about more performance.<br>- The fan is NOISY, if you care about noise check the noctua fan mod. <br>- Lightgun games, if you have CRT TV go for it, LCD lightgun mods are expensive.<br>- Fighting games, worth playing, look and sound great, go for it unless you want to use an arcade stick. <br>- Resident Evil, Skies of Arcadia, Jet Set Radio, worth it. <br>- Soul Reaver has better models and effects that the PC version, worth it. <br>- Tony Hawk 2 runs at 30fps. Xbox has better textures and it&#039;s a different game (2X), better version, but dreamcast has the &quot;proper classic&quot; version. <br>- Rayman 2 worth it because it&#039;s closer to the &quot;classic&quot; version. <br>- The 480p picture quality makes this console a MUST. It&#039;s amazing to play 90s games in this resolution. <br>- DCHDMI isn&#039;t worth it.

There doesn&#039;t seem to be much data on game sales available, but the 2 lists Ive found paint a pretty similar picture\u2014and it&#039;s pretty interesting.<br>Ironically, the #1 game on MD supposedly was Puyo Puyo.

I&#039;m pointing this out because there&#039;s a common notion now that N&amp;B was a decent game but everybody looked down on it because it was experimental and the fans didn&#039;t want it to be, but few people mention that there was originally a more traditional BK3 announced that was scrapped and replaced by N&amp;B, and that&#039;s why the fans hated it.", "time": 1671146699, "resto": 9493526}, {"no": 9493973, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:33:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9493840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9493840</a><br>Garbage taste", "time": 1671147219, "resto": 9493526}, {"no": 9494175, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)20:17:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9493526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9493526</a><br>Because Mario and Zelda fans are both more numerous and more vocal.

Some broken stuff is fun to abuse.<br><br>Second one has trash maps, but at least it&#039;s different. idk, just give it a try and see if you like it, but I personally think it&#039;s average. Feels closer to a JRPG than to an actual SPRG.<br><br>Third one includes a remake of the first one which is more fun than the original imo. The new part is solid even if some early maps are a bit of a slog. Also has two of the best pegasus riders in the series which makes it very fun.<br><br>Fourth game is considered by some to be the best in the series and has a lot of unique stuff, though the huge maps can be an issue for some people. It&#039;s really an epic adventure worth playing at least once, and the best story in the franchise. Second best after Thracia imo.<br><br>Fifth one is my personal favorite and considered one of the best, it&#039;s fun as fuck with tons of cool mechanics, weapons and staves to use. Probably the best map design in the franchise too.<br><br>Sixth one is the first one made after Kaga, the creator of the series, left, and it shows. Barebones compared to the previous two.

Going from being the King&#039;s Field and AC devs to then hitting there stride with the Souls formula and getting themselves out of that perception of being a lower tier company. I guess filling in that mecha niche helped them to be carried as you put it. Just think of all those other companies that were in their shoes at one point. Most didn&#039;t make it to today. They either got bought out and completely gutted until they were a soulless in name only company or they just were outright made defunct. Lets take EA for example, you got Bioware which was actually honestly at the time of EA&#039;s acqusition a much bigger and more known company than From. People loved Bioware even prior to EA.

Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist.

It&#039;s a weird game in the series, it acts as a continuation of SH1&#039;s plot while telling a more personal narrative about Heather like SH2, making it feel &quot;redundant&quot; in ways. SH3 both tries to tell a deeper narrative happening around the protagonist and those around her but also have her experience her own personal journey, it&#039;s a very ambitious narrative that, overall, I would say works out well but doesn&#039;t feel quite as cohesive as the prior two entries. Generally I think people see SH3 as having &quot;less meaning&quot; in what the game, and this is true in a few regards but still pretty inaccurate to the overall. Honestly I think the symbolism and themes go over people&#039;s heads because they&#039;re so heavily based in the feminine experience. If you&#039;re a guy I feel like it&#039;s likely you just kind of don&#039;t think about things like the game&#039;s various menstrual imagery, though some things like the hole leading to the final boss are hard to miss.<br><br>I always have a hard time deciding between SH1 and SH3 as my personal favorite. SH3 has a lot going for it with the most refined gameplay and graphics of the series, but it&#039;s also the most obviously compromised of the first three games. The game has essentially no exploration outside of the dungeons and a handful of &quot;grab thing, walk a room over, use thing&quot; moments. It&#039;s a great game on its own merits, but how it compares to prior entries and their strengths gives a lot of differing thoughts. I would say that, as simply a &quot;video game&quot;, that SH3 is the best, as to be expected being the newest, but it&#039;s clear pure gameplay is not why people love horror games.", "filename": "Ffn6nbWVQAAigcN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670955746219477, "time": 1670955746, "md5": "PMYuoi9u29tzPP5ZgPM7Cg==", "fsize": 63545, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488604, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Allow me to put this retarded discussion to rest.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 wikipedia is wrong </span><br>Okay school teacher.", "filename": "1649719663676", "ext": ".png", "w": 552, "h": 32, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 7, "tim": 1670955848062248, "time": 1670955848, "md5": "SWb5cKYBsciKWJJ4uj/yWQ==", "fsize": 5896, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488609, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488604</a><br>I know you must be genuinely retarded but yes, that is why wikipedia is generally agreed to be a fucking non source for anything unless wikipedia directly links to the actual source, literally fucking anyone can write in it and unless someone decides that what was written was wrong (and the cucks in charge agree with the changes) then that is the information present <br><br>fuck off literal NPC", "time": 1670956080, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488610, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *actual*, real thing that separates a &quot;survival horror&quot; game from something else is the true permanence of consequence</span><br>That has literally nothing to do with survival horror.

If I can add my two cents, SH 2 had the best story of the 3 games in my opinion, but only because the personal and &quot;simple&quot; nature of it all really suited the gameplay of Silent Hill.

You get one minor moment with Vincent in the office, and then that&#039;s it until the apartments. And by that point? <s>You basically hit the halfway mark of the game, you get the big reveal immediately, and then everything kicks into overdrive as you finally get to Silent Hill itself</s>.

For example, Star Fox on real hardware: <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaW<wbr>PTnHUEAY<br>(note how the intro cut sscene ends at the right music cue) <br><br>30fps overclock: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ6<wbr>pWTe-Sd8<br><br>Polygon cutscene ends way before the music ends. The devs designed Star Fox around its awful framerate. In order to make Star Fox look right at 60fps, the game would have to be modified to match the timing of the new framerate. I always heard that EAD synced the first stage Corneria to Dire Straights Money for Nothing (not sure what cut).The giant robots that are carrying items in the stage are suppose to be a reference to the two CG &#039;movers&#039; in the original Dire Straights music video. <br><br>https://youtu.be/lAD6Obi7Cag?t=89<br>https://youtu.be/zaWPTnHUEAY?t=343", "time": 1670719723, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9481867, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)19:54:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9478253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9478253</a><br>looking very forward too playing this once it&#039;s done anon", "time": 1670720073, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9481903, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)20:08:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9481853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9481853</a><br>They hacked around it a fair amount in EX, I just don&#039;t think they did it enough for 60 and some stuff just feels too zippy. 30 seems okay enough.", "time": 1670720892, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482017, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:14:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Toad", "time": 1670724847, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482186, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)22:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9475186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9475186</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is your dream game, /vr/ ?</span><br>claymation car combat platformer with lolis", "time": 1670729321, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482197, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)22:32:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>The only SMW hacks that stood out to me were the single screen puzzles", "time": 1670729572, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482213, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)22:39:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>Mario World From Memory is a really good hack", "time": 1670729943, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482270, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)23:01:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "$R27JUY6", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670731306957989, "time": 1670731306, "md5": "fVg4dpe68h+LIR2NgepT7Q==", "fsize": 3139477, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482496, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)23:58:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>i like fatass peach", "filename": "peachs_adventure_green_hill2", "ext": ".png", "w": 1233, "h": 1069, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1670734706121212, "time": 1670734706, "md5": "16vgGSuTKYAguWjkaq7AIg==", "fsize": 1318967, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482518, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:06:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMS<wbr>vpE-sKcs<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjQ<wbr>BPLb8zsk", "time": 1670735196, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482631, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:46:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/50<wbr>25/", "time": 1670737603, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482645, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:53:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9482270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482270</a><br>update never ever", "time": 1670737982, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9483391, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)10:44:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Commodore VIC-20 port of H.E.R.O. is a masterpiece, probably the best game for this almost computer.", "filename": "hero", "ext": ".gif", "w": 256, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1670773494165885, "time": 1670773494, "md5": "Of6WBSl7KSJudIoVGWA7lg==", "fsize": 905062, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9483657, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)13:47:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9482496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482496</a><br>Hey!

Put it this way, a V30 or 286 can run games that need a 386 in the PC Compatible world to run, and to make things more interesting there were games from 1996 that could run on a V30 (basically an 8086).

I did find that nailing the first half of the game along with the shmup section gave me enough surplus in lives to beat the latter half. If you can do that youre only 1-2 attempts from beating the game. I find your philosophy on save states for practice interesting. Giving youself the freedom to break a challenge into rehersable chunks instead of a blind gaunlet really only has one difference in that it takes less time to master. The end result once you do the full run is the same so i&#039;d argue that its fine. If you can play a games sequel before the original or come into a shmup with knowledge of others is that not the same in practice?

I am talking maybe 1996-ish, when the Sega CD was out of retail and its final releases were being sold at discount price. I dunno why I never bought a copy, despite owning a Sega CD? It has cool scaling and is one of the better looking games for the add-on. The animation is original, and made for the game. Even if it is a bit grainy. They don&#039;t use any licensed music, for whatever reason, so its all original composition. I think it&#039;s good. Cool looking arcade style shooter. It was like a sequel to Batman Returns driving sections. Batman returns for the Sega CD is a port of the Genesis game, but contains a CD soundtrack, these scaling driving sections ad some cutscenes using the scaling hardware. The driving sections in Batman Returns could be played on their own. I honestly think it is harder than the Genesis game overall. Or maybe I just suck at the Sega CD game? <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw-<wbr>c-r0qQhg&amp;t=161s", "time": 1671263018, "resto": 9495124}, {"no": 9497316, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:45:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9495124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495124</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;single player game</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all difficulty destroyed by memorizing simple patterns for each level</span><br>fucken lol same shit as shmups, run n guns and platformers. pre-determind ez difficulty for low IQs", "time": 1671263149, "resto": 9495124}, {"no": 9497324, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:49:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9497312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9497312</a><br>I think those driving sections in the sega cd batman returns are tough.

MiSTer is a project that is taking advantage of a cheap FPGA that people can buy, called the DE-10 Nano. The DE-10 Nano is cheap because it is made for college students, and is subsidized by Intel. The DE-10 Nano has an FGPA on board, as well as an ARM chip. It has various connectors on the board for expandability. MiSTer has a bunch of FPGA cores (much like the cores you would see on one of the Analog systems) for consoles, handhelds, arcade boards and computers. Developers are constantly adding more cores and improving on existing cores. A hobbiest community has popped up around this project, which has led to a lot of hardware addons that can be installed onto the DE-10 Nano, such as extra RAM, a digital or analog I/O board, USB hub (these things make up the most common MiSTer setup that you have likely seen, which is a sandwich of three boards with the DE-10 Nano in the middle)... etc. There are people who have made specialized expansion boards like the MiSTercade, which allows it to be used in a typical JAMMA arcade cabinet. At a base level, you really just need the DE-10 Nano, and preferably a RAM stick, the rest is optional.<br><br>MiSTer can be appealing to enthusiasts because it offers better accuracy/latency compared to software emulation. It&#039;s also very easy to set up and use in a variety of scenarios, without having to invest in a bunch of extra shit like flash carts, upscalers, custom cables... etc. It is an all-in-one solution for many of the systems that a retro gamer would be interested in. By its nature, it is also very customizable. <br><br>I still think that software emulation is a good option, especially on a budget since you can probably do it on hardware that you already own, however I do like my MiSTer quite a bit and I find that I am playing more /vr/ games than ever since getting it.", "filename": "mister-sandwich", "ext": ".png", "w": 611, "h": 856, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670246300392107, "time": 1670246300, "md5": "fcC4uIUOYU6IZ0kAMoy3Dw==", "fsize": 945737, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468185, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)11:56:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467832</a><br>I was just fishing for (you)s and shitposts but this high effort response doesn&#039;t deserve it", "time": 1670259366, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468240, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)12:25:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467669</a><br>Cope comes for free with being a poorfag as well kiddo", "time": 1670261105, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468353, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)13:15:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9465495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9465495</a><br>Yes.

So how about we try something different this time around? Instead of randomly picking games for a bunch of platforms, YOU pick out your games. But there&#039;s a catch. We aren&#039;t doing every platform at once back-to-back, and you can do multiple games from the same platform over the course of the Gauntlet if this survives. We&#039;re also going chronologically starting from 1985.<br>You pick one console released that year or prior to it, and one computer platform, or and one handheld(this really won&#039;t be a part of it unless we reach 1989), or arcade games. Either way, you pick out two platforms to choose from. Then you choose one game released on each platform that year or any time prior, and have one week to get a clear/high score to post for both games chosen. Screenshots aren&#039;t the only thing encouraged, tell us why you picked that game. Tell us about the game. If you know how to make webm&#039;s of your gameplay, post those. I&#039;ll gladly help anyone who needs help getting a game to run in MAME for the Gauntlet. If the thread is still alive by next week, we go on to 1986. Otherwise I&#039;ll figure this isn&#039;t a workable fix for the Gauntlet and let it die. It&#039;s either this, curated lists, or death.<br>You won&#039;t play a crap game unless you choose to. You also have two games to switch between to prevent burnout. You can use any website you want to search for and choose the games you want to play instead of needing a list picker. If you want a challenge, you can pick hard games. If you want to try new things, you can do that.

Some people would go home just to bathe, sleep a few hours, come back into the office to work, and then play Diablo at the office. It was mostly in the name of research, though. There are a number of games that we used as inspiration. Diablo was obviously one of them. I had heard that Dragon Quest was inspired by remaking Ultima with a Japanese audience in mind. So our concept was, \u201cLet\u2019s make a Diablo game that would appeal to the Japanese audience.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: With good results. Even though Diablo is a distinctly American game, PSO feels like a very distinctly Japanese game. And yet, it\u2019s not just palatable to Japanese gamers but to everyone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think Diablo is an amazing game, but it\u2019s not a game that appeals to Japanese players. Our suspicion was that Japanese gamers would prefer to cooperate and work together to defeat something more than to compete and fight against other players. That\u2019s why we created PSO to be a cooperative role-playing game. Diablo has cooperative elements but it also has PK and an element of killing other player characters. We eliminated those elements and focused on how we could make a fun, cooperative RPG experience.

Battling itself actually helps remove monsters stress. As you accumulate larger amounts of cash, it&#039;s definitely good to prioritize buying all the more expensive stress relieving, fatigue relieving, and sleep helping items you&#039;ll see in the shop like the cups and gems, as can afford them of course, don&#039;t skip out on them, they&#039;ll make it easier for new monsters.

The blackjack (note: there is no specific spot you have to hit guards with it, you can do it from any direction, even the front, provided they aren&#039;t in combat) works as a mechanic, because the choice to use it or not use it changes the way the game it played, if you knock guards out you get the burden of hiding their bodies, so other AI don&#039;t see them.

I generally call these types of games &#039;gun-formers&#039;. Gunformers, are the types of games that feature maze like level design with lots of platforming and your primary weapon being projectile. Turrican was kinda the type of game that spawned this genre. I would say Metroid, but Metroid has too much exploration to fall into this category. Robocop vs Terminator, Judge Dredd (SNES game), Cool Spot, because you shoot all the time, Earthworm Jim 1 at least, Alien 3 Mega Drive/ Genesis, Demolition Man. I&#039;m sure others can think of more. That&#039;s the genre I put Vectorman in, as most of the levels follow that formula. Vectorman tries to mix it up with different formulas, though. Game looks really nice, it has a generally good soundtrack (to me), the levels are good. Some bosses are cool looking. But some are way to gimicky. Like the train boss is not good. the disco stage boss where you spin around in circles is a bit lame. It&#039;s OK for one of these games. But Hard Corps is better overall. Contra III on the SNES is better. I remember playing Vectorman 2 all the way up to the half way point, but never fully completed it. Vectorman 2 is a spectacle for the hardware, with enhanced simulated lighting and bigger sprites, it is an impressive tech demo for the hardware in 1996. Anyway. Not too bad as a sequel. I feel like the levels were a little more streamlined, but the game made harder. It has the generic 3D tunnel effect stage, found in all of the Genesis/ Mega Drive games, like Garfield and batman and Robin. Also wasn&#039;t a fan of the over head stages with the rocket. I rank it as B tier series.

It&#039;s been known since forever ago that Woolsey didn&#039;t deliver the most faithful translation, not to mention all the censorship, which is why we got that old Sky Render fan translation over twenty years ago (that we now know to be amateurish as fuck). Then the GBA game came out, and its translation was recognized to be much more accurate, but it had two problems: first, by that point, Woolsey&#039;s script had obtained meme status, and while the GBA script kept some of his lines, it changed or tossed enough of them out to piss a vocal part of the fanbase off. Second, the GBA version had problems of its own, namely shit music, slowdown and lower resolution, among others. So now you have a bunch of Woolsey fanboys who like the idea of a more accurate script while still staying true to the Woolsey &quot;flavor&quot;, all on the mostly superior SNES version, and before long, we got the Ted Woolsey Uncensored hack. Problem is, its creator didn&#039;t know a lick of moon, so all he did was mix and match bits and pieces of the Woolsey, GBA and Sky Render scripts as he pleased, and to top it off, he decided to also make it an overarching &quot;game improvement&quot; hack that fixed a gorillion longstanding bugs and added QoL changes. This effectively set the mold for all like-minded hacks that followed, all of which were made by people with no nip-speaking credentials, and all of which were convinced they could do it better than the last, especially given they&#039;re not constrained to just script changes, but outright game changes as well, so every new release is just feature creep.

Even my friends that are my age don&#039;t seem to get this, and they only use Netflix and Spotify to access media. They don&#039;t seem to care that sometimes the best version of a film isn&#039;t the cut available on Netflix, they don&#039;t care that audio properties and subtitles can be adjusted when you have the file yourself, they don&#039;t care that audio clips can be tweaked or edited when you own the mp3, that LAN multiplayer or at least non-server based multiplayer means it&#039;s yours to play forever, etc. I admit that the trade-off is that it takes more time to set these things up than clicking Play/Download on a monthly web service, but to anyone with any serious interest in a medium the trade-offs are night and day.

The mugger in the street and the thug in the alley are possible soft-locks. If you&#039;ve already hit the mugger a few times, the next hit results in death. The only way past him after that, and the thug in the alley, is the $20 bill in your wallet(or one you steal from Sugar Shack after knocking her ass out). If you spend that $20 on a new gun to avoid another soft-lock, then you can wind up stuck with the mugger or thug with no way out.<br>Why buy a new gun? Because there is a random soft-lock in the sewers after you get rid of the murder weapon. I had it happen to me. After throwing away the gun, you can encounter the Alligator in the sewers. Only way to survive the gator is to shoot him. No new gun = stuck in the sewers with no way out other than death.<br>I actually recommend headed to the police station prior to going to the sewers just to encounter Sugar Shack, knock her out, and take her money to get yourself the new gun before going into the sewers, so you still have a $20 for the mugger, then staying out of the alley where the thug is. This way you avoid both potential soft-locks.<br>Another softlock happens if you enter a cab and travel but don&#039;t have the 3 coins to pay off, or leave Peoria St with less than 6 coins.
