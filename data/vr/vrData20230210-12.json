All on eBay. 2/3 were Japanese used: 1000 and 1100. Had to return the &quot;excellent condition FW 3.18&quot; for being the latest firmware and having severe burn-in from the hot charging port. The other JP one arrived perfectly, exactly as the seller and I personally discussed, and had the correct FW, no mura spots, no burn-in.<br>It does matter to get a 3.60 or lower firmware, people are lying when they say high FW can easily get CFW.<br>Ordered a US 1000 Vita to replace the returned 1100.<br>No interest in the 2000. The IPS is easier to take care of and internal memory card is convenient but offers no good sub pixel arrangement for crispness, no good blacks or contrasts, plus the 1000 OLED has good motion controls.<br>The OLED must be properly cared for though. You can&#039;t overcharge it or max the current to 2A over 5v constantly or you&#039;ll get burn-in. And you need a sleep timer or screensaver to prevent mura/splotches from developing, and set the brightness low most of the time for the same reason. It&#039;s actually worrying how bright it is at max. Halfway was still pretty bright in light and minimum is highly visible in the dark. So far this Vita looks pretty worth it. I love my PSP and it won&#039;t replace it for those games or the superior XMB clicky sounds but Vita is very good at its own thing.<br>If you&#039;re willing to message sellers directly and talk like a human being, you&#039;ll get a really sweet deal on an excellent condition Vita and then it&#039;s just a matter of taking care of it properly.<br>One more thing. The JP vitas have a different battery model in them than the US and EU versions. They&#039;re all the same true capacity BUT the JPN ones have the top &amp; bottom 20%-iles locked off. For most people, this will help them not wreck their batteries in 3 years. For power users, it could be a concern if you need the freedom.

The most Important things I can remember:<br><br>- Buttons and d-pad are on a whole new level compared to the RG351V I own,Provided that you like clicky tactile feedback.<br><br>- The short grips don&#039;t make it comfortable for twin stick gameplay. If you want to play FPS, get something bigger with grips that extend downwards, like the ones in the top corners. Or a smartphone clip for a ds4 or XB controller.<br><br>- It&#039;s not a great solution if you are going to use it on the go during short commutes, or if you have to change trains every 15-20 min. With no built-in battery and no off-button it keeps draining the phone&#039;s battery all the time, so you will want to disassemble it as soon as your train or bus gets to destination (and you need to be careful to not mess the usb port on the phone, that spring is extra strong).<br><br>Nothing of this is a problem if you will use it at home or get to sit on on public transport for 40 minutes without interruptions.<br><br>- Think carefully about which model you want, USB-C or Bluetooth. Many Android games don&#039;t support USB controllers (Apex Legends, but that one is dead now).

It generally just boils down to &quot;I don&#039;t want to have this happen to me so I will avoid it even if it is more work&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t want to have to play half the game again just for this one thing&quot;.<br><br>I&#039;ve also seen people get irritated that games stop them from doing 100% of possible tasks and situations in a single playthrough, which is ironic given those games are usually designed to let you do have a reason to replay the game. I think it&#039;s something for people who like the game enough to play it once but not enough to want to replay it. The prospect of not being able to see everything just drives them up a wall. That said, those people are likely also very self-deprecating completionistswho put way too much pressure on themselves to finish games and to act like beating a game is another checkbox on a grocery list.

A perfect way to do this is to have the start button pause the cutscene and then offer you an option to skip or resume it, like in MGS4 or the Yakuza series, for example.

Just comparing sequences in Trigger and Cross where you have to kill packs of enemies, the reptite tower is totally painless because it takes Crono half a second to draw his sword and transition into combat, and it takes two seconds to mash through text boxes at the end of combat, meaning that when you fight multiple packs of enemies it doesn&#039;t feel like your time is wasted and its all one big connected action sequence.

He definitely had a hand in Schala&#039;s story, but he can&#039;t have written everything about her either or he wouldn&#039;t have felt the need to retcon so much about her in Cross (even her hair is different!) and he definitely would not have written her brother out of the sequel when he was so central to her.<br><br>For other sections that you seem to have attributed to Kato, I&#039;m also confident in saying that he did NOT write Fiona&#039;s forest and the camp scene (goes against Cross&#039;s message of &quot;humans bad for environment&quot; and the campfire scene is contradicted in Cross), he did not write anything about prehistory (Cross even says that humans did not exist before Lavos arrived, retconning Ayla into a neanderthal), etc, he did not write any of the happy endings (he hated happy endings and retconned them into tragedies with his sequel) and he did not write any of the whimsical scenes of Trigger (too many to list).<br><br>Now, you may come and say that this means nothing, we can&#039;t actually compare the writing like that and he&#039;s responsible for more than I give him credit for, but then we need the answer to a simple question: If Kato wrote all that, why the hell did he feel the need to retcon, contradict or alter so much of it in the sequel?

You can explore towns, talk to people, shop, etc However the combat is tactical grid based. Unlike in FE or Famicom Wars, an attacked unit will not retaliate on the turn it is attacked. Gameplay is based around generals, the player has up to 4 teams each with 1 general and 5 units composed of fighters, archers, and mages (offensive or defensive). Units belonging to a general can not leave the current screen the general is on, so it is him that gives the overall movement of the team.<br>Nice graphics and musics. Difficulty a bit on the easy side.

And if that wasn&#039;t enough, most items from chests in dungeons respawn so it is easy to farm them (MP refills or sell for money etc) <br><br>Some interesting mechanics, the main one being that you can have up to 3 parties you can switch to in combat. The first party is your main characters, hero+warrior+mage. The second party is made of &quot;Idols&quot;, godly creatures that you find along the way and which mostly just use spells and are AI controlled. The third party consists of soldiers you can hire, you must pay for them and their gear so I never bothered with them. Only the party active at the end of a battle recieves exp. Idols may be fused together to create new idols, however they&#039;ll start over from lvl1, though usually know better spells so it is worth it.<br>Also you can pawn items instead of selling them.<br><br>The game is huge and there are a lot of dungeons, some of which can get a bit mazey, but the dungeons look great and most of them have dedicated art and palettes.<br>The overworld is huge also and once you get the boat, it&#039;s like looking for a needle in a haystack, again and again...

Everything is made to make you realize they were going through their own adventures of their own while you were. This gives them weight and personality and puts everyone on the same level. How many RPGs have each character put on the same level of importance like that? Certainly not DQ3.<br>- The way towns work like hubs. You usually use the same town in between several small quests; either that or there is a good reason to come back to the town later on. This makes the world feel organic, real; vs the tired routine &quot;each area is composed of one town, one dungeon, clear that, reach next area, repeat&quot; which DQ3 started.<br>- The adventure elements, namely the treasure hunting; DQ2 probably started the &quot;you must find X number of magical key items as a goal&quot; trope for jRPGs (unless you count Zelda as an RPG), but unlike later/other use of that trope in which the key item is merely a meaningless token for denoting that you beat a dungeon; here you must go through adventure game mechanics to acquire them, acquire clues, solve puzzle, beat dungeons too sure but not only, and almost each one is acquired differently.

Graphics are good enough but nothing extraordinary, some of the enemies don&#039;t look very good; but they are very varied with lot&#039;s of different locations.<br>Some interesting mechanics: there is a party chat you can use to remember what to do next and there is a seperate bag for inventory items (which can contain up to 100 items!), two things the DQ series would only introduce later on. Money is used to buy items (but not equipment, which is only found) but it is also used to cast spells and you only earn money from fights once you get back to a town.<br>Spells are treated like inventory items, so you can assign them to whomever, with the added downside of clogging the inventories quickly.

When a character dies, he&#039;s back to 1HP once the fight is over. If the entire party dies, you&#039;re back to the last save location (in a town) but you lose neither progress nor money. So the game is very lenient and just wants you to have a good time; but you still don&#039;t want to die in combat (no reviving) and enemies remain strong, so despite being a leniant game with no grinding, combat still manages to remain engaging.<br>On the downside, only a few defensive spells work at all during boss fights, few combat items did too; so it&#039;s all just the attack command against them. Also enemies in random encounters get quickly repetitive as you fight the same 3 enemies over and over in each area; although most areas are short enough it doesn&#039;t become too much a burden. You also get a Repel spell that actually works if you&#039;re tired of it.

I agree. I don&#039;t really like aiming anyway, give me an alternative. The best FPS games on consoles do this. Either fun weapons that behave in ways that bypass the need for aiming but tap into movement or spatial mechanics, lock on systems like in HL1 on the PS2 that still augment better movement and give opportunity for expressions of skill. Time Splitters 3&#039;s fun enemy engagements and variety of weapons, Power Slave&#039;s elaborate encounters and interesting choice of gear that swiftly veers from the stereotypical.<br><br>The focus on diverting gameplay from aiming brought some peoples favorites (like metroid prime, to me the game was too boring,) inspired devs to rethink melee, vehicles, health/armor in Halo, and shit, the proper way to play Doom on PC is to not aim vertically, making the player feel like a ball pinging around arenas schucking demons full of pellets.<br><br>I think that gets my point across, console FPS games are more fun.", "time": 1675952191, "resto": 9644484}, {"no": 9646494, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)10:06:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9644484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9644484</a><br>Black is a terrible terrible game.

Tekken 3 does a significantly better job of blending the 3D fighting area with the 2D background image though, I will admit that. Virtua Fighter stages have an elevated platform over a flat plane (to facilitate Ring Outs), whereas Tekken fighters stand directly on the flat plane, which scrolls infinitely. The elevated platform makes the transition looks weird in comparison. The character models and textures (as well as the resolution) are where VF2 really excels when comparing the two.<br><br>You are absolutely right on your next point though - 3D platformers were a genre that didn&#039;t see a lot of releases on the Saturn - and also what it did get was mostly ports (this is a consequence of launching in an era where arcade games were incredibly popular). Had it lasted a full generation I&#039;m sure we would have seen quite a few hitting the system once consumers stopped being satisfied with home console ports of quick playing arcade games. &quot;Bringing the arcade into the home&quot; was a big deal in the mid 90s (and we were finally starting to get to the point where home console ports could be near arcade perfect or even arcade perfect), but that interest changed as gamers started wanting more in-depth games (the kind of games that detractors would call &quot;cinematic&quot;).<br><br>The Saturn had a lot of really excellent games, but it cannot and will not ever be able to compete with the PS1 in terms of the sheer quantity of games and the variety of geners available.

Does it hold up today?</span><br>Well, I&#039;ve only completed 5 of all GB/GBC titles I&#039;ve played, and only for 2 franchises, Spider-Man and Yu-Gi-Oh! I know that&#039;s quite random, anyways those are the ones I can talk about:<br><br>1. Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters<br>One of the most archaic video games I&#039;ve ever played, the ammount of RNG involved, rules that are so basic it can feel downright shallow, and 100 wins requirements to get the cards everyone wants... still, I like it, the simplicity has some charm to it, the art is neat and it&#039;s the closest we&#039;ll get to a Duelist Kingdom RPG.<br><br>2. Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories<br>A lot better in both gameplay and artwork, with monsters having effects, though the rules differ from the OCG/TCG I still like them, and it&#039;s nice seeing some Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories characters, almost as if this is the portable port, it&#039;s nice, just wish the story was more concise, there&#039;s practically none here.<br><br>3. The Amazing Spider-Man<br>I don&#039;t think this gets enough credit, of course the control isn&#039;t perfect, but you get used to it very quickly and, once you do, you find something that, at the time it was released, did everything people wanted, a video game where you play as Spider-Man, beat up bad guys, do some platforming and use his web, it&#039;s fine.<br><br>4. Spider-Man<br>A lot of interesting ideas were attempted, RPG mechanics with a lite MetroidVania progression... anyways, the control is worse than the Game Boy one, which came out a decade earlier, and the flying enemies are annoying, especially in the sewers. Not bad, but I don&#039;t go back to it, even with its excellent atmosphere.<br><br>5. Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six<br>Everything a sequel should be, they took the original, polished it up, made everything better, especially the controls, which are quite satisfying here. We&#039;ve lost all RPG and MetroidVania elements, but that&#039;s fine, as long as the controls and level design are good, which they are here.", "filename": "1642900302707", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675995632799311, "time": 1675995632, "md5": "hiZfv54liPCfflDvUv3eCQ==", "fsize": 134211, "resto": 9647978}, {"no": 9648023, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9648005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9648005</a><br>P.S.

Only retarded sodabrained Gen X boomers hate it, because they think a child character is a personal attack on their masculinity. Pathetic. Imagine getting filtered by 1 character. This was a late &#039;96 release that was under the radar, plus making it be DK instead would cancel out the purpose of makong Dixie the star. I&#039;ve been hearing the same stupid shit since the 2000s on forums about how Kiddy alone ruins the game, without really delving into what they think about the gameplay proper. Yes it is more puzzle/gimmick centric than the first 2 games but that isn&#039;t inherently a bad thing. And if they did also have similar reservations that was all superceded by &quot;NOOOO KIDDY IS LAME FUCK KIDDY HE IS A DUMB BABY ABSOLUTELY RUINED IT&quot;. It is pure insecurity.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with Kiddy. I personally think he is a good character. The design being a retarded overgrown baby ape with retard strength is funny as hell and peak Rare humor, and he does show cheeky behavior in the game like raising his eyebrows at you or picking Dixie up like a ragdoll. He is also a return to the 1 heavy 1 agile partner dynamic of DKC1, except he is better than DK because he has a smaller frame, his jumps are more froglike and he can hold barrels in front of him.

I don&#039;t want dbps to stop, but at recent years when we are having more than 50 new wads a year that have at least same or higher quality than dbp usually, i wouldn&#039;t get angry about most of them not getting an award, while many other sets don&#039;t get award either.

Yeah, one could argue about how when the battery dies people would have to send the board to Capcom to get them to reload the key, but considering the battery lasts some 20 or so years that&#039;s hardly intentional planned obsolesce as the arcade cabinet itself is likely to be retired before that Nobody was expecting people to care about old games or that retro gaming would boom like it did.<br><br>And no in that the reason CPS2SHOCK was able to crack it in the early 00s was due to (if I remember correctly) an oversight Capcom left in from a CPS2 game they had converted to CPS1 hardware. I recall it was some older Street Fighter game, I guess they figured the revenue from arcades that could install the game in an old CPS1 cabinet was more profitable than keeping that old game out of bootlegger&#039;s hands. From what I remember they accidently left in an occasional call the game makes to the decryption hardware, which clued the team in that the CPS2 games didn&#039;t just decrypt the game once on boot but had to repeatedly confirm it for the board to keep decrypting the game or the system would stop decrypting. I am sure this would have eventually been figured out anyway (Especially since CPS3 was decrypted about 16 years ago) if they got the initial decryption done and then saw the game only works for a while, but it apparently gave them a target to know where to look and sped up the project. I remember when the site joked about renaming themselves to CPS3Shock right after they finally broke CPS2 wide open, since CPS2 took many years and people would have expected CPS3 if it ever happens to take an eternity...", "time": 1675848790, "resto": 9641807}, {"no": 9642917, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:36:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9642914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9642914</a><br>The timing of all that was pretty funny too.
