If you can&#039;t replace the tip, the iron is trash the moment the current tip gets damaged. You will also be stuck with whatever size tip it comes with. You don&#039;t want that. Look for replacement tips for the iron BEFORE you buy. If there&#039;s a wide selection, carry on. If they are rare or unobtainium, avoid that iron. As for having a temp readout VS just an adjustment dial, it&#039;s up to you. I started and do my current solder work on an iron with just an adjustment knob and no temp reading, but you do you.<br>Buy a few different types of solder, not just one. There are people who hate lead-free solder, I&#039;ve never had any issue with it. Some swear by solid core, some won&#039;t touch an iron without rosin-core. Try a few, see what works best for you and not some faggot on the internet. They are $2-3 per small coil, so it&#039;s not like you&#039;re going to be out a ton of money on solder. There is no &quot;right&quot; acid-free solder, only the right one for you. No matter which one you use, you&#039;ll want to use flux, so buy a big jar of that. Flux is flux, use whatever flux looks good to you.<br>Get a desoldering bulb. Desoldering guns are fancy, but have filters that require constant replacement in order to keep operational. The bulb is $10ish and just werks, at worst you might need to clean the tip with a paper-clip. Also get a desoldering braid for when you&#039;re ready to attempt SMD components. A few cans of Electrical Contact Cleaner and a soft-bristled tooth brush are also good to have for cleaning boards and removing leftover flux.", "time": 1669560548, "resto": 9447404}, {"no": 9447473, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)09:52:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9447463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9447463</a><br>Hey that\u2019s great information!

For me the real reason to step away from the OEM controller is to go modern. The overall build quality doesn\u2019t feel as cheap as the Tribute 64. It still feels like a third party controller. A lot of people complain about the stick but I never felt anything was hard on games that require precision. It feels very good actually.

Build quality feels cheap, but I like the A B C buttons more on this than the Brawler. It has rumble but you can\u2019t freely swap between memory and rumble, you need to unplug it or reset the console. The dongle is a very tight fit so it will probably wear the port out if you plug/unplug too much.

Most of my school buddies were poor too, but they could spend their money paying less than 1$ per hour to play PS1 games in a local rental store after school. I was one of the first lucky ones to afford N64 here. The console cost me as much as a half monthly average wage where I live. And that heavy price was while ditching the expensive taxes after looking for a small store to pay cheap. And they even accepted my old SNES with games as trade for a discount.<br><br>I never afforded buying games so I only rented. But even when renting every weekend from 2 different stores and being the first one to play (because nearly nobody afforded the console), there were still not enough new N64 game releases to play. Then I saw that my school buddy who had an old PS1 was getting much more new games on cheap pirated disks. <br><br>By reading gaming magazines I was aware that I wasn&#039;t getting many N64 games because they were not releasing enough while PS1 was getting much more new games with no port to N64. The same magazine had been shilling to N64 over a year prior to the console release as &quot;Ultra 64&quot; in Japan. By that time they were told that the thumb stick was a &quot;mystery button&quot; and that the company wouldn&#039;t tell anyone what that &quot;button&quot; was for. They also said that the company was even planning a project to add online connection to N64. The console was going to be released in February in Japan on that same year but they changed the date later. <br><br>One year after getting my N64 and still not having enough games being released and ports being delayed. I got my PS1 with 2 dual shocks for one third of N64 heavy price through smuggling to avoid taxation and also bought a huge amount of pirated PS1 game disks for much cheaper than renting from N64 small library. While owning both consoles N64 would only be good to play the Rareware and Nintendo titles. If it wasn&#039;t for those titles N64 would be useless to me.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f1<wbr>8S47UOlg", "filename": "Ultra64CaraFera", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 540, "h": 720, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669488150797734, "time": 1669488150, "md5": "puJ45CjwFHHc5kTPYBwI2g==", "fsize": 208672, "resto": 9441276}, {"no": 9445742, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)14:33:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9445272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9445272</a><br>Based", "time": 1669491239, "resto": 9441276}, {"no": 9445871, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)15:47:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9444543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9444543</a><br>What is this &quot;games&quot; you speak of?", "time": 1669495646, "resto": 9441276}, {"no": 9446803, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)00:51:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9443515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9443515</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That was the only time I have ever purchased a console on launch day.</span><br>Because you regretted as I did", "time": 1669528284, "resto": 9441276}, {"no": 9447334, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)08:02:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9445654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9445654</a><br>dogshit taste + third world release schedule + limited rental availability (b-but it had ALL the games i swear)", "time": 1669554130, "resto": 9441276}], "last_modified": 1669554130}, {"no": 9439425, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)23:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;just found out Mega Man has a racing game</span><br>How bad is it?", "filename": "3783", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669262634835561, "time": 1669262634, "md5": "6XjXuOxZTr/B+6zXrikAig==", "fsize": 102831, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "just-found-out-mega-man-has-a-racing-game", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 39, "images": 8, "omitted_posts": 34, "omitted_images": 7, "last_replies": [{"no": 9446229, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)18:57:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9446213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9446213</a><br>Fair enough, I suppose.", "time": 1669507052, "resto": 9439425}, {"no": 9446329, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)19:40:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;ll never get experimental racing games like this ever again since the market is monopolized by Mario Kart and realistic simulators.</span>", "filename": "IMG_20190313_162546_249", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 265, "h": 270, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669509632377285, "time": 1669509632, "md5": "FMaXbezVgGjpERnaCH15uw==", "fsize": 24758, "resto": 9439425}, {"no": 9447272, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)07:01:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9442713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9442713</a><br>I loved it.
