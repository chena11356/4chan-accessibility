There&#039;s a boss in Mega Man 6 where you&#039;ll likely never do him without taking damage without knowing that there&#039;s a safespot you can just stand on, and Mega Man is also aimed at kids and is usually really easy. Sonic Advance already has Special Stages hidden only for the players that go out of their way to find them and just like almost any Sonic game before, Special Stages rely on you memorizing the layout and understanding how they work to beat them, as otherwise you will be just slamming your head at them and lose. That&#039;s not to mention that things like halfpipes have problems like them being designed for two players (the ring lines are doubled but you can only get one of them if you&#039;re playing alone) and yet the Tails&#039; AI doesn&#039;t just fail to help with that, he can get in front of you and crash into bombs, and as far as I know, there is no consistent way to avoid this without disabling Tails entirely as I ran into this problem many times. This is what I mean by inconsistent: you know what to do in those halfpipes, but Tails can just get in front of you anyway and you just have to deal with it. In Advance 1, you go out of your way to get to the special springs, which are always located in the same location, and if you play those special stages the exact same way each time, you will always succeed. To me, that is enough for good design. I don&#039;t care about debating whether this is autism or not, it works, has always worked and will continue to work and that&#039;s all.

They have to be used intelligently for healing/fighting/tanking and it&#039;s an essential mechanic in some parts of the game. Also, blocking actually matters a lot, and when you are low on health, enemies deal less damage and you are more likely to dodge attacks.

Depending on the game it could save to the cart, but also could save to a memory card... you would think then that the memorycard was nonvolatile memory like the PS1... or even to BOTH. Only some of the earliest N64 games that saved to the cart used battery-backed SRAM while just about all later games used one of multiple implementations of different kinds of nonvolatile memory.... while the memorycards were battery-backed. What an idiotic mess. On top of that there was no built-in memory card management application like the PS1 and Saturn had, you had to hold Start while booting up a game that supported memory cards... and there was no standard or guidelines on how to design said manager so they varied wildly in features and what they could or could not do.

You couldn&#039;t even get cards as small as 1GB anymore in 2015 easily and the printer was hundreds of dollars yet they still cheaped out on the included card and reflashed a 128MB card to show up as 1GB and corrupt anything past the 128MB mark, as if anybody would refuse to buy the printer because it didn&#039;t include a MicroSD card or the card was only 128MB, which would still be enough to store the data for dozens of prints.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s wrong or even unusual to charge for shipping, I&#039;m saying it&#039;s wrong to pretend that shipping is not part of the total cost of the product.</span><br><br>It is when the only time it comes up is a grasping at straws attempt to try to artificially inflate the price of the device in order to bitch about it.

Enemies reacted to what part of their body you shot them, even leading a splat of blood, if you snuck up on a guard and shot him in the asscheek, he&#039;d jump in terror and grab is ass lmao. Some of the death animations were really drawn out and dramatic, as well, and it made the shootouts much more intense, and it was fun miming them at school recess when playing with other kids, sometimes we&#039;d build guns out of Lego, but most of the time just imagining the pistols and machineguns in our hands.<br><br>Seeing Quake 2 on PC not long after, that&#039;s another which made a huge impression on me.

Between Quake 2 featuring special textures for enemies as they got injured, even squeezing off some last shots in their dying throes, or outright getting shot into pieces, and GE64s hit location functionality and elaborate animations, it would actually take quite some time until I was actually impressed by videogame violence again.

The levels were incredibly elaborate, beyond what I had seen in many other games.<br>Sure, Terminator had the realistic city ruins, Goldeneye had the lifelike military installations and hydroelectric dams, but Super Mario 64 had these places where you looked around at everything and looked to climb it to see where it took you, these places were all about the platforming, the acrobatics, the parkour, the veritable and sometimes literal mountain climbing. The first person shooters had a bit of that, sort of, but they were mainly about gunfighting, so the environments were designed with that in mind, even Quake 2, which offered some mobility options, didn&#039;t have the same open locations, and certainly not the same range of mobility (barring rocketjumping, but I didn&#039;t know that yet). Goldeneye had very little for movement options, you couldn&#039;t even jump like in Quake 2 or Terminator, and I was actually very disappointed upon learning that, but it didn&#039;t preclude me from enjoying that game, and Super Mario 64&#039;s extremely versatile and flexible jumping more than made up for that.<br><br>The first Bowser stage was real impressive to me, for the more demanding terrain, featuring moving platforms and teeters suspended over the deadly void, all set to an imposing music track. The fight with Bowser had an aggressive guitar theme, and you couldn&#039;t punch or jump on him, there was no axe to drop a bridge underneath him, no, you had to circle around him, grab his tail, and then swing that big fucker around, trying to send him into one of those big naval mines.

RE4 is supposed to be best-looking on GC. Pokemon Colosseum is somewhat mediocre (cool story, though). Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness is much better. SSX series is supposed to be pretty good.

It&#039;s more chaotic and requires you to have better judgement on how to spend the missile bombing. Also, collecting fruit is pretty seamless and fast, as enemies leave fruit trails behind them, all you have to do is move acordingly and don&#039;t do any mistake while moving, and you can get the fruit on your way without any need for a detour. <br>The shop can be navigated within seconds, even split seconds. Or you can choose to not use the shop at all, if you don&#039;t want to.<br>Even if you want to argue that shooting with the face buttons is ideal (it&#039;s not IMO, and the devs agree), the C-buttons are more compact and act much better as a secondary d-pad than the DC&#039;s face buttons. However, the intended way to play Bangai O on the N64 is by using the d-pad to move and the stick to shoot. Might take some time to get used to it but once it clicked I could never go back to the face buttons.<br>Both versions are worth it, I think DC is better for beginners and N64 better for people who want more challenge. And thankfully both games offer enough changes, both gameplay wise and in presentaci\u00f3n, that both are worth it and neither discarded.<br>By the way the music is different in both games, totally different conpositions. <br>I still don&#039;t know why are we discussing Bangai O on a co-op thread but hey, I love this game, wish it had a co-op mode.", "time": 1675299405, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9624047, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)01:57:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Check out Toejam &amp; Earl on Genesis, def a weird ass 2 player game.", "time": 1675321053, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9624416, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)06:54:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9620510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620510</a><br>Is there any easy way to play this online with a frend", "time": 1675338850, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9624451, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:13:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9624416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9624416</a><br>Simple 64 as long as you both have PCs made in the last century", "time": 1675339999, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9624503, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:43:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If Treasure were smart they would have ported Dreamcast Bangai-O to modern systems and give it dual analog support for true twin-stick gameplay and the N64&#039;s scoring system to make it the definitive version, but alas...", "filename": "bangai_kino", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 420, "h": 324, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1675341802903864, "time": 1675341802, "md5": "8YT66hiW1LWN+mHBc4chUw==", "fsize": 146831, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9624996, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)11:36:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9624503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9624503</a><br>That doesn&#039;t sound too exciting, also I think visually some backgrounds are better on N64, as well as Bangai O itself&#039;s sprite.<br>What Treasure needs to do is release a Bangai O collection with the original, DC, DS and 360 games, all with level editors and online leaderboards.", "time": 1675355808, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9625017, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)11:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9624996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9624996</a><br>That sounds like a lot of work, also how would DS Bangai-O work on anything but a DS?<br>I would like to be able to play Missile Fury without a Red Ring of Death box though.", "time": 1675356392, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9626408, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)20:15:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No recs at all for Playstation?", "time": 1675386921, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9628315, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)12:32:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9626408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9626408</a><br>Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream is probably the most fun co-op game of the sixth generation.", "time": 1675445569, "resto": 9620510}, {"no": 9629183, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)18:47:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9628315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9628315</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream</span><br>Nice, I&#039;ll add it to the list.

Otherwise you can just cheese things and tank your way through any parts that would give you trouble, I beat the final boss in SH1 by just immediately going into the menu whenever they hit me and spamming heals, then getting back to spamming the shoot button and repeating that over and over, which really wasn&#039;t any fun at all.", "time": 1675446312, "resto": 9623389}, {"no": 9628845, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:05:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I recall reading that Nightdive said they\u2019d be interested in porting the first game to modern consoles.", "time": 1675458359, "resto": 9623389}, {"no": 9628868, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:18:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;want to replay sh1</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;remember the sewers and nowhere</span>", "time": 1675459113, "resto": 9623389}, {"no": 9628887, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:28:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "1 was cool, 2 was too Disneyfied, kinda like Terminator 2.", "filename": "1667938360850178", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 706, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675459714172816, "time": 1675459714, "md5": "sLN3vSForSLZRQksncdVZQ==", "fsize": 368534, "resto": 9623389}, {"no": 9628895, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:32:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9628281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9628281</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;turn auto aim on</span><br>Might as well go full faggot and watch a longplay, then.", "time": 1675459942, "resto": 9623389}, {"no": 9628963, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:05:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "2&gt;1&gt;4&gt;3<br><br>this is not up for discussion. dont @ me", "filename": "knowyourmemepepenumber245", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 599, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675461910900073, "time": 1675461910, "md5": "rnH8jZLYa6gMIAcpFAcfsQ==", "fsize": 42548, "resto": 9623389}, {"no": 9628967, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:06:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9627528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9627528</a><br>No foreskin drama?
