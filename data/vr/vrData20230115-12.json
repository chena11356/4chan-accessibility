MK Trilogy sprites are very thin and don&#039;t have much unique animations. SF Alpha games are kind of simple too but Darkstalkers and Marvel vs games have more elaborate attack animations that take a large chunk of screen (and VRAM). MK Trilogy being this lightweight on animations is pretty much confirmed by the PS1 version: it easily holds 4 unique characters for 2 on 2 combat in PS1 RAM - when one character is defeated the game doesn&#039;t stop to load the second one from the disc. No Capcom game manages to have four complete and unique characters in a single fight on PS1 because they take much more memory than Mortal Kombat ones.<br>N64 has more RAM and doesn&#039;t have to deal with loading from the disk at all, so it allows SIX unique characters in 3 on 3 combat. Great, right? But here&#039;s the deal: the animation quality is worse than in PS1 version. So while there are six characters in N64 RAM, even having only two of them on screen, N64 can&#039;t animate them as fast as PS1 version. This is barely a cart size issue - adding a couple of frames to each character standing idle animation would make them look a whole lot smoother and this takes a very little space of ROM. MKT ROM has a enough of padding (aka unused space) for this. Even without using the unused space they could just remove that fancy MK logo in flames title screen and shitty looking MK1 stages and add better animation instead. But they didn&#039;t because N64 can&#039;t run it as smooth anyway.", "time": 1673501177, "resto": 9561618}, {"no": 9563216, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:33:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9562805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9562805</a><br>There are certainly no 1800 sprites in Mario Kart.

A lot of the time there aren&#039;t really many obstacles to overcome, you just need to figure out where to go which is incredibly obvious, and Zelda and 3D Metroid are the same way.<br><br>But strangely I think any RPGs they have a hand in tend to turn out great, perhaps because they&#039;re usually at least a little unconventional. Granted these aren&#039;t usually first-party, but still, the first two Paper Mario games I remember having a cooler combat system than most other JRPGs, I really like how the stats work in Fire Emblem (speed is maybe too important, but then I like how they&#039;re not all equally important but even some of the less powerful ones it&#039;s still important to have a bit of), and even though you obviously CAN play single-player Pok\u00e9mon in a very braindead way and win, in my experience it&#039;s easier to find a way to play it that does produce tense and challenging situations than it is in most JRPGs, which I wouldn&#039;t really know how to make challenging without resorting to romhacks.<br><br>The single-combat format is unique as well, and a lot of the moves are also pretty creative in their functionality and I like that it actually tells you each move&#039;s accuracy and doesn&#039;t pull that BS where major enemies are immune to status moves.

Again, just as an example, a parody of famous places like Hollywood, Las Vegas, and so on. Tie old characters into it, like Blues Bros landing a movie deal, then blowing all their cash in casinos.

Dario and Milo had constant communication by comparison.<br><br>Long story short, TeamTNT made extra sure that TNT would be safe and inclusive, and in my theory, perhaps to differentiate itself from Plutonia&#039;s unrelenting difficulty which may have been frowned upon.

Cable, as we know it today, didn&#039;t really exist until the 80s. So suddenly there were LOADS of new channels that all needed content. The majority got a foothold by mostly using whatever old shows they could get access to. <br><br>The second was something called syndication. The short version of that is that local affiliates have some degree of control over what they air. That&#039;s why your local CBS channel is a bit different than CBS when you go out of state. Syndicated TV shows were shows that any local channel who felt like paying a small license fee could air. Older shows were cheaper, so they&#039;d often be used to fill in dead air time.<br><br>The reason that both have become far less common really just boils down to the pool of available media being MUCH larger. For example, Cartoon Network was almost entirely old Hanna-Barbara cartoons when it first launched.

Basically, the joke of the day back in 1989 was that the Leisure Suit Larry series was finished. At the end of LSL3, he gets a job literally working for Sierra and lives in a log cabin with his wife. The end. Then there were some firings at Sierra that year of a couple notable individuals (who will not be mentioned, for fear of internet-sleuths finding me out), who were caught having a seance in the backrooms of the offices at 3:33 AM. Al Lowe, who was a practicing Methodist at the time, demanded they be fired. Shortly after, Sierra wanted a sequel to Leisure Suit Larry 3, which Al Lowe refused to do. Until a series of unfortunate misshaps occurred. According to sources, Al Low slept in one day an hour later than usual. When he tried to get ready to go to work and hurried out the door, he saw a piano had fallen on his car. The next week, on a busride back from the office, a man held the driver of the bus at knife point and almost stabbed Lowe, until a plain-clothes policeman arrested the would-be attacker. Bad shit continued to happen, and eventually Al Lowe decided he was getting someone upstairs angry for not using his talents, so began work on LSL4.<br><br>That&#039;s where the fun stuff begins. Almost immediately following the development of the coding for the game, it repeatedly had to be redone, as the code constantly got corrupted over and over again. Art assets would unknowingly disappear. Apparently late one night, Al Lowe stated he heard faint whisperings in the office and was so skeeved out he refused to work late nights anymore. He also heard tell of a man in black who would arrive in the office lobby, before anyone was at the office, when the doors were locked, at 5 AM on the dot for 2 weeks straight.

A good player could beat all of DOOM on ultra violence if they were good enough because the game never throws an unfair or unexpected challenge at you unlike Blood.<br>Blood has a weak selection on weapons, ultimately this is due to the weak enemy roster and level design. DOOM&#039;s chaingun is a good sniper and a decent area clearer, best for big waves or far enemies. The Shotgun is your main gun for normal scenarios. The rocket launcher is great for bulky enemies and the best for huge waves. The Plasma gun is your strongest weapon and is a good all arounder but also scarce. The BFG is your reward for a secret or hard challenge and is the defacto trump gun. Each enemy and level is designed around these inherent weakness and strengths, its why pistol starting is fun. Blood doesn&#039;t have this design and most weapons are decent all arounders, the enemies and levels aren&#039;t designed around this either. There are few enemies that require you to utilize specific quirks of weapons like the afterburn and most will go down to anything. The levels give you every type of weapon without much thought, like a playground of stuff to mess around with which maybe is fun for a bit but is a weaker experience to DOOM&#039;s and Quake&#039;s design where the player is not given all the tools at once and needs to be crafty.", "time": 1673714668, "resto": 9570521}, {"no": 9570595, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)11:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570521</a><br>blood is cringe lord bullshit.

This set comes with Tetris, and I already have Jack Bros, Panic Bomber, and Wario Land. I&#039;m looking forward to getting a headache.

You start off with the dart gun that has both tranq and dart ammo, pistols, the flechette with fucking hornet and splinter ammo which is cool, the magnum with hollow point and teflon rounds which is awesome, and at the end you get rail guns and rocket launchers, skorpion machine guns and whatnot. <br><br>The plot in SS1 is Hal9000. AI goes insane and tries to kill humanity. It&#039;s well written, all bourgeoning empire of steel careening into the sky and all that, but it&#039;s pretty simple all through the game.

The CPC was, I think, the only 8 bit computer with no colour attribute limitations, and it was pretty fast too considering what it was. The PC-88 had a really high screen resolution.<br>But yes, for gaming purposes, nothing beat the Atari 8-bit and C64. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you mean atari st&#039;s processing speed then yes, it is far powerful than amiga</span><br>Of course, blast processing beats the &#039;migger.", "time": 1673606614, "resto": 9561262}, {"no": 9566954, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:46:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9566905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9566905</a><br>The apple ii was ass.

Like it sounds like the devs wanted more characters a hardcore gamer would have recognized associated with playstation systems, but most people buying those consoles, were never doing so for Sony ips. So them you are trying to sell this crossover celebration to a audience who only buys your systems for call of duty or madden, then getting upset you aren&#039;t reaching those sales, while at the same time not giving the money or support to the devs to make something that will atleast please hardcore gamer nerd/Sony heads.
