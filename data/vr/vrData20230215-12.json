First thing first, I am not into multiplayer because I am very bad when under pressure. I only played some Red Alert 2 on LAN with my friends 20 years ago. I don&#039;t care about esports and SC2. I am Westwood C&amp;C fanboy and I have been hesitating to try Blizzard games for a long time. Tiberian Sun is my favorite and it is usually seen as thematically and visually close to Starcraft but now I see how different they are.<br>Campaign wise I still think that TS has better missions and maps. Neutral buildings, scripting, secrets etc. Starcraft missions are more like skirmish maps with minimum scripts. TS also has cooler technical stuff like deformable ground, debris doing damage, destructable bridges, working gates, flying units actually taking off and landing instead of always floating in the air. And tech tree looks more logical and less convoulted.<br>But the core gameplay of Starcraft is something else. Actually good hotkeys. So many rock-paper-scissor matchups, possibilities and little quirks. Marines on health-damaging drugs. Protoss units with rechargable shields and a building for fast charging. Zerg making suicide bombers out of humans. The joy of a Reaver drop and the chaos it causes. Manually building nukes and sending cloaked ghosts to guide them is actually fun unlike Tiberian Sun one click on cooldown superweapons. And the aforementiomed tech tree, while makes less sense in logical way, is less linear and greatly affects your gameplay choices.<br>Also I have noticed that Starcraft has some Dune 2 DNA in it that is not present in later Westwood games - upgrades, unit production facilities working in parallel, reliance on hotkeys (or visible command menu if you forget a key).<br>So, what&#039;s your opinion on Starcraft gameplay in comparison with C&amp;C?", "filename": "348028-starcraft-macintosh-advertisement", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1256, "tn_w": 159, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676452644997075, "time": 1676452644, "md5": "j8gWrlyPfvT5nGm3wROalA==", "fsize": 124437, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "starcraft-singleplayer", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 9663286, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)04:51:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9663254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9663254</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;opinion on Starcraft</span><br>Starcraft is the only good game the usa has ever produced.

My experience with Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and Switch is that with Wii they had the most support ever, with Sega, Hudson/Konami, SNK-Playmore pitching in games for huge line up of retro consoles. Maybe licensing is too much these days or they&#039;d rather just release their own overpriced compilations.<br><br>Wii U and 3DS support was kind bad, and I think PC Engine was Japan only.

Tons of arcade games exists through Hamster and their arcade releases on the eShop. They have a huge range of stuff that has never been released in a long time but they&#039;re like $8 per ROM with online leaderboards a few standard options. Oddly Sega has a Genesis/MD collection AND a few of the same titles on the Switch Online Expansion.

One of the games in there he has already sold on Ebay, so I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s still in there. I thought the reason certain games were in the folder is because if they weren&#039;t they would spread and the value would deflate.</span><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMC<wbr>oNXlWRks&amp;t=3308s<br><br>Searching &quot;BakuDD&quot; turns up a few accounts.<br><br>Reddit profile where he mostly talks about gambling games.<br><br>https://old.reddit.com/user/bakuDD/<wbr><br><br>Redump account with only one post that has been deleted.<br><br>http://forum.redump.org/profile.php<wbr>?id=62466<br><br>A pintrest full of homosexual anime art.<br><br>https://www.pinterest.com.au/fghjjj<wbr>jjjj/<br><br>A github account where he develops crypto scam software<br><br>https://github.com/bakudd<br><br>He might be one of the faggots in this video.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_d<wbr>Ftq2ZZTY&amp;t=2444s", "time": 1675447094, "resto": 9627750}, {"no": 9628892, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:30:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9628229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9628229</a><br>Keep at it anon, don&#039;t let the truth die to these furry crazies.<br>Because /v/cord motherfuckers are just looking for more schizo coomer threads to generate.

Shinra&#039;s end goal was to create Neo Midgar by finding The Promised Land, a place with allegedly infinite Mako, and putting a reactor on top of it. And their goal with Jenova&#039;s corpse was to take cells from it and artificially create a human with the abilities of the Cetra. So the hybrid could speak to the Planet, point the way to The Promised Land, and Shinra could print infinite money. Which is just deranged. Imagine reading the Bible and getting to the scripture that speaks of Heaven having streets of gold. And rather than seeing that as God&#039;s promises to encourage you to get closer to God and reach a spiritual enlightenment, instead you decide to take the information you can find and make a lab baby that can possibly infiltrate heaven. So you can send your armies there to harvest the gold.<br><br>Either way it wasn&#039;t until Dr Gast found Ifalna who clarified that Jenova was not a Cetra but rather a shape shifting alien who destroyed the Cetra. And that Jenova was the enemy of the Planet. Hojo didn&#039;t give a fuck though. Even after finding Hojo and Ifalna he forged ahead with his experiments out of curiosity of what Jenova would do. And since no one updated Gast&#039;s notes from when they were still working in the Mansion, Sephiroth got the wrong idea after reading them. Believing that Jenova was a Cetra that was done dirty by humans and the world belonged to her. Just like his father though, Sephiroth didn&#039;t care and forged ahead after finding out the truth and went with his own insane Meteor plan.

Good. Great point. So then don&#039;t remake it. If you are going to remake it then do it right since you obviously don&#039;t care about the idea of there being too many remakes. If you don&#039;t want to redo Final Fantasy 7 but you do want to revisit the world then make an actual sequel with new characters and new themes involving a different point in that world&#039;s history. We still don&#039;t know how Shinra took over the world. It&#039;s still not clear why black materia was used in the first place or if Jenova rode in on the meteor it summoned. What exactly was Genesis going to do at the end of Dirge of Cerberus. Still nothing on the other side of that equal sign Square. If you want to make an entirely new story then make a new game. The Final Fantasy 16 team looks like they can use some help. Final Fantasy 17 is still an open slot.<br><br>That&#039;s one of several problems that I have with remake. Square wanted to have their cake and fuck it too. They wanted to introduce this new story with this new theme but they don&#039;t want to do it with characters that aren&#039;t already time tested. Clive, for better or worse, cannot hinge on the reputation of previous characters to succeed. He has to tell his own story in his own setting. Everyone already fucking likes Cloud. Just putting his ass on the box is enough to make it sell. So now Square gets to parade around this new idea they have using a setting that&#039;s already established knowing full well what fans wanted. Everybody saying that fans just wanted a 1:1 remake is bullshiting. No one complained about Tifa breaking down at the loss of her second home even though that was not present in the first game. No one complained about Barrett telling Tifa to hold on to her rage even though he never said that in the OG. Nobody bitched about Cloud getting a handjob even though that never happened in the original game.

Even before you get to the Northern Crater there are parts of Cloud&#039;s character that makes no sense. Like how he claimed to be a 1st class SOLDIER yet he&#039;s at lv1 in the flashback. Weaker than the lv4 he starts the game with and only slightly stronger than the lv3 you meet Barrett at. Or how he starts finding plotholes in his own story when you first reach Junon. On the 2nd playthrough FF7 gets better because you start to realize how it all falls into place. Like with the level thing. Despite everything Cloud said, he didn&#039;t know what it actually felt like to be as strong as a SOLDIER 1st class. So he couldn&#039;t replicate the feeling of that strength in his memory.

Very atmospheric, kino soundtrack, some of the best weapon sounds in gaming in general and enemies have very satisfying animations for getting hit</span><br><br>Soul Reaver<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Slow paced gothic Zelda with slow but objectively monotonous combat that was anfterthought but it still feels satisfying to impale those undead niggas. Pure adventure game of an era long gone.</span><br><br>Assault Retribution<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3d contra clone, has coop, has ridiculous boss fights every few minutes, constantly shooting lasers at aliens and destroying everything. Not too long but with just the right amount of difficulty. Aesthetically pleasing cyberpunk vibe and nice electronic soundtrack</span><br><br>CT Forces<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;imagine Metal Slug except slow, methodical and not over the top. Has coop. Gorgeous colourful visuals. Also has a sequel</span><br><br>NFS Porsche Unleashed<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PC port is a different (and better) game but this is a very unique PS1 experience. Very comfy, with amazing soundtrack for different eras. Has a full damage model that impacts performance. You earn money, buy new cars, move through the eras starting with 60s americana music and vintage cars. </span><br><br>Sheep Dog n Wolf (aka Sheep Raider)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cell shaded stealth game with adventure game elements and puzzle solving</span><br><br>Off you go", "time": 1676458434, "resto": 9661997}, {"no": 9663469, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)07:22:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9662456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9662456</a><br>Kino ost too", "time": 1676463765, "resto": 9661997}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9662860, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)23:41:14", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Castlevania series", "com": "What is your favorite Castlevania game and why?", "filename": "Castlevania", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1207, "h": 1167, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 241, "tim": 1676436074572918, "time": 1676436074, "md5": "OFLRlXdH/ISTiw9PNVZ8ig==", "fsize": 308254, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "castlevania-series", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 24, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 9662863, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)23:43:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the original because its the only one ive played", "time": 1676436190, "resto": 9662860}, {"no": 9662878, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)23:48:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9662860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9662860</a><br>IV, because it&#039;s the best.", "time": 1676436500, "resto": 9662860}, {"no": 9662910, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9662860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9662860</a><br>Chronicles", "time": 1676437323, "resto": 9662860}, {"no": 9662950, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:20:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9662860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9662860</a><br>Super Castlevania IV is my favorite game, but I return to the original much more often.

Of course Disney isn&#039;t an entity focused on bringing joy or anything like that, though many people there had that intention back then, and maybe even today, but still, a company has a single true goal, making money and staying on top, and a way to do that is expand into different markets to make more money somewhere else. In the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s Disney truly caught on to video games and their growth, and we got many gems thanks to that.<br><br>I&#039;m mostly familiar with SEGA&#039;s Illusion series, which is what I grew up with, on my good old Mega Drive, though that series also had plenty of releases on both Game Gear and Master System, which I&#039;ve played now that I&#039;m all grown up and thoroughly enjoyed for what they were. I didn&#039;t grow up with just Mickey and Donald though, there were also tons of video games based on Disney films, like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King, which are the ones I remember most fondly, though there were many others like Aladdin. Disney&#039;s video games kept being made when the jump to 3D happened, on PS1 and N64, and quality was still good.<br><br>Nowadays though... we&#039;ve got Kingdom Hearts and not much else, so if you&#039;re not into that series then there&#039;s not much to see, back then when Disney would put out a new film it was a matter of time before we got a video game adaptation, regardless of how good or bad they were, we had them at least. Of course, this could all change with the new Disney Illusion Island, for Nintendo Switch, it looks like a modern World of Illusion and I&#039;m really into that, hopefully it lives up to the name.

The very few visuals that have true power are all inanimate objects/ background elements that unnerve you (mostly elements of the otherworld like seemingly endless pits that the metal grating walkways are pinned upon) but they arent some pants shitting terror inducing spooks and just some uncomfortable art that makes you uneasy. RE3 is a far scarier game from the same generation simply because of nemesis. Better jumpscares by far and more oppressive/ tense. SH1 might be a more interesting art piece but its not fucking scary unless youre 8 years old (or otherwise stupid/ inexperienced enough to not pick up on just how predictable the game is and how it establishes way too much clear rules to properly scare the player afterwards). Its literally a prime game mechanic to hear the presence of enemies through the radio before they show up so by extension you should never ever let the game scare you whenever it tries to (falsely) pull the mat from under your feet with some new scary audio that you dont recognize.

I think the FCC cracked down on Nintendo by 1991 and Nintendo had to change their contracts and remove the exclusivity deal. EA was never a Nintendo publisher and worked with Konami/ Ultra on the NES. They jumped over to the Genesis/ MD in 1990. LJN created a separate company called Arena Games, so they could publish Genesis/ MD games and work around Nintendo&#039;s contracts. Acclaim created the company Flying Edge, which would publish Genesis/ Sega games exclusively. Flying Edge was a division of Acclaim, and Arena was a division of LJN. But Acclaim purchased LJN and all of LJN&#039;s subsidiaries. in the end, Acclaim owned LJN, Flying Edge and Arena Games. Jack Friedman started fresh with THQ. Tengen was a division of Atari Games.

Or at least closer to the arcade game, but still not exact. the NES game is still at a smaller resolution compared to the arcade game. the Cherry sprites missing details. But, it was a solid enough port. Namco used the same port too? I also remember renting the TENGEN Ms. Pac-Man NES port too. It looks closer to the arcade game, but the screen has to scroll. Giving you 3/4th of the screen. But still, not a big annoyance. But the game does have co-op option, and the option for smaller and more compressed maps that fit the screen, and the option for larger maps.

I don&#039;t think the Namco version is bad. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_b<wbr>UrJmCUyA&amp;t=60s<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-_<wbr>mOUOnZxk<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIN<wbr>UCRdN6lw&amp;t=385s", "filename": "tengenvsnes", "ext": ".png", "w": 1176, "h": 793, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1676452764687730, "time": 1676452764, "md5": "5RsGVL0QwExRY/2qBi+u/A==", "fsize": 863853, "resto": 9661230}, {"no": 9663305, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:03:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661230</a><br>I&#039;m sure there&#039;s any number of 90-minute video essays you can look up on this subject.", "time": 1676455397, "resto": 9661230}, {"no": 9663318, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:11:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9663206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9663206</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The TENGEN carts use some sort of reverse lockout that doesn&#039;t do any damage.</span><br>They plain stole the patents and made a clone of the NES lockout chip.", "time": 1676455916, "resto": 9661230}, {"no": 9663330, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:25:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661230</a><br>transcending history and the world, a tale of tens and gens", "time": 1676456713, "resto": 9661230}, {"no": 9663402, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:20:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9661571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9661571</a><br>Their guidelines could be quite vague and inconsistent at times, several studios have commented on it.

Everyone back then when they saw it assumed it was something you were supposed to be able to remove to plug in some kind of upgrade or additional accessory, and having a completely separate piece of the cart that is even a different color must have made the manufacturing of the carts more much expensive than if it was just two black plastic shells.<br><br><a href=\"#p9663206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9663206</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;always heard that other unlicensed games tend to shoot extra voltage into the NES, and &#039;daze&#039; the NES10 lockout chip. They can damage the console, and even causes a burning plastic smell. The TENGEN carts use some sort of reverse lockout that doesn&#039;t do any damage.</span><br><br>There was other unlicensed games that did indeed do that. It was found that if you sent a voltage spike to the chip it disables it until you power cycle the console. The NES10 basically does the equivalent of pressing the reset button if the other chip on the cart ever fails it&#039;s security check (Hence why the NES keeps resetting if there is no cart inserted), so disabling it works for bypassing the DRM. The Famicom never had it, so it could not be integrated that well into the console unlike later Nintendo systems, which is why just simply removing the pin from the chip that sends the reset signal disables the DRM completely instead of prevents the console from working at all.<br><br>No idea if it could cause damage, but it likely was not good for it. I think Codemasters was one who did that, there was a switch on their earlier carts that adjusted this behavior because it was not perfected.

The opponent can escape the combo with DI, so you have to follow the direction where he moves as you execute the combo, and you may have to turn that up b into nair or something else.

Got a good controller and read up on what people use - now what initially felt impossible feels trivial with ZERO practice. That&#039;s legacy, not skill. I had to immediately jump into training mode and memorize the b&amp;bs cause fighting games don&#039;t really have an accessible beginner pipeline. there&#039;s no items mode on to play with experienced players so we all have fun (while in basketball I played a ton of &quot;throw here, then from 3, then half-court&quot; games with my more experienced friends), the inputs can&#039;t really be learned on the fly (as you would learn basketball or football or boxing), you have no choice but to commit to the game before you even see what it&#039;s about. Unless you&#039;ve played fighting games before, there&#039;s absolutely no reason why a quarter circle -&gt; punch would throw a projectile. It&#039;s just not intuitive. That&#039;s legacy, and that&#039;s the sort of learning path that would&#039;ve made sense in the arcade days were people met face to face and you could get tutorials IRL.

Where the actual skill lies is in the actual fight - how do you handle neutral, how do you optimize your advantage/disadvantage, which attacks are &quot;safer&quot;, how do you read/predict your opponent&#039;s habits, how do you mix up and become unpredictable, how do you safely space your attacks, is aggression or defensive play better, etc. All of which is present in Smash, so the skill is the same except without the added complexity of Smash&#039;s analog inputs and DI.", "time": 1676382425, "resto": 9657642}, {"no": 9660998, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)09:20:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9660939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9660939</a><br><a href=\"#p9660872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9660872</a><br>None of the complexity you mentioned is any more than most fighting games though.

You can say it&#039;s retarded and inaccurate and about way more than that, and I don&#039;t care, you show me a mech and I&#039;m turning that gay shit off. Same thing with hedgehogs and guns.

But it&#039;s a divisive entry BECAUSE of it&#039;s Metroid-design and Wario losing abilities he had in WL2, so you&#039;ll either think it&#039;s a masterpiece or hate it. Also the Golf minigame sucks.<br><br>WL2 is the foundation of which the future Wario Lands are based on. It&#039;s really cool due to it&#039;s alternate story routes. Though every chest having a mini-game roulette attached to it is so fucking annoying and I hate it more then the Golf mini-game of 3. <br><br>Both WL2/Wl3 Wario can&#039;t die, so much of the punishment is having your time wasted instead.

But there&#039;s a magic to playing the games in order of release and seeing the evolution there. Otherwise you would have to play half of a SNES game, go back to play Fire Emblem Gaiden on the NES, then go back for the other half of the SNES game to play in order of &quot;1, 2, 3&quot; for the games.<br>The inventory system might of the original Shadow Dragon might be frustrating to deal with, though. Even when the game wasn&#039;t even a year old yet there was an interview with the series creator on Famitsu and he talked about how people complained about that inventory system.

The Switch Brigandine game is fun, too, if you like the original. Not much it terms of changes, so it&#039;s just more of the same rather than changing or trying to revamp the system. I prefer the story and characters of the original probably just because of the nostalgia/familiarity but there&#039;s an obvious difference in the design with the new game having the giant anime tits that you&#039;d expect out of any modern offering.

I can offer some of their thoughts. <br><br>Some arcade machines kept track of how much they earned in the hidden operator test settings. Data would display on how much money/quarters that players put inside the machine on each difficulty. You could track the data. <br><br>If you made the difficulty too high, then casual players would give up and stop playing because it was too hard.<br><br>If you made it too easy, then the game wouldn&#039;t be seen as a challenge and your casual players would easily beat the on less quarters. Which means you earn less money.<br><br>The idea was to find the perfect middle ground. You could adjust default CPU difficulty on a scale from level 1 to level 10 in many games.<br><br>If your arcade was in an area with mostly casual players and children, then you kept the difficulty on moderate. You go easy on the kids to lure more quarters out of them. Give them just enough hope and they will give you more quarters. <br><br>For an arcade that had a lot of &quot;pro players&quot;, operators kept the difficulty on high because they would be more of a challenge to pro players. <br><br>For some games like Fighting games, you could even adjust the default damage level.<br><br>For example, in the Philippines the the damage level was actually kept on 50% instead of the normal 100%. Kids didn&#039;t have a lot of money, so arcade owners would lower the damage so the players that visited often would be able to &quot;feel&quot; like they got their money&#039;s worth. Matches would be extra long due to lower damage. But this kept visitors coming to arcades. This happened in many countries in Asia, South America, and the Pacific Islands where kids had less money. <br><br>In America and Europe the damage was set to 100%<br><br>This led to an interesting scenario in &quot;Marvel VS Capcom 2&quot; when they were trying to host worldwide tournaments.

Emulation does not (and will never) count. <br><br>There is a reason that official record holder websites like Twin Galaxies and other websites exist. And the rule is that it must be on original hardware. It&#039;s to hold everyone to same rules and same standards.<br><br>Games like Donkey Kong require a 4 way joystick (original manufacturer design). And Using other joysticks with more available directions actually give an unfair advantage in game. There are active lawsuits right now in the real world about records being false because of using the wrong joystick. <br><br>PC computers are not universal. Everyone has different setups. Emulation can be used to cheat and there have been numerous cases of people cheating. Like with DDR and Guitar Hero record holders who&#039;ve been caught faking their records. They record themselves with the gameplay speed reduced to around 90% or 80% (because they can&#039;t do it at 100% speed), then use a video editing program to speed it back up to 100%. <br><br>Or people trying to claim &quot;Shoot Em up&quot; or &#039;Run and Gun&#039; game records, but use autofire.

So in this case finishing a game is just getting to the end. Whereas I&#039;d argue that &#039;finishing what you start&#039; doesn&#039;t really imply getting through the middle. Because you can on several degrees of passivity &#039;finish&#039; what you start. I merely asked why one would finish what they start, on the notion that the whole thing is tedium.

Spider-Man: Mysterio&#039;s Menace (2001/GBA) is a weird one, because it&#039;s sort of a sequel to both Spider-Man duologies from that time, on PS1 and GBC, and it worked well for both. As for how it plays, it&#039;s 2D, just like both GBC installments, and takes elements from both, like the upgrades and overall open design from Vicarious Visions&#039; 1st effort, while also having actual levels like Torus&#039; sequel. While it isn&#039;t 3D, it clearly attempts to follow up on both PS1 installments, with its sprites and GUI/HUD clearly taken straight from it or at least inspired by it.

Looking back at PS1 and 2s vast library I nor any of my friends, even my well off ones, had even half the games on those lists and knew of maybe only a couple of the larger ones like Metal Gear Solid they never got. Comparing something retroactively to its potential versus its actuality is a bit foolish. Games were expensive when you were a kid, piracy hardly golden. Hell, one of my friends wanted to borrow a game to pirate a copy for himself and he ended up destroying my disk, so I was very piracy averse after that experience for years. If you want to compare and argue about it now potential matters, but I don\u2019t think it matters when you actually talk about the reality of the situation. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had Symphony of the Night growing up, nowadays it\u2019s my second favorite Castlevania behind Rondo of Blood and only slightly beating out Castlevania 3. But I didn\u2019t play any of these games before I was an adult, what I played growing up was was Castlevania 1 and 2 on my dads NES, and I didn\u2019t play any of the ones on my N64 because. Well I never actually saw any at GameStop or at a yard sale. I played rogue squadron and army men and Mario and Zelda. My pals with their PlayStations played Spyro and Crash and a lot of shitty shovelware I don\u2019t really remember (like army men Kek)<br><br>And we all played on our game boys and gameboy advances because that\u2019s just what you did. We\u2019d get the game links and play advance wars together or trade our Pok\u00e9mon. Nintendo put out and published some fantastic games on their handhelds.", "filename": "CFC549FF-E020-47A2-AE6E-844F6E8F722A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 753, "h": 753, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676129899704461, "time": 1676129899, "md5": "5Wkw9mGEVYjbtJaqEObgmQ==", "fsize": 78051, "resto": 9650641}, {"no": 9651983, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:45:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9651970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9651970</a><br>And we would trade games a lot because well it was much easier to loans a friend a game after he had beaten it than to buy it yourself.

Plus we would skirmish and no one ever unlocked everything (except me I eventually finished everything in AW2 years after they had all moved on lmao) so some games you just had to get for yourself so you\u2019d wait for your birthday or do yard work and mow grass to get it. But seriously even my pal who\u2019s dad was a doctor who would continually buy and update his computer to play the newest games on PC, and then would give his son his hand me downs, didn\u2019t get every game. I mean they had an Xbox even? And he had a lot of games for it but not everything that would show up on a top 10 best Xbox games list. Even if they could technically have afforded them all he had neither infinite time nor infinite knowledge and my friend was playing on his gameboy as much as his fancy Alienware computer or fancy new Xbox none of us had.

So when you play the remaster with twin stick control, it&#039;s super fucking easy. Like I am on Normal and have not come even close to dying at any point. I think the remaster supports a control option that mimics the original though, but I haven&#039;t tested it. It also has the Wiimote aiming controls if you&#039;re into that. If you have a Switch-compatible GC controller, it can be used to control the game exactly as it was on the original hardware. Visually the remaster is exceptional, and runs at 60FPS somehow despite the Switch&#039;s dogshit hardware.<br><br>Ultimately, I would recommend the remaster without any caveats, unless your mission is specifically to play the original code of the game in its purest form. The remaster is a straight visual upgrade without sacrificing any of the original&#039;s art direction or atmosphere. Control options are varied enough to give you whatever you want. It&#039;s got extra accessibility options, and some bonus features like concept art and 3D model viewers that the original didn&#039;t have. <br><br>TL;DR The remaster is definitely worth the purchase", "time": 1676349182, "resto": 9644914}, {"no": 9660218, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)23:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9644914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9644914</a><br>Really I don&#039;t know which is the best version between the original and the remaster.

I\u2019m always confused when people act like 3&amp;K is the best of the genesis games. Its not a terrible game but I prefer 1, 2 or CD. Sonic 1 and 2 are great for reasons you mentioned. Linear, fast and fun almost arcade style games. Race through the level and beat the boss quickly, stopping only to get the chaos emeralds. Multiple paths but the best is always fast and gives lots of rings. Metropolis Zone in Sonic 2 feels like a preview of Sonic 3. Its long and gets old. The added content in 3 seems to just slow everything down. It felt like it was competing with something slower and more methodical like DKC of Yoshi Island rather than trying to be fast, arcadey sonic. All the different powerups and different kinds of bonus zones complicated things in the wrong way. <br><br>Of course levels like labyrinth Zone and Marble Garden Zone in Sonic 1 slow things down too. I love these levels. The difference is they are simpler in design and not as long and just don\u2019t feel as padded out. Most levels in Sonic 3 wear out their welcome by the first zone in my opinion. Those slower levels in Sonic 1 remind me of 80\u2019s platforming games. Alex Kidd, SMB, etc. The long ones in 3&amp;K feel like Metropolis Zone times 3<br><br>Sonic CD is more about exploration and collection so the levels are more open. You can breeze through levels like in previous sonic games or you can try to find the collectables. Its a different game and I would say its a great twist. Rather tham just being longer and having more cinematic showpieces like 3, theres a real purpose and you\u2019re actively looking for something.<br><br>I don\u2019t mean to be too hard on 3&amp;K. Saving makes up for my complaints and moves it from an arcade platformer and turns it into a longer experience like DKC, Super Metroid or Castlevanias. Instead of playing the whole game, the player is meant to play a level or two per sitting, keeping things fresh.

Sonic CD was great too as a one-off experimental title, but it wasn\u2019t the direction I would have taken the series.
