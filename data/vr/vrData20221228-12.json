Play if you like quirky games like Wario Ware and rhythm games.<br>3. Advance Wars\u2014personally not a fan, but those who liked it spent hundreds of hours in it. Very addictive strategy game.<br>4. WarioWare\u2014quirky and addictive, one of the more original games for GBA. If you&#039;ve never tried it, do. If you did, still fun to see where it all started from.<br>5. Metroid Fusion\u2014it&#039;s 2D Metroid, enough said. It&#039;s great despite some say it&#039;s not Super Metroid.<br>6. Mother 3\u2014not a perfect RPG, but one many people want to play now. Play if you like Earthbound or want an RPG with plot.<br>7. Wario Land 4\u2014some praise this is as pinnacle of GBA or even best platformer ever, others will write it off as good but ultimately weaker than the GBC ones. Regardless, well worth a try.<br>8. Mario &amp; Luigi\u2014actually very good RPG, only brought down by bing bang wahoo style and kinda whatever graphics.<br>9. Kirbies in general\u2014always fun and worth a play. Play if you like Kirby, don&#039;t play if you&#039;re sick of platformers.<br>10. Mega Man Zero 3 &amp; 4\u2014decent games, but got pretty overrated recently as some &quot;official canon classics&quot;. I beat them all, they&#039;re fun and good but not really masterpieces. Play if you like Mega Man X series and / or have played the other 9 games already.<br>Not on the list:<br>SNES ports, especially Mario ports\u2014kind of obsolete in current day and age, maybe save for SMW as you can collect dragon coins in it, but that&#039;s it.<br>Pokemons\u2014you either love them or hate them. If you love them, you probably know which ones to play anyway, and may prefer remakes. <br>Zelda: Minish Cap\u2014it&#039;s more Zelda. Play it or skip it, it&#039;s alright if you want more ALTTP but thats about it.<br>Treasure games\u2014no comment.<br>Mega Man Battle Network\u2014one of those monster / card collect series that just goes on and on.", "time": 1672043990, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518704, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:53:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518654</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his list is baaad, look at my list look at my list! </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the same but has one-dollar-store Symphony of the Night with ladyboy characters!</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9518683</span><br><a href=\"#p9518687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518687</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;then takes it so seriously he deletes his post over a typo and uses alt codes</span><br>I hope you are a janny because otherwise you need to touch snail shells right now", "time": 1672044817, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518708, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:59:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518704</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look at my list look at my list</span><br>I never posted a list.

Depends on the game. Beatemups are usually easy to clear in a sitting, and RPGs, while they take time, are just a steady grind of getting stronger until you win. There are some games where, as a kid, my bros and I would play for a bit, have fun, then swap cartridges to something else, with some titles remaining perpetually unbeaten. But we were never particularly bothered by it. It sounds like a bizarre thing to say, but &quot;you have to be able to beat it&quot; never felt like a required selling point back in the day. Just trying to get farther for the explorative reward of seeing the next level or the new enemy types was exciting enough. It was fun to be able to go to school the next day and tell kids &quot;dude I got to level 4 once and there&#039;s these grey octopus things that shoot missiles!&quot; on some game. <br><br>Part of it comes down to ownership vs rental though. It wasn&#039;t common for kids in our region and generation to own lots of games, we weren&#039;t super rich. So we&#039;d get one or two a year for birthday/Christmas, and borrow them between ourselves. When rentals became a thing it greatly expanded the number of titles we were able to play, and at only 3 days a pop it was common to return a game without clearing it, to try something else, then come back to it and rent it again at a later date (unless it was so awesome that it was worth renting multiple times in a row; when Street Fighter 2 came out on SNES I think we stayed up 25 hours playing that). <br><br>I do have some distinct memories of games I did beat, though. Zelda 1 multiple times - always an immersive adventure. Final Fantasy 1 as well, and grinding or no the last dungeon can get tricky if you&#039;re not smart with your spellcasting. Castlevania 1, was pretty proud when I could sit down and beat that in a single run.

That&#039;s not even getting into issues like nonsensical location jokes and references / skits that are extremely dated. There are lots of translators today, both by people who do it for a living or for fun or even AI / MTLs are getting in on the action, all of which pretty much renders that original &quot;worth learning&quot; part moot. On top of that, that&#039;s not even getting into the nightmare of localizations and the script purity question. Even with all of those compounded factors, there are people who still pushed through with it and there&#039;s a ton more people who know Japanese now than there was a decade or two ago, leaving a very saturated field of translators who are constantly fighting over rights to translate. There&#039;s also another thing in this thread that&#039;s worth pointing out too: most of the titles posted are either Sega Saturn, obscure PC-E or PS1/PS2 titles, the reason which is that the technology to actually inject and rewrite text, make sure it fits the boxes, etc. is a much more difficult task than translating the script itself wholesale.

The go-to example of this is probably The First Templar (way too easy) or Gran Turismo 5 (requires a retarded amount of dedication) not to mention all of the online-only trophies which were functionally impossible to get. <br><br>Nowadays, while there are a lot of games releasing solely for trophy hunters to get an easy platinum, most other achievement lists are designed by the developers themselves rather than a third party. In my opinion, if retro devs had access to cheevo software back in the day, the lists they would have made might be quite similar to these fanmade ones - barring glitches and 1cc autism, of course.<br><br>My go-to pick for proof of why RetroAchievements is fantastic are the coin challenges in SMB1. Even when you consult a level map to get every coin possible, ratchet scrolling means you have to be basically perfect. There&#039;s also the ironman challenge for SMW, or the extra hard cheevos for F-Zero X. It&#039;s also worth mentioning that the API&#039;s implementation is a fantastic training tool for indie devs since you have to dive deep into the code and tinker with lots of stuff just to make a functioning trophy.<br><br>There are definitely games which don&#039;t need achievements at all.

Would have been sweet to see it introduced with R/S/E instead. Was probably the most logical change to ever come to this franchise but by the time it showed up I was already done with Pokemon so I never played past the third gen of games. It was also nice to see those secret bases be a thing even if there was only a few limited locations for it. Was nice you could link up with friends, even have your friends character persist in your world. The fashion shows were also a fun divergence from the main game. Something this series desperately needed instead of just constant battling. Also made lesser mons and attacks not always completely worthless. Just too bad it was never expanded on really to my knowledge. Pokemon should have went out its way to vastly expand on concepts outside the catching and battling but I guess that leaves no room for milking so of course it wasn&#039;t happening.<br><br>Now as for the GB/GBC era, I actually prefer this era.

QuackShot (Sega Genesis): It&#039;s not a complete piece of cake, but it&#039;s really enjoyable and well made, short and has unlimited continues, so as long as you keep going it should be a matter of time.<br><br>2. World Cup Italia &#039;90 (Sega Genesis): I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re into football/soccer, but this is a simple one, a tournament of 7 matches, just spam diagnoal long balls and try to do a header or bicycle kick.<br><br>3. Sonic Chaos (Sega Master System/Sega Game Gear): I&#039;d say this is the easiest 2D Sonic platformer ever made, just keep going to the right and you&#039;ll beat it, if you want 100% completion though...<br><br>4. Lucky Dime Caper &amp; Deep Duck Trouble (Sega Master System/Sega Game Gear): A similar situation to QuackShot, they&#039;re both good, fun and short, with unlimited continues, just keep playing them.<br><br>5. World Cup Italia &#039;90 (Sega Master System): Another 7 match tournament, just select a good team like Brazil, run up the pitch or do long passes, and score by passing it sideways near the box.<br><br>6. Donald Duck no Mahou no Boushi (SNES): A straightforward adventure even on the hardest difficulty setting, same situation as the previous Donald Duck titles I&#039;ve mentioned, and a good time too.<br><br>7.

Things aren&#039;t &quot;weak&quot; to elements per se, rather, each color represents some sort of universal element, and the cards within that color are fundamentally weak because they lack abilities and strengths represented through the other colors. As in, decks heavy on Blue generally have good magical capabilities, but their creatures tend to be weaker pound-for-pound, which requires strategizing around. So, the elements themselves have strengths and weaknesses, and your &quot;team composition&quot; (deck) requires adjustment in order to make up for those weaknesses. But the elements don&#039;t actually have advantages against one another mechanically during gameplay.
