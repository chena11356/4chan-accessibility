NTSC has telecine judder because of the 3:2 pulldown, while in PAL everything is sped up to 25 fps, and while it&#039;s not really noticeable until you compare side by side, often the pitch of the audio is higher as a result and it sounds jarring if you&#039;re familiar with the original. <s>I&#039;ll take a 4K Blu-ray on an OLED here, thank you very much.</s><br>TV broadcasts are better in PAL, 50Hz is OK and you get the benefit of a higher resolution and better colors. Of course when we&#039;re talking about natively PAL-produced content. Shows converted from one format to the other have their own share of problems.<br>Now, for games it&#039;s NTSC hands down. Most games were produced with NTSC in mind and many PAL ports are broken (speed, aspect ratio, etc.). I have no problem with playing proper PAL conversions though. Of course with NTSC/PAL for games I mean line/refresh standards, not the color encoding.

This is almost counter advertising. But at the same time, parents were upset that the Super Nintendo was not backwards compatible with the NES. There actually was outrage over that. Parents would spend up to $60 a cartridge for their kids NES, spend hundreds of dollars in total over the span of a few years. Find out that the next Nintendo console will not be able to use the old Nintendo software that they paid good money for. Parents didn&#039;t want to have a mess of consoles in their living rooms with wires thrown around everywhere. They just wanted to have the one machine that could play all their Nintendo library. Nintendo could never fully communicate why their SNES was not backwards compatible, without sounding like a technical manual. Super Mario AllStars was a weird compromise to everyone, expecting backwards compatibility.

Flying enemies fly in a straight line, &quot;hopping&quot; enemies that just hop up and down 3 times, and then they throw them at you with * 10 more hp later on in the game because they expect you to have &quot;whip but slightly longer dealing 3 times more damage&quot;.

Doesn&#039;t matter which version you play, all of them have their strengths. There is an exception where Grant is broken in the Japanese version because of his infinite throwable knives allowing him to cheese the whole game, which gets fixed in the US version and even further refined in the PAL version since the enemies and bosses put up a fair fight instead of being frail and easily exploitable as they are in the JP version, or tough as nails in the US version.

Handily shitting all over the cpus of the gameboy and neo geo pocket- this was the only system of the 3 that could run a full ass web browser.<br><br>Nearly the entire library runs at 75 fps. Why? Idk but it\u2019s quite nice. Games are smooth with lots of animation and fast clean scrolling. Hundreds of sprites dotting the screen without hiccup. <br>The system is no slouch in audio hardware either. Having a capable synth setup, AND cool ass sample capabilities- it has a sound that when used to full potential reminds me of some neo geo titles.<br><br>Despite the device being a properly capable 16 bit handheld for the time, the thing SIPS power. A single AA battery will keep the thing in active gameplay for well over 40 hours. That\u2019s not 40 hours standby- that\u2019s 40 hours of straight gameplay. On ONE battery. Gbc could barely muster 10 on 2 of the things.<br>This was also a console that only cost about $30 on release.", "filename": "6930D498-A4EA-4706-B748-CEF889F1787E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 267, "h": 189, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 176, "tim": 1668420133696263, "time": 1668420133, "md5": "JaukUU5hoNJO++I8RMZeUg==", "fsize": 7746, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "its-far-better-than-you-think", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 58, "images": 10, "omitted_posts": 53, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 9421163, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)00:38:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9419643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9419643</a><br>Backlight toggle or not it was still a battery hog. <br>And the gameboy light actually sorta got away with its light by using an EL panel.

Surreal and unsettling would be a good place to start. A weird curio from a bygone era? Yep. An avant-garde art piece? Yeah, probably that too. I&#039;m hesitant to call it a good game, because it&#039;s barely a game at all, but I&#039;ll certainly say this... it&#039;s interesting.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The game is extremely linear, mostly shuffling you around from location to location with a few things in any given environment to interact with and, once you do, you&#039;ll be shuffled off to the next area. This has the effect, intended or not, of making you feel rather uncomfortable as you&#039;re given virtually no control over anything. Practically every game amounts to simply doing what the developers intended, but it&#039;s rarely as on the nose as it is here, to the point that it feels less like exerting your own will and intellect to reach a desired conclusion that was planned by the developers and more like doing what they want, regardless of what you want. The distinction is arguably superficial but, in this case, it&#039;s palpable just the same.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graphically the game is a strange mishmash of steampunk, art deco, and some kind of unidentified Eastern Bloc country aesthetic. Things frequently take a turn for the surreal, and you often travel from one location to the next in something approximating an out of body experience - you&#039;ll be looking at a monitor of something and then suddenly move through the monitor into that location, for example.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adding to the surreal and unsettling quality is a fantastic, otherworldly soundtrack by Koji Ueno. It sometimes reminded me of the work of Akira Yamaoka, with things frequently turning into walls of abstract industrial noise. If the bizarre visuals and storytelling aren&#039;t enough to make you uneasy, the music ought to do the trick.</span><br><br>https://www.zombs-lair.com/gadget-c<wbr>ollection", "filename": "2glzDFD", "ext": ".png", "w": 510, "h": 750, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668506698232772, "time": 1668506698, "md5": "ivD+zb9HhdFodwBytFKC4g==", "fsize": 662825, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gadget-is-hard-to-describe-surreal-and-unsettling", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 12, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 7, "omitted_images": 4, "last_replies": [{"no": 9419263, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)10:37:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9419107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9419107</a><br>Shit doesn\u2019t get any weirder than this, definitely a product of its time https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch<wbr>?v=C58MMwxTSvM", "time": 1668613055, "resto": 9416592}, {"no": 9421474, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)05:02:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1668679367, "resto": 9416592}, {"no": 9421574, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:30:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sadly the interaction is really poor.

You didn&#039;t have great fighting experience on home consoles.<br>On 5th gen you have literal masterpieces like VF2, Tekken 2 and 3, SF Alpha games and other Capcom and SNK ports. Even on PS1, which is considered less desireable than Saturn for 2D fighting games, things like SFA or Real Bout shit all over any of the SNES or Genesis ports.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Racing games</span><br>This is even easier. Daytona USA, Ridge Racer, Sega Rally, Gran Turismo, Need for Speed - these all are huge system sellers and still play great. SNES and Genesis have tons of racing games but they all are shovelware. Nothing on the level and prominence of the titles mentioned above. Out Run was good only on arcades.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First person shooters</span><br>5th gen had Doom, Quake and Goldeneye. Nuff said. SNES Doom is more of a curiosity than a proper game. 16 bit consoles only had Wolfenstein and Zero Tolerance which is a Wolfenstein clone - both very simplistic and flat, compared to Doom.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Real Time Strategy</span><br>There is Dune 2 on Genesis and that&#039;s it. Herzog Zwei is a strategy/shmup hybrid and is a different genre. Dune 2 is a very barebones game with only skirmish missions, bad controls and tons of slowdown. 5th gen consoles have proper RTS games with C&amp;C, Red Alert and Warcraft 2 ports.", "filename": "download-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 600, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1668499231068493, "time": 1668499231, "md5": "r2zwBfRhbxMrvTvJe7V3Wg==", "fsize": 40625, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "5th-console-generation-was-the-real-golden-age", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 50, "images": 9, "omitted_posts": 45, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 9421068, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)23:46:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sega Dreamcast: <br><br>\u20223PS/FPS: Bang!
