John Carmack basically said the same thing, and he would have had a front row seat into dealing with Jobs. Apparently Jobs thought of video games as &quot;pornos&quot; where &quot;the plot didn&#039;t matter&quot;. To him, Pixar was the bastion of digital creativity, games were for peasants. When they released Doom, Carmack wanted to include &quot;produced on NeXT&quot; branding, but Jobs denied the request. Years later, Jobs would do everything in his power to prevent OSX from being a more game-friendly platform. I think Carmack said something along the lines of how Jobs &quot;could talk, with complete confidence, about things he was just plain wrong about&quot;. <br><br>The man had some good ideas but it&#039;s a real shame that he was such a dick about this particular thing.

In the late game, made use of the ADD_TO_FLAG to keep make the loops to add heroes to the map a little longer each time, it&#039;s still worth putting in some hard cap on it in case there are too many things to draw on screen, in fact reaching such a caps a good reason to take the player to the final set of waves.<br><br>It&#039;s a bit cliche to put a &#039;boss&#039; party that has the avatar and a bunch of heroes on repeat. Fighting the avatar takes forever even with strong creatures and will get boring to do over and over. Try to make your boss party a little more diverse if repeating it, maybe a witch or wizard leads the party sometimes. When deciding to repeat elements, I found it more enjoyable to group by spells, e.g. select some from a group that can heal, then some with hand to hand, and so on.

A good example to study is level 11 in the campaign (Hearth). What you&#039;re aiming for is a war of attrition in that kind of style. Small parties attacking from multiple sides are better than just sending in a big wave (that&#039;s the kind of thing boulder traps were made for). Reducing the timer slightly is a nice way to increase pressure. Between every tier change (with stronger/increased heroes added to party) I&#039;d always give plenty of breathing room, that way at least if they don&#039;t make it they can analyse what they did and think, &#039;yeah okay I should&#039;ve trained my dragons for a while longer instead of leaving them on research, it would&#039;ve meant I would&#039;ve won that fight&#039;.<br><br>Some logic to try to punish turtling, I always had a party or two that its job was just to harass the player in some form if they hadn&#039;t progressed (triggered an expected flag by a certain amount of time, given ample time, this timer would keep repeating until they got to the expected trigger).<br><br>Another thing to do is always to limit the amount of gold, players had to keep digging it out and things like gems were on further reaches of the maps (and a great place to put enemy keepers or hero gates in the way to force the player to eventually fight).<br><br>Also there&#039;s a mistake in my explanation here <a href=\"#p9467738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467738</a> the 600 is starting gold for the creature if I remember, the script is actually every 1,000 turns (as per timer).<br><br>One idea for a multiplayer map I had was where there are keepers in the corners, gems in the middle but it&#039;s also got a lot of hero gates around them that spawn waves of heroes in the manner described.

MiSTer is a project that is taking advantage of a cheap FPGA that people can buy, called the DE-10 Nano. The DE-10 Nano is cheap because it is made for college students, and is subsidized by Intel. The DE-10 Nano has an FGPA on board, as well as an ARM chip. It has various connectors on the board for expandability. MiSTer has a bunch of FPGA cores (much like the cores you would see on one of the Analog systems) for consoles, handhelds, arcade boards and computers. Developers are constantly adding more cores and improving on existing cores. A hobbiest community has popped up around this project, which has led to a lot of hardware addons that can be installed onto the DE-10 Nano, such as extra RAM, a digital or analog I/O board, USB hub (these things make up the most common MiSTer setup that you have likely seen, which is a sandwich of three boards with the DE-10 Nano in the middle)... etc. There are people who have made specialized expansion boards like the MiSTercade, which allows it to be used in a typical JAMMA arcade cabinet. At a base level, you really just need the DE-10 Nano, and preferably a RAM stick, the rest is optional.<br><br>MiSTer can be appealing to enthusiasts because it offers better accuracy/latency compared to software emulation. It&#039;s also very easy to set up and use in a variety of scenarios, without having to invest in a bunch of extra shit like flash carts, upscalers, custom cables... etc. It is an all-in-one solution for many of the systems that a retro gamer would be interested in. By its nature, it is also very customizable. <br><br>I still think that software emulation is a good option, especially on a budget since you can probably do it on hardware that you already own, however I do like my MiSTer quite a bit and I find that I am playing more /vr/ games than ever since getting it.", "filename": "mister-sandwich", "ext": ".png", "w": 611, "h": 856, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670246300392107, "time": 1670246300, "md5": "fcC4uIUOYU6IZ0kAMoy3Dw==", "fsize": 945737, "resto": 9464069}], "last_modified": 1670246300}, {"no": 9465108, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)11:51:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "cruisin down the street in my 64", "filename": "1670085845041723", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1284, "h": 1260, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 245, "tim": 1670172689156916, "time": 1670172689, "md5": "/vlOgWMnxwBr6+8Xcw+ecg==", "fsize": 441316, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cruisin-down-the-street-in-my-64", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 38, "images": 6, "omitted_posts": 33, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 9467490, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)03:22:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9465464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9465464</a><br>Cause the n64 boys are always hard<br>You come talking that trash, we&#039;ll pull your card", "time": 1670228552, "resto": 9465108}, {"no": 9467775, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:30:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9465191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9465191</a><br>No u", "time": 1670243447, "resto": 9465108}, {"no": 9467780, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:35:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9465586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9465586</a><br>Ps1 is a mitsubishi eclipse.

Batman returns for the Sega CD contained the kinda crappy Genesis/ Mega Drive platformer, but added a CD soundtrack, and those scaling driving scenes wit the batmobile and batboat.

The biggest improvement between morrowind and oblivion that makes morrowind feel lifeless in retrospect is the static lives of npcs. People complained about the overhyped time cycle ai of oblivion but it really is a breath of life into the world. Oblivion at least maintained the leveling system of morrowind while making it casual. Skyrim is just horrific and unforgivable. It has zero creativity, no soul, no life, no atmosphere, and a horrific leveling system devoid of choice or thought. Oblivion has less soul in a serious sense than morrowind, but it has a dime novel fantasy feel that redeems this with a tongue in cheek schlock. Skyrim fails at everything entirely.
