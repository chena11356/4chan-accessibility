This is because the internet has made it easier than ever to find and like something new, but because the systems by which you find them are so splintered, it feels like nothing is solid, because we are used to old ways of thinking about fame and notoriety. When we were growing up, shit wasn&#039;t important unless it was on TV, in movies, on albums, or in magazines. Now there is no reason to appear in any of those, because you can do far more with the digital age and reach way more people than in the slowly dying traditional platforms. There are so many net cultures, however, that it&#039;s very hard to point at one and say &quot;that&#039;s it, that&#039;s the biggest thing right now&quot;. Its like that kardashian slut on SNL a few months ago. She rightly called being on TV a &quot;small, intimate setting&quot; because TV is the modern newspaper; Nobody important is on TV anymore, they&#039;re on shit like instagram and tiktok. Yet her game came from being on TV and in tabloids and such, which is why it seems like everyone knows about her. The problem is that even if TV is increasingly irrelevant, and culture is explosing online, a generation like ours either generally avoids social media, or just because of the weird ways you have to find your space in those worlds, we simply miss them. Tons of people use different social media platforms, and yet they mean completely different things to those people, because it is easy for someone or something to be famous yet unknown due to their being in a small subset of that service or platform.", "time": 1670620778, "resto": 9476223}, {"no": 9479060, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:20:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9479057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9479057</a><br>As such I argue that rather than no culture, there&#039;s actually too much subculture, buried away on different platforms and in different corners, and because it&#039;s all famous to somebody, but lacks penetration on the old world media empires (TV, film, records, print) it remains &quot;unknown&quot; to anyone outside of the right circles. That&#039;s why it feels like there is no culture, because the traditional modes that have dominated pop culture are outmoded and irrelevant, and because the new cultures are built for &quot;somebody, but not everybody&quot; which means they don&#039;t get picked up and pushed as part of a &quot;mainstream&quot; culture.

They don&#039;t know who of the young world is actually going to fit their &quot;wide movie audience&quot; or whatever, and so they just go back to old shit that benefited from the age when people got all their fame through old world media bombardment. As for the lack of &quot;scenes&quot; or the accusation of only using trappings of old scenes as costumes, my understanding is that young people are generally much less interested in the tribalism of being specific to one scene or identity, in part because people are so easily exposed anymore to new things. It&#039;s not like you have to subscribe to a certain magazine or go to specific stores in order to find out about stuff. With everything being online, and costing only time to find out about, why close yourself off to new things you might like, simply for sake of definition? It&#039;s almost more a modern rejection of the idea that corporate products can define your personality or sensibilities, and a willingness to stay open to new ideas or experiences, though I don&#039;t think shallow means of self-identity have disappeared in teens, they gave just changed foci and forms of expression.

The success of these two 1996 zombie games inspired a wave of Asian zombie films, such as Bio Zombie (1998) and Versus (2000), for example.[18] The zombie revival which began in the Far East eventually went global following the worldwide success of Japanese zombie games such as Resident Evil and The House of the Dead. Their success led to a wave of Western zombie films during the 2000s, such as 28 Days Later (2002) and Shaun of the Dead (2004), for example.[18] In 2013, George Romero said it was the video games Resident Evil and House of the Dead &quot;more than anything else&quot; that popularised his zombie concept in mainstream popular culture.[19][20]<br><br>The House of the Dead has also been credited with introducing a new type of zombie distinct from Romero&#039;s classic slow zombie: the fast running zombie. After first appearing in The House of the Dead, they became popular in zombie films and video games during the 2000s, including the Resident Evil games and films, The House of the Dead film adaptation, and the films 28 Days Later (2002) and Dawn of the Dead (2004).[21]", "time": 1670599030, "resto": 9471906}, {"no": 9478426, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)10:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471906</a><br>Probably Sakura Wars in Japan", "time": 1670599161, "resto": 9471906}, {"no": 9478514, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)11:21:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9478251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9478251</a><br>Just because you&#039;re a neurotic coping redditot it does make me kek.
