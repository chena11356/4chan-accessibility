Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white. Realistically, you&#039;ll probably have to settle on some sort of compromise between true blacks and a bit of black crush as no display is perfect. But hey, that ghosting should be gone at least.", "time": 1674540713, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9597950, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)02:07:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;build gbsc, forget jumper</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;plug it into pc crt</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crt goes berzerk &quot;117khz 240hz out of range&quot; with green flashes of light</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fix gbs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now pc monitors makes progressively louder high pitch squeal at 640x480, gone in other resolutions</span><br>di...did I fuck up?", "filename": "06a", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 606, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1674544066693093, "time": 1674544066, "md5": "CwRG4KYruIQjk+3tsEyo9Q==", "fsize": 32915, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598045, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:03:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597950</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fuck up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ask if you fucked up</span><br>lol. why?", "time": 1674547438, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598059, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597859</a><br>cheers, i&#039;ll try that out later", "time": 1674548000, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598074, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9598045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9598045</a><br>Yeah but did I fuck up enough to where my crt will die?", "time": 1674548507, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598121, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:52:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588807</a><br>What model is pic rel from?", "time": 1674550331, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598176, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:14:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591052</a><br>Infinite is good fun", "time": 1674551693, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598265, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)05:36:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588703</a><br>Yeah.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

It&#039;s supposed to make up for its weaknesses in sheer luck and agility, but in practice, it&#039;s a total paperweight. It becomes better after class change, but that&#039;s not saying much when even a fourth-rate Knight w/Icebrand can out-damage a first-rate Ninja w/Katana. But in a bugfixed/remade version? Thief becomes MUCH more viable and almost feels like another class entirely, and Ninja&#039;s access to Haste and bugfixed Temper means it&#039;s not to be underestimated. Meanwhile, both the Black and White Mages are simply too damn squishy even accounting for bugfixed Int, and taking full advantage of them by decking out their magic slots makes them lowkey the most expensive classes to maintain, so they&#039;re hardly worth wasting slots. This ironically makes the default party of the NES/MSX version the best beginner-friendly one in the long run since it has the most reasonable variety; in the original/bugged version, Thief is just too much of a drag in the long run and you&#039;re better off replacing it with literally anything else. I dunno why remakes then swap out Monk and Red Mage for White and Black Mages. That&#039;s just a straight-up worse setup even in those versions. All the good magic can be learned by Red Wizard, and physical stats are way more important in this game, so it&#039;s a nobrainer.

I am here to tell you that emulation and the secondhand market are both very wrong. Please delete your unauthorized reproductions and used copies within 24 hours. The only ethical way to consume video games is to buy a rendition that is currently sold through physical or digital retailers. For FINAL FANTASY, the Pixel Remaster series is an excellent choice. It is the latest incarnation of the classic FINAL FANTASY series, remastered for modern audiences with &quot;retro&quot; sensibilities. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is currently available on PC via Steam, Android via Google Play Store, and iOS via App Store. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is also coming soon to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4, where they were available physically. For FINAL FANTASY III or FINAL FANTASY IV, you may alternatively or additionally purchase our 3D remakes, which are still available on digital markets. The 3D remakes offer an experience similar but alternative to the 2D originals, making them worthwhile playthroughs. Remember, by purchasing only these versions of the FINAL FANTASY series, you are supporting the company that brought you the definitive editions of these legendary video games. As much as I too have a certain fondness for these classic role-playing video games as they appeared on Game Boy Advance and Sony PlayStation Portable, Square Enix will no longer receive the desirable monetary compensation through these obsoleted platforms, so it is therefore not recommended that you seek those ancient versions of these video games.

In DQ2 towns tend to work like hubs from which you may lead several adventures, and come back to between these adventures: using Cannock to go to the cave in the east, then to the cave in the west, before venturing further. Using Hamlin to go to Moonbroke, find the item in the swamp, then the tower in the east before venturing further.

The Pixel Remaster is (surprise) the easiest one between the Famicom and 3D versions. Back in the DS version, the monster limit was crunched due to perceived hardware limitations, so stats/classes were rebalanced across the board to make up for it. It wasn&#039;t perfect, but it got the job done and general game difficulty wasn&#039;t as wildly thrown off as some people make it seem. At worst, maybe the boss AI could&#039;ve been improved. Pixel Remaster is aesthetically closer to the Famicom original, but it still carries over and builds upon a staggering amount of 3D remake changes under the hood, especially the parts of it that give you an easier time without regard for why that was done in the first place. Many of the added class abilities were kept, giving you a bigger edge in battle. The capacity system was replaced yet again, but whereas the 3D version gave you a reasonable adjustment period, PR now has absolutely nothing there to keep you in check. And while the formations are ostensibly based on the original, the monster locations are based on the 3D version; an easy example, Goblins only appear in Altar Cave in the original, while in the 3D and PR versions, they keep appearing well after the cave and show up in and around town, which is normally the point you&#039;re supposed to be moving on to the next phase of monsters. Oddly enough, a similar change may have been planned for the WonderSwan Color version <br><a href=\"#p9600631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9600631</a>, but it at least looks like they would&#039;ve increased the number of outdoor Goblins to compensate (or it was just a test shot). Plus, in Pixel Remaster, game overs mean very little and the game freely allows you to restart from the beginning of the area. Final Fantasy III isn&#039;t even one of the hardest games in the series, putting aside the long final dungeon that eluded playtesting.

Cacoawards should be redone imo, and a good analogy for what ig I\u2019m trying to explain is that maybe it should be less like the oscars and more like a film festival.", "time": 1674586738, "resto": 9593848}, {"no": 9599148, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)14:07:32", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Screenshot_Doom_20230124_160619", "ext": ".png", "w": 1437, "h": 808, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674587252144180, "time": 1674587252, "md5": "qQyEseYcXu2I5lU4etBbxA==", "fsize": 180259, "resto": 9593848}, {"no": 9599157, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)14:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599123</a><br>Thanks, it&#039;ll fit in nicely.

The major difference, besides the controls, is apparently Prime 2 has some difficulty adjustments for some bosses so the game ends up being a bit easier. <br><br>Out of Prime 1 and 2, I think 2 barely edges it out for me. I think Prime 2 really hones down the aesthetic of the Prime games into something unique, where Prime 1 has some generic aesthetic choices. This is also apparently controversial, but I actually really like the beam ammo mechanics. There&#039;s a bit of a survival horror edge to Prime 2 because of that: besides the zombies in the opening, the Ing, and the whole dark world. <br>I think Metroid is at its best when it&#039;s a little scary, and Prime 2 might lean hardest into the spooky aesthetics I like from the series, besides what you get in Super.<br><br>In terms of environments I&#039;m a massive fan of Torvus Bog: it reminds me of growing up in Florida, but has this lovely feeling in certain parts of it like you&#039;re not supposed to be there. Like exploring some dark corner of a sewer system that hasn&#039;t seen an intelligent soul in decades. Torvus Bog following after Agon wastes is also a bit genius: you go from this oppressive desert for the first third of the game to this area drenched in rain.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it.

OoT was a very good start on 3D combat but right now I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry and <s>Dark Souls not retro though</s>.<br><br>The prior focuses on giving the player as many combat options as possible and makes that the fun of the game. Launchers, flying attacks, guns, ways to combo enemies, parries, everything you could want to do. These games are more about being stylish than just outright winning the fight. However this limits the enemy design as these games can quickly become unfun if there&#039;s too many enemies you can&#039;t combo effectively, or if the bosses act in a way that&#039;s too limiting to your arsenal.<br><br>While the latter is the exact opposite, you have an extremely narrow set of options in combat. Block, dodge, light swing, heavy swing, shoot projectile and maybe a few more options. While this seems limiting it allows the developers to focus much more heavily on challenging enemy design based on how enemies respond and require you to use the few options in your arsenal. People generally love boss fights in these kind of games for this exact reason, every single boss is like learning a song in a rhythm game since its mostly been simplified to &quot;when do I dodge and when do I hit?&quot;.<br><br>OoT has a lot of options that lack purpose. Yes you can angle your swipes, horizontally or vertically, but what value does that have over just hitting the B button? The answer is none because enemies don&#039;t respond to things in ways that warrant you to change that. Would crouch stabbing have any value if it wasn&#039;t just objectively the best DPS in the game? I don&#039;t think so, because no enemies have a mechanic where you need to crouch to evade their attacks. Dodge mechanics are hardly even necessary because only a tiny few enemies can threaten your shield, I can&#039;t even think of any other than Darknuts.<br><br>So I think that answers your question, quality &gt; quantity.", "filename": "20245725_1390952080994962_7348464048814365511_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 658, "h": 370, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674842161091574, "time": 1674842161, "md5": "zWcQa8zfOLvO/HZ8GMt9rQ==", "fsize": 25081, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607775, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry</span><br>you are wrong<br>it&#039;s <s>the batman arkham games</s>", "time": 1674842493, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607783, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:04:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607775</a><br>i really only see other superhero games copying that but yeah that one is influential unfortunately, I don&#039;t think its as much as the 2 I said though.", "time": 1674842640, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9608043, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:54:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607519</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;second song</span><br>good job proving my point with one of the most grating instruments used.", "time": 1674849272, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609634, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br>They should increase the quality instead of reducing the quantity", "time": 1674905120, "resto": 9594662}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9609248, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)01:20:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Champions of Norrath for the PS2 (and the sequel) are criminally underrated games.", "filename": "norrath", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 941, "h": 720, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 191, "tim": 1674886857290084, "time": 1674886857, "md5": "XHq00wG0FC564BbEAcrShw==", "fsize": 379669, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "champions-of-norrath-for-the-ps2-and-the-sequel", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 9609267, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)01:34:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609248</a><br>This is a Champions Return To Arms screenshot", "time": 1674887665, "resto": 9609248}, {"no": 9609269, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)01:34:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "it&#039;s an okay series but very buggy, very unbalanced, and very little randomization for the genre it&#039;s imitating<br><br>also negative points for shitting all over the EQ lore, why license the IP if you&#039;re only going to utilize the most superficial elements from it", "time": 1674887698, "resto": 9609248}, {"no": 9609297, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)01:57:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609267</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(and the sequel)</span>", "time": 1674889067, "resto": 9609248}, {"no": 9609340, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)02:29:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609248</a><br>The Fallout game uses the same engine and it&#039;s also not bad for a Fallout dungeon crawler.", "time": 1674890986, "resto": 9609248}, {"no": 9609628, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:22:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609269</a><br>elaborate?", "time": 1674904938, "resto": 9609248}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9606447, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:47:37", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Good Xbox games", "com": "Besides ports, what&#039;s so great about the Xbox?

There&#039;s nothing wrong with emulating, but personally I&#039;d rather spend more time playing the games themselves than fixing input settings, visual settings, flipping between different emulators because the one you tried first had some problems, etc. With a console I just have to put the game into the slot and turn it on and it works perfectly and there&#039;s no problems. Emulation SHOULD be more convenient than real hardware simply because you can run so many games on one machine, and yet it&#039;s not. I also think freedom of choice is a problem. For some reason when I have a menu with a bunch of games I end up playing only for a few minutes and then switching to a different game. I don&#039;t know why it is but I always do this. Meanwhile if I have an actual cartridge then I tend to leave it in and will play a single game for a few hours and will actually try to complete it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s worth putting each cart in a bag or if that plastic will interact with the other plastic?

The sleeves I use are very specific and I know for a fact that they won&#039;t cause problems. I wouldn&#039;t throw my stuff into any random plastic bag for storage. Short term is fine like if you need to carry it between two locations, but if the game is going to be sitting in that bag whenever it&#039;s not in the console then you need to consider whether or not it&#039;s safe to put it in there.<br>I&#039;m unsure about bubble wrap for long term storage, especially in the summer.

There is no better or worse, just different. The Virtual Boy displays games in 3D similar to the 3DS, and the emulator can&#039;t replicate it properly. It&#039;s better than playing on a flat LCD screen, but it&#039;s not the same experience as playing on the real hardware. The controls on the Oculus are similar to the Virtual Boy controller, but these games are made for d-pads not analogue sticks (although that&#039;s a minor gripe). One nice feature about the emulator is that you can change the color palette to something that&#039;s more pleasing to look at if the red bothers you.<br><br>If you can&#039;t justify the price for a failed device with only 22 games then the VR emulator is a great way to experience these games. At the very least it&#039;s a much closer experience than what a PC will give you.

Most FF fans are completely artistically illiterate and can&#039;t see any nuance. Sephiroth is shown to be cold and ruthless even when he was a &quot;hero.&quot; He was raised to be a killing machine, held up as a figurehead for Shinra&#039;s propaganda, showered with praise for slaughtering any perceived enemy, and we learn from Lucretia that he was never even held by his mother as a baby; he was whisked off by scientists to be a research specimen the moment he was born. You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see how fucked up someone would be from living a life like that. Even before the Nibelheim incident, he was, at best, a functional sociopath with a massive superiority complex, but most players completely miss all of that and take the claim that he&#039;s a hero at face value. <br><br>I&#039;d also argue that he doesn&#039;t actually give a shit about Jenova or the Ancients. Those are just post-hoc rationalizations he uses to justify his desires. When he reads in Gast&#039;s research notes that Jenova is an Ancient, he claims that entitles him to take the planet back from the humans who betrayed the Ancients. Later, when he travels through the Lifestream and learns the truth about Jenova (that she was actually just a monster that wiped out the Ancients), he twists it around and says that he&#039;s entitled to rule the planet because Jenova was even greater than the Ancients were. In other words, all he really wants is to satisfy his own ego by elevating himself up to godhood compared to the rest of the world, and he&#039;ll use whatever excuse he can come up with to justify it.", "time": 1674613383, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka is\u2026 Sephiroth</span><br>this nigga doesn\u2019t understand how numbers work", "time": 1674614692, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600392, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka\u2026 gets his plans foiled</span><br>You didn\u2019t even play the game.

There&#039;s at least a dozen Kojima-tier absurd plot twists that precede it, but basically the character being executed believes that its a mock execution, because the chief of police pardoned him but had to keep up appearances because he&#039;s known for being tough on crime. Usually on stage, that character acts like a chad with no fear of death, and his girlfriend is singing these joking lyrics about what a good actor he is while the music itself is really tense and clues you in that he&#039;s actually fucked and the police chief didn&#039;t actually give the order to pardon.

I think this game was excellent when it came to the music (that main menu theme!) and the overall plot and presentation was great. Lara never looked better imo. The gameplay is what kills it. The last levels from Strahov onward are simply unfinished and cut extremely short. I would have loved to see more of that world and the stuff they would have us raid from tombs. Each classic tomb raider game really did something completely different from the last one. Collecting an Atlantean artifact from lost civilisations that developed from a cataclysm, destroying an Italian cult focussed around a Chinese dagger that turns you into a dragon hunting through sunken ships (interesting choice of tomb), Collecting meteorite splinters from all over the world for a weird social darwinist gone power-mad only to then kill him, and then a game focussed around the apocalypse being started by a haughty Lara picking up the amulet of Seth (1999 had many apocalypse plots, even V:tM Redemption), Chronicles was all over the place, and finally this weird cinematic plot of a serial killer and Icons that you need to collect and periapt shards you need to defeat the weird half-angel Nephilim race. <br><br>Tomb Raider was a wild ride. It really pisses me off that the gameplay for the final game was so piss-poor. There is lots of potential in that game and afaik they wanted to do so much more.

It vastly improves the game with new mechanics and content. It should be noted that this version alongside the All-Stars/USA version were made by Nintendo R&amp;D2. Tanabe only directed Doki Doki Panic before it was Mario-fied. Doki Doki Panic is an inferior base game if you bother trying it out on emulator; missing crucial gameplay elements taken for granted like a run button, and bizarre, poor game design choices like forcing you to replay and beat the game as all 4 characters to reach the ending.

I figure the ones decrying it are aging Gen Xers who grew up on NES and SNES and think they&#039;re cringe/unnecessary, which is a fair opinion I guess, but to outright not play the game or say it ruins the whole entire package is elitist pedantry. The only real downside I&#039;d say is that the color palette is too washed out for being an early GBA release with no backlight, but that&#039;s nothing a color restoration mod can&#039;t fix.<br><br>I like all versions sans Doki Doki, but if I had to choose only 1, I&#039;ll go for Advance hands down.

A lot of it is just most people don&#039;t actually keep up with developments and work off of whatever old assumptions and limited information they have, but N64 in particular seems to be especially bad about this. I think it probably has to do with the fact that the scene itself is pretty quiet and fragmented - it doesn&#039;t have a larger-than-life figure like byuu that constantly brought attention to all kinds of shit going on with SNES emulation AND provided a solution, nor does it have one relevant and constantly active project that puts out blog posts and shit for normies to get hyped the way Dolphin and now PCSX2 do. It had some HUGE developments in the past few years, but it was from several people working on their own solutions, not coalesced around a single end-point or project, which I guess makes it harder to reach everyone and show them the big picture. And so people might&#039;ve heard there&#039;s a new plugin or two out there, but they&#039;ve no clue what that actually means for the overall state of N64 emulation or whether they actually fix the numerous issues it had in the past, so for all they know, the Body Harvest bridge is still broken, you still can&#039;t play the Factor 5 games, Mario Tennis is a bugged glitchy mess, etc.", "time": 1674807503, "resto": 9606203}, {"no": 9606852, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:07:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9606804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9606804</a><br>I can expect that from the more casual player, but people comming to this specific board should know better.<br><br>N64 is really good these days (use the correct emulator!)<br>Same for Saturn, stick to mednafen/beetle saturn and its near perfect.<br><br>Oh and none of this will work on potato hardware like the pi4, use a real pc for gen 5 emulation.", "time": 1674810453, "resto": 9606203}, {"no": 9606861, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:19:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9606852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9606852</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people comming to this specific board should know better</span><br>/vr/ is not much different than every other board these days in regards to the average anon actually knowing what they&#039;re talking about before deciding to speak.

Eventually he finds out that that means the other inhabitants might disappear, but from what one of the owl statues say I think it&#039;s also implied his real body is still underwater and he will drown if he chooses not to still leave.

Playing the same handful of games all the time would get boring.

As I mentioned in my other comment I have hundreds of games across various consoles and handhelds, but I also dabble with emulation a bit (I love my Retroid) and I have flash carts or ODE&#039;s for most of my systems. But the real thing is always a better experience. I would rather PLAY the game than spend most of my time adjusting emulator settings trying to get everything just right, and while flash carts are nice for whatever reason I&#039;m more likely to invest time into games that I actually own (I think it&#039;s a &quot;freedom of choice&quot; problem).

WW1 is more an outlier in heavier bayonet usage, due to being a massive industrially backed war where equipment and tactics hadn&#039;t caught up with a lot of new technology (mostly for some very stupid reasons, there was a lot which was telling of where things were going many years in advance).<br><s>For most of their history bayonets were used kind of seldom, to the point that there genuinely existed a sentiment in the later 1800s and in the 1900s that they were obsolete. With better options for intense close quarters combat coming around in WW1 and the interwar period, use goes back down to more normal levels, but it never disappears. Bayonet charges specifically occur sporadically in warfare, from the rest of the 20th century up to today, and they can be really helpful at times, even modern armies engage in them.

I think the question of whether The Adventure or III took place first was put off for a while until Konami started sharing the series timeline publicly, and they decided on III being first and I guess implied that Christopher took after Ralph/Trevor&#039;s middle name.", "filename": "ignore2ndtheorylol", "ext": ".png", "w": 1036, "h": 740, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1674831508077961, "time": 1674831508, "md5": "EDx4tQLCTDT2pqiODPtQJA==", "fsize": 826765, "resto": 9605642}, {"no": 9608903, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)21:14:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607395</a><br>That was Trevor&#039;s original name.

For some asinine reason, the Zero and Zero 2 localizers decided to rename all the boss enemies in other language settings to fit what they thought was Blaster Master canon, but all they did was look up unsourced wiki names and assume they must&#039;ve had it right. They can be traced to a fan-walkthrough by Dingo Jellybean. They renamed the returning frog boss because most people who played the game assumed it was the frog from the intro, even though the magazine and novelization suggest it&#039;s something else and the ending shows Fred unharmed. This also causes a translation issue with the Underworld Lord by Zero 3. <s>Jason by all accounts should&#039;ve known what its name was, but because they fucked up in Zero 1, localization halfasses it by claiming GOEZ is the Underworld Lord&#039;s name on planet Sophia, which makes -no- sense because the name was displayed by the namesake tank&#039;s -Sophian- records. So why did Jason get another name? Was it stuck on auto-translate? But that can&#039;t be, because as we all know, humanoids speak the same language in the future. Also, Eve was able to retrieve the actual name of the mutants in optional dialog (Invem), although it wasn&#039;t revealed yet to keep the Metafight aspect a surprise. Needless to say, Japanese text doesn&#039;t have this avoidable plothole.</s>", "filename": "SunSoftGameTimeNewsVol1No3Pgs2-3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1207, "h": 773, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1674751841795277, "time": 1674751841, "md5": "LUbiz578D5s0Ur5E/EorDA==", "fsize": 1125486, "resto": 9590631}, {"no": 9604792, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)12:11:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604748</a><br>God damn it&#039;s amazing that the games are still a mess even by Zero&#039;s time", "time": 1674753102, "resto": 9590631}, {"no": 9604798, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)12:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9590631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9590631</a><br>Master Blaster.", "filename": "MadMaxRoadWarrior", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 736, "h": 1157, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674753319977443, "time": 1674753319, "md5": "Yaf0AYMtxVnU7OrQB8HbQg==", "fsize": 110018, "resto": 9590631}, {"no": 9605162, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)15:13:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604748</a><br>They also fucked up by naming the planet Sophia instead of &quot;Sophia the 3rd&quot;, which would be a fine retcon if Metal Attacker&#039;s codename didn&#039;t still say that, so it makes no sense.", "time": 1674763985, "resto": 9590631}, {"no": 9605184, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)15:25:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9595247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9595247</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zero is a sequel, not a remake</span><br>That&#039;s debatable.", "time": 1674764704, "resto": 9590631}, {"no": 9605189, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)15:26:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596942</a><br>Cataracts.", "time": 1674764780, "resto": 9590631}, {"no": 9605191, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)15:27:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597714</a><br>Man this series has a pretty manly storyline.

Nudging is not something the general public does to machines. It&#039;s someone only very specific players do. And Nudging, shifting, or moving the machine *will* cause issues over time. They loosen screws, bolts, and wear out the machine connections at joints. It&#039;s a physical movement of the machine afterall. Maybe not cause issues right away, but it will over time. <br><br>I&#039;ve even seen instances where a player nudges too hard and can cause cracks in the glass. Do these people take responsibility? Nope. They just quietly walk away and leave the arcade without saying anything. Now the arcade owner has to pay to replace the glass. And the pinball is now out of service for days or weeks depending on how quickly they replace the glass. <br><br>Nudging (or any other &quot;pro&quot; pinball techniques) causes problems over time when a single player does it. Now imagine a pinball machine in a public arcade. It gets played dozens of times a day by many different players. More if it&#039;s popular location. It wears out the machine faster. Pins are just pieces of wood and metal after all. It&#039;s gonna break eventually if you keep stressing the connection points with movement. <br><br>You might be able to get away with it with newer machines but These older pinball machines aren&#039;t made anymore and sourcing replacement parts are difficult if something serious breaks.

All the FX2 did was support larger ROMs than the FX1, the FX1 otherwise performs the same as the FX2. Many people assumed the FX1 runs slower from trying to use Star Fox 1 as the doner cart, but the chip used in Star Fox 1 was slower variant called the Mario Chip. The ROM of Star Fox 2 is small enough to be fully addressable with the FX1. The most likely reason that Star Fox 2 was going to use a FX2 chip is that they were probably not producing the FX1 anymore, not that it needed it. Even if the FX2 cost more to make, having production of both FX1 and FX2 going on at the same time when any FX1 game would run the same on a FX2 would have cost more.<br><br>There are far less games that had a FX2 in them, and even less that had battery SRAM. About your only option outside of Tealand is Doom and Yoshi&#039;s Island, both rare and expensive.<br><br>Meanwhile the Dirt Trax FX and Stunt Race FX games can be had for $10-15 at times and there were tons of those. Yeah, it does suck to have to cannabalize older SNES games to make one of these, but there is no real way to create your own from scratch due to it being an FX game. No homebrew way to create your own FX chip. I mean, it can probably be implemented with a FPGA but I have zero clue how powerful (and thus expensive) an FPGA one would need. I tried to lookup the hardware in the FXPak but all I could find was that a prototype from 2011 used a Spartan 3 FPGA, no idea if the current carts also use that.

For example most car guys know what&#039;s going on under their hood. If something happens to their dream car then they can usually pop the hood, investigate and figure out what the problem is, and repair it themselves. And if they don&#039;t know how then they&#039;ll reach out to people who do know how and ask for advice, learn how to fix it, and then get it done. But then when it comes to games, it seems that most gamers just play games and don&#039;t know anything about what&#039;s going on so when a problem arises they&#039;re shit out of luck. They don&#039;t know anything about the hardware so they just repeat whatever they heard in YouTube videos, which are made by people who also don&#039;t know about the hardware. All it takes is one Metal Jesus to say something stupid and everyone who watches them and also doesn&#039;t understand the hardware will repeat it forever because they trust the channel they watch much like boomers trust their favorite entertainment news channel.<br><br>In the coming years, more and more consoles will become in need of basic maintenance, and as that happens more and more casuals will probably turn to emulation because they&#039;re too scared to learn how to change a battery or a capacitor. My hope is that as a result of this, more and more retro gamers who play on physical hardware will become more like car guys and actually know what&#039;s going on under the hood. You don&#039;t have to be an expert, but you should be capable of basic repairs and upkeep and currently most people aren&#039;t.

I know PS2&#039;s are super common so it&#039;s not really a big deal, but imagine if someone threw away something less common like a Virtual Boy or something because they&#039;re incapable of spending 5 minutes doing research.", "time": 1674790488, "resto": 9605516}, {"no": 9606409, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:28:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605516</a><br>dude, its a meme", "time": 1674793730, "resto": 9605516}, {"no": 9606638, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)01:57:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9606409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9606409</a><br>It&#039;s a meme but a lot of people genuinely believe it.", "time": 1674802647, "resto": 9605516}, {"no": 9607574, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)11:30:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9606256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9606256</a><br>They learned but it&#039;s still a lot of effort just to place baby&#039;s first rpg", "time": 1674837012, "resto": 9605516}, {"no": 9607584, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)11:33:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605639</a><br>Audiophiles are even bigger retards than retro game collectors", "time": 1674837228, "resto": 9605516}, {"no": 9607921, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:09:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605516</a><br>your feat should be not your CD collection lasting but how you will buy a replacement CD player in 20 years.", "time": 1674846571, "resto": 9605516}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9607394, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)09:58:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Well, I *was* having a good time.", "filename": "nightshade stage 6", "ext": ".png", "w": 874, "h": 645, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 184, "tim": 1674831503710375, "time": 1674831503, "md5": "dBYORmqvclpdtss0VoombA==", "fsize": 888246, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "well-i-was-having-a-good-time", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 9607529, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)11:04:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607394</a><br>Goddamn these games are so cool but 2 hard 4 me.", "time": 1674835479, "resto": 9607394}, {"no": 9607920, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:09:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607394</a><br>Just play NG Black bro", "time": 1674846548, "resto": 9607394}]}]
