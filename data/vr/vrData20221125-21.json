The difficulty is solid, but it never becomes too hard if you properly utilize the different turtles and sub weapons you can find through exploration. Managing the health of the turtles not only requires you to make risk reward determinations in regards to the best turtle to use in a given situation, but requires you to take note of the pizza locations you have found, and also making determinations on which turtle to give certain subweapons you come across. Much can be said for the imbalance of power in the turtles, Donny being the best, followed by Leo, and then Raph/Mikey. However, this ends up making an interesting psychological impact. This may make someone want to only use Donny and give him the best subweapons, but if you risk always using Donny in overwhelming/quick death situations, you may end up killing Donny and finding yourself only having lackluster turtles for the rest of the level. Similarly, this power imbalance may make an individual want to give the weaker turtles the best subweapons so that all the turtles have strong utility, and losing one turtle never ends up being the end of a run. However, over utilizing the weaker turtles in dangerous situations may end up with you only having Donny for the rest of the round. There are a lot of micro decisions for you to make that impact how you approach the rest of the level/game, and it is these meaningful choices that make this title an extremely interesting Action-Platformer.", "filename": "Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(1989_video_game)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 265, "h": 362, "tn_w": 183, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669343231390083, "time": 1669343231, "md5": "APQw+nVrm7mh1AYQli4VFA==", "fsize": 69126, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "have-you-played-any-tmnt-games-for-the-nes", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 22, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 17, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 9443250, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)15:25:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9441574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9441574</a><br>TMNT was one of the most difficult NES games I owned as a kid.

But if you want to experience the original Famicom version there are some translation patches floating around. The 3D remake fleshes out the Onion Kids a little and makes them their own characters to an extent.

More exciting jumps, better use of momentum physics, more interesting level designs. Spyro 2/3 diluted the core gameplay until there was almost nothing left but basic platforms that served little but to be a vehicle for questgivers. That&#039;s why Insomniac ran into a wall. They went the wrong direction for expanding the gameplay, adding in a bunch of minigames and gimmicks instead of focusing on the core gameplay. When they ran out of gimmicks to add, they stopped working on Spyro. Ratchet and Clank suffers this issue a little bit as well, though the shooting mechanics help take your mind off of it.
