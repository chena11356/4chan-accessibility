Even Silent Hill, its greatest rip-off, is absolutely nothing like Resident Evil. It has virtually no item management, and ammo is not scarce at all. Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist.

SH3 both tries to tell a deeper narrative happening around the protagonist and those around her but also have her experience her own personal journey, it&#039;s a very ambitious narrative that, overall, I would say works out well but doesn&#039;t feel quite as cohesive as the prior two entries.

If you&#039;re a guy I feel like it&#039;s likely you just kind of don&#039;t think about things like the game&#039;s various menstrual imagery, though some things like the hole leading to the final boss are hard to miss.<br><br>I always have a hard time deciding between SH1 and SH3 as my personal favorite. SH3 has a lot going for it with the most refined gameplay and graphics of the series, but it&#039;s also the most obviously compromised of the first three games. The game has essentially no exploration outside of the dungeons and a handful of &quot;grab thing, walk a room over, use thing&quot; moments. It&#039;s a great game on its own merits, but how it compares to prior entries and their strengths gives a lot of differing thoughts. I would say that, as simply a &quot;video game&quot;, that SH3 is the best, as to be expected being the newest, but it&#039;s clear pure gameplay is not why people love horror games.", "filename": "Ffn6nbWVQAAigcN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670955746219477, "time": 1670955746, "md5": "PMYuoi9u29tzPP5ZgPM7Cg==", "fsize": 63545, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488604, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Allow me to put this retarded discussion to rest.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 wikipedia is wrong </span><br>Okay school teacher.", "filename": "1649719663676", "ext": ".png", "w": 552, "h": 32, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 7, "tim": 1670955848062248, "time": 1670955848, "md5": "SWb5cKYBsciKWJJ4uj/yWQ==", "fsize": 5896, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488609, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488604</a><br>I know you must be genuinely retarded but yes, that is why wikipedia is generally agreed to be a fucking non source for anything unless wikipedia directly links to the actual source, literally fucking anyone can write in it and unless someone decides that what was written was wrong (and the cucks in charge agree with the changes) then that is the information present <br><br>fuck off literal NPC", "time": 1670956080, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488610, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *actual*, real thing that separates a &quot;survival horror&quot; game from something else is the true permanence of consequence</span><br>That has literally nothing to do with survival horror.

If I can add my two cents, SH 2 had the best story of the 3 games in my opinion, but only because the personal and &quot;simple&quot; nature of it all really suited the gameplay of Silent Hill. As in, minimal cutscenes and exposition dumps and long stretches of just pure gameplay. <br><br>However, Heather is my one of my favorite protagonists ever and I still really enjoyed SH3. <a href=\"#p9482770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482770</a><br><a href=\"#p9482789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482789</a><br><a href=\"#p9482861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482861</a><br>If I could add, I&#039;d say the biggest issue SH3 had was the pacing.

You get one minor moment with Vincent in the office, and then that&#039;s it until the apartments. And by that point? <s>You basically hit the halfway mark of the game, you get the big reveal immediately, and then everything kicks into overdrive as you finally get to Silent Hill itself</s>.

Most of what can&#039;t will fit on a larger capacity CD, which are easily obtainable by any adult with an IQ&gt;70. There are not so shitty scene releases that compress content using more efficnet systems than the original and have negligible loss in quality.

But the game has some slowdowns. Check the overclock mod if you care about more performance.<br>- The fan is NOISY, if you care about noise check the noctua fan mod. <br>- Lightgun games, if you have CRT TV go for it, LCD lightgun mods are expensive.<br>- Fighting games, worth playing, look and sound great, go for it unless you want to use an arcade stick. <br>- Resident Evil, Skies of Arcadia, Jet Set Radio, worth it. <br>- Soul Reaver has better models and effects that the PC version, worth it. <br>- Tony Hawk 2 runs at 30fps. Xbox has better textures and it&#039;s a different game (2X), better version, but dreamcast has the &quot;proper classic&quot; version. <br>- Rayman 2 worth it because it&#039;s closer to the &quot;classic&quot; version. <br>- The 480p picture quality makes this console a MUST. It&#039;s amazing to play 90s games in this resolution. <br>- DCHDMI isn&#039;t worth it.

Basically the analog stick started dropping inputs, so for example if you were running forward as Link in OoT he would stop and start - essentially unusable. Both had the exact same problem. <br>Unfortunately they both had fallen just outside the warranty window, and their support didn&#039;t even reply when I sent them like a &quot;Hey, anything I can try to do to fix these?&quot; <br>About a year later someone on twitter was asking about them, and I outlined that whole chain of events to them and said that I don&#039;t recommend them at all. From that tweet, their PR/customer support team reached out to me and ultimately actually shipped me two of the newer wireless versions by way of apology. And the wireless one has held up a lot better than the originals. At least, so far. <br>So maybe the takeaway is, they used to be utter crap, and now are (hopefully) a lot better. The analog stick on all of these these is just kind of weird though. <br><br>In the interim I used the wired Retro-Bit Tribute64 (which is modeled after the famous Hori N64 controller) and I actually liked this a lot better than any of the Brawler64s. The only problem with these is that the connector has an absolute death grip on the controller port, which is why I switched back to the wireless Brawler64 for right now - since I didn&#039;t want to be unplugging and replugging that controller all the time, and wireless controllers just keep things a bit more tidy. You know how it is. <br><br>There is an N64 controller purist on this board who will tell you that the analog stick sensitivity and deadzones of any of these 3rd party controllers is crap compared to the original - he&#039;s got charts and whatnot to back it up. He&#039;s probably right, but it&#039;s never really bothered me and or caused any real problems.<br><br>Of these I&#039;d recommend the Tribute64 first.", "time": 1670950508, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488501, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:34:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>i would FUCK lenore<br><a href=\"#p9487536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487536</a><br>yes", "time": 1670952875, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488537, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>What the fuck is that worm-like thing on top of the TV?", "time": 1670954061, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488540, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_2933", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3120, "h": 2080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1670954081568968, "time": 1670954081, "md5": "MQ5LotAcZ3SlN+b/piGZ6Q==", "fsize": 965843, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488542, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488456</a><br>Thats a bit annoying i hate wireless stuff but if those are better maybe they made changes in the wired also?

Going from being the King&#039;s Field and AC devs to then hitting there stride with the Souls formula and getting themselves out of that perception of being a lower tier company. I guess filling in that mecha niche helped them to be carried as you put it. Just think of all those other companies that were in their shoes at one point. Most didn&#039;t make it to today. They either got bought out and completely gutted until they were a soulless in name only company or they just were outright made defunct. Lets take EA for example, you got Bioware which was actually honestly at the time of EA&#039;s acqusition a much bigger and more known company than From. People loved Bioware even prior to EA.

If you like what you&#039;re playing but want something a little bit more substantial, DQ9 on the DS is kind of like the Bravely Default to DQ3&#039;s Final Fantasy V.

The devs designed Star Fox around its awful framerate. In order to make Star Fox look right at 60fps, the game would have to be modified to match the timing of the new framerate.

It&#039;s been known since forever ago that Woolsey didn&#039;t deliver the most faithful translation, not to mention all the censorship, which is why we got that old Sky Render fan translation over twenty years ago (that we now know to be amateurish as fuck). Then the GBA game came out, and its translation was recognized to be much more accurate, but it had two problems: first, by that point, Woolsey&#039;s script had obtained meme status, and while the GBA script kept some of his lines, it changed or tossed enough of them out to piss a vocal part of the fanbase off. Second, the GBA version had problems of its own, namely shit music, slowdown and lower resolution, among others. So now you have a bunch of Woolsey fanboys who like the idea of a more accurate script while still staying true to the Woolsey &quot;flavor&quot;, all on the mostly superior SNES version, and before long, we got the Ted Woolsey Uncensored hack. Problem is, its creator didn&#039;t know a lick of moon, so all he did was mix and match bits and pieces of the Woolsey, GBA and Sky Render scripts as he pleased, and to top it off, he decided to also make it an overarching &quot;game improvement&quot; hack that fixed a gorillion longstanding bugs and added QoL changes. This effectively set the mold for all like-minded hacks that followed, all of which were made by people with no nip-speaking credentials, and all of which were convinced they could do it better than the last, especially given they&#039;re not constrained to just script changes, but outright game changes as well, so every new release is just feature creep.

Play the Japanese version for a richer soundtrack, slightly better graphical effects, and a more tough-but-fair challenge as originally intended.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Super Castlevania 4 (SNES)</span><br>Surprisingly underrated these days, my personal favorite Classicvania. The graphics and sound are awesome and the gameplay is fun as hell, with more streamlined controls. It is easier than usual for Castlevania which makes it more approachable to just sit back and play, but if you love the hardcore challenge of previous Castlevania games you may be disappointed.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Castlevania: Rondo of Blood (TG-CD)</span><br>The fan favorite Classicvania. Whereas SC4 went full on with the Halloween horror aesthetic, this one goes full early-90s anime and it&#039;s a really fun vibe. It&#039;s on a CD so it&#039;s got voice acted cutscenes and CD quality music. The controls are more stiff than SC4, and the challenge is cranked back up, but it still feels a little more fair than the NES games. Alternate routes are back and you can unlock a second character.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Castlevania Chronicles (X68000, PS1)</span><br>Okay reimagining of the first game. The difficulty here is retardedly high, and it&#039;s just the worst 16-bit Castlevania by far. The PS1 version adds an &quot;&quot;&quot;easy&quot;&quot;&quot; mode but the music for that mode is really goofy remixes.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Castlevania Bloodlines (Genesis)</span><br>This one&#039;s pretty fun, and it&#039;s on Genesis so it feels a little more &quot;hardcore&quot;.

I think the original games had better music and a handful of better lines of dialogue, but FRLG was pretty great otherwise. I like held items, natures and all the other gen 3 junk and honestly like being able to play Red or Green with that stuff thrown in. I liked the way the Pokedex was presented and how the game gives you a little recap of what you last did whenever you load a save.

I&#039;m playing it now and I have to say that I completely disagree.<br>The controls are super sluggish, especially whenever you&#039;re in the air. In the first game you slowed down when jumping, but it still felt pretty satisfying; in Metroid 2 it&#039;s way too slow. Specifically, there&#039;s a big problem with how long you can hold the A button to jump. In Metroid 1, whenever you release the button, you immediately stop rising and begin falling. In Metroid 2, however, after a certain point, it becomes impossible to cancel out your jump, so even if you let go of the button, Samus will continue to rise, and this feels really shitty. If you&#039;ve played the game you&#039;ll know what I mean.<br>The screen is way too zoomed in and it&#039;s retarded that there&#039;s no automap. In Metroid 1 they advised you to make your own map, and that&#039;s what I did, but such a recommendation is not repeated in Metroid 2&#039;s manual, and making your own map would fucking suck because of how zoomed in the screen is. So I&#039;ve spent ages going over the same little bit of area with the shitty sluggish controls and ear rape music (trying to be suspenseful and atmospheric on the Gameboy was an ambitious concept but it falls flat on its face, it&#039;s just a bunch of irritating beeping) and can&#039;t find the gay fucking Metroid. I&#039;ve got 18 left so I&#039;m not even halfway through this bitch.<br>So the first game was definitely better.

If you can do that youre only 1-2 attempts from beating the game. I find your philosophy on save states for practice interesting. Giving youself the freedom to break a challenge into rehersable chunks instead of a blind gaunlet really only has one difference in that it takes less time to master. The end result once you do the full run is the same so i&#039;d argue that its fine. If you can play a games sequel before the original or come into a shmup with knowledge of others is that not the same in practice?

Try it, it will make a huge difference. Melee enemies that get close because itll either oneshot them or knock them back giving you room for a charge shot. They have very basic patterns to play around once you know how they work. Boss of stage 1 is a bit of a pain if you dont know the patterns and some require you get into position before the attack comes out. If the turret is spinning one way try to be one the end of that rotation so you have enough time to read the pattern before youre expected to dodge. Shifting levels and ducking is effective.

It has cool scaling and is one of the better looking games for the add-on. The animation is original, and made for the game. Even if it is a bit grainy. They don&#039;t use any licensed music, for whatever reason, so its all original composition. I think it&#039;s good. Cool looking arcade style shooter. It was like a sequel to Batman Returns driving sections. Batman returns for the Sega CD is a port of the Genesis game, but contains a CD soundtrack, these scaling driving sections ad some cutscenes using the scaling hardware. The driving sections in Batman Returns could be played on their own. I honestly think it is harder than the Genesis game overall.

Pattern recognition is a form of puzzle solving, where the player is rewarded for how quickly they can recognize and adapt to a challenge with an equal amount of skill execution thrown on top. The appeal of a single player action game is that once you&#039;ve passed a skill check you move onto the next one in increasing levels of difficulty and complexity. Pvp and multiplayer in general is great for creating dynamic and evolving scenarios but it also doesnt give the player and clear linear progression of their skills or promise any variety to foster it. Theres a reason at uni I mostly made couch multiplayer games. It was a cheap shorthand to getting emergent play out of a few design elements. Put a character controller in a room with a ball they have to roll into a basket? Boring. Put two character controllers in a room with baskets for each of them? Watch the strategies emerge, add a few rock paper scissors elements and boom. good grades. As a player you feel more intelligent but as a designer you come to appreciate how brilliant a well designed single player game is.

It was latter half of thunderforce iv. I prefer games give me a decent level of power by default but give me more power through skilled play which requires that i maintain that skill to keep the power from decaying in some way. I see a lot of shmups where the skill needed actually declines to more powerful you become. The scrolling sections become pushovers and the only threats being anything that can live to get a shot off and the bosses that can tank the damage. Its easy to develop bad habits when you spend most of a stage not seeing a single attack pattern. When a threat comes around that does challenge your damage output losing that output is a death sentence when you have so little familiarity with the stage. I think its more a case of power being to static 100-0 than a smooth gradient that causes the issue.

My last name is Belmont and my favorite holiday is Halloween. I used to be better at NES/GB Castlevania than all of my friends put together, so my circle growing up thought I had to love every Castlevania and nicknamed me Simon. Then Super Castlevania IV came out and I was like &quot;wtf is this&quot; because now suddenly everyone else could play a Castlevania game better than me and meanwhile I was like &quot;why isn&#039;t the music pumping me up, what&#039;s the use for sub-weapons, why&#039;s everything zoomed in, etc.&quot; They said I didn&#039;t get it and started calling me &quot;Bi-man Ball-nonce,&quot; which caught on at school and even my homeroom teacher accidentally said it at one point which made things far worse. My girlfriend (now fiancee) Maria happens to look like Maria Renard but thankfully had a more pleasant experience over it, thank christ she gets most of her gaming opinions from video essays. In fact, we have a longterm plan to deal with you Super Castlevania IV nutjobs once and for all. After we get married, I am going to fuck my wife. A helluva lot. We are going to have so much unprotected sex in so many ways you wouldn&#039;t believe. I&#039;m going to creampie her tightass pussy so many times she&#039;ll give me dozens of kids. Then, we are going to specifically indoctrinate each and every them into loving every Castlevania game except Super Castlevania IV. A fire of seething hatred will light in their eyes every time my numerous progeny even think of Super Castlevania IV. Then, I will encourage them to get &#039;their&#039; opinions out there by becoming essayists, reviewers, telling their friends, etc. They will spread and eventually multiply. Soon enough, popular opinion will turn completely and utterly against Super Castlevania IV. While you lot laments at how zoomies just don&#039;t get it, I will have weaponized them to my own ends. In the end, I will have the last laugh. I will win. You will lose.
