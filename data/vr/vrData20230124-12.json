All the FX2 did was support larger ROMs than the FX1, the FX1 otherwise performs the same as the FX2. Many people assumed the FX1 runs slower from trying to use Star Fox 1 as the doner cart, but the chip used in Star Fox 1 was slower variant called the Mario Chip. The ROM of Star Fox 2 is small enough to be fully addressable with the FX1. The most likely reason that Star Fox 2 was going to use a FX2 chip is that they were probably not producing the FX1 anymore, not that it needed it. Even if the FX2 cost more to make, having production of both FX1 and FX2 going on at the same time when any FX1 game would run the same on a FX2 would have cost more.<br><br>There are far less games that had a FX2 in them, and even less that had battery SRAM. About your only option outside of Tealand is Doom and Yoshi&#039;s Island, both rare and expensive.<br><br>Meanwhile the Dirt Trax FX and Stunt Race FX games can be had for $10-15 at times and there were tons of those. Yeah, it does suck to have to cannabalize older SNES games to make one of these, but there is no real way to create your own from scratch due to it being an FX game. No homebrew way to create your own FX chip. I mean, it can probably be implemented with a FPGA but I have zero clue how powerful (and thus expensive) an FPGA one would need. I tried to lookup the hardware in the FXPak but all I could find was that a prototype from 2011 used a Spartan 3 FPGA, no idea if the current carts also use that. Depending on the version they go from $18 to $120, most seem to be $18-40.<br><br>As for making it, many have made such a repro in the past.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it. Also, some DS games could have some form of interaction with prior GBA titles if two relevant ones were inserted, typically bonuses in a DS sequel to a GBA game.", "time": 1674085495, "resto": 9571779}, {"no": 9583639, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:32:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9582349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9582349</a><br>There&#039;s too much shit to keep up with as is.

This has been mislabeled for decades, confusing people to no end. Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white.

In 2001 we got ports of Neversoft&#039;s original, though they were almost identical, besides making 100% completion a lot easier, since the Quick-Change suit, which used to require 10.000 points to unlock on the Zip-Line training, now required 7.500, still difficult, but much more possible. 2001 also gave us a sequel to Neversoft&#039;s original, this time by Vicarious Visions, called Enter Electro, only on PS1.<br><br>Activision wasn&#039;t satisfied with all of that, and got both Torus Games and Vicarious Visions, which was already working on Enter Electro, pump out a couple of portable titles, one for Game Boy Color and another on Game Boy Advance. Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six was a sequel for the original Game Boy Color port of Neversoft&#039;s original, and it got rid of the more open style in favor of traditional levels. Mysterio&#039;s Menace is the one I wonder the most about though, it can be seen as a sort of Spider-Man 3... but is it a sequel to The Sinister Six or Enter Electro? It&#039;s portable, but everything it it looks like PS1 assets.", "filename": "21161-spider-man-mysterio-s-menace-game-boy-advance-front-cover", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 795, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 248, "tim": 1674489516304867, "time": 1674489516, "md5": "ZH4c5SJEAEJ/SaYbfToYFA==", "fsize": 183323, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "spiderman-mysterios-menace", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 15, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 9595757, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)11:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9595717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9595717</a><br>I didn&#039;t read your post OP sorry<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQc<wbr>VFtie6Zk&amp;list=PLO4jlmGoc6uA_jQnwMG6<wbr>Sh2J5O6MZxdRU&amp;index=16&amp;ab_channel=R<wbr>ingsOfGeonosis", "time": 1674490340, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9595772, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)11:15:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9595757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9595757</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I didn&#039;t read your post OP sorry</span><br>No need to apologize, anon!

I&#039;ve decided that I&#039;ll beat it, just to complete this series whole, but I&#039;ve got to say that to me this is the least enjoyable installment. I don&#039;t mind the idea of interconnected areas and a pseudo MetroidVania style, but the execution was not ideal at all, for quite a few reasons unfortunately:<br><br>1. All areas are nicely condensed and fun to explore except for a single one, the Sewers, which just happen to be where you&#039;ll spend most of your time by far, and with no map at all.<br>2. Flying enemies are the worst to fight against, as Spider-Man&#039;s not well equipped to deal with them, so they take a lot of health away, especially the bats... in the Sewers, of course.<br>3. Control isn&#039;t responsive, it takes a second for Spider-Man to respond, and not only that, he keeps too much momentum while on the ground, but his jumping barely goes forward.<br><br>I kept playing, giving up, picking it up again, then giving up... until I got sick of it and decided that either I went after a guide or I&#039;d give up on this for good, so I swallowed my pride and used a guide. I feel that the experience is much better now, especially with a map of the Sewers, getting all of the hidden upgrades and taking the best routes so bats don&#039;t take away all of your health is ideal too, and almost kind of fun... but overall I can&#039;t help but feel that they dropped the ball on this one, both The Sinister Six and Mysterio&#039;s Menace were huge improvements.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spider-Man most dangerous enemies are bats and seagulls for some reason</span>", "filename": "1656370330300", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 315, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1674517000459049, "time": 1674517000, "md5": "/89rTA0ntqNkwPS35lwlAw==", "fsize": 148080, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597368, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596867</a><br>Well, just a little update, I&#039;ve managed to beat it, though I&#039;m not sure if it was a 100% run or not... I&#039;ve found 2 guides, one from IGN back in the day, and another by Legomondo, I found both to be excellent, but regarding the Defense Upgrade, which are items you find in levels to upgrade your defense to a maximum of 6, there&#039;s something odd. Legomondo&#039;s guide mentions that Doc Ock&#039;s Lab has a Defense Upgrade, but you can level up both your attack and defense to 4 through XP, and then there are 2 Attack Upgrades you can find, which I did, but for defense it mentions a 3rd one in the last level, even though I had already found 2 by then and it doesn&#039;t make much sense to reach level 7 even though there isn&#039;t even a slot for it, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a mistake in the guide or not, but anyways I went into the last bosses completely leveled up in all fronts, so I suppose it counts as a 100% completion, though I&#039;m not sure due to the guide.<br><br>Anyways, leaving my 100% completion OCD aside, I want to talk about this installment, a GBC port for one of my favorite video games of all time, which is the PS1 original by Neversoft, of course I didn&#039;t expect them to make something as good as that, but I was frustrated by my experience. I&#039;ve mentioned how cryptic the Sewers are, and how you spend a lot of time lost there and getting swarmed by bats, flying enemies in general feel quite cheap. I still dislike how Spider-Man controls aswell, his jumping and momentum to be more specific, this should be one of the most agile characters in fiction, but he sure doesn&#039;t feel like that here. A lot of the concepts just aren&#039;t fleshed out enough, like how you pretty much have to grind for XP so you can fully level up Spider-Man... grinding, in a Spider-Man video game, doesn&#039;t feel right... also, if they wanted to make a MetroidVania, which I&#039;m down for, they could&#039;ve at least given players a map...<br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "1639702839705", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 858, "h": 858, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674528526223632, "time": 1674528526, "md5": "bD4XImdxFxHFgWOLFTgp2w==", "fsize": 141475, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597389, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597368</a><br>I know it all sounds quite negative so far, but it&#039;s not all bad though, far from it. One thing that I must stress though... if you&#039;re going to play this, do yourself a favor and use a guide, or else you&#039;ll probably want to quit as soon as you go to the Sewers for the 1st time, not knowing where to go because everything looks the same, getting attacked from all directions, with tons of bats swarming you and taking away all of your health as you try to find upgrades and fail because they&#039;re all hidden in the most cryptic manner possible... it takes a nosedive in quality here so a guide is a must, at least to me. Anyways, I was going to talk about what I liked... and there was lots of it, there&#039;s a reason I tried so hard to keep up when I could&#039;ve just given up, there are lots of qualities here. Well, the 1st thing you&#039;ll notice is how it looks and sounds, not only are all sprites and environments well detailed for GBC standards, we&#039;ve also got some quality tunes and SFX in the OST... and the best part to me is its atmosphere, it&#039;s dark, grim, but not edgy and overdone, it feels appropriate for the story told, which is also a good time really.<br><br>We have a password system that works well, as intended, and has an atmospheric and moody password screen too which I love... and while I think they messed up a lot of what they went for with this MetroidVania lite style, mostly in execution, some of it does work, when you know how to get all of the upgrades and power Spider-Man up, also some grinding to fully level him up, you feel the difference from early on, how you take enemies down quicker and with ease, when they used to give you trouble. Overall, it can be fun with a guide, combat is satisfying, at least apart from enemies constantly respawning, some level design is good, and atmosphere is perfect... but it can be a frustrating experience, especially for the reasons mentioned earlier here, still, I don&#039;t regret my time with it, and I&#039;m glad I played it.<br><br>(2/2)", "filename": "1656807225603", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 851, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674529168872681, "time": 1674529168, "md5": "7wCEFw7//O6GAfe0DlzXfQ==", "fsize": 82489, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597847, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)01:04:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;im already at full health!</span>", "filename": "Spiderman-PSX", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 423, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674540258432539, "time": 1674540258, "md5": "IV2hDwAzjJW8WZ12oXSpSQ==", "fsize": 45191, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597857, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)01:10:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How do I shot web?", "time": 1674540603, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597868, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)01:16:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597857</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do I shot web?</span><br>Well, it depends, which Spider-Man video game are you currently playing?", "filename": "1491173159741", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1261, "h": 842, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674541008984625, "time": 1674541008, "md5": "h15KIOnVSQrU0pQzjz/tSg==", "fsize": 107537, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597870, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)01:17:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597847</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SURF THE WEB</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SURF THE WEB</span>", "filename": "tumblr_ov0gpwsOAs1urj8f7o1_1280", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 853, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674541071711968, "time": 1674541071, "md5": "2YP6Sytc02Xd1OdUtaLG0A==", "fsize": 599979, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597871, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)01:19:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597857</a>", "filename": "insane-headbang[1]", "ext": ".gif", "w": 200, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674541164096848, "time": 1674541164, "md5": "9KAVjmIJfNdlg8504c4Qcg==", "fsize": 8766, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9598334, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:29:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "REAL CHAD&#039;S SPIDEY GAME CUMMIN THRU", "filename": "th-3391309001", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 469, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1674559775582978, "time": 1674559775, "md5": "UhhcwdcOYWyrlHADFQ4YhA==", "fsize": 67058, "resto": 9595717}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9598330, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:27:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;game freezes so much it&#039;s practically unplayable</span><br>how did they fuck this up", "filename": "BloodRayne-986216608", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 281, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674559659119742, "time": 1674559659, "md5": "RZp+xVQBNm1eUgwu6Jn2VA==", "fsize": 69941, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "game-freezes-so-much-its-practically-unplayable", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9596397, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:24:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What studios do you consider on retro Nintendo&#039;s level in terms of quality and quantity of output?", "filename": "605d6db2c611c6bf6463941b2c149371", "ext": ".png", "w": 588, "h": 834, "tn_w": 176, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674505444522626, "time": 1674505444, "md5": "qaxA+IHSeEhEouw8CINnaQ==", "fsize": 194530, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-studios-do-you-consider-on-retro-nintendos", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 22, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 20}, {"no": 9596398, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:25:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596397</a><br>Prime Capcom had similar consistency", "time": 1674505528, "resto": 9596397}, {"no": 9596401, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:25:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Capcom", "time": 1674505528, "resto": 9596397}, {"no": 9596403, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:26:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596398</a><br><a href=\"#p9596401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596401</a><br>Not bad", "filename": "Konachan.com -

However it would at least have made things easier for the devs to explain or even just fans themselves to understand the conclusions. <br><br>With how the story is not though I do agree with what you guys say.

Then some of the ass pulls he does in regards to his magnificent prowess (kek sorry I just had to) would make more sense or be justified from a fan perspective. He&#039;s just anime badass supreme over here really. And due to the fandom at this point he seems to be the true star of the entirety of FFVII at this point with his coolness factor which detracts a bit imo from how great everything else about the game was. I don&#039;t like what they did with FFVII compilation stuff really. I get the feeling the remake trilogy or whatever may even make him become a misunderstood hero. He&#039;s too liked by fanboys.

Nudging is not something the general public does to machines. It&#039;s someone only very specific players do. And Nudging, shifting, or moving the machine *will* cause issues over time. They loosen screws, bolts, and wear out the machine connections at joints. It&#039;s a physical movement of the machine afterall. Maybe not cause issues right away, but it will over time. <br><br>I&#039;ve even seen instances where a player nudges too hard and can cause cracks in the glass. Do these people take responsibility? Nope. They just quietly walk away and leave the arcade without saying anything. Now the arcade owner has to pay to replace the glass. And the pinball is now out of service for days or weeks depending on how quickly they replace the glass. <br><br>Nudging (or any other &quot;pro&quot; pinball techniques) causes problems over time when a single player does it. Now imagine a pinball machine in a public arcade. It gets played dozens of times a day by many different players. More if it&#039;s popular location. It wears out the machine faster. Pins are just pieces of wood and metal after all. It&#039;s gonna break eventually if you keep stressing the connection points with movement. <br><br>You might be able to get away with it with newer machines but These older pinball machines aren&#039;t made anymore and sourcing replacement parts are difficult if something serious breaks.

You can look at tournament rules for most places and there usually is defined &quot;what you cant do&quot; that is present when you enter tournaments such as picking up the machine.

They feature weaknesses that are hard to guess and hard to tell when you\u2019re doing it right versus wrong. For instance, phantoon does his special attack when you super missile him. A new player unfamiliar with his patterns will have a tough time linking that attack to a super missile hitting him and as such will probably stumble through the fight. The worst offender is draygon with the grapple zapple. If you don\u2019t use the grapple against it the fight is really really hard for a new player. Finally, Ridley is practically immune to missiles, taking 180 to die from them as opposed to 20 charge shots, making him not only wall players using regular boss strategies (use missiles and supers) but also doesn\u2019t give any indication that charge shots are doing more (other than noticing the faster color change on him). These bosses seem like an area where the game fails to communicate to the player, unlike the entire rest of the game, which is filled with thoughtful touches. <br><br>Thoughts?", "time": 1674452578, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9594943, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)00:57:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9594635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9594635</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;samefagging 47 minutes later</span><br>lol sure<br>perhaps...your opinion isn&#039;t very popular", "time": 1674453438, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9595360, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;underrated</span><br>what the fuck is wrong with you<br>what do you think that word means?<br><br>seriously what the fuck do you think it means<br>&quot;underrated&quot;<br>jesus christ", "time": 1674473606, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9595525, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:51:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is Super Metroid still fairly underrated?</span><br>Since the franchise itself still is and Super Metroid has never even sold 3 million + copies to my knowledge I would say yeah its way too underrated.

I basically ignored it except for being a less weird looking and slightly less cheap feeling second controller than the one with a Saturn style d-pad we had and thought it was weird until I somehow realized you could press the analog button and use it to trail brake in Gran Turismo without eating shit, and thankfully that usage ignores how bad the d-pad and face buttons were. (must have mashed on it in something enough the square button is really bad though, maybe Smackdown) Felt like a privilege to be able to use a DualShock 2 for PS1 games after we got a PS2.", "time": 1674352384, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591635, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:04:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591471</a><br>Which one?", "time": 1674353049, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591637, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:05:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591497</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he wants the D</span><br>Faggot", "time": 1674353110, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591640, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:06:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591637</a><br>I don&#039;t want the D, I have the D", "time": 1674353176, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591658, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:12:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591640</a><br>No, you pick the D", "time": 1674353546, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591913, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:34:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591470</a><br>Get on my level, normalfag.", "filename": "410AA2JRWBL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 386, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1674362062970980, "time": 1674362062, "md5": "tmPEvj0VT0TN8n3SZSLwcA==", "fsize": 24921, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591918, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:38:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591635</a><br>Ape Escape", "time": 1674362295, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591923, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:39:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591918</a><br>Ape Escape only works with the DS, doesn&#039;t work with the analogue", "time": 1674362391, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591924, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:40:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dual Analogs are cool but the design of the analog stick housing is really bad.</span><br><br>Remember this was on a console that had self destructing CD drives.<br>The try holding the optical pickup bar was plastic, and next to the power supply, so the heat coming from it deformed the plastic and made the optical pickup be lower than it should be.

I know it&#039;s a matter of taste, and if you don&#039;t enjoy something I do then that&#039;s fine really, but I can&#039;t help but feel that a lot of people don&#039;t give Sonic a fair enough shot and end up missing out on experiences they might&#039;ve loved otherwise. When it comes to Sonic, the reason you run into things and get hit is because, well, you&#039;re going fast and, depending on how quick your reflexes are, you might not be able to react to things in time, it&#039;s something that varies from player to player and that&#039;s fine, but I can see why some would go through this and assume that it&#039;s all memorization...<br><br>Still, all video games require us to memorize sections we&#039;re having trouble with, and we&#039;re not supposed to be good at a video game as soon as we pick it up, it&#039;d be shallow otherwise, if you could just run and win, then no one would&#039;ve cared about Sonic, it&#039;s a franchise that rewards you for sticking around. One more thing that can help, is that Sonic&#039;s vulnerable when he&#039;s just running, but not when he&#039;s jumping... or rolling into a ball, always make sure to press down in slopes, not only do you gain speed, but you also protect yourself. Also, if you prefer something like Mario, then I can&#039;t recommend Sonic&#039;s 8bit library enough, they&#039;re a lot more Mario like than the original Genesis installments, Sonic 1 is excellent on both Game Gear and Master System, if you go for Sonic 2 then always pick the Master System version, otherwise it&#039;s too punishing, but if you go for Sonic Chaos then go for Game Gear, otherwise it&#039;s too simple. I hope you can give Sonic another fair shot, but if you prefer not to then that&#039;s your choice, but trust me, they&#039;re excellent video games.", "filename": "1656183688449", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2419, "h": 1171, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1674472582803650, "time": 1674472582, "md5": "UgJgu6Yjv2a1TYRi6mfaAg==", "fsize": 1802199, "resto": 9594740}, {"no": 9595434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)07:28:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9594740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9594740</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog (plus 8-bit)</span><br>Love both.

I dont remember the exact value but i ordered a set of two fat ps3s and the postage ended up being something crazy like 120 dollars but it still worked out cheaper than buying locally as one was a backwards compatible model. Anime figures on average are about 25 dollars postage when i order those. Although it used to be cheaper before the russia ukraine bullshit. Japan post has a postage service called small air parcel which was very cheap and i think i used to be able to get figures shipped for like 10-15 dollars but they cant fly here anymore because they used to go over ukraine.

This usually means stuff like video being heavily downsampled, audio being downsampled, or sometimes audio/video being removed completely. The ODE situation on the Dreamcast is kinda fucked as well (they exist, but availability can be a pain in the dick if you don&#039;t want to buy the more expensive model).<br><br>Either console will have a solid selection of arcade ports, RPGs, and action games.

A simple but efficient formula only a few franchises managed to construct properly<br><br>Though it should be obvious that it&#039;s this kind of game and that you probably won&#039;t get much out of it if you don&#039;t love the game&#039;s world from screenshots and trailers, so not sure what even compelled you to try for so long instead of just moving on", "time": 1674412540, "resto": 9589783}, {"no": 9593372, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)13:37:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9593352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9593352</a><br>Still the best TES <s>with mods</s>", "time": 1674412647, "resto": 9589783}, {"no": 9593380, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)13:41:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9593349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9593349</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zelda is nothing special because there exists a carjacking simulator that&#039;s also long</span>", "time": 1674412878, "resto": 9589783}, {"no": 9593430, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)13:56:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9593364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9593364</a><br>I like Zelda, that&#039;s why I kept trying.

With TP it feels like the game hasn&#039;t even really started yet. I&#039;m several hours in and it still feels like the tutorial. Basically every other 3D Zelda sets you free far sooner than what I&#039;m currently experiencing with TP, and while the thematics and dungeon narratives are cool, the two dungeons I&#039;ve been to don&#039;t really match up to the ones in OoT, MM, or even some of SS&#039;s. Things like the magnetic platforms in the Goron dungeon are cool but they&#039;re not really used for any truly interesting puzzles or traversal challenges.

Crash got some traction at first, but then went downhill hard, Spyro seemingly lost any and all relevancy, and newer series seemingly never got any traction even if they were good (like Sly series). Past 2001, the genre seemingly went on a death spiral. Literally only Ratchet series survived this era.<br>I&#039;m trying to think of reasons.

Where characters previously had static faces and eyes made of pixels, on GameCube they had full animation and lip synching for dialogue - all of which was re-recorded with most of the original cast. In the position of director was Japanese filmmaker Ryuhei Kitamura, known for his high octane action films. As Kitamura explains, it was Hideo Kojima&#039;s love of films that landed him the job. &quot;Hideo came and watched my first feature Versus and loved it and we became very good friends.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible). The rest should be played in original form where possible, give or take a translation/restoration patch.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I mostly care about translation accuracy</span><br>The ChaosRush one is the one you want then, preferably with an enhancement that makes the game play more like rereleases / as intended. Default is probably better since Chaos Edition looks like it makes a bit too much guesswork with DND equivalents.

The GBA version might be best overall, but it feels like Square was being vindictive at times about their official PSX versions of 4&amp;5 being outshined at the time by unofficial SFC translation hacks, so they overlocalized it to the point a few key scenes almost feel like parody. You&#039;ll see some defend these edits, but it&#039;s clear in reality that they have trash taste. SFC original does have a GBA script port. The base fan translation is showing its age, but you could try checking out Spooniest&#039;s &quot;Legend of the Crystals&quot; addendum instead.

Meanwhile, both the Black and White Mages are simply too damn squishy even accounting for bugfixed Int, and taking full advantage of them by decking out their magic slots makes them lowkey the most expensive classes to maintain, so they&#039;re hardly worth wasting slots. This ironically makes the default party of the NES/MSX version the best beginner-friendly one in the long run since it has the most reasonable variety; in the original/bugged version, Thief is just too much of a drag in the long run and you&#039;re better off replacing it with literally anything else.

I am Anon#4000 who has not read this thread and only bothered to see the original post yet feel oddly compelled to weigh in on the matter. I am here to tell you that emulation and the secondhand market are both very wrong. Please delete your unauthorized reproductions and used copies within 24 hours. The only ethical way to consume video games is to buy a rendition that is currently sold through physical or digital retailers. For FINAL FANTASY, the Pixel Remaster series is an excellent choice. It is the latest incarnation of the classic FINAL FANTASY series, remastered for modern audiences with &quot;retro&quot; sensibilities. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is currently available on PC via Steam, Android via Google Play Store, and iOS via App Store. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is also coming soon to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4, where they were available physically. For FINAL FANTASY III or FINAL FANTASY IV, you may alternatively or additionally purchase our 3D remakes, which are still available on digital markets. The 3D remakes offer an experience similar but alternative to the 2D originals, making them worthwhile playthroughs. Remember, by purchasing only these versions of the FINAL FANTASY series, you are supporting the company that brought you the definitive editions of these legendary video games. As much as I too have a certain fondness for these classic role-playing video games as they appeared on Game Boy Advance and Sony PlayStation Portable, Square Enix will no longer receive the desirable monetary compensation through these obsoleted platforms, so it is therefore not recommended that you seek those ancient versions of these video games. If the FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is your first exposure to the FINAL FANTASY series, you will have no frame of reference with what came before, which in our studies can enhance consumer experience even further.

The other alternative was to zoom 2\u00d7 or 3x, then slightly resize the output, and have either smudged or uneven pixels.<br><br>And of course, the aspect ratio of TV console output pixels is not 1:1, so to correct the almost-square picture to (more or less physically correct) 4:3, you had to stretch with different coefficients vertically and horizontally.<br><br>On the one hand, hardware scaling on a specific system with a specific hardware using specific resolution could be a blurry mess, a blocky mess, or a combination of both. On the other hand, emulators had to use it in most cases, and had to be prepared for that. The idea of all those 2\u00d7 and 3x filters was to implement fast enhancing upscale (instead of the regular pixel doubled or pixel tripled copy) that would help contrast lines (e. g. text on screen) to survive the uncontrollable external stretching. They compensated for the less than stellar processing down the path.", "time": 1674458566, "resto": 9586643}, {"no": 9595082, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)02:23:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588306</a><br>We&#039;ve gone too far.", "filename": "1639469972932", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 997, "h": 748, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674458588722471, "time": 1674458588, "md5": "oXYywO/nemNFSaABXYqk8Q==", "fsize": 185325, "resto": 9586643}, {"no": 9595084, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)02:23:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9595080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9595080</a><br>You can open any image editor, and try stretching the original buffer, its 2\u00d7 or 3\u00d7 copies, and 2\u00d7 or 3\u00d7 filtered copies to the same random output resolutions with nearest neighbor and bilinear filtering, and decide which results look less horrible to you.<br><br>Then after a couple of years, a couple of processor and video card families, and a couple of DirectX versions letting software interact with hardware through new APIs, it all slowly stopped being relevant.

In a delicious irony, Holst&#039;s propagation of this false &quot;fact&quot; has spurred it into becoming one of the most widely-circulated bits of misinformation to be found on the Internet.</span>", "time": 1674376708, "resto": 9588762}, {"no": 9592240, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)03:43:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592235</a><br>It&#039;s not a myth in Australia", "time": 1674377038, "resto": 9588762}, {"no": 9592329, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:34:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592240</a><br>The best way to catch a spider is to suck it inside your mouth.

Conventional knowledge (not horse shit here) is *the packaging* is the most likely element to fail, which can happen in a few ways (moisture absorbtion, cracking from shock, distortion causing stress on the silicon being a major cause etc). Epoxies used to package ICs vary in composition and, importantly, the fillers used to cheapen their manufacture, improve elasticity etc. Ceramic is better but rare. <br><br>Heat rates a very distant second. It affects electromigration RATE, but EM will eventually kill any chip that doesn&#039;t die from something else first at room temp. Heat can aid package decay but is unlikely - the epoxies used are less susceptible to heat than previously mentioned problems. <br><br>Like packaging composition, each process node can involve different proprietary methods and will have different limitations. It is difficult to nail down generic IC properties and limitations but silicon itself has an unusual conductance/temp curve that imposes a relatively low practical temp limit with current technologies (this may well change). Silicon at 30 degrees and 300 degrees F have roughly the same conductivity and between here is lower - a safe zone for the silicon itself, ignoring all else. Although the resistance actually starts dropping at 200 deg and temp can be much harder to control at this point. Too low and thermal stress can shatter the core, too high is MUCH worse because... <br>1) cheap packaging will more likely distort / fail.<br>2) lower resistance will likely cause excessive load on power AND signal circuits connected to it, meaning the system will simply start to break down e.g corrupting data.

Heat is a waste product usually from electrical resistance/impedance and more efficient processes have less waste heat. <br><br>2) there is more to a cpu than the process it is made on. E.g Gold interconnects are expensive but far less resistive than copper which itself outclasses aluminum. What do the CPUs you are comparing use? <br><br>3) your cpu does not have 100% of its circuits being used at any time, but generally the more being used, and the more often in a certain space of time, the greater the current draw and resultant waste heat.
