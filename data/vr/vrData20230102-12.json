I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

Gouraud Shading doesn&#039;t really have much of a performance hit on VDP1. If you want to know how that figure is actually determined it basically boils down to this. <br><br>- A non textured pixel takes about 1 clock cycle to draw. <br>- A textured pixel takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A textured and gouraud shaded pixel still takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A half transparent pixel takes about 6 cycles to draw. <br><br>So compared to untextured pixels it&#039;s 6 times longer to draw, compared to textured it&#039;s 3 times longer to draw. So this is where your up to 6 times longer comes from. So with those values we can say that the max theoretical fillrate of VDP1 is 26-28 Million pixels per second depending on what resolution mode the Saturn is in and if you&#039;re drawing all untextured pixels. This is probably how the theoretical value listed earlier was determined. For Textured and Gouraud shaded pixels it&#039;s about 13-14 Million pixels per second. For half transparent pixels, it&#039;s about 4-5 Million pixels per second. <br><br>That&#039;s still a pretty significance performance hit for half transparencies. Throw in that they don&#039;t work correctly all the time and it&#039;s easy to see why most devs went with meshes. <br><br>That all said, if you&#039;re not doing half transparencies VDP1&#039;s fillrate is still more than enough for most games. At 320x240 resolution at 30fps you have enough fillrate to draw the entire frame buffer about 6 times per frame. So if you&#039;re sorting and culling polygons properly and not trying to draw everything as half transparent, you really shouldn&#039;t be hitting the fillrate limit.", "time": 1672264899, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9525165, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523969</a><br>Held back only by the small cartridge space.

All of the home ports of Virtua Fighter 1 are locked down to 30fps. The 32x game retains 30fps for the majority of the game, but has some slowdown during the win/ lose cutscenes. One of the big enhancements that the model 2 arcade board made was the 60 (57fps) framerate. Every Model 2 arcade game targeted 57fps.

That&#039;s not even getting into issues like nonsensical location jokes and references / skits that are extremely dated. There are lots of translators today, both by people who do it for a living or for fun or even AI / MTLs are getting in on the action, all of which pretty much renders that original &quot;worth learning&quot; part moot. On top of that, that&#039;s not even getting into the nightmare of localizations and the script purity question. Even with all of those compounded factors, there are people who still pushed through with it and there&#039;s a ton more people who know Japanese now than there was a decade or two ago, leaving a very saturated field of translators who are constantly fighting over rights to translate. There&#039;s also another thing in this thread that&#039;s worth pointing out too: most of the titles posted are either Sega Saturn, obscure PC-E or PS1/PS2 titles, the reason which is that the technology to actually inject and rewrite text, make sure it fits the boxes, etc. is a much more difficult task than translating the script itself wholesale.

A flamethrower would also be nice for damage over time, a nice contrast to the BFG where you have to be looking at the enemy to damage them.

If anything, the pressure intensified, even though we had a 2,300 sqft house with absolutely fuck all in it. Divorce was painful but worth it in the end. My current house is a little over half the size of the one we had together, but I actually have control over it, and don&#039;t just live in it like some kind of pet while my wife makes all the decisions and lords over me.

I wasted a total of 4 years with my ex wife, then I had to recover from the divorce, then get out dating again. Even if my gf and I got married and had a kid by this time next year (unlikely), there would still be a significant age gap (5+ years) between my kid and most of my friends&#039; kids. A lot of parents, most of my friends included, keep in touch by organizing &quot;play dates&quot; with kids of similar age, but my kids wouldn&#039;t really be able to play with the others because they would be at different development stages.

Most casuals don&#039;t want to have the headaches of worrying about things like accuracy or input timing and are quick to dismiss any discrepancies they think are irrelevant, they just need the game to run and that&#039;s it. Software emulation and MiSTer may be visually difficult to distinguish under several circumstances to the average person such as color output or ability to render the game in sync with everything else. The line can be tough to draw for most on which is better because the FPGA-based emulators have quickly caught up and even exceeded it&#039;s cycle accurate software counterparts in many technical areas. For any applicable cores, MiSTer has more accurate sound (certified against MDfourier). Most importantly, no core has input delay that isn&#039;t native to the original game or hardware, something all software emulators still haven&#039;t nailed down without the use of run-ahead (banned on speedrun). Input delay is always a subject easily dismissed by the typical casual because you&#039;re not practicing a game enough to begin to care about getting optimal input timings in, you just need to play your game and that&#039;s it.

People have definitely been burned by the lies these devices were sold upon. Also, the popularization of the Raspberry Pi and the RetroPie project have really marred the image of dedicated emulation devices specially because they are low powered devices which underperform against most other emulation solutions. MiSTer is a project being developed on the DE-10 Nano which is another low powered device. The main difference is that it is FPGA which means [in laymen&#039;s terms] it is more flexible when it comes to running closer to the real hardware it is imitating since the core [emulator if you wanna call it that] is actually attempting to run at the real clock speed of the target hardware. A lot of people are understandably skeptical, others have already settled for other solutions [besides hardware] and prefer to not research yet another way to play due to caution of finding out it&#039;s not worth it afterall.

Yes, between those two, as well as from one pad of the battery to just about anywhere else.

The only other game I have to test with is Mario Kart 64, which holds its data no problem.

It&#039;s one of my favorite games of all time, but I understand well why it&#039;s always been a little niche. My suggestion if you try again is just take it slow for a while and learn how the game flows. The second level has an octopus that is there to help teach you. You&#039;ll feel low on air and like you should be rushing, but the octopus will slap you back of you do. In Ecco, rushing is what usually kills you. Your air is always depleting and you will think you&#039;re going to drown if you don&#039;t, but success relies on keeping calm under pressure and being accurate.

The player initially being proposed as an evil killer looking to murder a poor girl, then being changed into a hero trying to save his girl would be going from a darker to a lighter tone, and it would make the fact that the player looks like a famous slasher horror killer less inexplicable.", "filename": "sh1_flyer_front", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1203, "h": 850, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1672384199533475, "time": 1672384199, "md5": "lcMwoaXG4nUUcI2urviz5A==", "fsize": 257179, "resto": 9514647}, {"no": 9529414, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)02:12:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9527471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9527471</a><br>I don&#039;t think Nintendo would have been cool with it at the time Splatterhouse 3 was still new or relevant.", "time": 1672384349, "resto": 9514647}, {"no": 9530112, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)11:37:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9529412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9529412</a><br>the ironic thing is that you end up heroically beating your gf to death with your bare hands anyway... one of the few games with mandatory domestic abuse", "time": 1672418242, "resto": 9514647}, {"no": 9530528, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)14:27:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9514647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9514647</a><br>Have you tried the shmup Shooterhouse?

But as far as I know, that is the most popular and well received genre on the platform. I&#039;ve been playing the City Hunter release on the console as well, and it&#039;s a pretty enjoyable experience. I guess because it is a side scrolling game set in the city where you shoot people and get shot at, it reminded me of the Dick Tracy game on NES at first.

The program was not made as a diss, and it was definitely not shown to any lawyers as an act of pettiness, it was just a silly private joke shown to a couple friends.<br><br>Here&#039;s David Crane&#039;s personal explanation of it:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe Venetian Blind cart is a working 2600 demo that shows a landscape at sunset outside a window, covered by a fully operational Venetian Blind \u2014 one that moves up and down under joystick control. Here is how it came about:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Atari sued Activision they laid claim to certain \u2018proprietary\u2019 techniques. One technique for which they claimed ownership was first used by Bob Whitehead in the display code of the Atari Chess cartridge. This method moved the display objects back and forth every scan line to allow the game to display more objects. On the chess pieces, for example, Bob showed the odd pixel row of the odd numbered columns of pieces and the even pixel row of the even numbered columns. We called this the Venetian Blind technique since it made the pieces look like they were being viewed through a venetian blind.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One day in the lab at Activision while the lawsuit was in full swing, Bob and I collaborated on a practical joke. We made a display showing an architecturally accurate window with a view of a grassy hill at sunset. We covered it with a venetian blind effect that animated up and down (complete with the stacking up of the slats as they were gathered up by the blind mechanism). We took it to CES and showed it to a few people who were privy to the lawsuit, asking \u2018Is this what Atari means by the Venetian Blind Technique?\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The joke was on us in one respect, when we realized that we had made public our latest innovation (the background sunset) when we showed it to our competitors. (Several games in the lab were using this new idea, but they had not yet been published.) As it turned out, nobody picked up on our slip and nobody beat us to market with the sunset.\u201d ~ David Crane</span>", "time": 1672589122, "resto": 9523001}, {"no": 9536297, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)19:53:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523274</a><br><br>This guy is the most stupid-looking Pok\u00e9mon character I have seen so far.", "time": 1672620828, "resto": 9523001}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9525689, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:11:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ITT: Retro asses", "filename": "VAGRANT_STORY-221227-183614", "ext": ".png", "w": 897, "h": 672, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1672276269810292, "time": 1672276269, "md5": "w9Dx+xMXpYDBde4GMb6Ncg==", "fsize": 943835, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "itt-retro-asses", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 168, "images": 77, "unique_ips": 89}, {"no": 9525696, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:13:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "vagrant culo", "time": 1672276384, "resto": 9525689}, {"no": 9525709, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:15:59", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "EGaaDKqW4AA9Q7X[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672276559103306, "time": 1672276559, "md5": "bnCCdYWC3LAJHfKX+Mo4cQ==", "fsize": 132451, "resto": 9525689}, {"no": 9525736, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:25:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "586200_20221002001637_1", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672277140575570, "time": 1672277140, "md5": "ON7bq/o+OdJE68Ic4j+/ow==", "fsize": 1456767, "resto": 9525689}, {"no": 9525748, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:30:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9525689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9525689</a>", "filename": "f", "ext": ".png", "w": 1487, "h": 857, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1672277436944074, "time": 1672277436, "md5": "BUS+tIREMoCJbtBZwsmMEg==", "fsize": 1651081, "resto": 9525689}, {"no": 9525750, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:32:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9525689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9525689</a><br>Wrong Vagrant Story ass", "filename": "vagrantstory300c", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 530, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672277547425012, "time": 1672277547, "md5": "7uahfaDvYZXH1lL6cXVfpg==", "fsize": 25988, "resto": 9525689, "spoiler": 1}, {"no": 9525774, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:45:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9525748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9525748</a><br>ASSLESS<br>CHAPS", "time": 1672278309, "resto": 9525689}, {"no": 9525841, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)21:14:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9525748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9525748</a><br><a href=\"#p9525750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9525750</a><br>Why is it so commonf or SE to make something good but then also make it retarded in some way?
