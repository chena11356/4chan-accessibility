One of the actual improvements that RE2 has over the PS1 game is that the Factor 5 audio engine supports Doubly Surround, and you could hear the difference in the game, with the right audio set-up. I have played N64 RE2 on a surround sound set-up, and it was impressive hearing Zombie noises coming from the back speakers, and the left and right. The audio samples are sadly compressed, but the surround aspect is cool. <br><br>I played the N64 port long before the Ps1 port. I loved RE2 on the N64, and playing the PS1 port later, I was impressed by how little the N64 game lost in the process of being ported to the console. The game, is basically all there.

Yes, its true that NOA and NOE during the NES years often had a bias against overt themes regarding themes and symbols of many IRL faiths and/or religions as per their pre-ESRB political correctness game censorship guidelines, which also forbade references to alcohol, illicit drug use, and, most on-screen bloodshed. However, as much as there are references to Christianity here and there, especially in the early years of the franchise, that the Cross is not an exclusively Christian symbol, just as the Six-pointed star is not exclusive to Judaism. True, the special book in the early Zelda games is literally called a &quot;Bible&quot;, and cross imagery in a number of areas, the bulk of them in the early titles. But what makes you so damn sure that the word &quot;Shimpu&quot; is specifically meant to mean a Christian Priest? How fluent in Japanese are you, really? The language is often vague, its written form (aside from Kanji, which acts somewhat more like Chinese does) is a syllabary, is more reader dependent in its structure than any of the languages of Europe, and those of the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. I also add that even in the pre-Majora&#039;s mask era of LOZ, there are also other lore and folkloric beings from different parts of the world present. Fairies (Celtic and Germanic Lore) can be found in every game in the series. The Master Sword in Link to the past/Triforce of the Gods is very much reminiscent of Celtic Arthurian legend and lore. The swimming fish that raise their heads out of the water to make ranged magic ball attacks found in LOZ1 and ALTTP/Triforce of the Gods are more Japanese Kappa-inspired. Not sure about the Peahat enemies, though.", "time": 1674015044, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581035, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:20:37", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "GamefanVolume4Issue01January1996ALT_0022", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1214, "h": 1621, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674015637828338, "time": 1674015637, "md5": "5GydHhHBdt80ri52s/Na4Q==", "fsize": 377476, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581039, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:22:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9577784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9577784</a><br>lmao", "time": 1674015724, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581172, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9580456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9580456</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;monkey named Spanky</span>", "filename": "1674019964737", "ext": ".png", "w": 353, "h": 334, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1674019974248669, "time": 1674019974, "md5": "VHDGz0no1Lrb5UOlrXRdbA==", "fsize": 144174, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581194, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why cant videogames just be for cool tough guys anymore?", "time": 1674020686, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581207, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:51:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9581194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9581194</a><br>Seriously.

All the FX2 did was support larger ROMs than the FX1, the FX1 otherwise performs the same as the FX2. Many people assumed the FX1 runs slower from trying to use Star Fox 1 as the doner cart, but the chip used in Star Fox 1 was slower variant called the Mario Chip. The ROM of Star Fox 2 is small enough to be fully addressable with the FX1. The most likely reason that Star Fox 2 was going to use a FX2 chip is that they were probably not producing the FX1 anymore, not that it needed it. Even if the FX2 cost more to make, having production of both FX1 and FX2 going on at the same time when any FX1 game would run the same on a FX2 would have cost more.<br><br>There are far less games that had a FX2 in them, and even less that had battery SRAM. About your only option outside of Tealand is Doom and Yoshi&#039;s Island, both rare and expensive.<br><br>Meanwhile the Dirt Trax FX and Stunt Race FX games can be had for $10-15 at times and there were tons of those. Yeah, it does suck to have to cannabalize older SNES games to make one of these, but there is no real way to create your own from scratch due to it being an FX game. No homebrew way to create your own FX chip. I mean, it can probably be implemented with a FPGA but I have zero clue how powerful (and thus expensive) an FPGA one would need. I tried to lookup the hardware in the FXPak but all I could find was that a prototype from 2011 used a Spartan 3 FPGA, no idea if the current carts also use that. Depending on the version they go from $18 to $120, most seem to be $18-40.<br><br>As for making it, many have made such a repro in the past. Most of them back then were made with the beta ROM that was floating around for years before the SNES Classic.

This usually means stuff like video being heavily downsampled, audio being downsampled, or sometimes audio/video being removed completely.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

It&#039;s supposed to make up for its weaknesses in sheer luck and agility, but in practice, it&#039;s a total paperweight. It becomes better after class change, but that&#039;s not saying much when even a fourth-rate Knight w/Icebrand can out-damage a first-rate Ninja w/Katana. But in a bugfixed/remade version? Thief becomes MUCH more viable and almost feels like another class entirely, and Ninja&#039;s access to Haste and bugfixed Temper means it&#039;s not to be underestimated. Meanwhile, both the Black and White Mages are simply too damn squishy even accounting for bugfixed Int, and taking full advantage of them by decking out their magic slots makes them lowkey the most expensive classes to maintain, so they&#039;re hardly worth wasting slots. This ironically makes the default party of the NES/MSX version the best beginner-friendly one in the long run since it has the most reasonable variety; in the original/bugged version, Thief is just too much of a drag in the long run and you&#039;re better off replacing it with literally anything else. I dunno why remakes then swap out Monk and Red Mage for White and Black Mages. That&#039;s just a straight-up worse setup even in those versions. All the good magic can be learned by Red Wizard, and physical stats are way more important in this game, so it&#039;s a nobrainer.

Nudging is not something the general public does to machines. It&#039;s someone only very specific players do. And Nudging, shifting, or moving the machine *will* cause issues over time. They loosen screws, bolts, and wear out the machine connections at joints. It&#039;s a physical movement of the machine afterall. Maybe not cause issues right away, but it will over time. <br><br>I&#039;ve even seen instances where a player nudges too hard and can cause cracks in the glass. Do these people take responsibility? Nope. They just quietly walk away and leave the arcade without saying anything. Now the arcade owner has to pay to replace the glass. And the pinball is now out of service for days or weeks depending on how quickly they replace the glass. <br><br>Nudging (or any other &quot;pro&quot; pinball techniques) causes problems over time when a single player does it. Now imagine a pinball machine in a public arcade. It gets played dozens of times a day by many different players. More if it&#039;s popular location. It wears out the machine faster. Pins are just pieces of wood and metal after all. It&#039;s gonna break eventually if you keep stressing the connection points with movement. <br><br>You might be able to get away with it with newer machines but These older pinball machines aren&#039;t made anymore and sourcing replacement parts are difficult if something serious breaks. They should be respected and treated with an extra level of care from players if it&#039;s an older machine. This isn&#039;t the 1980s or 1990s anymore.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it.

Love this game. Beat it on my dad&#039;s NES last summer. Have a notebook full of passwords to prove it. Didn&#039;t use any guides, either.<br>Took about a week to finish. The main thing that gets people hung up about this game, I think, is all the similar-looking sections. Those can be confusing, but that&#039;s kinda the point. It&#039;s an adventure game, so the path of advancement isn&#039;t going to be straightforward. I enjoyed the feeling of being all alone and hopelessly lost in this scary hellish maze. Eventually, you&#039;ll notice that something&#039;s amiss about a particular location, and things will start to fall into place, and there&#039;s a great satisfaction that comes with that. My favorite part of the game was the hectic trip up the vertical shaft after defeating Mother Brain, with the countdown. So good. The first half of the song that plays during this part is dark and dramatic and oppressive, almost making you feel like you&#039;re not gonna make it\u2014but then wait! The second half of the song starts playing, and suddenly, it&#039;s triumphant and encouraging, as if the game&#039;s telling the player not to give up hope just yet. As long as you keep pushing, there&#039;s still a chance that you&#039;ll succeed\u2014and I did, and it was glorious. https://youtu.be/V2k01qmi99k<br>And of course, the revelation that Samus is a woman at the end was sadly something that I missed out on, since I took too long. That&#039;s okay, though\u2014everyone knows Samus is a girl, and the whole point of the twist is that it never mattered that she was a woman in the first place.<br>A regret I have is never having found all the power-ups. A guide would&#039;ve helped out with this, but I was committed to finishing the game without one. As a result, I never wound up finding the Screw Attack, one of Samus&#039;s more iconic weapons.

I agree with the other guy, good ideas but insufficient execution, there&#039;s enough value to gleam in it that it had some appeal, that it was worth making sequels, but there&#039;s pretty good reasons why they were never runaway hits.<br><br><a href=\"#p9578923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9578923</a><br>The first game of a bunch of office software programmers on the Playstation in 1994 isn&#039;t actually that great to look at? It&#039;s a primitive depiction, and I&#039;m not gonna say that King&#039;s Field is a real classic, because it&#039;s not, reviews were very mixed at the time, lots of people thought it was no good, but this was a first person 3D game with an open world, on console, in 1994, so it stood out, especially being one of the Playstation&#039;s launch titles, meaning it got to be one of the few choices available at first.<br>That last part damns it with faint praise, but there&#039;s enough which is compelling about it that there were people interested in sequels which turned out to indeed be better. Like so many other Japanese games, it was influenced by the Wizardry series, which was well liked by Japanese nerds, so King&#039;s Field was already vying for some of that audience, evidently appealing enough to them that they were willing to give them another shot.<br><br>They do get better with time, the later games are remembered more fondly for a reason, but mind also that Demon&#039;s Souls caught fire BECAUSE the formula saw a number of alterations to make it much better and much more appealing. It wasn&#039;t just King&#039;s Field but with 2009 graphics, it&#039;s a more ambitious and well thought out game.

Janet was from Virtua Cop 2 (AM2), Daytona Hornet car = AM2. rent-A-hero is another AM2 created game. Virtua Fighter Kids = AM2. Though MegaMix contains a lot of the fighting move from Virtua Fighter 3 for the VF3 cast, and Janet is basically Aoi from VF3. <br><br>As for Fighting Vipers, the game is hardly a Tekken clone, as it does contain some unique gameplay elements, not really found in other fighting games. The armor mechanic, the walled environments, Characters with armor on, move slower and can take less damage. With no armor, they take more damage, but move faster.

There are a few other dependencies in babel_static_functions.txt, but other than that you pretty much just inherit from SyncEnabledMonster or ChainEnabledMonster and use the appropriate hold state calls to make sure your monsters don&#039;t get their actions clobbered by signals at the wrong times.

A lot of the stuff in Babel is fairly highly coupled, specifically for fear, but there&#039;s also things I never did like making weapons attract monster attacks and other fuckery with targeting. Once you get a grip on the basics of exactly what I did to get sync/chain to work you&#039;ll see it&#039;s fairly straightforward, honestly not complex at all. If you want to get more complex and make a mod that isn&#039;t trying to be vanilla+, but maybe a little more out there, there&#039;s a TON of things that you can do just by throwing triggers around and manipulating states. The Cacodemon, for example, uses the same kinds of signals for its dodges.

You can use some other rasterization method (scanline fill or ray casting, for example). Collision detection and visibility work with planes. Read something on how compiler tools process the map data from the editor, and why. If I recall correctly, Quake-related engines combine all static brushes into one complex enclosed space (the \u201cinside\u201d of the map where everything exists), then subdivide it with each face plane to produce many subvolumes touching each other. You can also check GoldSrc and Source documents from Valve, their principles are similar.<br><br>When you have planes, you know you have planes by definition. When you have polygons, you need additional calculations to get normals from positions of vertices (which accelerators can implement in hardware, but you can&#039;t), and, sometimes, to recover the fact that polygons belong to the same plane.", "time": 1674188541, "resto": 9580932}, {"no": 9586641, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:46:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are there any source ports for Unreal Gold?", "time": 1674190010, "resto": 9580932}, {"no": 9586648, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9586641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9586641</a><br>No, the source code for all versions of UE are proprietary.

However my research confirms around 25 to 30 Ridge Racer Full Scale Units were exported for Western/Foreign markets. They were spread across the USA, UK, Spain, France, Middle East, Australia, etc. <br><br>And around 20 Ridge Racer Full Scale were used in Asian markets. Namco themselves kept several units in reserve to use in their Namco branded theme parks and Namco arcades in Japan. Several independent arcade owners in Asia had a Ridge Racer Full Scale too.

But Nextech who was in charge of porting the Saturn game, had issues with RE2 to the Saturn, which caused its&#039; cancellation.I think Sega may have suggested making the game for the Dreamcast, instead. Nexttech made the Code Veronica game engine, which was essentially the RE2 game engine running with 3D environments. I almost thing Code Veronica was going to be a 3D remake of RE2, before Capcom decided to make it a new game. Code veronica was originally planned to have both Leon and Claire, with Leon being replaced by Steve Burnside. When Code Veronica was first shown off to the public, the game was treated like a technical showcase for the Dreamcast, and it was the first &#039;next generation&#039; Resident Evil game. The game did get released months before the PS2. The real-time cinematics and cinematic game models were really impressive for their time. The game was one of the best looking games on the DC outside of Shenmue I and II. But when it was ported to the PS2 and Gamecube (clearly much more powerful hardware) , the game lost some of its luster, when put up against other games on those consoles. Resident Evil 2 and 3 did get Dreamcast ports, but these ports are basically the PC games running on WindowsCE.", "time": 1674110040, "resto": 9578771}, {"no": 9584414, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:36:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9583887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9583887</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IM SOWWWYYYY</span><br><br>Steve&#039;s original hairstyle was superior.", "filename": "steve_s_differences_by_crazyiam234166_d2ottty-fullview", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 515, "h": 340, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674110204089143, "time": 1674110204, "md5": "bhoxWbwLq8sSApxsG/WLlQ==", "fsize": 25287, "resto": 9578771}, {"no": 9584446, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:57:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9580408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9580408</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CV makes trannies seeth so I love it</span><br><br>Basically, it comes down to one line of dialogue spoken by Claire. the game was being developed in 1998-2000, and Alfred was basically a homage to the movie Psycho, or more specifically... the shot for shot 1998 remake of Psycho starring Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Q<wbr>kvHCfg7w&amp;t=7s<br><br>Code veronica borrows heavily from the 1998 Psycho remake, the X-Files movie (1998), The Matrix/ John Woo, there is a bit of a Juon references.", "time": 1674111440, "resto": 9578771}, {"no": 9584723, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)05:55:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9582549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9582549</a><br>Well I played it last night and saved last just before Rebecca has to go to some torture room to restore power and the monkey enemies appear.<br>It&#039;s pretty standard survival with a somewhat interesting gimmick with the character swapping so far, and even the research center has great atmosphere but desu I&#039;m a bit biased as I think the REmake type backgrounds are just a joy to look at. <br>Not many healing items, though, and that&#039;s probably where the difficulty stems from.

After Code Veronica, you can tell in this one they were trying to build up something interesting with Spencer as this big, scheming behind the scene, bad guy and his mysterious endgoal.<br>Funny that it ended as a dud revelation about a euginistic program for creating a race of superhumans and the trope of the scientist seeking eternal life in 5.

Sales of the console had dried up by 1996 and there&#039;s evidence the software sales were tanking even sooner than that.

So every time Sega of America ordered more stock, that counted as a sale in Sega of Japan&#039;s export revenue. But that stuff wasn&#039;t selling and was sitting in warehouses. So the parent company&#039;s finances were looking ok because of those &quot;sales&quot;, but the subsidiary was doing much worse, but it wasn&#039;t being reflected accurately. So when Japan took over in 1996-1997, they realized this massive mess was going on, wrote off all the inventory and got rid of it.

The fabled phone call in 1994 that peopel quote was in response to Sega of America continuing to drag their feet and not get behind the Saturn. They didn&#039;t want to release it and instead wanted to stick to the Genesis. Which again, the Genesis was showing it&#039;s age and software sales were beginning to slump. So this phone call was Japan going &quot;Ok if you don&#039;t want the Saturn what the hell do you want and what the hell are we going to release here to counter these new upcoming systems?&quot; <br><br>So eventually Sega of Japan gave in and agreed that they wouldn&#039;t release Saturn in the US yet and would instead focus on the Genesis and offered an enhanced Genesis with more colors to try and extend it&#039;s life. Sega of America countered with the 32X. So no, the 32X wasn&#039;t forced on Sega of America. It was Sega of Japan giving Sega of America exactly what they wanted.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The developer of Sonic X-Treme outright said that SoJ refused to give SoA the game engine of Nights into Dreams.</span><br>Which has been debunked by Yuji Naka. NiGHTS was a game hardcoded in Assembly. People who have dug into the game to try and datamine and reverse engineer it have confirmed it&#039;s very obvious that it&#039;s handwritten assembly and not compiled C code. As a result, that code was useless for anyone trying to make their own game because it wasn&#039;t an engine and wasn&#039;t easy to use in any way like that.<br><br>Naka stated he doesn&#039;t even remember anyone asking for it.", "time": 1674188677, "resto": 9583207}, {"no": 9586626, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:37:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9586482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9586482</a><br><a href=\"#p9586608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9586608</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There were games in the works by 3rd parties that were cancelled out right because Sega refused to continue supporting the Genesis.</span><br>Going further off of this, I believe you have this situation mixed up. Third Party devs weren&#039;t mad at Sega for dropping the Genesis because they had games in the works for it in 1997/1998. They were made at them for dropping the Saturn in 1998 for this reason. These were developers like EA, Konami, Capcom, Game Arts, Atlus, Hudson, etc. Which it shouldn&#039;t be a surprise that those devs with the exception of Capcom made significantly less games for Dreamcast than they did for Saturn. Some like EA skipped it entirely.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NiGHTS and Sonic Xtreme</span><br>And going further off of this, Sonic Xtreme was doomed long before the supposed NiGHTS fiasco. The project was a text book case of terrible project management, the lead programmer never even touched a Saturn devkit and was convinced his PC code could just compile for the Saturn and be fine.

Sega of America was high on their on farts and thought they could hold off the PS1 by sticking to the Genesis. Sega of Japan tried to back them up with an enhanced Genesis and that led to the 32X.

You hear &quot;Banjo is like Mario, but better&quot; and you instantly think they&#039;re talking about platforming\u2014They are not. Banjo has literally completely different design philosophy to Mario. It&#039;s an ADVENTURE game primarily, not a platformer primarily like Mario is. It is, admittedly, disappointing that the bear sucks ass to control, but this is also compensated for in the gameplay by Banjo being far, far less of a platformer.

Click Clock Wood is structured entirely around its shittastic platforming, asking you to climb up that damn tree over and over again, and it&#039;s not fun. It feels atrocious. Make no mistake: there ARE plenty of platforming challenges in the game. Fans may not consider it a &quot;platformer&quot;, and there may be more puzzles/minigames than there is actual platforming, but you still DO platform a lot in the game, and it never feels right. Especially when they constantly ask you to do that backflip to get to high areas, which is probably the stiffest jump move I&#039;ve seen outside of Bubsy 3D.<br><br>Also, any instance where the game asks you to fly (which you, again, do a LOT of) also isn&#039;t fun.

Sure it can be a bit too much sometimes, but figuring stuff like this out and having a bit of an adventure are sort of the point. It&#039;s not SUPPOSED to be as convenient as humanly possible.

What exactly are you finding so compelling about Grunty&#039;s Lair? I mean, I GUESS there are one or two puzzles needed to access new areas, that&#039;s fine, and I GUESS there are a small handful of Jiggies that can only be found in the hub, but it&#039;s not as if Grunty&#039;s Lair is a level unto itself. It&#039;s not as compact and dense with things to find as Mario 64, nor is it filled with just as many collectibles and challenges as a normal level would have as the Spyro games do. 90% of the time spent in Grunty&#039;s Lair is just walking back and forth across empty areas that you&#039;ve already seen before. Is it just &quot;immersive&quot;? Maybe if you&#039;re a child. I&#039;m onboard with exploration, and adventure, and if it means I&#039;m always discovering new things, but that&#039;s only if I&#039;m not constantly going back and forth over the same shit I&#039;ve already found, and not finding anything new. And on repeat playthroughs, that gets even more frustrating, because that feeling of discovery is gone.<br><br>Banjo as a game doesn&#039;t seem to know what it wants to be. If it&#039;s an adventure game, then there&#039;s too much crappy platforming and flying (I knew you could make sharp turns, since I played on Xbox, and it&#039;s still janky as hell). It&#039;s not doing a good job of what it&#039;s &quot;trying&quot; to be or do. If Rare wanted to make an adventure game, they shouldn&#039;t have filled it with so many platforming challenges that play like shit. I could go on and mention even more things about the game that piss me off, such as needing to go back to Mumbo every single shitty fucking time I want to transform, or Rusty Bucket Bay having some of the worst level design I&#039;ve ever seen, or the bullshit final boss, but I think you get it by now.<br><br>I&#039;m going to go play Jak &amp; Daxter to cleanse my palette.

There&#039;s still no concept of the idea of a saved game, or that playing games with friends is an activity you can&#039;t start and stop on a whim, or now in the era of the internet that people form meaningful friendships without even meeting each other in real life. None of them are certainly worthy of being called a hobby.<br><br>When I branched out from modding Quake 1/HL1 to actually writing games during the indie boom, I was reminded weekly that making video games isn&#039;t a real job and that I needed to keep pursuing my university education in a STEM field instead. When the game I wrote went live on Steam and I started actually making a steady income from it, my mother and father were not happy about it at all. They wouldn&#039;t believe that I got money for making video games and when they finally had to accept that I was actually supporting myself through programming they still continued to complain that it was fluke and I absolutely needed to go back to college and finish my masters to get a real job.<br><br>Needless to say, while they didn&#039;t stop me from playing video games when I was young, they had always hoped I would &quot;grow out of them&quot; and get a more adult hobby.", "time": 1674190398, "resto": 9584873}, {"no": 9586726, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)00:48:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9584873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9584873</a><br>Mom thought it was a waste of time, dad thought it was good for reflexes and problem solving.", "time": 1674193735, "resto": 9584873}, {"no": 9586742, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My Dad wasn&#039;t around but my Mom was pretty much pro-vidya.
