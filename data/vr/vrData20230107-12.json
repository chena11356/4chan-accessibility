Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth.

I wish there were a few more bullets at the start since shooting the elevated skeletons at the start feels drawn out with the shotgun. I really dislike that some of the rock/sand piles around the start have impassible lines for no reason since it can block your dodging without any telegraph. This is especially annoying since not all of them are like this. Like the other post said already, many descended midtextures are visibly clipping through the floor with software rendering (you can fix this by varying the brightness value or flat between the surrounding sectors). The ambush before the rocket launcher is a blatant example of hitscanners without cover, the computer in the center isn&#039;t tall enough to protect you. I wish there were some consistency about which doors are intractable since inert/onesided doors look the same as normal ones. Using spectres as soon as you enter a dark room twice in the same map feels kind of lazy. Both archviles feel poorly used since the first one is trivial since he can never get behind you and the other is just a test of patience since it can never get down the lift. I didn&#039;t realize there was a lift at first since there&#039;s no indication it&#039;s intractable and it looks the same as the surrounding walls. I feel like the revenant/imp ambush by the computer switches would work a lot better if the wall above you were shorter so the enemies could shoot down at you when they get caught against the wall. I have no idea what the switch before the blue key lift is for since it seems like you can and should safely ignore it. The lost souls in the end room feel completely pointless since you can just kill them before you hit the switch, I&#039;d honestly just remove them since the fight&#039;s hard enough anyway. You can also softlock yourself if you ride the perpetual lifts in that room up and jump over the wall.

The visuals in the map are unpolished, I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d use a high quality texture pack like Otex if you aren&#039;t even going to align your textures (not just aligning your similar textures to each other but also aligning seams of the textures with the edges of geometry. Otex was designed from the ground up for this, I&#039;m not sure why so many people don&#039;t bother). Using a combination of stock and Otex also tends to look incongruous, you can sometimes get away with it but it shouldn&#039;t really be necessary given the latter&#039;s comprehensiveness.<br>This probably comes off as a scathing review but I&#039;d like to stress that none of these things ruin the map, and I liked many of the ideas present even if the execution was flawed.

Even if you can infer something about the level design from looks it will always be liable to misunderstanding.

When Shoichiro Irimajiri took over as CEO of Sega of America after Kalinske he quickly realized how mismananged the US branch was and how much the financials were being misrepresented.

Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed.

It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere.

I had a good enough time, though I found it pretty easy once you got Second Chance. Then I played KH2 which I had never played. I dropped 2. I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

I remember playing Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six as a kid, it was my first ever experience with a video game based on my favorite super hero, and it was quite good, nothing superb, but it doesn&#039;t deserve the poor reception it usually gets, it plays fine enough and has some good level design.<br><br>What I really remember from my childhood however, is the PS1 duology of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro. I couldn&#039;t believe how accurate these were, you really felt like you were Spider-Man, and the jump to 3D helped with that quite a lot. I recall growing up and hoping that there&#039;d be a 3rd installment, but there wasn&#039;t, the Sam Raimi films came out and, while I loved those, and both Spider-Man (PS2) and Spider-Man 2 (PSP) played like the PS1 duology, it wasn&#039;t set in the same universe... lately I discovered something though, the PS1 original was ported to GBC, which got a sequel... and a 3rd installment, Mysterio&#039;s Menace.<br><br>When I finally looked at Mysterio&#039;s Menace it really took me by surprise, the graphics, UI, power ups... everything seemed like the PS1 duology, and that&#039;s because, from what I&#039;ve read, this is a sequel to that, and not the GBC timeline, regardless if that&#039;s the case or not, it sure feels like it. I&#039;ve just finished a playthrough on Easy and, while nowhere near the experience I got from the PS1 duology, it feels quite good, and it&#039;s worthy of the classics I grew up with, the 3rd installment I always wanted.

Anyway, I did just finish a playthrough on Normal difficulty, so Super Hero is all that remains, besides doing it 100% of course, though I won&#039;t be too harsh on myself if I don&#039;t pull it off, there are a few Spider-Man video games where I wanted 100% completion and gave up, like Spider-Man on PS1 due to the Quick-Change suit being impossible to get, and 8bit Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin for having 1 life.<br><br>I still have a smile on my face, as this feels like the 3rd installment to the PS1 duology that I&#039;ve wanted through out my entire childhood, the graphics and UI are clearly based on it, it can&#039;t be a coincidence. Vicarious Visions did a good job here, just like they did in Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro, though neither is as good as Neversoft&#039;s original, and from the trilogy I&#039;d say this is the worst one... I think Spider-Man can work well in 2D, but this feels like the 3D PS1 duology, just with a dimension less, so it&#039;s simply lesser by default, still good, but not as good. I do feel that this is a worthy ending to the series I loved on the PS1 though.<br><br>Of course there are things that bother me, Spider-Man really needed more invincibility frames after getting hit, and enemies can have life bars that are too large at times, or just have a very cheap placement overall, especially on the edge of platforms you have to jump on... either way, level design is still good and varied for the most part, interesting to navigate in and explore, I also love the controls, it doesn&#039;t feel as good as 16bit Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin to me, but it does feel good overall, and it&#039;s a good translation of the PS1 control scheme.

Overall I loved revisiting all of the levels after defeating Mysterio, in an attempt to find everything, the upgrades and suits, and eventually I did. I loved how everything was hidden, they&#039;re not in plain sight, but with some exploration you&#039;ll eventually find them... except the Symbiote suit, I&#039;m ashamed to admit that I had to use a guide for that.<br><br>While looking for everything I&#039;ve missed during my first playthrough, doing some exploration, it made me appreciate how good the level design is, and I started to get so good at some levels that playing them felt exhilarating, the flow and rhythm really made me feel like Spider-Man... I have a few gripes with it though, Spider-Man really needed invincibility frames, as when you get surrounded by enemies it can be a chore, also having enemies on the edge of platforms can feel quite cheap. One last thing is the web slinging, it actually feels good... but you can&#039;t gain altitute from it, I really wish it was closer to Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin.<br><br>I&#039;m glad I&#039;ve finally played and completed Mysterio&#039;s Menace though, this is a worthy follow-up of the PS1 duology I grew up with, not as good as those due to the hardware and its limitation, especially due to the loss of a whole dimension, but Spider-Man can definitely work in 2D, and this is an example of that. Vicarious Visions did a good job here and I can&#039;t recommend it enough for those that grew up with all of Spider-Man&#039;s adventures on the PS1, it has the soul of the Spider-Man 3 that we never got for that console.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

But people forget that Ocarina of Time made people slowly forget about the bear and bird. Then Donkey Kong 64 came out and there were tons of collectathons so when Banjo Tooie came out people were tired of collectathons not to mention in the holiday christmas season of 2000 the N64 was now considered old, the PS2 had come out and took all the thunder away. Banjo Tooie was never as popular as the first game which in gaming it&#039;s a bad sign. They could&#039;ve turned it around with a great third Banjo game on Gamecube and establish Banjo as a franchise but Rare was sold and didn&#039;t get a new game until the IP was dead.<br>Microsoft didn&#039;t want to lose the work that had already been done so they released the GBA Banjo game. But by the time the game came out many Nintendo fans had moved on from Rare, not to mention it didn&#039;t get much advertisement from THQ who published the game and of course Nintendo weren&#039;t going to do their own marketing for a competitors mascot and use their Game Boy to promote the Xbox.

It was developed and planned for a 1975 launch date but a change in RCA management during this time pushed it back to an early 1977 release. The Studio II&#039;s black and white graphics looked inferior to the Fairchild Channel F which displayed in color, and the Atari VCS&#039;s launch later in the year made it look even cruder. It was discontinued in early 1978 and an estimated between 57,000 and 64,000 units sold. This would make it the smallest-selling game console ever sold in North America. The decision to pull the plug came after the Studio II failed to sell much over the 1977 holiday season and the realization that it had no hope to compete with the VCS. The Charlotte, North Carolina plant where the Studio II was manufactured was closed and 120 workers laid off.<br><br>The Studio II used RCA&#039;s 1802, the first microprocessor fabricated in CMOS, and a custom graphics chip known as &quot;Pixie&quot; which displayed 64x32 block graphics. There were 512 bytes of RAM, split 50/50 between video and work RAM. It used ROM cartridges but included five built-in games as well. Just ten cartridges were produced, with a possible 11th (Bingo, a suspected prototype or planned but never actually shipped).<br><br>RCA engineer Joe Weisbecker was the main designer of the Studio II and his high school-aged daughter Janice programmed two games for it, Schoolhouse and Speedway/Tag.

Army of Zin", "com": "Just finished playing these two games and wanted to talk about them.<br><br>Starting with Ghosts to Glory. The ability system is noteworthy, for experienced players, it rewards mastery over the game, making Maximo super powerful if you are skilled enough to stay alive, while providing new players 3 permanent slots (or up to 6 later) so that they can keep their favorite abilities if they die. I do think there are 2 problems, the game does a poor job at explaining the system, I had a hard time figuring how it works initially, and that you can&#039;t unequip an ability once you get it.<br><br>The abilities keep the otherwise simple moveset from becoming boring, it also helps that the enemies die easily and are hard-hitting, leading to a nice pace of combat that 3D action games don&#039;t often have, giving the game an arcadey feel. One aspect I don&#039;t like is collecting souls, after a while it gets repetitive and boring, and it stops the otherwise great flow of gameplay.<br><br>I also really like the enemy design, some requires low attacks, attacks from above or behind to be taken out, it helps create the flow I talked about, making it a bit more strategic and making positioning during a fight more important. While individually they may be easy to kill, put different types of them together and you have a really hard game.

While that&#039;s not what I wanted out of the sequel, it&#039;s still a good game.<br><br>There are some direct improvements to this title, mainly the camera. Which you can now control with the left stick, or the R1 button like GtG (that can be readjusted while moving, thank god). One aspect that I do miss and one of my favorite stylistic choices is the angled camera in the first game, RIP. Also, having enemies drop souls instead was a great choice.<br><br>Gameplay wise the excellent ability system is now gone and replaced with a fine but unremarkable (and abuseable to grinding) shop system where you can buy them instead, they aren&#039;t as varied or overpowered since they are permanent, but the new weapon and combo attacks is what keeps the gameplay fresh instead. Overall, stringing attack combos on enemies is fun and I like the playstyle the hammer brings, the ice upgrade made it way more fun, freezing low priority targets to focus on the high priority ones with the sword.<br><br>My biggest gripe is how lacking the enemy design is in this game, despite some of them being more complex than the enemies in GtG, they are more unsatisfying to fight. The quantity of enemies increased and they are much tankier, leading to prolonged fights, often done in a certain area, before moving on to the next one, in contrast to GtG where fights were more spread out and done while platforming through the level. What really bothers me is how enemies are used. For the majority of the game, the same types of enemies are used together, which leads the player to use the same strategy everytime. I say majority because the first area of the game was great, it had different types of enemies, with different weakness that made fights interesting and varied. <br>However, I do love the bosses.

Every episode you enter has different parts swapped around and the episodes progress in a way that tells a small story about each level&#039;s inhabitants as you make your way through the level. For example, there are tourists at Sirena Beach that grow increasingly frustrated with the hotel&#039;s customer service as the levels progress, and there&#039;s a yellow pianta in Ricco Harbor that has a different excuse for shirking his work every episode with one exception where he hints at a hidden blue coin in the wall near him. Sunshine&#039;s episode structure enhances the worldbuilding which is something Sunshine focuses on a lot so to compromise that would detract from one of the game&#039;s best aspects. The things I would fix with Sunshine is make every episode in the game have 100 coins in it so you can get that shine in any episode and having skippable cutscenes. The big thing I would change is the progression system, though this is much more than the thread asks. I&#039;d make the shadow mario fights their own special encounters that appear after a certain number of shines so progression is tied to shine quantity rather than completing specific objectives. Ideally, Shadow Mario would work similarly to Galaxy&#039;s comet stars where after a certain # of shines collected, Shadow Mario appears in a level where defeating him yields a shine and progresses the story. 7 fights at 10 shine intervals for a total of 70 to unlock every fight and 78 to beat the game since shadow mario fights and final bowser give shines. The dark veil over delfino plaza goes away at 60 shines but you only need 58 to beat the game regularly so if you do the bare minimum one of the game&#039;s biggest problems goes unsolved, so by upping the requirement to 70 to beat the game makes sure all the bad stuff Bowser Jr. did to pollute the island gets fixed.

Now with this MiSTer test build and a display that supports Variable Refresh Rate, if there was a Mortal Kombat core, it can run at the proper 53.2Hz refresh rate</span><br><br>https://www.retrorgb.com/mister-fpg<wbr>a-news-updates-irem-arcade-games-ro<wbr>dland-vrr-and-more.html", "filename": "hidden gem", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 266, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672967675483316, "time": 1672967675, "md5": "f+trBiTf2V8QUxcHrx2sfA==", "fsize": 39563, "resto": 9546578}, {"no": 9546885, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)20:15:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9546862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9546862</a><br>I didn&#039;t consider the arcade bros out there, sorry about that.

First of all, those consoles like the MTV and IBM versions, those are licensed. That means those companies had to pay royalties for having their logo displayed. Right there, that&#039;s money being made before the hardware even sells. Secondly, limited run hardware is generally expected to sell out because it commands a higher demand and incentivizes more preorders -- so it&#039;s a great way to establish a profit baseline for a fiscal quarter earnings report. Also, it isn&#039;t uncommon for companies to produce a run of say, 20k units, only to hold back or repurchase a small portion of that stock with the intention of listing it on sites like eBay under an anonymous account at an inflated price; letting them clean up extra cash on the &quot;secondhand&quot; market with the stock they would normally offer at MSRP, all without damaging PR. You also have to take into account that this stuff is very cheap to produce; most of these &quot;special&quot; editions are nothing more than a printed logo or a swapped jewel, so they&#039;re losing very little by doing this.
