Simon beats the monster, but gets cursed - hence why in Simon&#039;s Quest he has to uncurse himself by, you guessed it, finding Dracula&#039;s different body parts in different places.<br>IV is like a &quot;good ending&quot; version of Castlevania 1, where Simon effectively vanquishes Dracula for good and you see him dying to the day light, burning out. No curse for Simon, and I think Gaibon is like a mini-version of Curse of Man, at least it sure looks like it.<br>People still discuss about this because the source of the lore is not very clear, although it&#039;s said to come from Akamatsu, the Castlevania creator who has disappeared from the public eye, and only 1 japanese guy who worked with him talked about this in recent years. But to me, it makes sense. Also the IV team being aware of this lore because the IV team is the only one that was in direct contact with Akamatsu (III and IV being developed around the same time, and Akamatsu giving personal advice to the IV team). After CV III, Akamatsu&#039;s team dissolved.

Big arcade chains like &quot;Dave and Busters&quot; will offer to sell their machines to smaller secondary arcade chains like &quot;Chucke E Cheese&quot;. And then once CEC is done with the arcade machine, it might get sold to a smaller independently owned &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; arcade businesses. Places that aren&#039;t chains.

It depends on how long the final owner wants to keep it. That&#039;s how these arcades end up in private owners hands. Sometimes arcade owners have warehouse storage and just shove old arcades into their warehouse for many years. <br><br>Sometimes you can just walk into an arcade and ask if an older arcade game is for sale. It might be. It happens far more often than you think. It depends on the mood of the arcade business owner. But be prepared to spend several hundred dollars (for standard old arcade cabinets) to maybe $1K to $2K for old 1990s deluxe arcade machines (like an old deluxe Time Crisis machine or an old deluxe House of the Dead machine). It really depends on the condition of the machine. Do all the joysticks, buttons, and monitors work? How big is the machine is, and how much space does it takes up? If a machine is really banged up, then usually you can negotiate a cheaper price. <br><br>Really vintage stuff like &quot;Pac Man&quot; is really in demand and usually sells for a higher price to collectors.
