Final Fantasy 7 is Anime as fuck so it would be hypocritical for me to judge Weiss as an anime trope and not everyone else. With that being said there&#039;s a matter in how it was handled. Rufus and his staff had a certain level of pragmatism even at their silliest. Hojo was going to make Aeris fuck a dog but I think that was meant to illustrate the complete lack of humanity Shinra as a whole had. Hojo didn&#039;t even know her name and considered her no more than a specimen to be observed, with Tifa calling out in shock that Aeris is a person. Something that doesn&#039;t even register to Hojo. The Neo Midgar plan itself is the most fucked up part because unlike most people, Shinra&#039;s upper management knows what Mako really is and how the Cetra felt about it. And rather than be enlightened by the Cetra&#039;s wisdom they bastardized it in an attempt to make infinite money out of a world they already own. Fucking Sephiroth was born from this one idea. There&#039;s no emotion behind what Shinra does, they&#039;re motivated by cold profit be it Rufus&#039;s unfeeling demeanor or Palmer&#039;s stupid ass personality. <br><br>And then you have whatever the fuck Weiss is.", "time": 1668621568, "resto": 9409603}, {"no": 9419624, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:40:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The word you&#039;re looking for to describe compilation nonsense is &quot;tone deaf&quot;.", "time": 1668624016, "resto": 9409603}, {"no": 9419665, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:02:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9410195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9410195</a><br>he does respond. he just doesnt saying anything verbally. he clearly reacts to what he sees", "time": 1668625355, "resto": 9409603}, {"no": 9419757, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:40:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9411745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9411745</a><br>Why would Red survive but humanity wouldn&#039;t?", "time": 1668627608, "resto": 9409603}, {"no": 9419765, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:42:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9419757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9419757</a><br>Because Holy isn&#039;t indiscriminate.

Tiger was in development for 18 months, and Leopard was in development for over 2 years. Now, they&#039;re pumping out a new version of Mac OS every year. The Mac team doesn&#039;t really have enough time to refine the software or to fully think through the features, so we will often get a half-baked release like Yosemite which is followed up by a &quot;stable&quot; release like El Capitan. And speaking of the Mac team, the political environment inside Apple has now changed. The iPhone has eclipsed the Mac as Apple&#039;s flagship product. Anyone who wants to advance within Apple knows that they need to get on the iOS team, so all the best talent goes there. The core Mac team is comprised of the also-rans, and some of the lower performers from the iOS team are sent over to the Mac team. These people are not stupid by any means, after all they work for Apple, but they are not Apple&#039;s A-Team.

Surreal and unsettling would be a good place to start. A weird curio from a bygone era? Yep. An avant-garde art piece? Yeah, probably that too. I&#039;m hesitant to call it a good game, because it&#039;s barely a game at all, but I&#039;ll certainly say this... it&#039;s interesting.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The game is extremely linear, mostly shuffling you around from location to location with a few things in any given environment to interact with and, once you do, you&#039;ll be shuffled off to the next area. This has the effect, intended or not, of making you feel rather uncomfortable as you&#039;re given virtually no control over anything. Practically every game amounts to simply doing what the developers intended, but it&#039;s rarely as on the nose as it is here, to the point that it feels less like exerting your own will and intellect to reach a desired conclusion that was planned by the developers and more like doing what they want, regardless of what you want. The distinction is arguably superficial but, in this case, it&#039;s palpable just the same.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graphically the game is a strange mishmash of steampunk, art deco, and some kind of unidentified Eastern Bloc country aesthetic. Things frequently take a turn for the surreal, and you often travel from one location to the next in something approximating an out of body experience - you&#039;ll be looking at a monitor of something and then suddenly move through the monitor into that location, for example.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adding to the surreal and unsettling quality is a fantastic, otherworldly soundtrack by Koji Ueno. It sometimes reminded me of the work of Akira Yamaoka, with things frequently turning into walls of abstract industrial noise. If the bizarre visuals and storytelling aren&#039;t enough to make you uneasy, the music ought to do the trick.</span><br><br>https://www.zombs-lair.com/gadget-c<wbr>ollection", "filename": "2glzDFD", "ext": ".png", "w": 510, "h": 750, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668506698232772, "time": 1668506698, "md5": "ivD+zb9HhdFodwBytFKC4g==", "fsize": 662825, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gadget-is-hard-to-describe-surreal-and-unsettling", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 8, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 9416705, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)07:11:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "tl;dr this movie game is a confusing mess of weirdass exposition being thrown at you and a world that barely explains itself but some movies were inspired by the hallway aesthetics and shit", "time": 1668514262, "resto": 9416592}, {"no": 9418062, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)20:26:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9416592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9416592</a><br>Not for me but you might want to post your review on specific websites.", "filename": "Screenshot_20191209-174533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 426, "h": 582, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1668562007356522, "time": 1668562007, "md5": "cgsLph56phR+8RYT3OLDHg==", "fsize": 151294, "resto": 9416592}, {"no": 9418945, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)06:37:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9418062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9418062</a><br>These are reviews from different websites.", "time": 1668598659, "resto": 9416592}, {"no": 9419107, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)09:04:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9416592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9416592</a><br>This game looks fucking awesome.

Mine is in a box right now, so I can&#039;t check \u2014but I think the 8820 and SD90 have two MIDI inputs each, so you can do 64 channels, but you could be sending to the wrong one or something weird.
