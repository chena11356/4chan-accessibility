And looks like Sonic was quite popular on it, ending the meme that &quot;no one knows Sonic in Japan&quot;\u2014MD simply sold like shit, and Sonic with it. <br>That said, the top was clearly dominated by RPGs, with Shining and Phantasy Star, and even games like Langrisser 2. No wonder Sega later wanted to have more RPGs on the platform. <br>Mega CD sold relatively well in Japan, so a few games for it made it to the top, like, interestingly, Silpheed, an even a fucking Night Trap.<br>Anyway, it&#039;s pretty surprising to see a list like this. Then again, it&#039;s clear that action games were far more popular in the West than in Japan, and it clearly had more appeal there with stuff like Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, Comix Zone, all the platformers, Mortal Kombat, sports games, and so on. <br>(1/3)", "filename": "Screen Shot 2022-12-16 at 15.29.56", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 696, "h": 978, "tn_w": 177, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671212298281865, "time": 1671212298, "md5": "g5IcGCx40HKlBYaslajQBw==", "fsize": 184948, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "so-ive-been-trying-to-understand-how-exactly-is", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 166, "images": 29, "unique_ips": 42}, {"no": 9495735, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)12:40:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9495731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495731</a><br>another chart (from https://www.gavas.jp/user_data/mega<wbr>drive_game_ranking.php )", "filename": "md", "ext": ".png", "w": 898, "h": 2248, "tn_w": 49, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671212407309056, "time": 1671212407, "md5": "BJUSETBR7YxG055IaHcxzw==", "fsize": 568694, "resto": 9495731}, {"no": 9495748, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)12:47:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9495731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495731</a><br>Sonic 1 only sold 260000??

As is pretty evident, Wii&#039;s console sales numbers (12 million in Japan, 48 million in NA, 40 million in other regions) were driven mostly by the casual games. NSMB and Mario Kart Wii were kind of in-between, and they sold big; but then it&#039;s all Wii Play, Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Wii Party, Mario Party, and other stuff like that (note though that many of those games were bundled). You have Brawl at #9, which again is in-between casual and hardcore, then you have Animal Crossing at #11, and finally something that more or less fits the definition of a &quot;hardcore audience&quot; game in Monster Hunter 3 at a little over 1 mln sold. <br>Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 both sit right under it, also selling slightly over 1 mln. So basically each one sold less than SM64 (1.9 mln) (that&#039;s considering N64 sold about 5.5 mln in Japan, and Wii did 12 mln).

Basically the analog stick started dropping inputs, so for example if you were running forward as Link in OoT he would stop and start - essentially unusable. Both had the exact same problem. <br>Unfortunately they both had fallen just outside the warranty window, and their support didn&#039;t even reply when I sent them like a &quot;Hey, anything I can try to do to fix these?&quot; <br>About a year later someone on twitter was asking about them, and I outlined that whole chain of events to them and said that I don&#039;t recommend them at all. From that tweet, their PR/customer support team reached out to me and ultimately actually shipped me two of the newer wireless versions by way of apology. And the wireless one has held up a lot better than the originals. At least, so far. <br>So maybe the takeaway is, they used to be utter crap, and now are (hopefully) a lot better. The analog stick on all of these these is just kind of weird though. <br><br>In the interim I used the wired Retro-Bit Tribute64 (which is modeled after the famous Hori N64 controller) and I actually liked this a lot better than any of the Brawler64s. The only problem with these is that the connector has an absolute death grip on the controller port, which is why I switched back to the wireless Brawler64 for right now - since I didn&#039;t want to be unplugging and replugging that controller all the time, and wireless controllers just keep things a bit more tidy. You know how it is. <br><br>There is an N64 controller purist on this board who will tell you that the analog stick sensitivity and deadzones of any of these 3rd party controllers is crap compared to the original - he&#039;s got charts and whatnot to back it up. He&#039;s probably right, but it&#039;s never really bothered me and or caused any real problems.<br><br>Of these I&#039;d recommend the Tribute64 first.", "time": 1670950508, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488501, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:34:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>i would FUCK lenore<br><a href=\"#p9487536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487536</a><br>yes", "time": 1670952875, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488537, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>What the fuck is that worm-like thing on top of the TV?", "time": 1670954061, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488540, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_2933", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3120, "h": 2080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1670954081568968, "time": 1670954081, "md5": "MQ5LotAcZ3SlN+b/piGZ6Q==", "fsize": 965843, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488542, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488456</a><br>Thats a bit annoying i hate wireless stuff but if those are better maybe they made changes in the wired also?

If you can do that youre only 1-2 attempts from beating the game. I find your philosophy on save states for practice interesting. Giving youself the freedom to break a challenge into rehersable chunks instead of a blind gaunlet really only has one difference in that it takes less time to master. The end result once you do the full run is the same so i&#039;d argue that its fine.

It has cool scaling and is one of the better looking games for the add-on. The animation is original, and made for the game. Even if it is a bit grainy. They don&#039;t use any licensed music, for whatever reason, so its all original composition. I think it&#039;s good. Cool looking arcade style shooter. It was like a sequel to Batman Returns driving sections. Batman returns for the Sega CD is a port of the Genesis game, but contains a CD soundtrack, these scaling driving sections ad some cutscenes using the scaling hardware. The driving sections in Batman Returns could be played on their own. I honestly think it is harder than the Genesis game overall.

Pattern recognition is a form of puzzle solving, where the player is rewarded for how quickly they can recognize and adapt to a challenge with an equal amount of skill execution thrown on top. The appeal of a single player action game is that once you&#039;ve passed a skill check you move onto the next one in increasing levels of difficulty and complexity. Pvp and multiplayer in general is great for creating dynamic and evolving scenarios but it also doesnt give the player and clear linear progression of their skills or promise any variety to foster it. Theres a reason at uni I mostly made couch multiplayer games. It was a cheap shorthand to getting emergent play out of a few design elements. Put a character controller in a room with a ball they have to roll into a basket? Boring. Put two character controllers in a room with baskets for each of them? Watch the strategies emerge, add a few rock paper scissors elements and boom. good grades.

I see a lot of shmups where the skill needed actually declines to more powerful you become. The scrolling sections become pushovers and the only threats being anything that can live to get a shot off and the bosses that can tank the damage. Its easy to develop bad habits when you spend most of a stage not seeing a single attack pattern. When a threat comes around that does challenge your damage output losing that output is a death sentence when you have so little familiarity with the stage.

At least for US output, however, that meant that you were more likely to get slower, thought-provoking games, rather than faster, dexterity-challenging games.

Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist.

It&#039;s a weird game in the series, it acts as a continuation of SH1&#039;s plot while telling a more personal narrative about Heather like SH2, making it feel &quot;redundant&quot; in ways. SH3 both tries to tell a deeper narrative happening around the protagonist and those around her but also have her experience her own personal journey, it&#039;s a very ambitious narrative that, overall, I would say works out well but doesn&#039;t feel quite as cohesive as the prior two entries. Generally I think people see SH3 as having &quot;less meaning&quot; in what the game, and this is true in a few regards but still pretty inaccurate to the overall. Honestly I think the symbolism and themes go over people&#039;s heads because they&#039;re so heavily based in the feminine experience. If you&#039;re a guy I feel like it&#039;s likely you just kind of don&#039;t think about things like the game&#039;s various menstrual imagery, though some things like the hole leading to the final boss are hard to miss.<br><br>I always have a hard time deciding between SH1 and SH3 as my personal favorite. SH3 has a lot going for it with the most refined gameplay and graphics of the series, but it&#039;s also the most obviously compromised of the first three games. The game has essentially no exploration outside of the dungeons and a handful of &quot;grab thing, walk a room over, use thing&quot; moments. It&#039;s a great game on its own merits, but how it compares to prior entries and their strengths gives a lot of differing thoughts. I would say that, as simply a &quot;video game&quot;, that SH3 is the best, as to be expected being the newest, but it&#039;s clear pure gameplay is not why people love horror games.", "filename": "Ffn6nbWVQAAigcN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670955746219477, "time": 1670955746, "md5": "PMYuoi9u29tzPP5ZgPM7Cg==", "fsize": 63545, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488604, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Allow me to put this retarded discussion to rest.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 wikipedia is wrong </span><br>Okay school teacher.", "filename": "1649719663676", "ext": ".png", "w": 552, "h": 32, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 7, "tim": 1670955848062248, "time": 1670955848, "md5": "SWb5cKYBsciKWJJ4uj/yWQ==", "fsize": 5896, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488609, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488604</a><br>I know you must be genuinely retarded but yes, that is why wikipedia is generally agreed to be a fucking non source for anything unless wikipedia directly links to the actual source, literally fucking anyone can write in it and unless someone decides that what was written was wrong (and the cucks in charge agree with the changes) then that is the information present <br><br>fuck off literal NPC", "time": 1670956080, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488610, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *actual*, real thing that separates a &quot;survival horror&quot; game from something else is the true permanence of consequence</span><br>That has literally nothing to do with survival horror.

If I can add my two cents, SH 2 had the best story of the 3 games in my opinion, but only because the personal and &quot;simple&quot; nature of it all really suited the gameplay of Silent Hill. As in, minimal cutscenes and exposition dumps and long stretches of just pure gameplay. <br><br>However, Heather is my one of my favorite protagonists ever and I still really enjoyed SH3. <a href=\"#p9482770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482770</a><br><a href=\"#p9482789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482789</a><br><a href=\"#p9482861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482861</a><br>If I could add, I&#039;d say the biggest issue SH3 had was the pacing.

You get one minor moment with Vincent in the office, and then that&#039;s it until the apartments. And by that point? <s>You basically hit the halfway mark of the game, you get the big reveal immediately, and then everything kicks into overdrive as you finally get to Silent Hill itself</s>.

I&#039;m playing it now and I have to say that I completely disagree.<br>The controls are super sluggish, especially whenever you&#039;re in the air. In the first game you slowed down when jumping, but it still felt pretty satisfying; in Metroid 2 it&#039;s way too slow. Specifically, there&#039;s a big problem with how long you can hold the A button to jump. In Metroid 1, whenever you release the button, you immediately stop rising and begin falling. In Metroid 2, however, after a certain point, it becomes impossible to cancel out your jump, so even if you let go of the button, Samus will continue to rise, and this feels really shitty. If you&#039;ve played the game you&#039;ll know what I mean.<br>The screen is way too zoomed in and it&#039;s retarded that there&#039;s no automap. In Metroid 1 they advised you to make your own map, and that&#039;s what I did, but such a recommendation is not repeated in Metroid 2&#039;s manual, and making your own map would fucking suck because of how zoomed in the screen is. So I&#039;ve spent ages going over the same little bit of area with the shitty sluggish controls and ear rape music (trying to be suspenseful and atmospheric on the Gameboy was an ambitious concept but it falls flat on its face, it&#039;s just a bunch of irritating beeping) and can&#039;t find the gay fucking Metroid.

But the game has some slowdowns. Check the overclock mod if you care about more performance.<br>- The fan is NOISY, if you care about noise check the noctua fan mod. <br>- Lightgun games, if you have CRT TV go for it, LCD lightgun mods are expensive.<br>- Fighting games, worth playing, look and sound great, go for it unless you want to use an arcade stick. <br>- Resident Evil, Skies of Arcadia, Jet Set Radio, worth it. <br>- Soul Reaver has better models and effects that the PC version, worth it. <br>- Tony Hawk 2 runs at 30fps. Xbox has better textures and it&#039;s a different game (2X), better version, but dreamcast has the &quot;proper classic&quot; version. <br>- Rayman 2 worth it because it&#039;s closer to the &quot;classic&quot; version. <br>- The 480p picture quality makes this console a MUST. It&#039;s amazing to play 90s games in this resolution. <br>- DCHDMI isn&#039;t worth it.

It punishes failure heavily, but it never ends the game for you. A determined player can easily kill MB without taking a hit, if they choose to keep trying the fight rather than stock up on health.

Meanwhile, SFC had about 16 mln by 1995, and PCE had ~8 mln (of which 6 were PCE and 1.9 mln of Turbo Duo, also add 0.9 mln of CD-ROM2).<br>Basically, that means that MD was at most just 15% of the market, and SFC was like 60%, rest was PCE. So it was like the situation with Saturn vs PSX and N64 in the West. Few big companies wanted to make original games for it, because there was no reason to.<br>Small install base, tiny game sales in the order of ~200k for big hits (see <a href=\"/vr/thread/9495731#p9495731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495731</a> ). All this meant it was unfeasible to make an RPG for MD alone, unless we&#039;re talking ports.<br>2. The console was just the worst fit for RPGs out of the 3. SFC was the obvious most popular choice (biggest brand, Square &amp; Enix, fitting hardware). PCE came out earlier, already had a more popular CD add-on, meaning that it would attract most of the RPG devs that weren&#039;t satisfied with Nintendo for some reason, and/or wanted the benefits of the CD. <br>MD was made for fast-paced arcades. It had no real advantage over competition when it came to RPGs. Also, no one mentioned this yet, but there&#039;s this weird thing that few games on MD had saves to begin with. <br>Maybe that&#039;s why most 3rd party devs like Treasure were making fast arcade action games for the platform.<br>^With all that said, RPGs still dominated the sales of MD games (see <a href=\"/vr/thread/9495731#p9495731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495731</a><br>and <a href=\"/vr/thread/9495731#p9495735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495735</a> ), which is kind of ironic.

The blackjack (note: there is no specific spot you have to hit guards with it, you can do it from any direction, even the front, provided they aren&#039;t in combat) works as a mechanic, because the choice to use it or not use it changes the way the game it played, if you knock guards out you get the burden of hiding their bodies, so other AI don&#039;t see them.

First Doki because they got the contract to do a game using those mascots, then Mario for the western release and future releases.<br><br>If they didn&#039;t get the deal to make Doki, it could have gone either way if it was released at all. Releasing it as a budget disk title with minimal risk since they were contracted to release ANY game using those characters gave them an easy way to test this vertical focused platformer they had been dicking with. The arabian themes are leftover from that version, probably, but thats still literally a skin applied to something that they were working on that had no identity attached to it yet. Without Doki, it either would have been a scrapped project, gotten a new IP attached to it or they eventually would have decided to just use Mario anyway seeing as it was being designed as a successor to Super Mario THE GAME. Doki was not 100% designed from the ground up just for that ip to have a game, it was a skin given to concepts already in the development phase.<br><br>So yes, BOTH Mario 2 games are sequels to Super Mario Bros. 2 Japan is a literal continuation of the same first game while USA/Doki/US 2 is a sequel to trying new things with the ideas and gameplay of Super Mario they had already done.", "time": 1671532406, "resto": 9498840}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9504363, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:56:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyanon know what game this is?", "filename": "7742DA9C-6367-40B2-8EB3-892FBDDC63A5", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2318, "h": 1908, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 205, "tim": 1671530210690440, "time": 1671530210, "md5": "d1TBNrKSGVfBxpVO4a6BMA==", "fsize": 1395770, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-anyanon-know-what-game-this-is", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 9504367, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:57:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Gunner&#039;s Heaven", "time": 1671530253, "resto": 9504363}, {"no": 9504369, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:58:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9504363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9504363</a><br>Rapid reload", "time": 1671530319, "resto": 9504363}, {"no": 9504385, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)05:15:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9504367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9504367</a><br>Thanks!

It&#039;s been known since forever ago that Woolsey didn&#039;t deliver the most faithful translation, not to mention all the censorship, which is why we got that old Sky Render fan translation over twenty years ago (that we now know to be amateurish as fuck). Then the GBA game came out, and its translation was recognized to be much more accurate, but it had two problems: first, by that point, Woolsey&#039;s script had obtained meme status, and while the GBA script kept some of his lines, it changed or tossed enough of them out to piss a vocal part of the fanbase off. Second, the GBA version had problems of its own, namely shit music, slowdown and lower resolution, among others. So now you have a bunch of Woolsey fanboys who like the idea of a more accurate script while still staying true to the Woolsey &quot;flavor&quot;, all on the mostly superior SNES version, and before long, we got the Ted Woolsey Uncensored hack. Problem is, its creator didn&#039;t know a lick of moon, so all he did was mix and match bits and pieces of the Woolsey, GBA and Sky Render scripts as he pleased, and to top it off, he decided to also make it an overarching &quot;game improvement&quot; hack that fixed a gorillion longstanding bugs and added QoL changes. This effectively set the mold for all like-minded hacks that followed, all of which were made by people with no nip-speaking credentials, and all of which were convinced they could do it better than the last, especially given they&#039;re not constrained to just script changes, but outright game changes as well, so every new release is just feature creep.

I played Red and Yellow before I played FireRed and honestly don&#039;t really prefer one version over the other. I think the original games had better music and a handful of better lines of dialogue, but FRLG was pretty great otherwise. I like held items, natures and all the other gen 3 junk and honestly like being able to play Red or Green with that stuff thrown in. I liked the way the Pokedex was presented and how the game gives you a little recap of what you last did whenever you load a save. The Sevii Islands were boring though, and the battle sprites should have been animated like they were in Emerald.<br><br><a href=\"#p9501003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9501003</a><br>I liked Pearl but not enough to have ever replayed it since it came out.

For example, Star Fox on real hardware: <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaW<wbr>PTnHUEAY<br>(note how the intro cut sscene ends at the right music cue) <br><br>30fps overclock: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ6<wbr>pWTe-Sd8<br><br>Polygon cutscene ends way before the music ends. The devs designed Star Fox around its awful framerate. In order to make Star Fox look right at 60fps, the game would have to be modified to match the timing of the new framerate. I always heard that EAD synced the first stage Corneria to Dire Straights Money for Nothing (not sure what cut).The giant robots that are carrying items in the stage are suppose to be a reference to the two CG &#039;movers&#039; in the original Dire Straights music video. <br><br>https://youtu.be/lAD6Obi7Cag?t=89<br>https://youtu.be/zaWPTnHUEAY?t=343", "time": 1670719723, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9481867, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)19:54:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9478253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9478253</a><br>looking very forward too playing this once it&#039;s done anon", "time": 1670720073, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9481903, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)20:08:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9481853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9481853</a><br>They hacked around it a fair amount in EX, I just don&#039;t think they did it enough for 60 and some stuff just feels too zippy. 30 seems okay enough.", "time": 1670720892, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482017, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:14:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Toad", "time": 1670724847, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482186, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)22:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9475186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9475186</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is your dream game, /vr/ ?</span><br>claymation car combat platformer with lolis", "time": 1670729321, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482197, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)22:32:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>The only SMW hacks that stood out to me were the single screen puzzles", "time": 1670729572, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482213, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)22:39:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>Mario World From Memory is a really good hack", "time": 1670729943, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482270, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)23:01:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "$R27JUY6", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670731306957989, "time": 1670731306, "md5": "fVg4dpe68h+LIR2NgepT7Q==", "fsize": 3139477, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482496, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)23:58:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>i like fatass peach", "filename": "peachs_adventure_green_hill2", "ext": ".png", "w": 1233, "h": 1069, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1670734706121212, "time": 1670734706, "md5": "16vgGSuTKYAguWjkaq7AIg==", "fsize": 1318967, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482518, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:06:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480292</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMS<wbr>vpE-sKcs<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjQ<wbr>BPLb8zsk", "time": 1670735196, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482631, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:46:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/50<wbr>25/", "time": 1670737603, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9482645, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:53:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9482270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482270</a><br>update never ever", "time": 1670737982, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9483391, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)10:44:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Commodore VIC-20 port of H.E.R.O. is a masterpiece, probably the best game for this almost computer.", "filename": "hero", "ext": ".gif", "w": 256, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1670773494165885, "time": 1670773494, "md5": "Of6WBSl7KSJudIoVGWA7lg==", "fsize": 905062, "resto": 9475184}, {"no": 9483657, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)13:47:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9482496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9482496</a><br>Hey!

A fire of seething hatred will light in their eyes every time my numerous progeny even think of Super Castlevania IV. Then, I will encourage them to get &#039;their&#039; opinions out there by becoming essayists, reviewers, telling their friends, etc. They will spread and eventually multiply. Soon enough, popular opinion will turn completely and utterly against Super Castlevania IV. While you lot laments at how zoomies just don&#039;t get it, I will have weaponized them to my own ends.

Battling itself actually helps remove monsters stress. As you accumulate larger amounts of cash, it&#039;s definitely good to prioritize buying all the more expensive stress relieving, fatigue relieving, and sleep helping items you&#039;ll see in the shop like the cups and gems, as can afford them of course, don&#039;t skip out on them, they&#039;ll make it easier for new monsters. Also don&#039;t let your monster get fat or malnourished, fat monsters get fatigued more and underweight monsters get stressed more.<br><br>Also take it easy on baby monsters, just do the most basic training until its more mature aka when Holly tells gives you that cue that it&#039;s an &quot;important time&quot; or whatever she says, that&#039;s when you start the coach routines<br><br>Always focus on like 3, maybe 4 main stats to train your monster in. Having a balanced monster doesn&#039;t really work because there&#039;s only so much time you can put into training during its lifespan, you want your monster to excel hard in specific areas, not be average in many areas, so take that into consideration when deciding what monster you wanna raise and how you want it to grow/what moves you want it to learn<br><br>When you&#039;re stronger and start doing sparring with the intention of learning new moves specifically, it&#039;s not really worth it unless you&#039;re gonna learn a new move, so don&#039;t bother wasting the money and time unless it says there&#039;s a chance your monster will learn a new move, and honestly I say theres no shame in saving before and restarting until you learn the move", "time": 1670371774, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9471981, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Jell<br>but the one I used to win with was Hare", "time": 1670372119, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472112, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:14:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471460</a><br><a href=\"#p9471549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471549</a><br>What are you doing, dude?", "filename": "1308028510381", "ext": ".png", "w": 496, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1670375679755307, "time": 1670375679, "md5": "vQBz/xGhIxFw/6o0Q324aA==", "fsize": 134450, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472651, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)00:50:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Kato, named him Risk and built him pure agi and int?/tech?(the one that increases the damage of the green skills) and spammed the twister/tornado claw.

By the time thedid rapidly expand, it was younger people making the stories, who had a different perception of WWII and Japan as a whole. since the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s Japan has just very heavily leaned into using young people in media. <br><br>On the contrast to what the west was doing. The growth of hollywood never stopped during the war, only shifted. And the stream of stories was always on the middle aged. It wasn&#039;t till the 50&#039;s that the west also started incorporating young people into their stories. <br><br>I think FFX suffers from some slight issues, as far as intent and facts though. Auron is supposed to old at age 35 and even refers to himself as young 10 years ago, when he was 25. Yet we have a maester who has served for some 70 years. I think what happens is characters get designed and created and then put into a story and not organically written. So it&#039;s part of the overall media franchise machine.", "time": 1670852896, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485524, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:21:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9469583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9469583</a><br>I have caused multiple hookups to lactate by sucking on their tits long enough", "time": 1670854905, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485536, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:36:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9483121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483121</a><br>IIRC, doesn&#039;t Kimahri just carry her during that sequence?", "time": 1670855801, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485890, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)12:23:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9469583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9469583</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><s>You realize milk only comes after childbirth right</s><br>You do realise that men can also lactate without having given birth?", "time": 1670865797, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485970, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)12:59:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9484332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9484332</a><br>So I&#039;m replaying X-2 and it just dawned on me, does the HD version of X-2 still use Wakka&#039;s old model when X doesn&#039;t?

Discussion about game linearity is often completely misguided. Certain games SHOULD be linear, and FFX is one of them.<br>If someone wants to play a game where the party wanders around randomly and gradually progresses to The Big Bad, they have that. Even in Final Fantasy, you can play FF1 or FF2 and make your way through the landscape between objectives. Games like Baldur&#039;s Gate and Morrowind have the player starting off largely irrelevant and wandering widely to gain experience, only later returning to address the surrounding region&#039;s rising concerns. But then in Baldur&#039;s Gate 2, the game becomes much more linear, and this is because the party is focused on a specific path from the start. Some players (even today) resent that BG2 is so much more linear, but the dissonance between the linearity of the story and the bits of side questing thrown in to stay true to the prequel is noticeable; the player can&#039;t help but wonder why &quot;the big concern&quot; can be put off indefinitely while they buy beers for kids in some random town.<br>FFX did this right, the party knows what they have to do and they mostly go in that direction (IIRC, it&#039;s been a long time).

I just feel like the actual core gameplay in 2k4 is meh, meaning the deathmatching. The actual team-based modes are actually really fun, and great! ...but they don&#039;t feel like Unreal.

There&#039;s a lot to be said about what went wrong with the 2010 reboot (and there was a lot), but setting aside the fact that they likely were simply uninterested in the legal risks of using the roided out Jason look from the original arcade game, going by the mask from Splatterhouse 3 was the most aesthetically interesting choice.<br>Theoretically more marketable too, with his cool look which stands out, if the game hadn&#039;t fallen on its face.<br><br>I hope Namco gives Splatterhouse another chance one day.", "filename": "Rick Taylor through the ages", "ext": ".png", "w": 1134, "h": 210, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 23, "tim": 1671373570585833, "time": 1671373570, "md5": "VTFQQVpTvrG20yHj6aooXg==", "fsize": 14839, "resto": 9496612}, {"no": 9500973, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)18:54:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9500025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9500025</a><br>You have a source for that original plot for the game?", "time": 1671407696, "resto": 9496612}, {"no": 9501448, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)23:03:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9500973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9500973</a><br>I&#039;m trying to find that, but it seems that I cannot, so I wonder actually if this is something I&#039;m misremembering, or if I&#039;m repeating something I read or was told which wasn&#039;t fully accurate.
