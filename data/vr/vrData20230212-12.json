Some games just slap skip on the start button without telling you so, when it acts as pause everywhere else in the game and that&#039;s stupid and counter-intuitive. A perfect way to do this is to have the start button pause the cutscene and then offer you an option to skip or resume it, like in MGS4 or the Yakuza series, for example.

Growing up without really using the internet I didn\u2019t even know there was a console war. I played gameboy and NES and later on N64 and Gameboy Color and then GameCube and Gameboy Advance then Wii and DS and I just never ran out of things to play. I also wasn\u2019t exactly rich so I hardly even came close to playing everything. Looking back at PS1 and 2s vast library I nor any of my friends, even my well off ones, had even half the games on those lists and knew of maybe only a couple of the larger ones like Metal Gear Solid they never got. Comparing something retroactively to its potential versus its actuality is a bit foolish. Games were expensive when you were a kid, piracy hardly golden. Hell, one of my friends wanted to borrow a game to pirate a copy for himself and he ended up destroying my disk, so I was very piracy averse after that experience for years. If you want to compare and argue about it now potential matters, but I don\u2019t think it matters when you actually talk about the reality of the situation. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had Symphony of the Night growing up, nowadays it\u2019s my second favorite Castlevania behind Rondo of Blood and only slightly beating out Castlevania 3. But I didn\u2019t play any of these games before I was an adult, what I played growing up was was Castlevania 1 and 2 on my dads NES, and I didn\u2019t play any of the ones on my N64 because. Well I never actually saw any at GameStop or at a yard sale. I played rogue squadron and army men and Mario and Zelda. My pals with their PlayStations played Spyro and Crash and a lot of shitty shovelware I don\u2019t really remember (like army men Kek)<br><br>And we all played on our game boys and gameboy advances because that\u2019s just what you did.

There are a number of reasons for me.<br><br>1. First off, I don\u2019t pay hundreds of dollars for anything emulatable. The only game I\u2019ve ever spent over $100 on is a PS3 game that emulates like absolute shit. I might buy Steel Battalion someday. I VERY rarely spend more than $30 even. I just have a lot of old stuff and hunt for deals, which is part of the fun for me<br><br>2. I like to browse. Buying physical games from my local shop keeps them in business so I can browse. This is actually helped by the prices of sought-after games shooting up\u2014since those are unavailable I look over the shelf for something affordable that seems interesting. It pushes me to explore the console\u2019s library more and I\u2019ve found some of my favorite games of all time this way.<br><br>3. While I don\u2019t intentionally buy games as an investment, the value of my collection is at this point far beyond what I paid for it. If I managed to sell my collection off at going rate (unlikely without years of work, I know) I could pay the down payment on a house at this point<br><br>4. If I have a big rom list I just don\u2019t play anything. Having physical games in my shelf encourages me to play through them, and browsing what I have can remind me to start or finish a game. It creates a contact point that just doesn\u2019t exist for a rom list.<br><br>5. Maybe the most schizo point, but I don\u2019t trust that piracy will remain as easy at it is now forever. Just because the internet has stayed relatively unregulated for this long doesn\u2019t mean it will be that way forever. I could write a manifesto about this but won\u2019t here and now.<br><br>6. They\u2019re neato and old hardware is cool. Fixing consoles and such taught me soldering skills that I\u2019ve used to make money as a side hustle. I like being the guy with shelves of old games. My friends think its cool I have certain rare games.

Unfortunately I lost most of my childhood game collection through selling and trading, and I don&#039;t really have much left. It&#039;s really sad actually. After I moved overseas I started my collection by picking up various games that I enjoyed as a kid. That was basically my only goal in the beginning, but after a while I started branching out and picking up games I&#039;ve never played and ultimately that&#039;s where most of my collection has come from and has led to the most enjoyment. It&#039;s nice to be able to pull out a game I liked as a kid, and it&#039;s nice to be able to open the closet or look over at the shelf and see a collection that I would have been so jealous of when I was younger. Like you said, a lot of great memories get attached to this stuff and playing and bring you back to another time.

I can offer some of their thoughts. <br><br>Some arcade machines kept track of how much they earned in the hidden operator test settings. Data would display on how much money/quarters that players put inside the machine on each difficulty. You could track the data. <br><br>If you made the difficulty too high, then casual players would give up and stop playing because it was too hard.<br><br>If you made it too easy, then the game wouldn&#039;t be seen as a challenge and your casual players would easily beat the on less quarters. Which means you earn less money.<br><br>The idea was to find the perfect middle ground. You could adjust default CPU difficulty on a scale from level 1 to level 10 in many games.<br><br>If your arcade was in an area with mostly casual players and children, then you kept the difficulty on moderate. You go easy on the kids to lure more quarters out of them. Give them just enough hope and they will give you more quarters. <br><br>For an arcade that had a lot of &quot;pro players&quot;, operators kept the difficulty on high because they would be more of a challenge to pro players. <br><br>For some games like Fighting games, you could even adjust the default damage level.<br><br>For example, in the Philippines the the damage level was actually kept on 50% instead of the normal 100%. Kids didn&#039;t have a lot of money, so arcade owners would lower the damage so the players that visited often would be able to &quot;feel&quot; like they got their money&#039;s worth. Matches would be extra long due to lower damage. But this kept visitors coming to arcades. This happened in many countries in Asia, South America, and the Pacific Islands where kids had less money. <br><br>In America and Europe the damage was set to 100%<br><br>This led to an interesting scenario in &quot;Marvel VS Capcom 2&quot; when they were trying to host worldwide tournaments.

If the damage level is set to 50%, then suddenly your combos that would kill the enemy team will still leave them alive.<br><br>So there were debates and arguments between players about it.

All on eBay. 2/3 were Japanese used: 1000 and 1100. Had to return the &quot;excellent condition FW 3.18&quot; for being the latest firmware and having severe burn-in from the hot charging port. The other JP one arrived perfectly, exactly as the seller and I personally discussed, and had the correct FW, no mura spots, no burn-in.<br>It does matter to get a 3.60 or lower firmware, people are lying when they say high FW can easily get CFW.<br>Ordered a US 1000 Vita to replace the returned 1100.<br>No interest in the 2000. The IPS is easier to take care of and internal memory card is convenient but offers no good sub pixel arrangement for crispness, no good blacks or contrasts, plus the 1000 OLED has good motion controls.<br>The OLED must be properly cared for though. You can&#039;t overcharge it or max the current to 2A over 5v constantly or you&#039;ll get burn-in. And you need a sleep timer or screensaver to prevent mura/splotches from developing, and set the brightness low most of the time for the same reason. It&#039;s actually worrying how bright it is at max. Halfway was still pretty bright in light and minimum is highly visible in the dark. So far this Vita looks pretty worth it. I love my PSP and it won&#039;t replace it for those games or the superior XMB clicky sounds but Vita is very good at its own thing.<br>If you&#039;re willing to message sellers directly and talk like a human being, you&#039;ll get a really sweet deal on an excellent condition Vita and then it&#039;s just a matter of taking care of it properly.<br>One more thing. The JP vitas have a different battery model in them than the US and EU versions. They&#039;re all the same true capacity BUT the JPN ones have the top &amp; bottom 20%-iles locked off. For most people, this will help them not wreck their batteries in 3 years. For power users, it could be a concern if you need the freedom.

The most Important things I can remember:<br><br>- Buttons and d-pad are on a whole new level compared to the RG351V I own,Provided that you like clicky tactile feedback.<br><br>- The short grips don&#039;t make it comfortable for twin stick gameplay. If you want to play FPS, get something bigger with grips that extend downwards, like the ones in the top corners. Or a smartphone clip for a ds4 or XB controller.<br><br>- It&#039;s not a great solution if you are going to use it on the go during short commutes, or if you have to change trains every 15-20 min. With no built-in battery and no off-button it keeps draining the phone&#039;s battery all the time, so you will want to disassemble it as soon as your train or bus gets to destination (and you need to be careful to not mess the usb port on the phone, that spring is extra strong).<br><br>Nothing of this is a problem if you will use it at home or get to sit on on public transport for 40 minutes without interruptions.<br><br>- Think carefully about which model you want, USB-C or Bluetooth. Many Android games don&#039;t support USB controllers (Apex Legends, but that one is dead now).

You can explore towns, talk to people, shop, etc However the combat is tactical grid based. Unlike in FE or Famicom Wars, an attacked unit will not retaliate on the turn it is attacked. Gameplay is based around generals, the player has up to 4 teams each with 1 general and 5 units composed of fighters, archers, and mages (offensive or defensive). Units belonging to a general can not leave the current screen the general is on, so it is him that gives the overall movement of the team.<br>Nice graphics and musics. Difficulty a bit on the easy side. You can replay battles to grind for exp/gold and the game seems to expect you to do that at least if you want to buy an acceptable amount of gear in shops.<br>What&#039;s impressive about it is the amount of characters the game can have on the screen at once. The game uses background graphics for the characters, unless it is currently the unit in play in which case it will turn into sprites for the time being. Smart.<br>On the bad side, the game rarely goes beyond the battle-&gt;town-&gt;repeat routine. Most of the game has the same two musics on loop (battle and town), despite the musics being of quality.

And if that wasn&#039;t enough, most items from chests in dungeons respawn so it is easy to farm them (MP refills or sell for money etc) <br><br>Some interesting mechanics, the main one being that you can have up to 3 parties you can switch to in combat. The first party is your main characters, hero+warrior+mage. The second party is made of &quot;Idols&quot;, godly creatures that you find along the way and which mostly just use spells and are AI controlled. The third party consists of soldiers you can hire, you must pay for them and their gear so I never bothered with them. Only the party active at the end of a battle recieves exp. Idols may be fused together to create new idols, however they&#039;ll start over from lvl1, though usually know better spells so it is worth it.<br>Also you can pawn items instead of selling them.<br><br>The game is huge and there are a lot of dungeons, some of which can get a bit mazey, but the dungeons look great and most of them have dedicated art and palettes.<br>The overworld is huge also and once you get the boat, it&#039;s like looking for a needle in a haystack, again and again...

Everything is made to make you realize they were going through their own adventures of their own while you were. This gives them weight and personality and puts everyone on the same level. How many RPGs have each character put on the same level of importance like that? Certainly not DQ3.<br>- The way towns work like hubs. You usually use the same town in between several small quests; either that or there is a good reason to come back to the town later on. This makes the world feel organic, real; vs the tired routine &quot;each area is composed of one town, one dungeon, clear that, reach next area, repeat&quot; which DQ3 started.<br>- The adventure elements, namely the treasure hunting; DQ2 probably started the &quot;you must find X number of magical key items as a goal&quot; trope for jRPGs (unless you count Zelda as an RPG), but unlike later/other use of that trope in which the key item is merely a meaningless token for denoting that you beat a dungeon; here you must go through adventure game mechanics to acquire them, acquire clues, solve puzzle, beat dungeons too sure but not only, and almost each one is acquired differently.

Graphics are good enough but nothing extraordinary, some of the enemies don&#039;t look very good; but they are very varied with lot&#039;s of different locations.<br>Some interesting mechanics: there is a party chat you can use to remember what to do next and there is a seperate bag for inventory items (which can contain up to 100 items!), two things the DQ series would only introduce later on. Money is used to buy items (but not equipment, which is only found) but it is also used to cast spells and you only earn money from fights once you get back to a town.<br>Spells are treated like inventory items, so you can assign them to whomever, with the added downside of clogging the inventories quickly.

When a character dies, he&#039;s back to 1HP once the fight is over. If the entire party dies, you&#039;re back to the last save location (in a town) but you lose neither progress nor money. So the game is very lenient and just wants you to have a good time; but you still don&#039;t want to die in combat (no reviving) and enemies remain strong, so despite being a leniant game with no grinding, combat still manages to remain engaging.<br>On the downside, only a few defensive spells work at all during boss fights, few combat items did too; so it&#039;s all just the attack command against them. Also enemies in random encounters get quickly repetitive as you fight the same 3 enemies over and over in each area; although most areas are short enough it doesn&#039;t become too much a burden. You also get a Repel spell that actually works if you&#039;re tired of it.

All I know is that when you instantly rewind, there won&#039;t be a cognitive learning process as your brain needs to learn (adapt to) a certain pattern with expectations and outcomes. Rewinding just brings you back to the moment right before dying, but not the moments leading up to it. Yet you&#039;ll still receive the dopamine reward in both cases, taking away the motivation to become better at the game. Rewinding also drastically reduces the possibility of failure, and failure is when your brain actually learns in order to adapt and overcome. Hence the absence of learning. <br><br>8 and 16 bit games especially have been designed with this learning process in mind. It&#039;s the literal structure of those video games. When using save states or rewinds, you bypass this learning process and don&#039;t experience the game in full how it was intentionally designed by the brightest minds of the gaming industry. What you&#039;re left with is a powerpoint slide of dopamine shots that only serve as escapism. The element of &#039;play&#039; almost completely disappears. Imagine soccer but every time a player misses he can rewind and slightly adjust his foot to make sure he&#039;ll get the right angle this time. What is left of the game then? Nothing.<br><br>In short, rewinding makes you a worse gamer in the long term. This is simple cognitive neurology, any scientist would agree. Save states and rewinds therefore make for an objectively inferior experience as you only experience a small aspect of the game. It&#039;s only slightly different than being a passive observer by watching a longplay on Youtube. It just baffled me how some people don&#039;t see this.

We will be lucky if there is a replacement in a DECADE, and that is no exaggeration. This thing is massively over-engineered and overpowered for it&#039;s purpose, we basically got lucky that it was a great fit for the MiSTer project, originally they didn&#039;t think they could get anything more than the SNES out of it when the project started. Until the DE-10 is unfit for educational purposes, which is not going to happen in a long time, there isn&#039;t going to be a more powerful FPGA that doesn&#039;t cost as much as a decent used car that would fit the bill.

Just comparing sequences in Trigger and Cross where you have to kill packs of enemies, the reptite tower is totally painless because it takes Crono half a second to draw his sword and transition into combat, and it takes two seconds to mash through text boxes at the end of combat, meaning that when you fight multiple packs of enemies it doesn&#039;t feel like your time is wasted and its all one big connected action sequence.

He definitely had a hand in Schala&#039;s story, but he can&#039;t have written everything about her either or he wouldn&#039;t have felt the need to retcon so much about her in Cross (even her hair is different!) and he definitely would not have written her brother out of the sequel when he was so central to her.<br><br>For other sections that you seem to have attributed to Kato, I&#039;m also confident in saying that he did NOT write Fiona&#039;s forest and the camp scene (goes against Cross&#039;s message of &quot;humans bad for environment&quot; and the campfire scene is contradicted in Cross), he did not write anything about prehistory (Cross even says that humans did not exist before Lavos arrived, retconning Ayla into a neanderthal), etc, he did not write any of the happy endings (he hated happy endings and retconned them into tragedies with his sequel) and he did not write any of the whimsical scenes of Trigger (too many to list).<br><br>Now, you may come and say that this means nothing, we can&#039;t actually compare the writing like that and he&#039;s responsible for more than I give him credit for, but then we need the answer to a simple question: If Kato wrote all that, why the hell did he feel the need to retcon, contradict or alter so much of it in the sequel?

The most noticeable one is the ice beam, and the arm cannon freezes over. These effects are not in Trilogy for whatever reason.

From my years of reading about it, apparently its due to porting the game to the Metroid Prime 3 engine and dealing with some of the physics there. These effects are remade in Remastered.

Just the fact that he reissts a lot of common types and has a big spongey HP makes him perfect for the typical G1 grind method of &quot;weak Pokemon first turn, then switch&quot;. also has a surprisingly high Special/attack, which means it can hold its own.Just solid for learning game mechanics. <br>Squirtle is a nice balanced middle ground between defense, special and attack, learns the biggest variety of moves and can cover most types buy itself.<br>Charmander feels the easiest to grind with because so much of what you encounter are bug types and Pokemon witha weak special stat ; while his attack/special aren&#039;t actually higher than the Bulbasaur line his move pool centers more around stronger attacks early on.

But you can easily use Charmander to solo the game, or Squirtle to build a team around. <br>Personally, when I want to not use a starter I usually go with Charmander to grind through with ember, get a nidoran as a support until I can lean more on him and get to Cerulean and have access to all the Pokemon around there.", "time": 1675984541, "resto": 9642534}, {"no": 9647656, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)18:31:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9643619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9643619</a><br>Bulbasaur is the best one not just because of the early game but also because Razor Leaf is literally busted and also there aren&#039;t any better grass types than Venusaur in the game.

The gaming market was oversaturated and becoming something of a circlejerk with every console selling the same arcade ports. And the quality control, especially when it came to the 2600, could be very lax.

The Supra is a bit fat so it makes sense, but try turning in a bit earlier so you hit the inside kerb, it will shave off some time you&#039;re losing going wide+the kerb compressing the suspension will help you turn. On the hairpin exit on the other hand it seems like you stop turning left at one point because you already managed to get in the right direction before reaching the middle of the track surface, that means you&#039;re not carrying as much speed as you could. You can fix that by accelerating a tiny bit earlier and sacrificing a bit of entry speed if needed so you can get a better exit. Remember, corner exit speed is worth more than corner entry speed. You seem to be really aggressive on entry and it&#039;s probably fucking you over.

Shinra&#039;s end goal was to create Neo Midgar by finding The Promised Land, a place with allegedly infinite Mako, and putting a reactor on top of it. And their goal with Jenova&#039;s corpse was to take cells from it and artificially create a human with the abilities of the Cetra. So the hybrid could speak to the Planet, point the way to The Promised Land, and Shinra could print infinite money. Which is just deranged. Imagine reading the Bible and getting to the scripture that speaks of Heaven having streets of gold. And rather than seeing that as God&#039;s promises to encourage you to get closer to God and reach a spiritual enlightenment, instead you decide to take the information you can find and make a lab baby that can possibly infiltrate heaven. So you can send your armies there to harvest the gold.<br><br>Either way it wasn&#039;t until Dr Gast found Ifalna who clarified that Jenova was not a Cetra but rather a shape shifting alien who destroyed the Cetra. And that Jenova was the enemy of the Planet. Hojo didn&#039;t give a fuck though. Even after finding Hojo and Ifalna he forged ahead with his experiments out of curiosity of what Jenova would do. And since no one updated Gast&#039;s notes from when they were still working in the Mansion, Sephiroth got the wrong idea after reading them. Believing that Jenova was a Cetra that was done dirty by humans and the world belonged to her. Just like his father though, Sephiroth didn&#039;t care and forged ahead after finding out the truth and went with his own insane Meteor plan.

GC release perhaps even more so than the Dreamcast game because it comes with an included expansion pack and you can do local split-screen multi in case someone who&#039;s into PSO ever pops to yours after all. Best way I can describe the game is arcade-RPG, not action-RPG, it feels very &quot;Sega&quot; if that makes sense? Best enjoyed in short bursts. Get back home from work, fire the game up, play for an hour or two, call it a day before you end up getting bored of the gameplay. Because the gameplay is mad repetitive. It&#039;s fun, very much so, just not in longer sittings unless you have other people to interact with to break the monotony. You don&#039;t get to really customize your character much and the &quot;builds&quot; work different than other games like Diablo etc., you don&#039;t see any skill trees - every character class has different stats (these differ depending on the gender too), but you don&#039;t upgrade your character. You use stat boosting items (weapons, armor etc.) and level up your MAG - a MAG is a basically a small cutesy summon that follows you 24/7 and depending on what you feed it, it&#039;ll grow diifferently and provide you with different stat boosts. You don&#039;t like it, you get a new one. But you don&#039;t improve the actual character you control per say. And the gameplay is as basic as it gets - you get dropped in a map, you slay shit left and right, find some treasure, find some card keys to open new areas on the map, find the exit, boom - done. Get back to the main game hub, collect a reward for finishng the mission, start a new one. It&#039;s a simple game. But it looks charming to this very day and there&#039;s the whole &quot;soul&quot; aspect to it.<br><br>TL:DR - yes it&#039;s fun solo, but in short bursts. Unless you&#039;re connected to a server, you probably won&#039;t spend 5+ hours a day glued to your TV, you&#039;d get bored eventually without the social/community element of the game.", "time": 1676129509, "resto": 9648621}, {"no": 9652016, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:01:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ragnarok and Gunz", "time": 1676131263, "resto": 9648621}, {"no": 9652226, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)12:35:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9651347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9651347</a><br>friendly reminder that the last big triple A sandbox MMO to come out was fallout 76 and nobody liked it until they tweaked it to be more like a themepark MMO.<br><br>the problem with the player driven content of sandbox MMOs and why they usually fail nowadays is...<br><br>1.) if the player count significantly drops that affects the game. no players = no content.<br><br>2.) if you have world PvP then gankers &amp; griefers basically accelerate that player count drop.<br><br>3.) sandbox survival games make that whole genre of MMOs basically obsolete. why play an sandbox MMO when you can have a similar or better experience on a RP server in rust or minecraft?<br><br>4.) the average player doesn&#039;t want a &quot;do nothing game&quot; anymore. if they did they&#039;d be playing a sandbox survival game.", "time": 1676136930, "resto": 9648621}, {"no": 9652573, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)15:08:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9652226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9652226</a><br>It doesn&#039;t even have to be a binary with sandbox vs themepark, FFXI I would consider to be a &quot;themepark&quot; MMO as it has no PvP and linear story missions, however within that space you were still allowed total freedom.

You do all this because you get an EXP/Currency bonus for entering into the queue a certain number of times per day. It&#039;s not personal.

To this day, PSO is the only MMO I&#039;ve ever liked. Nothing else I&#039;ve tried was as fun. Like the post I&#039;m replying to says, it should be played in short bursts, but one good thing about PSO is that it CAN be played in short bursts.
