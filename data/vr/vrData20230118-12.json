Why? Because the revive spell refills HP AND MP. So you can finally spam spells at will, let your characters/demons die, revive them and have MP again.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

The GBA version might be best overall, but it feels like Square was being vindictive at times about their official PSX versions of 4&amp;5 being outshined at the time by unofficial SFC translation hacks, so they overlocalized it to the point a few key scenes almost feel like parody.

The base fan translation is showing its age, but you could try checking out Spooniest&#039;s &quot;Legend of the Crystals&quot; addendum instead.

Another thing that this did, that the previous Spider-Man adaptations didn&#039;t, was having an actual story that develops as it goes along, instead of some text in the manual or an opening cutscene to set the plot, you have cutscenes between all levels that show Spider-Man&#039;s thought process as to where he should go next to find the keys to disarm Kingpin&#039;s bomb and it&#039;s great to see, it&#039;s immersive and captures the feeling of reading a comic book more than anything that came before it.

I came prepared: I had the cheat codes, which I copied from a video games magazine earlier at my local library, so my 1st time beating Doom was actually with cheats enabled.

But Ultima Underworld really marked the beginning of the genre, and RPGs in general, transitioning into 3D. It&#039;s worth noting Underworld was heavily influenced by Dungeon Master and its UI and interface makes a lot more sense if you&#039;ve played DM or Eye of the Beholder. Thing is that once they&#039;d made a 3D dungeon it made way more sense for it to be a single character game with you swinging your sword around and jumping and swimming in real time rather than a first person view of an entire party of characters doing these things. Obviously there were a few attempts to merge the new fully-3D first person RPGs with party mechanics like Might and Magic 6-9 and Wizardry 8 but they were few and far between and in the end single character games won out for 3D RPGs in general.<br><br>Here&#039;s a quote from an interview with Doug Church, the lead programmer behind Underworld 1 and 2 , System Shock and Thief 1, about this. It&#039;s from an interview from December 1992 about Ultima Underworld 2:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Q: GB: Will the game be single person still, or will a party join you in the dungeons? If no party, why not?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doug: Still a single player game. The action/motion nature of UW makes a party very hard to deal with. Say there was a chasm of lava, and you want to jump it, so you run and jump and make it. Your companion who you make carry all the food jumps as well, but is carrying so much that their top speed is too low to make the jump, and they fall in the chasm. Lots of problems like this crop up, along with the interface issues of real time control of the first person characters. Basically, we think that restricting the game enough to make it a party game would ruin a lot of the things it does well.</span><br><br>https://web.archive.org/web/2004050<wbr>2002424/http://www.uo.com/archive/f<wbr>tp/text/intrview/lglass.txt", "filename": "ultimaunderworld", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673922282079770, "time": 1673922282, "md5": "AvjfW/z6hRGBK9sdNkGyfA==", "fsize": 413357, "resto": 9576089}, {"no": 9578489, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:14:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576089</a><br><br>Not sure what you&#039;re talking about Etrian Odyssey is fairly recent", "time": 1673943283, "resto": 9576089}, {"no": 9578620, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)05:04:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576089</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and what would be the best starter game for it from your personal experience?</span><br>Lands of Lore is babies first blobber.

It also does the thing with the two castles as well as the possessed ally, the one where you track down Dracula&#039;s parts, and so on.

A lot of the time there aren&#039;t really many obstacles to overcome, you just need to figure out where to go which is incredibly obvious, and Zelda and 3D Metroid are the same way.<br><br>But strangely I think any RPGs they have a hand in tend to turn out great, perhaps because they&#039;re usually at least a little unconventional. Granted these aren&#039;t usually first-party, but still, the first two Paper Mario games I remember having a cooler combat system than most other JRPGs, I really like how the stats work in Fire Emblem (speed is maybe too important, but then I like how they&#039;re not all equally important but even some of the less powerful ones it&#039;s still important to have a bit of), and even though you obviously CAN play single-player Pok\u00e9mon in a very braindead way and win, in my experience it&#039;s easier to find a way to play it that does produce tense and challenging situations than it is in most JRPGs, which I wouldn&#039;t really know how to make challenging without resorting to romhacks.<br><br>The single-combat format is unique as well, and a lot of the moves are also pretty creative in their functionality and I like that it actually tells you each move&#039;s accuracy and doesn&#039;t pull that BS where major enemies are immune to status moves.

Overall I&#039;d say that Sega is better at making arcade games and arcadey games, but Nintendo is all about home consoles and makes better &#039;big&#039; games that feel like an adventure, you have a clear goal in them. Their early arcadey stuff like Balloon Fight and Wrecking Crew is still good though. Don&#039;t get me wrong, Sega still made some good big games like the MegaDrive/Dreamcast Sonic games or Shenmue, they are just not as good as stuff like Mario and Zelda", "time": 1673781145, "resto": 9572387}, {"no": 9573014, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)06:15:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9572972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9572972</a><br>Metroid and Zelda get constant praise and both are just crummier versions of Wonderboy 3.

The things we can measure objectively all tilt in favor of Nintendo&#039;s quality, be it Mario&#039;s snappy controls that respond near perfectly (talking about Odyssey, but obviously 64 was insane for its time where other games had tank controls--something I assume you just ignore), Mario having a lot of moves you can string together with relatively small time windows and rhythms that are literally methodologically and scientifically validated to be experienced as enjoyable by people, how well everything flows into one with just the right animations and weight to Mario. It&#039;s hard to tell how good something is when viewing it in isolation, though, so let&#039;s just look at the much lauded Jak games: You have to roll to long-jump, which is less visceral and chancier in tight spots than Mario&#039;s quick duck, while it&#039;s too easy to accidentally roll when you actually want to crouch for a high jump because the stick has to be 100% neutral, which doesn&#039;t have a good flow. It lacks Mario&#039;s rhythm and risk and reward (even the easiest platorms in Mario can be a challenge if you want to do things like backflips instead of standard jumps, but it always feels rewarding). You can constantly challenge yourself with timing triple jumps and dives to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and pits while still having to factor those into your timing if you want to go fast while also having the advantage of higher/longer jumps.

Sega/Nintendo started as Arcade developers, although Nintendo quickly tried to diversify and get computer-like experiences on their console (Famicom Wars, etc) and people with a background in art and 2D animation, then some short stints with cutting edge early 3D. Then there&#039;s their background as a toy maker and a card game maker.<br><br>As Nintendo is right now, they, alongside Namco (who are worse at quality control and budgeting), are very good at prototyping projects until they get a good idea of what makes it fun to play, then they add visual elements to serve that objective.

Those are games that released with their placeholder character designs, but were still shippable in that state.<br>The Wonderful 101 was pitched as a crossover using Mario/Zelda characters, and Nintendo as a matter of principle rejected it and asked for a prototype that would be fun to play regardless, and the game shipped with the generic characters.<br><br>Even their failures can be used to illustrate this.<br>Rare&#039;s Zelda pitch, while gorgeous, was immediately rejected because the gameplay was trash.<br>Project Hammer started at NST by American developers. It&#039;s supposed to be a Musou-like. They started funneling millions of dollars down the drain to produce expensive AAA cutscenes, complained that NCL&#039;s handlers are too oppressive, and that it must be xenophobia and the Japanese being PROBLEMATIC and out of touch with what American audiences want in a STORY.

Because it was a good way to catch up with friends and let off some steam, since it geared as a party game, so people that weren&#039;t that skilled could still join and have fun.<br><br>In the group of course there were three fanboys that played even more than me, their explanations as to why it&#039;s &quot;so awesome&quot;:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it doesn&#039;t do everything well, but it puts together different things well</span><br>Perhaps the most honest answer, he can&#039;t point at anything in particular, he&#039;s played enough games to know Halo didn&#039;t invent much new, but likes that there isn&#039;t any major annoyances in integrating all the different systems (from controls to game balance).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the AI</span><br>This is because the levels were heavily scripted, so for example someone might say &quot;wow that elite took cover behind this corner there when it&#039;s shields were down, that was clever&quot; - players don&#039;t know that Bungie just added these places into the terrain. Another level where you&#039;re on the beach, where grunts and jackals &quot;fall back&quot; because you shot the elite, there is actually a zone on the beach where they can retreat to baked into the game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the short time to kill, recharging shields/health</span><br>Honestly, I was never a huge fan of this concept but I think Halo 1 nailed it the best with the longer recharge time and and needing to venture to health packs. When they shortened the timer and fast regenerating health, for Halo 2 and beyond, it made the dynamic even worse (encourages people to just hide out of the action).", "time": 1673982071, "resto": 9573635}, {"no": 9579915, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:24:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9578751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9578751</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dedicated grenade button and regenerating health</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying either of them is something positive</span>", "time": 1673987071, "resto": 9573635}, {"no": 9579927, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:29:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9579915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9579915</a><br>First time seeing someone against a grenade button.

With a button I can just make a grenade throw and it automatically returns me to my weapon afterwards, that&#039;s smooth and I don&#039;t need to come to a halt, you can make the gameplay faster for it, and in return increase the challenge for the player to match their abilities.<br><br>In Half-Life, I find myself not using hand grenades all that often because that requires that I stop shooting what I&#039;m using now and switching to another weapon, manually throwing it, and then switching back. Because of that, in the heat of combat I basically never ever use them because I don&#039;t want to let up the pressure, whereas I gladly use the grenade launcher altfire because it&#039;s very conveniently attached to my machinegun (and it also detonates on impact). <br>The role I end up using them for (aside from maybe demolition or setting off tripmines from around a corner), is if I have the drop on an enemy, in which case one or two grenades are my opening before lay down fire. This is useful, but more occasionally, and the grunts tend to avoid it, which in itself isn&#039;t bad, it&#039;s nice that different enemies require differing tactics and approaches, that&#039;s good, but it makes the already limited grenades still more limited.<br><br>If I instead chuck one with a dedicated press, I could maybe use it when in actual combat with the grunts, if nothing else to flush them out or suppress them.<br><br><a href=\"#p9579953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9579953</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Map is littered with health pickups so you are always at full health</span><br>I don&#039;t know what to tell you, maybe try playing on a setting higher than the easiest.

Namco is actually well known for being financially responsible. It would not surprise me if 100 or 200 were made.

You could have gotten it for cheap if you had a few thousand dollars back then. I&#039;m guessing a few places picked up a Full Scale for cheap and got a couple more years of use out of it until the machine broke down and was scrapped.

Also, it takes only 15min to complete it, and the level design really nosedives in its 2nd half, not only that, but the OST literally has 2 tracks, graphics aren&#039;t that good for a 1992 NES release, and the story/presentation are barely there... still, it plays fine and once you get used to it, it can be fun, especially in the 1st half where level design is interesting too, more vertical and with items to collect.

Yes, its true that NOA and NOE during the NES years often had a bias against overt themes regarding themes and symbols of many IRL faiths and/or religions as per their pre-ESRB political correctness game censorship guidelines, which also forbade references to alcohol, illicit drug use, and, most on-screen bloodshed. However, as much as there are references to Christianity here and there, especially in the early years of the franchise, that the Cross is not an exclusively Christian symbol, just as the Six-pointed star is not exclusive to Judaism. True, the special book in the early Zelda games is literally called a &quot;Bible&quot;, and cross imagery in a number of areas, the bulk of them in the early titles. But what makes you so damn sure that the word &quot;Shimpu&quot; is specifically meant to mean a Christian Priest? How fluent in Japanese are you, really? The language is often vague, its written form (aside from Kanji, which acts somewhat more like Chinese does) is a syllabary, is more reader dependent in its structure than any of the languages of Europe, and those of the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. I also add that even in the pre-Majora&#039;s mask era of LOZ, there are also other lore and folkloric beings from different parts of the world present. Fairies (Celtic and Germanic Lore) can be found in every game in the series. The Master Sword in Link to the past/Triforce of the Gods is very much reminiscent of Celtic Arthurian legend and lore.

So I decided to try myself. Specifically on SNES, beating Lavos after reaching the end of time, before returning to 1000AD. My rule was the title/save name for the chapter couldn&#039;t change from &quot;End of Time&quot; to &quot;The Village of Magic&quot;. Thus I could grind in 65,000,000 BC to make it a bit faster. I did this via emulator, using turbo/fastforward but otherwise no assist/cheat/etc.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After many hours of grinding to LVL 90 I finally did it (88:25 of game time, less realtime with fast-forward). Was able to get to the final form at about LVL 70, but the last form is a beast to do with the low level equipment. Grand Stone is an insta-wipe (chrono can occasionally survive if lucky+full HP) So I needed Lifeline via chrono+marle+robo. Magic damage wasn&#039;t as much of a problem as everyone had maxed Mdef at that level, but did still require pretty constant healing. Luminaire is a heavy hitter, but expensive: robo tackle was the MVP with level scaling dmg and MP efficiency -- didn&#039;t quite one-shot the left bit, but close enough to allow a one-two punch.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interestingly, this doesn&#039;t appear to have unlocked NewGame+, which is a bummer.</span><br>I saw a TAS do it too at a low 40s levels, but I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s not possible normally without extreme luck<br>https://youtu.be/OJTUR67myH8", "filename": "chrono trigger art", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1366, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673989222779143, "time": 1673989222, "md5": "31KMhJKajRAqGNIjvQgCMg==", "fsize": 467050, "resto": 9577756}, {"no": 9580021, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9579958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9579958</a><br><a href=\"#p9580010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9580010</a><br>But a couple weeks ago I replayed and finally used Crono, Ayla, Robo the whole way, and it was great.

Compare this with CPS2 games that have more big and unique, sometimes animates objects in their backgrounds.<br>Next, the chatacters animations. MK Trilogy sprites are very thin and don&#039;t have much unique animations. SF Alpha games are kind of simple too but Darkstalkers and Marvel vs games have more elaborate attack animations that take a large chunk of screen (and VRAM). MK Trilogy being this lightweight on animations is pretty much confirmed by the PS1 version: it easily holds 4 unique characters for 2 on 2 combat in PS1 RAM - when one character is defeated the game doesn&#039;t stop to load the second one from the disc. No Capcom game manages to have four complete and unique characters in a single fight on PS1 because they take much more memory than Mortal Kombat ones.<br>N64 has more RAM and doesn&#039;t have to deal with loading from the disk at all, so it allows SIX unique characters in 3 on 3 combat. Great, right? But here&#039;s the deal: the animation quality is worse than in PS1 version. So while there are six characters in N64 RAM, even having only two of them on screen, N64 can&#039;t animate them as fast as PS1 version. This is barely a cart size issue - adding a couple of frames to each character standing idle animation would make them look a whole lot smoother and this takes a very little space of ROM.

For those games, there is some extra data in there for it, so it could convert these four shades to colours. This is just like extra palette data and the palettes are predetermined from the SNES master palette, so you&#039;re just saying use palette 3 (which had four colours), rather than entirely custom palettes.<br><br>The game also included coloured sprites to fill up the rest of the screen (again using the palettes) like background decoration. These are still just regular game boy games because at the time there was no gameboy colour. When the gameboy colour did come out, it had a neat little trick where on startup, you could set the game to use one particular palette as the main palette for everything. And the gameboy colour also knew how to interpret the coloured palettes (if you left it on the default main one), so even in the original pokemon games, they switched to shades of blue or green for different areas, and switch to a palette with green for the health bars and so on.<br><br>I think the reason why Yellow&#039;s palette is different is because they weren&#039;t limited to the predefined ones in the super gameboy, so they could pick from a wider range of colours for the four different ones, and they went for more vibrant ones. One thing I never tried, but would be curious to, is if you played yellow on a super gameboy, would it &#039;fall back&#039; to the same palettes as red and blue?", "time": 1673882064, "resto": 9572509}, {"no": 9576421, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)11:06:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576115</a><br>No they didn&#039;t?

Then there were some firings at Sierra that year of a couple notable individuals (who will not be mentioned, for fear of internet-sleuths finding me out), who were caught having a seance in the backrooms of the offices at 3:33 AM. Al Lowe, who was a practicing Methodist at the time, demanded they be fired. Shortly after, Sierra wanted a sequel to Leisure Suit Larry 3, which Al Lowe refused to do. Until a series of unfortunate misshaps occurred. According to sources, Al Low slept in one day an hour later than usual. When he tried to get ready to go to work and hurried out the door, he saw a piano had fallen on his car. The next week, on a busride back from the office, a man held the driver of the bus at knife point and almost stabbed Lowe, until a plain-clothes policeman arrested the would-be attacker. Bad shit continued to happen, and eventually Al Lowe decided he was getting someone upstairs angry for not using his talents, so began work on LSL4.<br><br>That&#039;s where the fun stuff begins. Almost immediately following the development of the coding for the game, it repeatedly had to be redone, as the code constantly got corrupted over and over again. Art assets would unknowingly disappear. Apparently late one night, Al Lowe stated he heard faint whisperings in the office and was so skeeved out he refused to work late nights anymore. He also heard tell of a man in black who would arrive in the office lobby, before anyone was at the office, when the doors were locked, at 5 AM on the dot for 2 weeks straight. In the end, the project collapsed as Al Lowe refused any further work on the project.", "time": 1673648710, "resto": 9564728}, {"no": 9568830, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)19:22:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Never played the game but I got a chuckle out of the Dyke song<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndA<wbr>XualcLHQ", "time": 1673655766, "resto": 9564728}, {"no": 9568843, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)19:31:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9568507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9568507</a><br>You mean you didn&#039;t play Leisure Suit Larry Kart for the Game.com?", "time": 1673656278, "resto": 9564728}, {"no": 9568847, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)19:35:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9564746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9564746</a><br>the originals were very funny to boomers.

Again, just as an example, a parody of famous places like Hollywood, Las Vegas, and so on. Tie old characters into it, like Blues Bros landing a movie deal, then blowing all their cash in casinos.
