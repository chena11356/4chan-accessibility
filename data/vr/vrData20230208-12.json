Just comparing sequences in Trigger and Cross where you have to kill packs of enemies, the reptite tower is totally painless because it takes Crono half a second to draw his sword and transition into combat, and it takes two seconds to mash through text boxes at the end of combat, meaning that when you fight multiple packs of enemies it doesn&#039;t feel like your time is wasted and its all one big connected action sequence.

I think the development of CD-ROM technology made a VHS console seem stupid in the end. I can see why Hasbro would cancel it. But they did still invest a few million dollars in the development of the console prototypes and filming budgets of Night Trap and Sewer Shark. They wanted to sell the footage they had, IDK. But they are credited for both Night Trap and Sewer Shark. Sony did publish the Sega CD Sewer Shark. But Digital Pictures published the 3DO game on their own. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mg<wbr>EnJ02ZNg", "time": 1675626871, "resto": 9633028}, {"no": 9635137, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)15:08:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9633486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9633486</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The original Sega CD release did have some exclusive new content filmed for it at the intro.

Gameplay, was a standard FMV shooter, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s too bad. The game does try to mix up the gameplay with randomization of the tubes, and there are a few alt-FMV scenes when you play better or worse. The best thing is the film making aspect of the movie, and it was miniature tunnels, puppets and live action. I remember seeing one black and white behind the scenes photo from a long time ago. Could never find it again. I think it was a B&amp;W scanned image. But it featured John Dykstra working on one of the model sewer pieces. Night Trap was pretty well documented during the filming process;. But Sewer Shark doesn&#039;t have much around it for behind the scenes material.

Nintendo tried and failed to get videogame rentals considered illegal anywhere except in Japan (Which considering how much Nintendo even today caters almost exclusively to the Japanese market was likely considered a win to them). Carts were small, the standard NES cart held 40KB without mappers. Even with mappers and more storage there just wasn&#039;t enough room for most types of games to have more than 30-60 minutes max of content if that, excluding ones they can drag out like RPGs. Hard to make something like Contra last several hours without a stupidly huge and expensive cart as well as filler levels of the same graphics and design over and over. This was a problem if someone were to buy an expensive game and then beat it that same day before it&#039;s even dark out, they would get tired of it pretty quickly, possibly even that same day. And then there is the bigger problem of people just renting those games instead of buying them and beating them during the rental period. So many games were intentionally made harder outside of Japan to combat this, one would have to practice a game for weeks or months to finally beat it.<br><br>Pretty much all of these were of less concern in the SNES era.

Yeah, one could argue about how when the battery dies people would have to send the board to Capcom to get them to reload the key, but considering the battery lasts some 20 or so years that&#039;s hardly intentional planned obsolesce as the arcade cabinet itself is likely to be retired before that Nobody was expecting people to care about old games or that retro gaming would boom like it did.<br><br>And no in that the reason CPS2SHOCK was able to crack it in the early 00s was due to (if I remember correctly) an oversight Capcom left in from a CPS2 game they had converted to CPS1 hardware. I recall it was some older Street Fighter game, I guess they figured the revenue from arcades that could install the game in an old CPS1 cabinet was more profitable than keeping that old game out of bootlegger&#039;s hands. From what I remember they accidently left in an occasional call the game makes to the decryption hardware, which clued the team in that the CPS2 games didn&#039;t just decrypt the game once on boot but had to repeatedly confirm it for the board to keep decrypting the game or the system would stop decrypting. I am sure this would have eventually been figured out anyway (Especially since CPS3 was decrypted about 16 years ago) if they got the initial decryption done and then saw the game only works for a while, but it apparently gave them a target to know where to look and sped up the project.

Everything is made to make you realize they were going through their own adventures of their own while you were. This gives them weight and personality and puts everyone on the same level. How many RPGs have each character put on the same level of importance like that? Certainly not DQ3.<br>- The way towns work like hubs. You usually use the same town in between several small quests; either that or there is a good reason to come back to the town later on. This makes the world feel organic, real; vs the tired routine &quot;each area is composed of one town, one dungeon, clear that, reach next area, repeat&quot; which DQ3 started.<br>- The adventure elements, namely the treasure hunting; DQ2 probably started the &quot;you must find X number of magical key items as a goal&quot; trope for jRPGs (unless you count Zelda as an RPG), but unlike later/other use of that trope in which the key item is merely a meaningless token for denoting that you beat a dungeon; here you must go through adventure game mechanics to acquire them, acquire clues, solve puzzle, beat dungeons too sure but not only, and almost each one is acquired differently.

I played the absolute shit out of Gen 1, and was stoked when I heard about Gen 2. The wait for it seemed eternal to me at the time, though. Eventually the Japanese game came out, and IIRC I even downloaded a ROM for it and tried playing it, but obviously didn&#039;t get far. By the time the actual game came out here, I think I was already turning off of Pokemon and was getting hardcore into Zelda and FF instead. I did replay Gen 1 a couple of times during that time frame, though, so maybe I just turned into a stuffy Genwunner in record time, I dunno. Whatever the case, It took like a decade before I touched another Pokemon game, namely Emerald, Lead Green and Platinum. I did get Soul Silver, but I think having played the previous three nigh back-to-back burned me out, with the last straw being me forgetting to save and turning it off after hours of progress (I was tired and possibly drunk lol). I know I can always pick it up, whether the original or the DS remake, but I always get this nagging feeling that I already &quot;missed the boat&quot; on it and any magic it held would be lost on me, sort of like when I played ALttP after OoT, and so I always hesitate and decide against it.<br><br>Thanks for reading my blog.", "filename": "1405282271141", "ext": ".png", "w": 291, "h": 343, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675271766168312, "time": 1675271766, "md5": "oQ+WD8s0c10Yy2dt0kyY0g==", "fsize": 72914, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9621867, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:20:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9620563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620563</a><br>Ursaring mogs the entirety of gen 1.", "time": 1675272015, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9621873, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:21:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9621856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9621856</a><br>You&#039;re overthinking it.

Funnily enough, though, I absolutely &quot;get it&quot; for the first Zelda and even Zelda II, which I absolutely love despite its bullshit, and I played and beat those even later, probably because they are still quite unique in what they do, whereas ALttP is, in many ways, the prototype model for literally everything that came after, so despite doing it first much of it felt &quot;been there done that&quot;, but more barebones, so to speak.<br><br>Anyway, I don&#039;t want to derail the thread too much.

Want Growlithe but playing at night? Want to train it right away? Have to wait until the day, that&#039;s just how it works. You can make the argument that &quot;you can play with any Pokemon&quot;, and sure Pokemon games are pretty easy, but it&#039;s not to the degree that which Pokemon you choose don&#039;t effect the game, the whole game is based on the fact that different Pokemon have different strengths and weaknesses, which Pokemon make up your team effects how you play the game, and how you determine Pokemon you actually want, as well as when you catch them determining when/where you can train them appropriately. Plus, who doesn&#039;t just want to use ones they like? When I play GSC, there are always inevitable parts where I simply have to stop playing the game because I&#039;m in an area at the wrong time for what I want to do there, and that is not collect every Pokemon in the area, it&#039;s simply to catch the few who make up my team and train them as best I can against new Pokemon/trainers. <br><br>Now, you can say &quot;well too bad if you want certain Pokemon instead of using any random ones you find you have to wait for the right time of day&quot; and that&#039;d be fine if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that Gen 1 didn&#039;t require this, which allows me to compare and prefer one way over the other.", "time": 1675655385, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9636431, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)22:59:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9634208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9634208</a><br>tbf if you go and hike in the mountains a lot you can get real tanned", "time": 1675655966, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9636786, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:54:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9620369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620369</a><br>Why did Gen 2&#039;s comfy atmosphere not prevent it from killing Pokemania?", "filename": "1675640035876553", "ext": ".png", "w": 317, "h": 421, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675666465241803, "time": 1675666465, "md5": "0Hrs+sfz7FL4WI57OGmr0Q==", "fsize": 8206, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9636808, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)02:08:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9636067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9636067</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;games should be cumbersome to be unique</span><br>There&#039;s a balance of effort and reward.

The best way to define the SaGa games is that they are very heavily focused on gameplay and on having unusual systems. For that reason they are often as innovative as they are frustrating. The lead designer is Akitpshi Kawazu, who is also famous (or infamous) as designer of FF2. Another trademark is unpredictability; Several of his games seem designed to be difficult or impossible to easily figure out or to manipulate. Believe I&#039;ve read before that his philosophy is that games are another universe, and so they should be a complex universe of rules and events that aren&#039;t always obvious, or else the world ceases to be a real world and is reduced to a simple toy for the player&#039;s amusement. This leads to designs that include obtuse methods or entirely hidden systems that control things without the player immediately knowing about them. If you&#039;ve played other games be designed then you&#039;ll know what I mean (Crystal Chronicles on gamecube, Last Remnant, and WildCard come to mind).<br><br>I&#039;m not an expert but that&#039;s my understanding. The games are often strange but have a very unique style that you won&#039;t often see. Series is worth trying out, the first game is rudimentary but still interesting.

Many shit on it because it&#039;s so unique and has a pretty deep learning curve until you&#039;re used to it. But once you are, no other game is like it. You really feel the difference in the weapons, swinging back and forth with the greatsword versus stabbing up and down with the lance. I understand the people who didn&#039;t like it, but to me it&#039;s sublime and the thing I missed most about the game on it&#039;s sequels. <br><br>I am a monster hunter super fan though, it&#039;s probably my favorite series of games ever. I maxed the clock at 999 hours on the original long, long before I stopped playing and other than Tri on the Wii and the World/Rise games I&#039;ve put at least several hundred hours into every one. <br><br>Playing the original now would be kind of sad because the online was such a major component but it&#039;s still an awesome game regardless and the offline game is quite a complete experience in it&#039;s own right. If you like it there&#039;s plenty more Monster Hunter out there to jump into including Generations Ultimate which is basically the best the series has ever been and still has a decent player base. <br><br>That said, the player bases as in all online games are always a little funny.
