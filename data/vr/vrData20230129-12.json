Why is it the only level where the box counter stays after I get the gem and say /0? Wonder if I could get through the level without breaking any boxes...<br><br>Crash 1 has the tightest level themeing; you&#039;re going on an adventure across the islands, gradually moving from nature to polluting industry and the levels reflect that.

As a species, we evolved to take a shit outdoors, which you&#039;d mainly do while squatting down, and doing it while sitting on a chair is not quite a natural angle. It&#039;s not too unusual to have some consequences in old age from shitting in a toilet chair all your life (I forget the exact ones), you&#039;re maybe not wrecked, but &#039;doing it wrong&#039; all your life catches up to you.<br><br>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s one of those things which is a catastrophe, because in spite of shitting like this for centuries, and lifespans increasing pretty impressively the last couple ones, this isn&#039;t a problem which is that widely talked known or talked about (and excessive straining in a squatting position has its risks too).<br>However, if you&#039;re constipated, or you&#039;ve ever had one of those shits which IS going, but it&#039;s not going easy and you&#039;ve gotta strain to follow through, I suggest to try switching to a squatting position over your bowl, or at least folding your legs up against your chest, it gives your plumbing an easier angle. You might find that it&#039;s a lot easier.", "time": 1674780357, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606761, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:51:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Obligatory Insufficient Direction chapter.<br>https://kissanime.com.ru/Anime/Kant<wbr>oku-Fuyuki-Todoki/Episode-008?id=69<wbr>521", "time": 1674805880, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606851, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:05:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what game is this", "time": 1674810337, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606876, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:33:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604181</a><br>sometimes ya gotta go down the pipes of life, and sometimes ya just gotta go down a toilet", "time": 1674811980, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606881, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:38:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604178</a><br>it&#039;s a pod, he goes in there to eat the bugs", "time": 1674812313, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606882, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:38:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604226</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the shower</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in</span>", "filename": "holyshit", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 807, "h": 1195, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674812333886327, "time": 1674812333, "md5": "j8oeVgWkw3tQPGq3y0p9Mg==", "fsize": 75666, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606887, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9606876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9606876</a><br>actually rather and &quot;sometimes that means ya gotta go down a toilet&quot;<br>you can quote me on that<br>and by that i mean you can steal it from me, i don&#039;t mind", "time": 1674812428, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606970, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:53:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what game is thi", "time": 1674816823, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606974, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:55:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605558</a><br>It&#039;s much healthier than a western toilet.<br>Anyway, the OP is not about a Japanese toilet, it&#039;s the fact that you can fucking dive into it.", "time": 1674816904, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9606984, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:58:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9606970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9606970</a><br>Crusader of Centy.", "time": 1674817132, "resto": 9604172}, {"no": 9607336, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)09:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9606974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9606974</a><br>Well, initially it was a hole, just like everywhere else.

I think this game was excellent when it came to the music (that main menu theme!) and the overall plot and presentation was great. Lara never looked better imo. The gameplay is what kills it. The last levels from Strahov onward are simply unfinished and cut extremely short. I would have loved to see more of that world and the stuff they would have us raid from tombs. Each classic tomb raider game really did something completely different from the last one. Collecting an Atlantean artifact from lost civilisations that developed from a cataclysm, destroying an Italian cult focussed around a Chinese dagger that turns you into a dragon hunting through sunken ships (interesting choice of tomb), Collecting meteorite splinters from all over the world for a weird social darwinist gone power-mad only to then kill him, and then a game focussed around the apocalypse being started by a haughty Lara picking up the amulet of Seth (1999 had many apocalypse plots, even V:tM Redemption), Chronicles was all over the place, and finally this weird cinematic plot of a serial killer and Icons that you need to collect and periapt shards you need to defeat the weird half-angel Nephilim race. <br><br>Tomb Raider was a wild ride. It really pisses me off that the gameplay for the final game was so piss-poor. There is lots of potential in that game and afaik they wanted to do so much more. TR Legend is just a big dumb action game with quicktime events that is over before you know it and doesn&#039;t really do anything with the king Arthur plot, not for all the dumb talking they do over it.", "time": 1674858311, "resto": 9603065}, {"no": 9608520, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)18:33:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608248</a><br>I wanna fuck that barbie doll", "time": 1674862413, "resto": 9603065}, {"no": 9609175, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:25:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608362</a><br>Have you tried the fan patch that fixes the gameplay and restores the cut content?", "time": 1674883546, "resto": 9603065}, {"no": 9609339, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)02:28:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609175</a><br>What system is that for?", "time": 1674890929, "resto": 9603065}, {"no": 9610208, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)11:50:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609339</a><br>Obviously PC", "filename": "1667514029909231", "ext": ".png", "w": 790, "h": 790, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674924629139318, "time": 1674924629, "md5": "APFcWAuiTqG2MGb5I1+C9w==", "fsize": 957699, "resto": 9603065}, {"no": 9610212, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)11:51:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9603065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9603065</a><br>I started with TR1 when it first came out and consider myself a Tomb Raider purist, but Legend series is alright.

Master speech skills so i can taunt anyone into attacking first. <br><br>The fact that with the Morag Tong; some NPCs will NOT conversate with you unless you get fully naked. I turned it into a wierd sociopathic tradition with my writ targets. Can only imagine what the npcs around think watching this cute little Breton whore undress and then murder. They can&#039;t do shit because writs are Legal. <br><br>I eventually end up having several houses for several purpose&#039;s and storage.

The controller setup, while serviceable, is not quite as optimized for the game, especially when taking differences in stick sensitivity into account (at least for me, aiming was always harder in the GC version). These days, if you absolutely have to play on real hardware, I&#039;d go with the N64 version, but only if you have a CRT to go with it since N64 games look like ass otherwise. Otherwise, I&#039;d just emulate, since that&#039;s what you&#039;d be doing with the GC version anyway.<br><br>As for MM, stay away.

Most FF fans are completely artistically illiterate and can&#039;t see any nuance. Sephiroth is shown to be cold and ruthless even when he was a &quot;hero.&quot; He was raised to be a killing machine, held up as a figurehead for Shinra&#039;s propaganda, showered with praise for slaughtering any perceived enemy, and we learn from Lucretia that he was never even held by his mother as a baby; he was whisked off by scientists to be a research specimen the moment he was born. You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see how fucked up someone would be from living a life like that. Even before the Nibelheim incident, he was, at best, a functional sociopath with a massive superiority complex, but most players completely miss all of that and take the claim that he&#039;s a hero at face value. <br><br>I&#039;d also argue that he doesn&#039;t actually give a shit about Jenova or the Ancients. Those are just post-hoc rationalizations he uses to justify his desires. When he reads in Gast&#039;s research notes that Jenova is an Ancient, he claims that entitles him to take the planet back from the humans who betrayed the Ancients. Later, when he travels through the Lifestream and learns the truth about Jenova (that she was actually just a monster that wiped out the Ancients), he twists it around and says that he&#039;s entitled to rule the planet because Jenova was even greater than the Ancients were. In other words, all he really wants is to satisfy his own ego by elevating himself up to godhood compared to the rest of the world, and he&#039;ll use whatever excuse he can come up with to justify it.", "time": 1674613383, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka is\u2026 Sephiroth</span><br>this nigga doesn\u2019t understand how numbers work", "time": 1674614692, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600392, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka\u2026 gets his plans foiled</span><br>You didn\u2019t even play the game.

There&#039;s at least a dozen Kojima-tier absurd plot twists that precede it, but basically the character being executed believes that its a mock execution, because the chief of police pardoned him but had to keep up appearances because he&#039;s known for being tough on crime. Usually on stage, that character acts like a chad with no fear of death, and his girlfriend is singing these joking lyrics about what a good actor he is while the music itself is really tense and clues you in that he&#039;s actually fucked and the police chief didn&#039;t actually give the order to pardon. He gets shot and dies with a look of shock on his face, and his girlfriend jumps off a cliff to avoid arrest, then curtains the end.<br><br>So in a meta sense, the two targets are actually playing the roles of the two opera characters, and 47 is actually playing the role of the executioner.

Since you meantioned the system clock not working it&#039;s pretty much guaranteed that it leaked and ceased to function. The end result of this failure is the acid corroding the circuits underneath or near where the cap is placed on the board, eventually killing the power button. To repair this is beyond my knowledge or capabilities. I can&#039;t even tell you whether it&#039;s a feasible option or not. This is why every single Xbox out there that&#039;s below hardware v1.6 needs to be openend and have it&#039;s clock cap removed or better yet, replaced - the system can run without it, as you have seen since yours is dead.

There&#039;s nothing wrong with emulating, but personally I&#039;d rather spend more time playing the games themselves than fixing input settings, visual settings, flipping between different emulators because the one you tried first had some problems, etc. With a console I just have to put the game into the slot and turn it on and it works perfectly and there&#039;s no problems. Emulation SHOULD be more convenient than real hardware simply because you can run so many games on one machine, and yet it&#039;s not. I also think freedom of choice is a problem. For some reason when I have a menu with a bunch of games I end up playing only for a few minutes and then switching to a different game. I don&#039;t know why it is but I always do this.

It&#039;s better than playing on a flat LCD screen, but it&#039;s not the same experience as playing on the real hardware. The controls on the Oculus are similar to the Virtual Boy controller, but these games are made for d-pads not analogue sticks (although that&#039;s a minor gripe).

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Romero just forgot to adjust the sectors in question while editing Map 15, lots of great level designer have made that slip up.<br><br>4.

This has been mislabeled for decades, confusing people to no end. Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white. Realistically, you&#039;ll probably have to settle on some sort of compromise between true blacks and a bit of black crush as no display is perfect.

For example most car guys know what&#039;s going on under their hood. If something happens to their dream car then they can usually pop the hood, investigate and figure out what the problem is, and repair it themselves. And if they don&#039;t know how then they&#039;ll reach out to people who do know how and ask for advice, learn how to fix it, and then get it done. But then when it comes to games, it seems that most gamers just play games and don&#039;t know anything about what&#039;s going on so when a problem arises they&#039;re shit out of luck. They don&#039;t know anything about the hardware so they just repeat whatever they heard in YouTube videos, which are made by people who also don&#039;t know about the hardware. All it takes is one Metal Jesus to say something stupid and everyone who watches them and also doesn&#039;t understand the hardware will repeat it forever because they trust the channel they watch much like boomers trust their favorite entertainment news channel.<br><br>In the coming years, more and more consoles will become in need of basic maintenance, and as that happens more and more casuals will probably turn to emulation because they&#039;re too scared to learn how to change a battery or a capacitor. My hope is that as a result of this, more and more retro gamers who play on physical hardware will become more like car guys and actually know what&#039;s going on under the hood. You don&#039;t have to be an expert, but you should be capable of basic repairs and upkeep and currently most people aren&#039;t.

Retro overpricing was heavily ramping up by then.<br><br>I sold just the BOXES for some of my old consoles and N64 games for several hundred altogether. In fact, I sold some of the extra consoles I had lying around that I no longer need and they went for much less than the empty boxes, unless it&#039;s a more recent console.<br><br>I was never much of a collector, at most I like to collect some of the more noteworthy games or ones from the past that I just really liked but I never cared too much about the boxes or condition over just playing the games. I have no desire to have a &quot;full collection&quot; for a console like some have, at least, not in physical form. I lucked out a bit though, went on a spending spree for old N64 and PS1 games around 2006, a little before the retro-boom. I remember it being considered expensive to pay more than $10 for a PS1 or N64 game that wasn&#039;t something rare, Amazon was full of hundreds of sealed boxed copies of Perfect Dark for $3 each. Managed to snag dozens of the N64 and PS1 games I always wanted to play, or had rented and loved but never owned for $1-5 each. Even ones that are expensive nowadays like Conker, the Banjo games, 007, every WWF game, Yoshi&#039;s Story, Mystical Ninja, Bomberman, and a few others... sadly I think I didn&#039;t get Diddy Kong Racing or the Turok games. Most are just the cart, but a few like Conker are CIB... that have actually degraded a bit because I had no idea I should have stored them well at the time.<br><br>That being said a few are special to me, such as a copy of Megaman 1 complete in box that I got for a mere 25 cents at a garage sale less than a year ago. I was very very tempted to sell it since that tends to go for over $300, but I wanted to just have at least one thing special since as far as I am aware nothing in my entire game collection since I started gaming in the NES era is special or rare and decided to keep it.<br><br>(Also, WATA can go burn in hell)", "filename": "4epcp7otecu61", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674767519588898, "time": 1674767519, "md5": "jrc566A+xXK+o89/saOSVw==", "fsize": 302432, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9605283, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:18:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604935</a><br>Yep, in box too.", "time": 1674767900, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9605526, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)17:45:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605270</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WATA grading</span><br>Useless", "time": 1674773159, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9605950, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605283</a><br>hot glue....", "time": 1674783781, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9606187, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:39:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604935</a><br>No. I even reserved it and got it the day it came out.

Something that also bothers me about them is that for all the hype around sick combos, a lot of the enemies can&#039;t be meaningfully combo&#039;d. Humanoid bosses in particular can often be stunned, allowing you to wail on them for a bit, but no matter what you do to them during these sections they just sit there: you can&#039;t move or manipulate them in any way, all you can do is deal damage. It&#039;s lame - I&#039;m not saying you should be able to infinitely combo them, but if they&#039;re going to have a &quot;vulnerable&quot; state you can trigger, make them comboable when in that state.", "time": 1674546788, "resto": 9596384}, {"no": 9598384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:16:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596485</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But anyway, who cares about the grades?

The major difference, besides the controls, is apparently Prime 2 has some difficulty adjustments for some bosses so the game ends up being a bit easier. <br><br>Out of Prime 1 and 2, I think 2 barely edges it out for me. I think Prime 2 really hones down the aesthetic of the Prime games into something unique, where Prime 1 has some generic aesthetic choices. This is also apparently controversial, but I actually really like the beam ammo mechanics. There&#039;s a bit of a survival horror edge to Prime 2 because of that: besides the zombies in the opening, the Ing, and the whole dark world. <br>I think Metroid is at its best when it&#039;s a little scary, and Prime 2 might lean hardest into the spooky aesthetics I like from the series, besides what you get in Super.<br><br>In terms of environments I&#039;m a massive fan of Torvus Bog: it reminds me of growing up in Florida, but has this lovely feeling in certain parts of it like you&#039;re not supposed to be there.

The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a Battletoads cart into it at 400 miles per hour, and the cart was unharmed. They then built a wall out of Battletoads and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond Battletoads made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at Battletoads. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of Battletoads into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth&#039;s orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a Battletoads made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at Battletoads into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.

All the FX2 did was support larger ROMs than the FX1, the FX1 otherwise performs the same as the FX2. Many people assumed the FX1 runs slower from trying to use Star Fox 1 as the doner cart, but the chip used in Star Fox 1 was slower variant called the Mario Chip. The ROM of Star Fox 2 is small enough to be fully addressable with the FX1. The most likely reason that Star Fox 2 was going to use a FX2 chip is that they were probably not producing the FX1 anymore, not that it needed it. Even if the FX2 cost more to make, having production of both FX1 and FX2 going on at the same time when any FX1 game would run the same on a FX2 would have cost more.<br><br>There are far less games that had a FX2 in them, and even less that had battery SRAM. About your only option outside of Tealand is Doom and Yoshi&#039;s Island, both rare and expensive.<br><br>Meanwhile the Dirt Trax FX and Stunt Race FX games can be had for $10-15 at times and there were tons of those. Yeah, it does suck to have to cannabalize older SNES games to make one of these, but there is no real way to create your own from scratch due to it being an FX game. No homebrew way to create your own FX chip. I mean, it can probably be implemented with a FPGA but I have zero clue how powerful (and thus expensive) an FPGA one would need. I tried to lookup the hardware in the FXPak but all I could find was that a prototype from 2011 used a Spartan 3 FPGA, no idea if the current carts also use that. Depending on the version they go from $18 to $120, most seem to be $18-40.<br><br>As for making it, many have made such a repro in the past. Most of them back then were made with the beta ROM that was floating around for years before the SNES Classic.

OoT was a very good start on 3D combat but right now I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry and <s>Dark Souls not retro though</s>.<br><br>The prior focuses on giving the player as many combat options as possible and makes that the fun of the game. Launchers, flying attacks, guns, ways to combo enemies, parries, everything you could want to do. These games are more about being stylish than just outright winning the fight. However this limits the enemy design as these games can quickly become unfun if there&#039;s too many enemies you can&#039;t combo effectively, or if the bosses act in a way that&#039;s too limiting to your arsenal.<br><br>While the latter is the exact opposite, you have an extremely narrow set of options in combat. Block, dodge, light swing, heavy swing, shoot projectile and maybe a few more options. While this seems limiting it allows the developers to focus much more heavily on challenging enemy design based on how enemies respond and require you to use the few options in your arsenal. People generally love boss fights in these kind of games for this exact reason, every single boss is like learning a song in a rhythm game since its mostly been simplified to &quot;when do I dodge and when do I hit?&quot;.<br><br>OoT has a lot of options that lack purpose. Yes you can angle your swipes, horizontally or vertically, but what value does that have over just hitting the B button? The answer is none because enemies don&#039;t respond to things in ways that warrant you to change that. Would crouch stabbing have any value if it wasn&#039;t just objectively the best DPS in the game? I don&#039;t think so, because no enemies have a mechanic where you need to crouch to evade their attacks. Dodge mechanics are hardly even necessary because only a tiny few enemies can threaten your shield, I can&#039;t even think of any other than Darknuts.<br><br>So I think that answers your question, quality &gt; quantity.", "filename": "20245725_1390952080994962_7348464048814365511_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 658, "h": 370, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674842161091574, "time": 1674842161, "md5": "zWcQa8zfOLvO/HZ8GMt9rQ==", "fsize": 25081, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607775, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry</span><br>you are wrong<br>it&#039;s <s>the batman arkham games</s>", "time": 1674842493, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607783, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:04:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607775</a><br>i really only see other superhero games copying that but yeah that one is influential unfortunately, I don&#039;t think its as much as the 2 I said though.", "time": 1674842640, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9608043, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:54:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607519</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;second song</span><br>good job proving my point with one of the most grating instruments used.", "time": 1674849272, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609634, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br>They should increase the quality instead of reducing the quantity", "time": 1674905120, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609819, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you want peak sword combat, check out Jedi Outcast", "time": 1674913481, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609823, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>the harmonica? not my fault you got shit taste", "time": 1674913581, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610042, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>This might be the wrong board for you if you need the clearest music possible and can&#039;t appreciate retro music by merit of memorable melodies <br><br>Kakariko is THE comfy-village music", "time": 1674920798, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610047, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:47:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609819</a><br>This game is the definition of janky", "time": 1674920873, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610052, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:49:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dark Souls not retro though.</span><br>But that&#039;s influenced by Zelda in the first place and extremely basic.

Apparently this sentiment has been prevalent ever since it released? This is the first time I&#039;m really noticing it. A lot of people online are saying this game was ball-bustingly hard or they never beat it. Are people just really bad at platformers these days? I don&#039;t get it. It feels more like a zoomer thing to say because I relished in the challenge. I didn&#039;t cry about having to hunt for lives or have only 3 hit points. I just found out you could have up to fucking ten (10!!!) hitpoints in the DSiWare version which I just find completely kekworthy.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it. Also, some DS games could have some form of interaction with prior GBA titles if two relevant ones were inserted, typically bonuses in a DS sequel to a GBA game.", "time": 1674085495, "resto": 9571779}, {"no": 9583639, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:32:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9582349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9582349</a><br>There&#039;s too much shit to keep up with as is.
