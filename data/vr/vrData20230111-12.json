One character class (Onion Knight), which kinda sucked anyway and was a major pain in the ass to master.<br>3. The updated translation, it sticks to the straight to the point, no bullshit script of the PSX release as opposed to going all Shakespearean on your ass. Some people will love it, others will hate it - there&#039;s two crowds of FFT fans, plenty of arguments have been made for both translations over the years.<br><br>So that&#039;s what you&#039;d miss out on. But holy fuck do you get so much more, with Continue+ and NG+ options, three additional endgame characters you can recruit (demons) after you&#039;ve finished the game for the first time, additional skills, being able to change the difficulty, stat resetting option once you&#039;ve reached level 99 with a character (won&#039;t take long, trust) and would like to improve your builds, fuckloads of quality of life little patches etc. Can&#039;t go back to the vanilla FFT after this, PSX or PSP, this mod rocks", "time": 1673166894, "resto": 9551446}, {"no": 9552690, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:37:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9551524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9551524</a><br>PS1 version modded with the extra stuff the PSP version added is the best of both worlds.

Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details. It&#039;s great as a replacement for aging handheld consoles, but for TV out consoles it may be better to get one of the other handhelds with bigger screens<br><br>That&#039;s it for now, I guess.

It&#039;s bad for a video game magazine, it&#039;s bad for a Nintendo-only magazine, it&#039;s bad for an English video game magazine and it&#039;s bad for an English Nintendo-only magazine.

Torment could be said to be worse bc you have to hover mouse-over to see any item/interaction prompts, many of which are hidden under scenery.

It&#039;s one of my favorite games of all time, but I understand well why it&#039;s always been a little niche. My suggestion if you try again is just take it slow for a while and learn how the game flows. The second level has an octopus that is there to help teach you. You&#039;ll feel low on air and like you should be rushing, but the octopus will slap you back of you do. In Ecco, rushing is what usually kills you. Your air is always depleting and you will think you&#039;re going to drown if you don&#039;t, but success relies on keeping calm under pressure and being accurate.

While I love Space Harrier to a huge degree, I also like Ecco. They are very different, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. I hate this comparison being thrown around, but in many ways Ecco is like Demon&#039;s Souls was compared to other contemporary games. <br><br>From an objective standpoint there are many harder retro games, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania 3, Super Ghouls n Ghosts, Battletoads, 1ccing Gradius etc (all of which get regular threads here by people declaring that the difficulty is overstated) are all much harder than anything Ecco throws at you, even the last levels. Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed. You can call it tedious, but it was never meant to be a bing bing wahoo rush to the finish type game. Unreliable just makes no sense, if you want to permakill an enemy, you can.

I think it would be amazing to see games with open environments that feature the occasional structured &quot;dungeon&quot; (the average HL level).

A few things got me into this, the 1st is that an English translation came out in the last few years and gave me a chance to finally play it, this was the most crucial reason by far, because otherwise I&#039;d have never even attempted to play it, the other reason is that this is historic for the Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG and TCG, since it essentially gave Konami the license for it and was used as the basis for the original rulesets. A lot of things about it are ridiculous, for example, do you want to get a Blue-Eyes White Dragon? Simple, just beat Kaiba... a 100 times, do you want a Red-Eyes B. Dragon? Simple, just beat Joey... a 100 times. You do get a card every 10 wins for each duelist, but the best ones require 100 wins... and I did it for about 5 or 6 of them, to get the cards I wanted, why?

Compared to DC, GCN doubles the number of dungeuns, adds new character classes, completely overhauls and rebalances the classes for the better, adds an absolute fuckton of new rare weapons to find (the main reason to play the game long-term) and makes their droprates almost reasonable compared to the absurdly low droprates on DC. The Spread Needle is no longer so OP as to completely dominate online play to the point where you won&#039;t get a single hit in if a teammate is using one. It fixes the glitch that allowed players to teamkill. It fixes the glitch that allowed players to go through locked doors. You no longer drop your money and equipped weapon when you die, to be ganked by other players. It adds a quick item select like the one in Monster Hunter that makes it MUCH easier to use items and spells that aren&#039;t assigned to your main 6 buttons. (On DC, you&#039;re stuck with JUST those 6 actions, at least two of which will be your basic attacks. Have fun juggling all those spells if you&#039;re a spellcaster) Spells now go up to Lv 30 instead of capping at Lv 15, and only Spellcasters can go above level 20, giving you an actual reason to use a spellcaster. GCN also adds splitscreen multiplayer, which is the best reason to play it. You can play online on private servers, either through a Gamecube with a broadband adapter, or a Wii with a lan adapter, but be warned; you have to take alot of precautions playing any console version online. Any rando in your lobby or your game can potentially freeze your game with a cheat device, causing you to lose all unequipped items on your character.

Much like the other VGA graphical adventure games by Sierra, the entire screen is full of stuff to check out. Jokes, one-liners, and even poems are hidden on the various screens in the games, and only need to be touched or looked at to be revealed. They are a breeze on easy, though possibly challenging for younger players, but on the hardest difficulty the puzzles can be challenging even for adults. Completing puzzles earns hint tokens which can be used to assist or even completely solve puzzles you have problems with.

I often see many hold it in high regard, but at the same time I often see it get a lot of harsh criticism, so it&#039;s hard to determine wheter it&#039;s mostly beloved or simply mixed in its reception. Now, for the 2nd thing I wonder about it, it&#039;s regarding its other versions, not so much the 8bit ones, since those, while respectable for the hardware they were made for, can be annoying due to only having a single life and no continues, it doesn&#039;t play as well as the original either... no, the main port that strikes my curiosity is the SEGA CD one, I&#039;ve played it recently after hearing many talk about how it was the definitive version, and while I see how it improves on a few things, it&#039;s overall not as fun as the original to me... which version do you consider to be superior, anons?", "filename": "c53ca19fba451ef8825d6beaf2890885", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 580, "h": 799, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673342522484112, "time": 1673342522, "md5": "k8JQUb48AR28m5kZV9kDRA==", "fsize": 115138, "resto": 9557860}, {"no": 9559257, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)13:38:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9558360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9558360</a><br>Elaborating a little on why I prefer the original version over the SEGA CD one, it&#039;s due to a lot of things they&#039;ve added that simply didn&#039;t do it for me.

I am STILL stuck on smb2 nes after playing it casually for a year and I save state every world. I save stated at the beginning of each level on smb1, the all star version is smb 1 every world, and smb2 every level, which makes more sense given the difficulty, and I think that&#039;s probably a better way to learn to platform anyways. I recommend Kirby&#039;s adventure too, it gets harder at the end and has fun things to find/figure out and I felt better at Mario after playing it, though I&#039;m a brainlet.

This can be verified, to a degree, by compiling the manually decompiled code and seeing if it matches the ROM, but all the identifier names and any programmer comments cannot be derived from the ROM image.", "time": 1672383202, "resto": 9522294}, {"no": 9529398, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)02:02:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why is there swearing in this supposedly family oriented game?
