I checked that wiki and actually most of the page links work so I recommend looking through it for many vital tips. The one that is broken is the one detailing the classes, which sucks but you can ask if you want advice. <br><br>My preferred strategy if I&#039;m not doing a specific challenge like playing as one class the whole game is to start by following Xom the chaos god. He&#039;s challenging because his will shifts between all the other gods at random, so one moment he&#039;ll be wanting you to play like a wizard and you&#039;ll be zapping spells and and wands trying to avoid combat and then the next round he turns barbarian and if you cast a single spell it will reverse all your good favor and he&#039;ll curse you. <br><br>So that said, Xom is always watching anyways so that can happen either way (though it&#039;s less likely not following him to have built up enough good will) and more importantly you only know which god he&#039;s mimicking if you follow him so that alone is a boon. But better, he&#039;s one of only two gods who can bless your water and holy water is one of the most useful items in the game, letting you uncurse objects. <br><br>So I follow him until I get holy water and then look at my situation, what gear I gave and what the specifics for the run are. If pointy slippers are jump or speed boots and I have decent spell books I&#039;ll usually go wizard for a while. Floppy hat, plain robes, two rings and pointy slippers is the dress code and he increases your mp regeneration speed which is super handy.", "time": 1669910810, "resto": 9447815}, {"no": 9458629, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:35:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9450556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9450556</a><br>I hate them, but something about rice changers is super cute.", "time": 1669930512, "resto": 9447815}], "last_modified": 1669930512}, {"no": 9458628, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:34:52", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Favorite nostalgia soundtracks?", "com": "What&#039;s your favorite nostalgia video game soundtrack that is specific to you and maybe is not heard of or recognized..?<br>Thanks", "filename": "a6d90f17-8e2d-43f4-8b27-8b695769f5a3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 192, "h": 262, "tn_w": 183, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669930492881549, "time": 1669930492, "md5": "dJnzvh6qCWuchln/5eTeNA==", "fsize": 17365, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "favorite-nostalgia-soundtracks", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1669930492}, {"no": 9432628, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)11:25:45", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Pokemon | Link&#039;s Awakening", "com": "Comparison in scale of Pok\u00e9mon and Zelda&#039;s Gameboy maps.<br><br>Interesting eh?", "filename": "redgreenlinksawakening", "ext": ".png", "w": 8119, "h": 5824, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 179, "tim": 1669047945461468, "time": 1669047945, "md5": "BH8Q3SUUW8NRPOusfZmI4g==", "fsize": 1325848, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "pokemon-links-awakening", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 238, "images": 36, "omitted_posts": 233, "omitted_images": 34, "last_replies": [{"no": 9457647, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)08:14:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9448743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9448743</a><br>Shut up", "time": 1669900487, "resto": 9432628}, {"no": 9458376, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)14:37:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9456379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9456379</a><br><a href=\"#p9456149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9456149</a><br><a href=\"#p9456054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9456054</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FR/LG vs R/B/Y faggotry</span><br><br>Shut the fuck you goddamn retards. <br><br>Anyone who was a kid when they played the originals (as you should have been), during the original wave of Pokemania, would have still only been like 14-16 teenage at the time of FR/LG.

Me and my brother actually emulated it before we got physical carts for Christmas, and we both knew damn well we wanted it portable and able to trade with others, even if we didn&#039;t have Game Boy Colors or a Super Game Boy. Both of us got Blue for some reason (maybe Red was out), but that was a minor disappointment and the game was still great.<br>I still like it a lot, it was a big hit for a good reason, a really solid entrylevel JRPG with a good premise and fun exploration, which was also paired with a great tie-in cartoon along with effective merchandising and marketing. The playground exchange and mythbuilding was also special, and something later generations of kids will likely never have (at least in the same way). It has flaws, there&#039;s things which don&#039;t work like intended, but it&#039;s still very playable, and most kids wouldn&#039;t notice them or know where to look for the more egregious ones. The little rough edges aren&#039;t a big deal.<br><br>The greatest strength I think is the setting, taking place in a contemporary world, rather than many RPGs being some form of medieval fantasy or a mixture of it. The setting is still pretty fantastical, even sci-fi at times, but it&#039;s overall a more relatable setting than most RPGs I had seen, and the anime really helped spur my imagination of how the world would look like past the functional abstraction of the game. There weren&#039;t any streets or sidewalks in the game itself, no highways with cars, with towns only being a few houses, but your fantasy fills in those gaps.<br>The progression of the worldmap is smart, there&#039;s crossing paths, dungeons you have to move through to get to the other side, paths initially closed off which you return to later, optional paths or even complete optional dungeons, etc, and different locations have different Pok\u00e9mon to fight and catch.

It kinda just slipped from us.<br>I got to try out my cousin&#039;s copy of Ruby some time later, and it really hooked me, aside from the pretty graphics and nicer sound and music, I liked the new land to explore, with new gameplay mechanics and new Pok\u00e9mon (the new generation of designs could be a little hit or miss, but there were a bunch I really liked).<br> <br>I talk my brother into it, and we both make sure to get different versions this time around, and we have a great time.

Romantic relationships are important, but I think saving the world from the apocalypse is a bigger goal. If you didn&#039;t want to go through all of that, you could have just chosen the bad ending and let everyone live their lives until the apocalypse, but that defeats the entire message the game is telling you and obviously the right thing to do is fight to the very end", "time": 1669893998, "resto": 9449504}], "last_modified": 1669893998}, {"no": 9455981, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)17:26:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are the best backwards compatible GBC games?", "filename": "45930_1218247272157_262_300", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 262, "h": 299, "tn_w": 219, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669847183349897, "time": 1669847183, "md5": "TWW+7082DkvA3Oc98wDCWA==", "fsize": 21866, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-are-the-best-backwards-compatible-gbc-games", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 6, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 1, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 9457038, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)00:11:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9455981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9455981</a><br>Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2 &amp; 3", "time": 1669871469, "resto": 9455981}, {"no": 9457051, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)00:14:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pokemon Trading Card Game, Mega Man Xtreme 1, and obviously, Pokemon Gold and Silver.", "filename": "1669161167425577", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2362, "h": 2953, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669871668976878, "time": 1669871668, "md5": "sD7DoVcwEluznmakkx13hw==", "fsize": 943863, "resto": 9455981}, {"no": 9457461, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)05:08:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9457051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9457051</a><br>Gold and Silver aren&#039;t backwards compatible.", "time": 1669889294, "resto": 9455981}, {"no": 9457471, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)05:17:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9457461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9457461</a><br>Yeah they are, crystal isn&#039;t though.", "time": 1669889824, "resto": 9455981}, {"no": 9457495, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)05:44:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wonder whether they were designed with color in mind or were added later.", "time": 1669891459, "resto": 9455981}], "last_modified": 1669891459}, {"no": 9453906, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)21:10:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So if people got a PS2 to play DVD&#039;s, was there a console people bought to play VCD&#039;s?", "filename": "img412dff723f7b3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 600, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669774241872099, "time": 1669774241, "md5": "P37D9jjz6WqiOW14AMjK5Q==", "fsize": 42895, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "so-if-people-got-a-ps2-to-play-dvds-was-there-a", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 34, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 29, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 9457354, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)03:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9457319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9457319</a><br>Yes, during that littlr era, where DVD players was common but DVD burner were not, it was a good way to share videos.
