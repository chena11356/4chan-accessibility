I feel like the only time they lose a ball is when there&#039;s absolutely nothing they can do even after nudging and I end up watching their 10 minute ball one after my 1 minute one lol. Is it just holding and going slow?

And the pinball is now out of service for days or weeks depending on how quickly they replace the glass. <br><br>Nudging (or any other &quot;pro&quot; pinball techniques) causes problems over time when a single player does it. Now imagine a pinball machine in a public arcade. It gets played dozens of times a day by many different players. More if it&#039;s popular location. It wears out the machine faster. Pins are just pieces of wood and metal after all. It&#039;s gonna break eventually if you keep stressing the connection points with movement. <br><br>You might be able to get away with it with newer machines but These older pinball machines aren&#039;t made anymore and sourcing replacement parts are difficult if something serious breaks. They should be respected and treated with an extra level of care from players if it&#039;s an older machine. This isn&#039;t the 1980s or 1990s anymore. These machines are old now. <br><br><br>Personally, I&#039;d much rather focus on flipper control than worry about nudging and shifting a machine.

Today, pinball is most commonly an arcade game in which the ball is fired into a specially designed cabinet known as a pinball machine, hitting various lights, bumpers, ramps, and other targets depending on its design. The game&#039;s object is generally to score as many points as possible by hitting these targets and making various shots with flippers before the ball is lost.

They feature weaknesses that are hard to guess and hard to tell when you\u2019re doing it right versus wrong. For instance, phantoon does his special attack when you super missile him. A new player unfamiliar with his patterns will have a tough time linking that attack to a super missile hitting him and as such will probably stumble through the fight. The worst offender is draygon with the grapple zapple. If you don\u2019t use the grapple against it the fight is really really hard for a new player. Finally, Ridley is practically immune to missiles, taking 180 to die from them as opposed to 20 charge shots, making him not only wall players using regular boss strategies (use missiles and supers) but also doesn\u2019t give any indication that charge shots are doing more (other than noticing the faster color change on him). These bosses seem like an area where the game fails to communicate to the player, unlike the entire rest of the game, which is filled with thoughtful touches. <br><br>Thoughts?", "time": 1674452578, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9594943, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)00:57:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9594635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9594635</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;samefagging 47 minutes later</span><br>lol sure<br>perhaps...your opinion isn&#039;t very popular", "time": 1674453438, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9595360, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;underrated</span><br>what the fuck is wrong with you<br>what do you think that word means?<br><br>seriously what the fuck do you think it means<br>&quot;underrated&quot;<br>jesus christ", "time": 1674473606, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9595525, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:51:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is Super Metroid still fairly underrated?</span><br>Since the franchise itself still is and Super Metroid has never even sold 3 million + copies to my knowledge I would say yeah its way too underrated.

Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white. Realistically, you&#039;ll probably have to settle on some sort of compromise between true blacks and a bit of black crush as no display is perfect. But hey, that ghosting should be gone at least.", "time": 1674540713, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9597950, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)02:07:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;build gbsc, forget jumper</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;plug it into pc crt</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crt goes berzerk &quot;117khz 240hz out of range&quot; with green flashes of light</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fix gbs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now pc monitors makes progressively louder high pitch squeal at 640x480, gone in other resolutions</span><br>di...did I fuck up?", "filename": "06a", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 606, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1674544066693093, "time": 1674544066, "md5": "CwRG4KYruIQjk+3tsEyo9Q==", "fsize": 32915, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598045, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:03:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597950</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fuck up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ask if you fucked up</span><br>lol. why?", "time": 1674547438, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598059, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597859</a><br>cheers, i&#039;ll try that out later", "time": 1674548000, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598074, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9598045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9598045</a><br>Yeah but did I fuck up enough to where my crt will die?", "time": 1674548507, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598121, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:52:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588807</a><br>What model is pic rel from?", "time": 1674550331, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598176, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:14:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591052</a><br>Infinite is good fun", "time": 1674551693, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598265, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)05:36:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588703</a><br>Yeah.

The ROM of Star Fox 2 is small enough to be fully addressable with the FX1. The most likely reason that Star Fox 2 was going to use a FX2 chip is that they were probably not producing the FX1 anymore, not that it needed it.

Yeah, it does suck to have to cannabalize older SNES games to make one of these, but there is no real way to create your own from scratch due to it being an FX game. No homebrew way to create your own FX chip. I mean, it can probably be implemented with a FPGA but I have zero clue how powerful (and thus expensive) an FPGA one would need. I tried to lookup the hardware in the FXPak but all I could find was that a prototype from 2011 used a Spartan 3 FPGA, no idea if the current carts also use that. Depending on the version they go from $18 to $120, most seem to be $18-40.<br><br>As for making it, many have made such a repro in the past.

I recall one of the descriptions was &quot;made things that look like crosses look a little less like crosses&quot;... which was code for removing every single cross in the game (though I spotted two they missed). This is a game where you play as basically a battle-nun exorcising demons and ghosts mind you, it would be like changing the vampires and skeletons in Castlevania to look like humans.<br><br>Another one that was poorly done in that same game is one of the characters would smoke, they edited out the cigarette from his sprite. Problem is his victory animation showed him tossing it and pulling out another, so now his victory animation made no sense.

It was Microsoft who were insisting on minimum orders that were too high (500k like). Developers beefs with Nintendo was that they required them to order more than what they needed and later ask for reimbursement, PLUS Nintendo goes and says &quot;nah your game sucks, just take 10k copies for the entire run&quot; while playing favorites with bigger publishers (infogrammes and enix get million copies of orders with no issue) but that means publishers often find that there&#039;s no way they can recoup localization/marketing/distribution<wbr> expenses because the sales potential is TOO LOW, so you get cases like Metal Slader Glory which cost a lot but only sold an initial print run of 10k and that was really it, despite massive public demand.<br>That aside, Nintendo even at their worst were very flexible with approving limited edition games (Recca, Tengai Makyou Zero Shounen Jump version, among others) so it wouldn&#039;t be a problem for WD if they wanted LEs. And the point is moot, Nintendo stopped most of this bullshit after 96 and even went back for the Snes to make up for past blunders and courted devs with the Nintendo Power service in Japan that eliminates physical altogether.<br><br>So the situation isn&#039;t present for the N64 and beyond.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it. Also, some DS games could have some form of interaction with prior GBA titles if two relevant ones were inserted, typically bonuses in a DS sequel to a GBA game.", "time": 1674085495, "resto": 9571779}, {"no": 9583639, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:32:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9582349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9582349</a><br>There&#039;s too much shit to keep up with as is.

The game opens with her being refused a bus ride, that bus is bombed by terrorists and everyone is dead, the terrorists are gunned by an airplane and everyone is dead, and the girl inspects the bus and goes &quot;It can&#039;t be helped&quot;. Then she has to avoid dying by starvation, getting hugged to death by a pedophile cop, getting killed in the crossfire of other terrorists in a public park where a schizophrenic woman thinks the heroine is daughter, and then an alien locale that defies description.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible). The rest should be played in original form where possible, give or take a translation/restoration patch.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I mostly care about translation accuracy</span><br>The ChaosRush one is the one you want then, preferably with an enhancement that makes the game play more like rereleases / as intended. Default is probably better since Chaos Edition looks like it makes a bit too much guesswork with DND equivalents.

The GBA version might be best overall, but it feels like Square was being vindictive at times about their official PSX versions of 4&amp;5 being outshined at the time by unofficial SFC translation hacks, so they overlocalized it to the point a few key scenes almost feel like parody. You&#039;ll see some defend these edits, but it&#039;s clear in reality that they have trash taste. SFC original does have a GBA script port. The base fan translation is showing its age, but you could try checking out Spooniest&#039;s &quot;Legend of the Crystals&quot; addendum instead.

Meanwhile, both the Black and White Mages are simply too damn squishy even accounting for bugfixed Int, and taking full advantage of them by decking out their magic slots makes them lowkey the most expensive classes to maintain, so they&#039;re hardly worth wasting slots. This ironically makes the default party of the NES/MSX version the best beginner-friendly one in the long run since it has the most reasonable variety; in the original/bugged version, Thief is just too much of a drag in the long run and you&#039;re better off replacing it with literally anything else.

I am here to tell you that emulation and the secondhand market are both very wrong. Please delete your unauthorized reproductions and used copies within 24 hours. The only ethical way to consume video games is to buy a rendition that is currently sold through physical or digital retailers. For FINAL FANTASY, the Pixel Remaster series is an excellent choice. It is the latest incarnation of the classic FINAL FANTASY series, remastered for modern audiences with &quot;retro&quot; sensibilities. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is currently available on PC via Steam, Android via Google Play Store, and iOS via App Store. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is also coming soon to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4, where they were available physically. For FINAL FANTASY III or FINAL FANTASY IV, you may alternatively or additionally purchase our 3D remakes, which are still available on digital markets. The 3D remakes offer an experience similar but alternative to the 2D originals, making them worthwhile playthroughs. Remember, by purchasing only these versions of the FINAL FANTASY series, you are supporting the company that brought you the definitive editions of these legendary video games. As much as I too have a certain fondness for these classic role-playing video games as they appeared on Game Boy Advance and Sony PlayStation Portable, Square Enix will no longer receive the desirable monetary compensation through these obsoleted platforms, so it is therefore not recommended that you seek those ancient versions of these video games. If the FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is your first exposure to the FINAL FANTASY series, you will have no frame of reference with what came before, which in our studies can enhance consumer experience even further.

In DQ2 towns tend to work like hubs from which you may lead several adventures, and come back to between these adventures: using Cannock to go to the cave in the east, then to the cave in the west, before venturing further. Using Hamlin to go to Moonbroke, find the item in the swamp, then the tower in the east before venturing further.

The Pixel Remaster is (surprise) the easiest one between the Famicom and 3D versions. Back in the DS version, the monster limit was crunched due to perceived hardware limitations, so stats/classes were rebalanced across the board to make up for it. It wasn&#039;t perfect, but it got the job done and general game difficulty wasn&#039;t as wildly thrown off as some people make it seem. At worst, maybe the boss AI could&#039;ve been improved. Pixel Remaster is aesthetically closer to the Famicom original, but it still carries over and builds upon a staggering amount of 3D remake changes under the hood, especially the parts of it that give you an easier time without regard for why that was done in the first place. Many of the added class abilities were kept, giving you a bigger edge in battle. The capacity system was replaced yet again, but whereas the 3D version gave you a reasonable adjustment period, PR now has absolutely nothing there to keep you in check. And while the formations are ostensibly based on the original, the monster locations are based on the 3D version; an easy example, Goblins only appear in Altar Cave in the original, while in the 3D and PR versions, they keep appearing well after the cave and show up in and around town, which is normally the point you&#039;re supposed to be moving on to the next phase of monsters. Oddly enough, a similar change may have been planned for the WonderSwan Color version <br><a href=\"#p9600631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9600631</a>, but it at least looks like they would&#039;ve increased the number of outdoor Goblins to compensate (or it was just a test shot). Plus, in Pixel Remaster, game overs mean very little and the game freely allows you to restart from the beginning of the area. Final Fantasy III isn&#039;t even one of the hardest games in the series, putting aside the long final dungeon that eluded playtesting. Overall, yes, there is much dumbing down in the Pixel Remaster, and the Famicom and DS versions both had greater respect for your resourcefulness.", "filename": "ff3fc", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 443, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 51, "tim": 1674675352136161, "time": 1674675352, "md5": "qgW3PKa/r8r091jgAkkqBA==", "fsize": 367577, "resto": 9570560}, {"no": 9602483, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:51:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9602415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9602415</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s more than visual fluff.</span><br>That&#039;s nice but that&#039;s all I was talking about<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many of the added class abilities were kept, giving you a bigger edge in battle</span><br>Does this really make the game that much easier so much as just making more jobs usable though?

We have an overall impression over the years that R2 was removed due to it somehow being too slow-paced and janky. Well, we have this Amy gameplay concept courtesy of (I think) Sonic Origins. Something relevant here is that she had a role in R2, not R1&amp;3, and indeed, she&#039;s missing from Salad Plain in the early proto, so it&#039;s likely she was at that point in development still bound for R2. It also seems that she had a somewhat bigger role originally. If I understand it right, here&#039;s what I believe the deal is: R2 was supposed to essentially be an ESCORT MISSION that served as a formal introduction to Amy. Maybe the idea was for players to get accustomed to her and even start to appreciate her help, possibly acting as a sort of tutorial to explore your surroundings, before she gets yanked away and motivates you to want to save her, but the execution was lacking and it ended up having the opposite effect in which she was a hindrance and players found her capture to be a relief. Thus it was an underground route filled with &quot;ridicule&quot; (Amy). Due to a combination of &quot;what shrooms were we on&quot; and time/space-constraints, the level was cut entirely instead of being reworked. The Amy gimmick was repurposed as a minor gag at the end of Palmtree Panic 1 present, and her kidnapping scene was moved to the start of R3 (Collision Chaos).", "filename": "SOAmyScene", "ext": ".png", "w": 1501, "h": 1960, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674680412440522, "time": 1674680412, "md5": "gDdLAh/5k2889bR11Fk3eA==", "fsize": 2744215, "resto": 9593869}, {"no": 9603759, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)00:04:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9602706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9602706</a><br>Hold on, how would the escort mission work with the time travel?

As well as trying to figure out exactly what you have to work with. First off, your pilots. The important stats are AP(Action Points), DEF(ense), SCT(Scouting), AG(Attack against Ground), and AA(Attack against Air). Your best combat mechs and your biggest guns should go to the people with the highest AG. Never make someone with a shit SCT score a scout. It shouldn&#039;t be too tricky to figure that part out. Next, you have a few different mechs to choose from at first, and you&#039;ll get upgraded versions later on. One is the general mech with maximum mount points for equipment, one is the heavy armor mech with no shoulder weapons, one is the scout mech, and you have a special 2-seater mech for that 3rd mission that you will never use otherwise.<br>When it comes to equipment, you have a lot of options but the shoulder-mounted missiles rape all. Less ammo but you aren&#039;t supposed to be fighting battles, you&#039;re supposed to be taking out a target and running away. After that you just need to assign people to roles. Who&#039;s flying them in, who&#039;s in which squad, who&#039;s support air or artillery. Once on the battlefield, have your scouts on the edge of your formation and have them scan.

PC-E has a fast 8-bit CPU while the Mega Drive has a slightly less fast 16-bit CPU with 32-bit data width. The 65C02 assembly codes resemble that of the 6502 and have shorter and simpler commands than the 68000, thus it excelled at simple 2D tasks. The 68000 excelled at more complex tasks, allowing games to have more visual effects and even 3D rendering capability. It&#039;s just like comparing the 6502 to the Z80 or the 680.<br>2. PC-E&#039;s display controller is more straightforward from what I know. Yeah it could render more colors, but you couldn&#039;t have too much parallax effects, and 3D effects would be slower. And I think you could pull off some tricks on the MD to make it display more colors.<br>3. PC-E&#039;s 8KB scratchpad SRAM might have helped. The Mega Drive got a slower 64KB unified DRAM. <br>4. Japanese devs sucked at 68000 assembly, or they just didn&#039;t bother trying because the MD was much less commercially successful in Japan. The Amiga veterans working on Mega Drive games created tons of technically impressive games the PC-E couldn&#039;t even dream of running. There&#039;s nothing remotely comparable to Turrican 3, Duke Nukem 3D, and The Lost World on the PC-E. There are a few great looking Japanese MD games like Panorama Cotton, Ranger X, and Alien Soldier. Faceball&#039;s 4 screen multiplayer is pretty impressive though, but it&#039;s a horrible looking game, worse than the Atari 8-bit port.<br>5. Space Harrier looks like ass t.b.h.

I know it&#039;s a matter of taste, and if you don&#039;t enjoy something I do then that&#039;s fine really, but I can&#039;t help but feel that a lot of people don&#039;t give Sonic a fair enough shot and end up missing out on experiences they might&#039;ve loved otherwise. When it comes to Sonic, the reason you run into things and get hit is because, well, you&#039;re going fast and, depending on how quick your reflexes are, you might not be able to react to things in time, it&#039;s something that varies from player to player and that&#039;s fine, but I can see why some would go through this and assume that it&#039;s all memorization...<br><br>Still, all video games require us to memorize sections we&#039;re having trouble with, and we&#039;re not supposed to be good at a video game as soon as we pick it up, it&#039;d be shallow otherwise, if you could just run and win, then no one would&#039;ve cared about Sonic, it&#039;s a franchise that rewards you for sticking around. One more thing that can help, is that Sonic&#039;s vulnerable when he&#039;s just running, but not when he&#039;s jumping... or rolling into a ball, always make sure to press down in slopes, not only do you gain speed, but you also protect yourself. Also, if you prefer something like Mario, then I can&#039;t recommend Sonic&#039;s 8bit library enough, they&#039;re a lot more Mario like than the original Genesis installments, Sonic 1 is excellent on both Game Gear and Master System, if you go for Sonic 2 then always pick the Master System version, otherwise it&#039;s too punishing, but if you go for Sonic Chaos then go for Game Gear, otherwise it&#039;s too simple.

Most FF fans are completely artistically illiterate and can&#039;t see any nuance. Sephiroth is shown to be cold and ruthless even when he was a &quot;hero.&quot; He was raised to be a killing machine, held up as a figurehead for Shinra&#039;s propaganda, showered with praise for slaughtering any perceived enemy, and we learn from Lucretia that he was never even held by his mother as a baby; he was whisked off by scientists to be a research specimen the moment he was born. You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see how fucked up someone would be from living a life like that. Even before the Nibelheim incident, he was, at best, a functional sociopath with a massive superiority complex, but most players completely miss all of that and take the claim that he&#039;s a hero at face value. <br><br>I&#039;d also argue that he doesn&#039;t actually give a shit about Jenova or the Ancients. Those are just post-hoc rationalizations he uses to justify his desires. When he reads in Gast&#039;s research notes that Jenova is an Ancient, he claims that entitles him to take the planet back from the humans who betrayed the Ancients. Later, when he travels through the Lifestream and learns the truth about Jenova (that she was actually just a monster that wiped out the Ancients), he twists it around and says that he&#039;s entitled to rule the planet because Jenova was even greater than the Ancients were. In other words, all he really wants is to satisfy his own ego by elevating himself up to godhood compared to the rest of the world, and he&#039;ll use whatever excuse he can come up with to justify it.", "time": 1674613383, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka is\u2026 Sephiroth</span><br>this nigga doesn\u2019t understand how numbers work", "time": 1674614692, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600392, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka\u2026 gets his plans foiled</span><br>You didn\u2019t even play the game.

There&#039;s at least a dozen Kojima-tier absurd plot twists that precede it, but basically the character being executed believes that its a mock execution, because the chief of police pardoned him but had to keep up appearances because he&#039;s known for being tough on crime.

In a delicious irony, Holst&#039;s propagation of this false &quot;fact&quot; has spurred it into becoming one of the most widely-circulated bits of misinformation to be found on the Internet.</span>", "time": 1674376708, "resto": 9588762}, {"no": 9592240, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)03:43:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592235</a><br>It&#039;s not a myth in Australia", "time": 1674377038, "resto": 9588762}, {"no": 9592329, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:34:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592240</a><br>The best way to catch a spider is to suck it inside your mouth.

There&#039;s a reason vast majority hates it.<br><a href=\"#p9595157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9595157</a><br>Pretty much this. I also have read similar stuff in the past. They put a lot of effort in creating them. Problem is all of them look worse than bilinear filter. What those shaders don&#039;t take into account is the issue of not being unified(say black areas looking sharper) and the characteristics of their filter(textures looking like they have melted).<br>Their disadvantage is much larger than their advantage.<br>At this point it&#039;s also becoming an obsolete technique given AI upscaling. I don&#039;t like AI upscaling for textures, but they do a much better job with texture compared to those filters like xBRZ and create less issues in the process.<br><a href=\"#p9596325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596325</a><br>Try an RGB CRT shader.

But it also does turn Sepiroth into as I said, almost like he&#039;s some godly DBZ villain. I think like someone said earlier maybe things would have made a lot more sense if he to was an ancient and was also the brother of Aeris. Then some of the ass pulls he does in regards to his magnificent prowess (kek sorry I just had to) would make more sense or be justified from a fan perspective. He&#039;s just anime badass supreme over here really. And due to the fandom at this point he seems to be the true star of the entirety of FFVII at this point with his coolness factor which detracts a bit imo from how great everything else about the game was. I don&#039;t like what they did with FFVII compilation stuff really. I get the feeling the remake trilogy or whatever may even make him become a misunderstood hero. He&#039;s too liked by fanboys.

To me, the hookshot is the definitive example of the problems 3D Zelda developed over time. In OoT, it functioned essentially the way you&#039;d expect it to, meaning, it could latch onto just about anything you&#039;d expect a high-velocity metal hook could (except for trees in the field for some reason). There were dedicated hookshot targets in the game that signaled you to use the hookshot on them, but it could also latch onto plenty of unsignaled objects that gave you freedom in how you moved through the game<br><br>In TP/SS, the clawshot can only latch onto dedicated targets (and climbable vines, but that only serves to speed up the climbing rather than to open up any new possibilities) and the games are far more restrictive all around. If you see a clawshot target, you know that you have to use the clawshot, and if you don&#039;t see the target, you know there&#039;s no point trying to use it. This mentality extends to nearly all the items in both TP and SS. The spinner, for example, would have been a homerun if it functioned just like a regular hoverboard that you could use anywhere, but instead, it only functions on dedicated tracks, and when you see those tracks, you know that the only thing you can do with them is to pull out the spinner. Rather than actually let you flex your problem solving skills, TP and SS just demand that you respond to specific signals, what people might call a &quot;simon says&quot; style of game design. You might not notice it on a first playthrough, but it becomes completely overbearing on replays where you realize you have next to no room to solve the puzzles outside of the one clearly signaled solution<br><br>An ideal Zelda game for me would combine BotW&#039;s physics that allow for universal applicability of the items with the more traditional world/dungeon design of the earlier games.

The Dreamcast is a great system, but the majority of its best games have been ported or re-released on other platforms, whereas the majority of the Saturn&#039;s best games are exclusive to the console.<br><br>Saturn consoles are still fairly cheap as well, you can get a jap import model with a controller, a memory cart, and sometimes a game or three for around $100 shipped. Spend another $50 on a PseudoSaturn cartridge and you&#039;ll be able to play burned games. Alternately you can get an ODE fairly cheaply (from around $140 to around $220, depending on the model).<br><br>The Dreamcast can play burned games natively since the copy protection was cracked over 20 years ago, but since the DC supported GD-ROMs (essentially CDs that could store 1GB of data compared to the 700MB you could get out of a CD-ROM) a significant portion of the games on the system have to have data trimmed to make them fit on a CD-R. This usually means stuff like video being heavily downsampled, audio being downsampled, or sometimes audio/video being removed completely. The ODE situation on the Dreamcast is kinda fucked as well (they exist, but availability can be a pain in the dick if you don&#039;t want to buy the more expensive model).<br><br>Either console will have a solid selection of arcade ports, RPGs, and action games. Neither console had a ton of lightgun games - the Saturn basically has a couple of solid Virtua Cop games, a mediocre port of House of the Dead, and the typical Maximum Force/Area 51 combo (plus a few not stellar others), meanwhile the Dreamcast has a great port of House of the Dead 2 and Confidential Mission (plus a couple more gun sections in other games).
