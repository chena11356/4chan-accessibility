Seeing him pilot mechs and vehicles and dangerous weapons is a fun juxtaposition to pink blob look of him, plus all the &quot;DEEP LORE&quot; horrors he fights.

Phoenix Wright is loved and it practically was a Working Designs style when it started out because of its attempts to go &quot;no this isn&#039;t Japan what are you talking about haha hey Maya sure loves to eat HAMBURGERS am I right&quot;. But overall anime and Japanese media has become big and ingrained enough that the Working Designs/4Kids/Saban levels of translating something is more met with derision than &quot;oh boy anime&quot;. Even when Nintendo tossed memes into localized scripts of their games, people are more likely to groan and wish they weren&#039;t there now.<br><br>I think part of it too is that Working Designs translated Magic Knights Rayearth, which has the honor of being the last western Sega Saturn game. If it were anything else, sure, but Rayearth was an established franchise and WD putting on their trademark brand of humor soured a lot to them: even back when the game was new, people felt it was an awkward and out of place translation for the game because the anime was available and already had fans. So you have a game that hits a lot of &quot;oh should I check this out&quot; flags (last console release in the west, based on a beloved series, etc) and get hit with &quot;eh, they made it worse&quot; is sort of an &quot;the Emperor isn&#039;t wearing any clothes&quot; moment for them.<br><br>Also they put an ammo system into Silhouette Mirage and that personally rankled me because it meant you never wanted to experiment with different weapons due to the cost to use them, then they added grinding for money on top of it.

Basically the analog stick started dropping inputs, so for example if you were running forward as Link in OoT he would stop and start - essentially unusable. Both had the exact same problem. <br>Unfortunately they both had fallen just outside the warranty window, and their support didn&#039;t even reply when I sent them like a &quot;Hey, anything I can try to do to fix these?&quot; <br>About a year later someone on twitter was asking about them, and I outlined that whole chain of events to them and said that I don&#039;t recommend them at all. From that tweet, their PR/customer support team reached out to me and ultimately actually shipped me two of the newer wireless versions by way of apology. And the wireless one has held up a lot better than the originals. At least, so far. <br>So maybe the takeaway is, they used to be utter crap, and now are (hopefully) a lot better. The analog stick on all of these these is just kind of weird though. <br><br>In the interim I used the wired Retro-Bit Tribute64 (which is modeled after the famous Hori N64 controller) and I actually liked this a lot better than any of the Brawler64s. The only problem with these is that the connector has an absolute death grip on the controller port, which is why I switched back to the wireless Brawler64 for right now - since I didn&#039;t want to be unplugging and replugging that controller all the time, and wireless controllers just keep things a bit more tidy. You know how it is. <br><br>There is an N64 controller purist on this board who will tell you that the analog stick sensitivity and deadzones of any of these 3rd party controllers is crap compared to the original - he&#039;s got charts and whatnot to back it up. He&#039;s probably right, but it&#039;s never really bothered me and or caused any real problems.<br><br>Of these I&#039;d recommend the Tribute64 first.", "time": 1670950508, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488501, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:34:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>i would FUCK lenore<br><a href=\"#p9487536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487536</a><br>yes", "time": 1670952875, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488537, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>What the fuck is that worm-like thing on top of the TV?", "time": 1670954061, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488540, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_2933", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3120, "h": 2080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1670954081568968, "time": 1670954081, "md5": "MQ5LotAcZ3SlN+b/piGZ6Q==", "fsize": 965843, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488542, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488456</a><br>Thats a bit annoying i hate wireless stuff but if those are better maybe they made changes in the wired also?

Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist.

It&#039;s a weird game in the series, it acts as a continuation of SH1&#039;s plot while telling a more personal narrative about Heather like SH2, making it feel &quot;redundant&quot; in ways. SH3 both tries to tell a deeper narrative happening around the protagonist and those around her but also have her experience her own personal journey, it&#039;s a very ambitious narrative that, overall, I would say works out well but doesn&#039;t feel quite as cohesive as the prior two entries. Generally I think people see SH3 as having &quot;less meaning&quot; in what the game, and this is true in a few regards but still pretty inaccurate to the overall. Honestly I think the symbolism and themes go over people&#039;s heads because they&#039;re so heavily based in the feminine experience. If you&#039;re a guy I feel like it&#039;s likely you just kind of don&#039;t think about things like the game&#039;s various menstrual imagery, though some things like the hole leading to the final boss are hard to miss.<br><br>I always have a hard time deciding between SH1 and SH3 as my personal favorite. SH3 has a lot going for it with the most refined gameplay and graphics of the series, but it&#039;s also the most obviously compromised of the first three games. The game has essentially no exploration outside of the dungeons and a handful of &quot;grab thing, walk a room over, use thing&quot; moments. It&#039;s a great game on its own merits, but how it compares to prior entries and their strengths gives a lot of differing thoughts. I would say that, as simply a &quot;video game&quot;, that SH3 is the best, as to be expected being the newest, but it&#039;s clear pure gameplay is not why people love horror games.", "filename": "Ffn6nbWVQAAigcN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670955746219477, "time": 1670955746, "md5": "PMYuoi9u29tzPP5ZgPM7Cg==", "fsize": 63545, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488604, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Allow me to put this retarded discussion to rest.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 wikipedia is wrong </span><br>Okay school teacher.", "filename": "1649719663676", "ext": ".png", "w": 552, "h": 32, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 7, "tim": 1670955848062248, "time": 1670955848, "md5": "SWb5cKYBsciKWJJ4uj/yWQ==", "fsize": 5896, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488609, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488604</a><br>I know you must be genuinely retarded but yes, that is why wikipedia is generally agreed to be a fucking non source for anything unless wikipedia directly links to the actual source, literally fucking anyone can write in it and unless someone decides that what was written was wrong (and the cucks in charge agree with the changes) then that is the information present <br><br>fuck off literal NPC", "time": 1670956080, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488610, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *actual*, real thing that separates a &quot;survival horror&quot; game from something else is the true permanence of consequence</span><br>That has literally nothing to do with survival horror.

For example, Star Fox on real hardware: <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaW<wbr>PTnHUEAY<br>(note how the intro cut sscene ends at the right music cue) <br><br>30fps overclock: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ6<wbr>pWTe-Sd8<br><br>Polygon cutscene ends way before the music ends. The devs designed Star Fox around its awful framerate. In order to make Star Fox look right at 60fps, the game would have to be modified to match the timing of the new framerate.

It is a first-person shooter for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,[1] developed by 3D Realms, Triptych Games, Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. It is the sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, as part of the long-running Duke Nukem video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, it became an infamous example of vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule; it had been in development under 3D Realms since 1996. Director George Broussard, one of the creators of the original Duke Nukem game, announced the development in 1997, and promotional information for the game was released from 1997 until its release in 2011.</span>", "time": 1670876297, "resto": 9484987}, {"no": 9486389, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)15:25:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9486357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9486357</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t play for more than 1 hour</span><br>What?

Some people would go home just to bathe, sleep a few hours, come back into the office to work, and then play Diablo at the office. It was mostly in the name of research, though. There are a number of games that we used as inspiration. Diablo was obviously one of them. I had heard that Dragon Quest was inspired by remaking Ultima with a Japanese audience in mind. So our concept was, \u201cLet\u2019s make a Diablo game that would appeal to the Japanese audience.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: With good results. Even though Diablo is a distinctly American game, PSO feels like a very distinctly Japanese game. And yet, it\u2019s not just palatable to Japanese gamers but to everyone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think Diablo is an amazing game, but it\u2019s not a game that appeals to Japanese players. Our suspicion was that Japanese gamers would prefer to cooperate and work together to defeat something more than to compete and fight against other players. That\u2019s why we created PSO to be a cooperative role-playing game. Diablo has cooperative elements but it also has PK and an element of killing other player characters. We eliminated those elements and focused on how we could make a fun, cooperative RPG experience.

A 3D platformer is fucking Glover or Mario 64. Banjo DOES have mini-platforming IN it, sparsely, as a vehicle for getting across the map. That doesn&#039;t make it a platformer any more than Zelda is a &quot;3D platformer&quot; just for having vague platform shit in it at times. Platforming is NOT a major focus in Banjo, and you can tell this because one of the few sections of the game that IS like a 3D platformer, the Engine Room, sticks out like a huge sore thumb against everything else in the game. The kind of platforming you use to traverse from A to B is not a major focus of the game.<br><br>Now it still is totally a fair critique to say that Banjo doesn&#039;t control anywhere near as nimble and complex as Mario can, which sucks and is lame. I wish his movement options were better, the game would be way more fun. But they also design Banjo-Kazooie AROUND the fact that the bear is stiff and doesn&#039;t do much. The focus is NOT platforming, it&#039;s not even trying to be. Banjo is an adventure-exploration collectathon, with minor elements of 3D platforming and puzzle-solving. It is extremely rare for tough platforming to be a focus because asking this clunky-ass bear to do acrobatic feats is not generally feasible. He is NOT Mario. Banjo is a slower <br>more methodical game based on exploration and bite-sized task completion.<br><br>I don&#039;t know why you would even bring up the fact that Gobi&#039;s Valley&#039;s pyramids lack much in the way of platforming.

MiSTer is a project that is taking advantage of a cheap FPGA that people can buy, called the DE-10 Nano. The DE-10 Nano is cheap because it is made for college students, and is subsidized by Intel. The DE-10 Nano has an FGPA on board, as well as an ARM chip. It has various connectors on the board for expandability. MiSTer has a bunch of FPGA cores (much like the cores you would see on one of the Analog systems) for consoles, handhelds, arcade boards and computers. Developers are constantly adding more cores and improving on existing cores. A hobbiest community has popped up around this project, which has led to a lot of hardware addons that can be installed onto the DE-10 Nano, such as extra RAM, a digital or analog I/O board, USB hub (these things make up the most common MiSTer setup that you have likely seen, which is a sandwich of three boards with the DE-10 Nano in the middle)... etc. There are people who have made specialized expansion boards like the MiSTercade, which allows it to be used in a typical JAMMA arcade cabinet. At a base level, you really just need the DE-10 Nano, and preferably a RAM stick, the rest is optional.<br><br>MiSTer can be appealing to enthusiasts because it offers better accuracy/latency compared to software emulation. It&#039;s also very easy to set up and use in a variety of scenarios, without having to invest in a bunch of extra shit like flash carts, upscalers, custom cables... etc. It is an all-in-one solution for many of the systems that a retro gamer would be interested in. By its nature, it is also very customizable. <br><br>I still think that software emulation is a good option, especially on a budget since you can probably do it on hardware that you already own, however I do like my MiSTer quite a bit and I find that I am playing more /vr/ games than ever since getting it.", "filename": "mister-sandwich", "ext": ".png", "w": 611, "h": 856, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670246300392107, "time": 1670246300, "md5": "fcC4uIUOYU6IZ0kAMoy3Dw==", "fsize": 945737, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468185, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)11:56:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467832</a><br>I was just fishing for (you)s and shitposts but this high effort response doesn&#039;t deserve it", "time": 1670259366, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468240, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)12:25:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467669</a><br>Cope comes for free with being a poorfag as well kiddo", "time": 1670261105, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468353, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)13:15:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9465495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9465495</a><br>Yes.

And the redesign is for flexibility in mind, which will win out over efficiency, speed and size because of cost which will be the main driver of chipmaking in the future.

This is because the internet has made it easier than ever to find and like something new, but because the systems by which you find them are so splintered, it feels like nothing is solid, because we are used to old ways of thinking about fame and notoriety. When we were growing up, shit wasn&#039;t important unless it was on TV, in movies, on albums, or in magazines. Now there is no reason to appear in any of those, because you can do far more with the digital age and reach way more people than in the slowly dying traditional platforms. There are so many net cultures, however, that it&#039;s very hard to point at one and say &quot;that&#039;s it, that&#039;s the biggest thing right now&quot;. Its like that kardashian slut on SNL a few months ago. She rightly called being on TV a &quot;small, intimate setting&quot; because TV is the modern newspaper; Nobody important is on TV anymore, they&#039;re on shit like instagram and tiktok. Yet her game came from being on TV and in tabloids and such, which is why it seems like everyone knows about her. The problem is that even if TV is increasingly irrelevant, and culture is explosing online, a generation like ours either generally avoids social media, or just because of the weird ways you have to find your space in those worlds, we simply miss them. Tons of people use different social media platforms, and yet they mean completely different things to those people, because it is easy for someone or something to be famous yet unknown due to their being in a small subset of that service or platform.", "time": 1670620778, "resto": 9476223}, {"no": 9479060, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)16:20:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9479057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9479057</a><br>As such I argue that rather than no culture, there&#039;s actually too much subculture, buried away on different platforms and in different corners, and because it&#039;s all famous to somebody, but lacks penetration on the old world media empires (TV, film, records, print) it remains &quot;unknown&quot; to anyone outside of the right circles.

They don&#039;t know who of the young world is actually going to fit their &quot;wide movie audience&quot; or whatever, and so they just go back to old shit that benefited from the age when people got all their fame through old world media bombardment. As for the lack of &quot;scenes&quot; or the accusation of only using trappings of old scenes as costumes, my understanding is that young people are generally much less interested in the tribalism of being specific to one scene or identity, in part because people are so easily exposed anymore to new things. It&#039;s not like you have to subscribe to a certain magazine or go to specific stores in order to find out about stuff. With everything being online, and costing only time to find out about, why close yourself off to new things you might like, simply for sake of definition? It&#039;s almost more a modern rejection of the idea that corporate products can define your personality or sensibilities, and a willingness to stay open to new ideas or experiences, though I don&#039;t think shallow means of self-identity have disappeared in teens, they gave just changed foci and forms of expression.

By doing this, Internet indirectly destroyed the best media that we had and replaced it with a void of people with a lot of voice but no ideas.<br>To elaborate, let me make a simple model.<br>There&#039;s &quot;lower class&quot; of media. These are standalone artists, lone enthusiasts, small groups of people with little to no funding. Today, these are sole youtubers / tiktokers / soundcloud rappers / etc. In old vidya, these were the people who made old computer games with basic graphics, Flash games, etc.; today, these are indie / phone game devs. Pros of this class can be freedom of experimentation, enthusiasm, and full creative control; the cons can be lack of budget to implement ideas, often lackluster / flawed quality, incredible proneness to shovelware, and last but not least, lack of educated professionals who actually went to school to study art and aren&#039;t just some random meme fucks.<br>Then there&#039;s the &quot;upper class&quot;. This is your EA, Activision, Nintendo, you get the drill. These are your big movie studios, your music labels, your TV companies, etc. Pros: big budgets to make things more impressive, implement ideas, hire professional artists / game designers / directors / etc., and ensure at least decent quality. Cons: the cons are often lack of freedom and creative control, resulting in &quot;soulless&quot; feel and rehashing same ideas. So\u2014it&#039;s like a polar opposite of the &quot;lower class&quot;.<br>But then there&#039;s the &quot;middle class&quot;\u2014The golden middle where you could argue you get the best of both worlds and where some of the best pieces of media were conceived. This is where you have money, enough to make quality things and implement ideas, but not too much so that you can take artistic risk.", "time": 1670648738, "resto": 9476223}, {"no": 9480070, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)00:26:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9479057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9479057</a><br><a href=\"#p9479060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9479060</a><br><a href=\"#p9479063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9479063</a><br><a href=\"#p9480028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480028</a><br>(2/3)<br>Of course, &quot;middle class&quot; is very relative, but it&#039;s that vague middle ground between EA and sole devs, Taylor Swift and soundcloud rappers, Avengers and some youtube video, etc.<br>You could argue that in vidya, these perfect conditions were achieved during late &#039;80s\u2013early &#039;90s. When the hardware naturally limited budgets and what could be achieved, most companies weren&#039;t too big, smaller companies like Id could give full creative control to a bunch of dudes to make Doom or Quake\u2014just think how many great games still talked about today came out on PC at around 2000. In music, this was the time when rock bands could have time and budget to devote themselves to music fully, and when musicians actually could play instruments. In movies, this was the time before blockbusters completely took over.<br>So, where am I going with all of this? In modern day, &quot;middle class&quot; of media has eroded. You either have lower class that gets always smaller, and upper class that gets ever bigger, to the point when it&#039;s &quot;too big to fail&quot;. Today, by and large, you either get EA OR phone / indie devs, Taylor Swift OR soundcloud rappers, Avengers OR some youtube video, etc. It either has budget under $100k, or budget over $100 mln. But ironically\u2014both sides are actually stretched thin and can have low profits.<br>How that happened? First off, the Internet. Downloading destroyed the music record industry. From year 2000 to 2010, it has shrunk 4 times for the first time in recent history after decades of growth. Like you said already, it has made a lot of other media irrelevant too. It has destroyed print media, it made TV networks less relevant each year. <br>Second, most relevant to vidya\u2014advancement of computers. Better graphics every year meant bigger budgets every year. Games went from costing under 1 mln to develop to $100+ mln.

The rise of AAA / blockbuster meant that they couldn&#039;t compete with the big guys. They had 2 choices: either get higher budgets, or downshift (in case of vidya\u2014to mobile / indie / handhelds / etc.; in case of movies\u2014to TV). Mid size vidya companies have long closed, or been sold to EA and such.<br>Computers also gave every fuck a way to make music, record videos, etc. As result, &quot;lower class&quot; of music has become oversaturated with soundcloud rappers and the like. With dropping profits of the record industry, &quot;traditional&quot; artists and rock couldn&#039;t compete. Again\u2014erasure of the &quot;middle class&quot;. <br>Same with vidya. What you got was millions of literally whos making cookie clicker shovelware for phones that suddenly has made even the big companies fear for their profits. The phones have already killed handhelds. Even Ninty had to take note. Meanwhile, the phone market is, again, oversaturated with garbage. The competition is insane, the profits are lowering.<br>Now what&#039;s worse\u2014those from the &quot;lower class&quot; who got rich are actually buying or replacing the upper class and &quot;traditional&quot; media. Chinese mobile companies are buying off big Western devs. You have a fucking Cartoon Cat TV shows for kids now. Soundcloud rappers get their trademark meals in McDs.<br>And looking at &quot;upper class&quot;, you can see where the $100+ mln budgets are taking us.

This is an era often identified by cartoon historians as the period from early 1960s until early 1980s or so. The idea is that the big picture companies stopped making shorts, so then the animators had nowhere to go. Cartoons were dead in the water except for Disney, so unless you worked for Disney you had to go to whomever picked up the slack, which was TV. However, the budgets for TV were tiny compared to the budget for shorts, and so the resulting product was hampered. What`s more, TV networks wanted very generic and repetitive material and were very risk-averse. If a winner was found, they wanted the same winner, over and over again. These two factors are why Hannah-Barbara made so many identical, low-budget shows in this time period; It was all that the networks would buy. This is why you had so many clone shows of Scooby-Doo after that was a big hit, to say nothing of spinoff series. The era ended once toy companies came in and injected money to make toy sales happen, which led to animators getting encouraged financially to stop making shit (though unfortunately much of it was outsourced to low-grade sweatshop animators, at least they started trying again). <br><br>I have long suspected that we are in a repeat of that era, especially given how sad the output of the cartoon cable channels have been in the new millennium. The market is moving/has moved again, whether to free platforms like youtube or to online paid services. But for the former, there`s no money again, and so we are in a repeat of that dark era. You need money to get good shit, that`s the truth. <br><br>What you pointed out about media bombs is not new, however. There have been overbudget flops in hollywood for decades. Just off the top of my head is Waterworld, and it`s hardly the only example.

Art imitates life, they say, and when every person can access every and any thing, and when there is absolutely no gatekeeping of information or of ideas by any measure, then it basically becomes possible for anyone to live in any world that they want to live in, no matter what it is. A remember a sociologist predicting in the 80s that innovations like e-mail and automatic remote garage openers would lead to people becoming more and more isolated from each other, to the point that they wouldn`t even know their own neighbors. I would argue that his worst fears are even more true than he could have realized at the time. <br><br>I think the irony is that we tech nerds that were largely the test model for this kind of human.

I think internet devices may need to be included into this category as well; When you reduce a person to a line of text on a screen, you dehumanize them to the point that hating their every existence becomes normal thought process, which I suspect is very unhealthy. This highway is a great way to share information and to communicate, but I think we have seen too much that it tears something important away from our humanity and reduces us to some cruel animal.

The entire premise of protecting other peoples feelings by watching what we say or do might seem incredibly stupid and restrictive to the generations after Gen Y &amp; Z, we saw this exact paradigm shift in society with Gen X, after they spent their teens in the 80s and early 90s living through basically what we&#039;re currently dealing with today (i.e. corporate and politically charged censorship), they rebelled by making everything darker, edgier, more violent, incorporating cynical and ironic humor into most facets of entertainment, having a &quot;tell it like it is&quot; attitude towards life, and so on. Gen Alpha could be the generation that finally turns things around, but somehow I doubt it, maybe the shift will take longer, maybe by the time we&#039;re all old and decrepit. Another thing most people overlook is the fact that the 80s were all about 50s/60s nostalgia, which is why the people of the 80s seem just as superficial and plastic as the people of the 50s, Gen X mocked it and rightfully so. <br><br>The problem with Gen Z on the other hand is that they have no idea what the hell they&#039;re doing from a sociocultural standpoint. They want to be sexually restrictive &amp; socially plastic like the Greatest Generation, while at the same time being sexually promiscuous and drug addled like the baby boomers, while, again, at the same time wanting to be hip, cool, and care free like the boomers of the 80s, but at the same time they also want to be edgy, ironic, cynical, &amp; anti-authoritarian like Gen X, but, once again, and this is the last one, they also want to be goofy and quirky like millennials.

I don&#039;t think this because of my own experiences, but because of that from older people who I have read from or talked to about it. They were pretty upfront about how people in the 90s web were every bit as nasty to people as they are now, and that social media didn&#039;t surprise them one bit. <br><br>I will say though, that to me, the social media world did turn things a different way, and I think it is for two reasons. The first is as in that consolidation pic; Everybody is in the same place. It&#039;s like when /v/irgins complained about the death of custom servers and the rise of P2P; You used to be able to choose your own experience in a given online game, and with P2P all the casual players, tryhards, dumb stoners, people with contrasting opinions, etc. were forced into one player pool and robbed of their choice to not be a part of it. I think social media has largely done the same thing. Anything you put on Twitter, for example, can be found and exploited at any time by any number of thousands of people in some tiny internet cabal that no one&#039;s ever heard of, and make your life hell over it. Pretty hard to do that if everyone is on different websites.<br><br>The second reason is that point above, which is that the stakes are higher. When I started using 4chan, the internet was SERIOUS BIZNESS, because we laughed at anyone taking shit seriously on the internet. There are still trappings of that mentality in places like /s4s/, but by and large the rule has changed. People across the net now take it very seriously and even stake their work and livelihood on it.

I remember reading a soft skills book that said the absolute worst thing you can do is try to send an important message, especially an emotional one, through text in any form. This focused in some respect on work email, but covered text arguments or anything else. The reason is that voices are evanescent and they disappear with time, fading from existence. Words, however (as well as video and audio recordings), can be copied and viewed infinitely, over and over again, and most importantly, reading words that make you angry feels like you are reading them for the first time freshly stated out of the person&#039;s mouth, no matter how old the words actually are. This, I have seen, is how shitstorms brew. When your words are not thin as air, floating away, but instead are heavy waves, pounding and pounding on mental shores with the dedicated repetition of the ocean tide, it doesn&#039;t give people time to heal from whatever anger they may have gotten out of it. Moreover, it doesn&#039;t give time for change. I remember once reading about the ancient Greeks and their opposition to the invention of writing.

I have had a number of experiences even in the last few years where people were really considerate and helpful to each other. If anything, I would argue that the caustic nature of social media and internet overuse comes out as illegitimate fears that people have of each other; This, I think, relates back to my previous statement about the dehumanization that occurs when we turn a human being into words on a screen. When all you see is text that makes you angry, it is easy to be nasty in response, because as far as you figure, it&#039;s not a real person at all. Doing all of your comm through the internet just gives you a heavily distorted perspective, and particularly if you are in the US and have gone through the last few years there, then it would be hard to say that you hadn&#039;t had an unpleasant experience online, not to mention checking in on news or seeing any number of wild things that have occurred. I would maintain, though, that in general, people are still pretty nice and want other people to be nice to them.

Basically, the controls work like dpad controls and the analog stick is mapped to the eight directions of a d-pad. This is not too unusual for games originating on PS1 back then, but what is unusual, and also insane, is the fact that the mapping seems to work like this: pick a very small epsilon and then determine for each of the four base directions, if they are pressed like this: if stickdirectionX &gt; epsilon then right = true; if stickdirectionY &gt; epsilon then forward = true (and similar for the opposite directions). As a consequence, if you only slightly deviate from the four base directions, you end up with a diagonal direction.

I&#039;m too lazy to type something new, though...so copy paste it is. Again. Playing Toy Story 2 on the Dreamcast. I&#039;m wishing I had bought Space Channel 5 instead... Right from the bat, something is wrong. When using the control stick, Buzz refused to walk in a straight line. At first, I thought something was wrong with my controller, but some replies and research says that no, this is not an isolated incident. It&#039;s a problem with the game itself. Fortunately, the D-Pad is more precise, but it&#039;s uncomfortable. You can adapt to it, though, which I did. However, in the Alley level, I&#039;m bumping into glitches. First, Buzz refused to move at all. I paused the game, not a problem with the controller, so I quit the level as started again. Then, the music started glitching up, and the game froze up. Is this a problem with the Dreamcast? Or can this one be pinned on the game? I&#039;m hearing the PS1 release has no such issues. It&#039;s the only Dreamcast game I have, so I&#039;m trying to make the best of it, but yeesh...I hope my Dreamcast isn&#039;t broken. There&#039;s some game I want to play, especially Puyo Puyo~n.

Claims they went into a random beer hall for food and drink, and not long after they arrived, happened to be there for a surreal display, in which an old guy (called &quot;grandpa&quot; by the staff) came in, they revealed a bunch of previously covered images of Nazi symbols and a large portrait of Hitler, and played the Nazi period version of the national anthem while everybody stood at attention, with some singing along (the old guy saluting the portrait). <br><br>Coworker says he was really lucky that despite being American military, he 1) had German ethnicity and looked the part (and the others more or less passed for &quot;European&quot;), 2) he knew German well enough to pass as someone who might be from around the area, and 3) none of his non-german speaking compatriots had said anything to anyone and so had plausible deniability. Said they had been eating and drinking normally before that point, but upon seeing all that (and apparently spotting a number of knives and brass knuckles and other weapons at different tables) decided they should GTFO. Compatriots thanked him for picking a lunch place that all but could have gotten them killed.<br><br>Thinking about it again, my only conclusion is that it must have been a small pocket of extremist germans hiding out in this small town.

Do you have any tip for a first-timer?</span><br>Nothing really specific to this games campaign as I haven&#039;t really bothered with finding many secrets or anything, but some basic tips on raising monsters, you may already know all this but....<br><br>Always make sure you relieve monsters &quot;stress&quot; and &quot;fatigue&quot;, always let it rest obviously but also use items like oil or mintcandy to remove fatigue after training and battles. Battling itself actually helps remove monsters stress. As you accumulate larger amounts of cash, it&#039;s definitely good to prioritize buying all the more expensive stress relieving, fatigue relieving, and sleep helping items you&#039;ll see in the shop like the cups and gems, as can afford them of course, don&#039;t skip out on them, they&#039;ll make it easier for new monsters. Also don&#039;t let your monster get fat or malnourished, fat monsters get fatigued more and underweight monsters get stressed more.<br><br>Also take it easy on baby monsters, just do the most basic training until its more mature aka when Holly tells gives you that cue that it&#039;s an &quot;important time&quot; or whatever she says, that&#039;s when you start the coach routines<br><br>Always focus on like 3, maybe 4 main stats to train your monster in. Having a balanced monster doesn&#039;t really work because there&#039;s only so much time you can put into training during its lifespan, you want your monster to excel hard in specific areas, not be average in many areas, so take that into consideration when deciding what monster you wanna raise and how you want it to grow/what moves you want it to learn<br><br>When you&#039;re stronger and start doing sparring with the intention of learning new moves specifically, it&#039;s not really worth it unless you&#039;re gonna learn a new move, so don&#039;t bother wasting the money and time unless it says there&#039;s a chance your monster will learn a new move, and honestly I say theres no shame in saving before and restarting until you learn the move", "time": 1670371774, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9471981, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Jell<br>but the one I used to win with was Hare", "time": 1670372119, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472112, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:14:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471460</a><br><a href=\"#p9471549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471549</a><br>What are you doing, dude?", "filename": "1308028510381", "ext": ".png", "w": 496, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1670375679755307, "time": 1670375679, "md5": "vQBz/xGhIxFw/6o0Q324aA==", "fsize": 134450, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472651, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)00:50:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Kato, named him Risk and built him pure agi and int?/tech?(the one that increases the damage of the green skills) and spammed the twister/tornado claw.

They would let people try the game out if you asked. I would rent the game, but never owned it. I owned SMB1, SMB3, and SMW, but never SMB2. Super Mario Bros. 2 did stand out as being a little different from the other games in the series. As a kid, I thought SMB3 was a step backwards from SMB2 in many ways. Ni selectable characters, no being able to pick up anything and throw it. Though the game did add the ability to pick up some objects. But at the same time, I never really suspected that it was a different game. because Zelda II on the NES was different from the first Zelda as well.

Doki Doki Panic did look better overall, and wasn&#039;t geared towards a hard mode. Localising it was the best thing to do. It was a game made by EAD.
