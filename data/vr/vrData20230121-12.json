With a button I can just make a grenade throw and it automatically returns me to my weapon afterwards, that&#039;s smooth and I don&#039;t need to come to a halt, you can make the gameplay faster for it, and in return increase the challenge for the player to match their abilities.<br><br>In Half-Life, I find myself not using hand grenades all that often because that requires that I stop shooting what I&#039;m using now and switching to another weapon, manually throwing it, and then switching back.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it.

Yes, its true that NOA and NOE during the NES years often had a bias against overt themes regarding themes and symbols of many IRL faiths and/or religions as per their pre-ESRB political correctness game censorship guidelines, which also forbade references to alcohol, illicit drug use, and, most on-screen bloodshed. However, as much as there are references to Christianity here and there, especially in the early years of the franchise, that the Cross is not an exclusively Christian symbol, just as the Six-pointed star is not exclusive to Judaism. True, the special book in the early Zelda games is literally called a &quot;Bible&quot;, and cross imagery in a number of areas, the bulk of them in the early titles. But what makes you so damn sure that the word &quot;Shimpu&quot; is specifically meant to mean a Christian Priest? How fluent in Japanese are you, really? The language is often vague, its written form (aside from Kanji, which acts somewhat more like Chinese does) is a syllabary, is more reader dependent in its structure than any of the languages of Europe, and those of the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. I also add that even in the pre-Majora&#039;s mask era of LOZ, there are also other lore and folkloric beings from different parts of the world present. Fairies (Celtic and Germanic Lore) can be found in every game in the series. The Master Sword in Link to the past/Triforce of the Gods is very much reminiscent of Celtic Arthurian legend and lore. The swimming fish that raise their heads out of the water to make ranged magic ball attacks found in LOZ1 and ALTTP/Triforce of the Gods are more Japanese Kappa-inspired. Not sure about the Peahat enemies, though.", "time": 1674015044, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581035, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:20:37", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "GamefanVolume4Issue01January1996ALT_0022", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1214, "h": 1621, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674015637828338, "time": 1674015637, "md5": "5GydHhHBdt80ri52s/Na4Q==", "fsize": 377476, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581039, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:22:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9577784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9577784</a><br>lmao", "time": 1674015724, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581172, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9580456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9580456</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;monkey named Spanky</span>", "filename": "1674019964737", "ext": ".png", "w": 353, "h": 334, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1674019974248669, "time": 1674019974, "md5": "VHDGz0no1Lrb5UOlrXRdbA==", "fsize": 144174, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581194, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why cant videogames just be for cool tough guys anymore?", "time": 1674020686, "resto": 9577587}, {"no": 9581207, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:51:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9581194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9581194</a><br>Seriously.

It&#039;s a primitive depiction, and I&#039;m not gonna say that King&#039;s Field is a real classic, because it&#039;s not, reviews were very mixed at the time, lots of people thought it was no good, but this was a first person 3D game with an open world, on console, in 1994, so it stood out, especially being one of the Playstation&#039;s launch titles, meaning it got to be one of the few choices available at first.<br>That last part damns it with faint praise, but there&#039;s enough which is compelling about it that there were people interested in sequels which turned out to indeed be better.

There are a few other dependencies in babel_static_functions.txt, but other than that you pretty much just inherit from SyncEnabledMonster or ChainEnabledMonster and use the appropriate hold state calls to make sure your monsters don&#039;t get their actions clobbered by signals at the wrong times.

A lot of the stuff in Babel is fairly highly coupled, specifically for fear, but there&#039;s also things I never did like making weapons attract monster attacks and other fuckery with targeting. Once you get a grip on the basics of exactly what I did to get sync/chain to work you&#039;ll see it&#039;s fairly straightforward, honestly not complex at all. If you want to get more complex and make a mod that isn&#039;t trying to be vanilla+, but maybe a little more out there, there&#039;s a TON of things that you can do just by throwing triggers around and manipulating states. The Cacodemon, for example, uses the same kinds of signals for its dodges.

You can use some other rasterization method (scanline fill or ray casting, for example). Collision detection and visibility work with planes. Read something on how compiler tools process the map data from the editor, and why. If I recall correctly, Quake-related engines combine all static brushes into one complex enclosed space (the \u201cinside\u201d of the map where everything exists), then subdivide it with each face plane to produce many subvolumes touching each other. You can also check GoldSrc and Source documents from Valve, their principles are similar.<br><br>When you have planes, you know you have planes by definition. When you have polygons, you need additional calculations to get normals from positions of vertices (which accelerators can implement in hardware, but you can&#039;t), and, sometimes, to recover the fact that polygons belong to the same plane.", "time": 1674188541, "resto": 9580932}, {"no": 9586641, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:46:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are there any source ports for Unreal Gold?", "time": 1674190010, "resto": 9580932}, {"no": 9586648, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9586641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9586641</a><br>No, the source code for all versions of UE are proprietary.

But Nextech who was in charge of porting the Saturn game, had issues with RE2 to the Saturn, which caused its&#039; cancellation.I think Sega may have suggested making the game for the Dreamcast, instead. Nexttech made the Code Veronica game engine, which was essentially the RE2 game engine running with 3D environments. I almost thing Code Veronica was going to be a 3D remake of RE2, before Capcom decided to make it a new game. Code veronica was originally planned to have both Leon and Claire, with Leon being replaced by Steve Burnside. When Code Veronica was first shown off to the public, the game was treated like a technical showcase for the Dreamcast, and it was the first &#039;next generation&#039; Resident Evil game. The game did get released months before the PS2. The real-time cinematics and cinematic game models were really impressive for their time. The game was one of the best looking games on the DC outside of Shenmue I and II. But when it was ported to the PS2 and Gamecube (clearly much more powerful hardware) , the game lost some of its luster, when put up against other games on those consoles. Resident Evil 2 and 3 did get Dreamcast ports, but these ports are basically the PC games running on WindowsCE.", "time": 1674110040, "resto": 9578771}, {"no": 9584414, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:36:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9583887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9583887</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IM SOWWWYYYY</span><br><br>Steve&#039;s original hairstyle was superior.", "filename": "steve_s_differences_by_crazyiam234166_d2ottty-fullview", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 515, "h": 340, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674110204089143, "time": 1674110204, "md5": "bhoxWbwLq8sSApxsG/WLlQ==", "fsize": 25287, "resto": 9578771}, {"no": 9584446, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:57:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9580408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9580408</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CV makes trannies seeth so I love it</span><br><br>Basically, it comes down to one line of dialogue spoken by Claire. the game was being developed in 1998-2000, and Alfred was basically a homage to the movie Psycho, or more specifically... the shot for shot 1998 remake of Psycho starring Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Q<wbr>kvHCfg7w&amp;t=7s<br><br>Code veronica borrows heavily from the 1998 Psycho remake, the X-Files movie (1998), The Matrix/ John Woo, there is a bit of a Juon references.", "time": 1674111440, "resto": 9578771}, {"no": 9584723, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)05:55:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9582549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9582549</a><br>Well I played it last night and saved last just before Rebecca has to go to some torture room to restore power and the monkey enemies appear.<br>It&#039;s pretty standard survival with a somewhat interesting gimmick with the character swapping so far, and even the research center has great atmosphere but desu I&#039;m a bit biased as I think the REmake type backgrounds are just a joy to look at. <br>Not many healing items, though, and that&#039;s probably where the difficulty stems from.

Banjo has literally completely different design philosophy to Mario. It&#039;s an ADVENTURE game primarily, not a platformer primarily like Mario is. It is, admittedly, disappointing that the bear sucks ass to control, but this is also compensated for in the gameplay by Banjo being far, far less of a platformer.

Click Clock Wood is structured entirely around its shittastic platforming, asking you to climb up that damn tree over and over again, and it&#039;s not fun. It feels atrocious. Make no mistake: there ARE plenty of platforming challenges in the game. Fans may not consider it a &quot;platformer&quot;, and there may be more puzzles/minigames than there is actual platforming, but you still DO platform a lot in the game, and it never feels right. Especially when they constantly ask you to do that backflip to get to high areas, which is probably the stiffest jump move I&#039;ve seen outside of Bubsy 3D.<br><br>Also, any instance where the game asks you to fly (which you, again, do a LOT of) also isn&#039;t fun. It&#039;s way too slow, damn near impossible to dodge projectiles, and killing those snowmen is ridiculously precise.

Huge flaw imo<br><br>Idk what to say it&#039;s not like your views of the game wasting your time are wrong persay, but I also think it&#039;s telling that you choose to view exploration as &quot;wasting time&quot;. Sure it can be a bit too much sometimes, but figuring stuff like this out and having a bit of an adventure are sort of the point. It&#039;s not SUPPOSED to be as convenient as humanly possible. You aren&#039;t MEANT to be handheld after Mumbo&#039;s Mountain, you&#039;re meant to figure shit out. The hub isn&#039;t JUST a place to access other levels in. Wandering around its many labyrinthine corridors is intended to be part of the fun.<br><br>I think your mental framing is off, you view it as time-wasting because you didn&#039;t play this game FOR the exploration aspects. So it&#039;s fair you don&#039;t like it, it doesn&#039;t cater to what you want. And saying the game isn&#039;t perfect and has meandering elements to it are fair and true. The warp cauldrons system is fucking trash.

What exactly are you finding so compelling about Grunty&#039;s Lair? I mean, I GUESS there are one or two puzzles needed to access new areas, that&#039;s fine, and I GUESS there are a small handful of Jiggies that can only be found in the hub, but it&#039;s not as if Grunty&#039;s Lair is a level unto itself. It&#039;s not as compact and dense with things to find as Mario 64, nor is it filled with just as many collectibles and challenges as a normal level would have as the Spyro games do. 90% of the time spent in Grunty&#039;s Lair is just walking back and forth across empty areas that you&#039;ve already seen before. Is it just &quot;immersive&quot;? Maybe if you&#039;re a child. I&#039;m onboard with exploration, and adventure, and if it means I&#039;m always discovering new things, but that&#039;s only if I&#039;m not constantly going back and forth over the same shit I&#039;ve already found, and not finding anything new. And on repeat playthroughs, that gets even more frustrating, because that feeling of discovery is gone.<br><br>Banjo as a game doesn&#039;t seem to know what it wants to be. If it&#039;s an adventure game, then there&#039;s too much crappy platforming and flying (I knew you could make sharp turns, since I played on Xbox, and it&#039;s still janky as hell). It&#039;s not doing a good job of what it&#039;s &quot;trying&quot; to be or do. If Rare wanted to make an adventure game, they shouldn&#039;t have filled it with so many platforming challenges that play like shit. I could go on and mention even more things about the game that piss me off, such as needing to go back to Mumbo every single shitty fucking time I want to transform, or Rusty Bucket Bay having some of the worst level design I&#039;ve ever seen, or the bullshit final boss, but I think you get it by now.<br><br>I&#039;m going to go play Jak &amp; Daxter to cleanse my palette.

Namco themselves kept several units in reserve to use in their Namco branded theme parks and Namco arcades in Japan. Several independent arcade owners in Asia had a Ridge Racer Full Scale too. A few malls had them as well. In the 1990s, any business owner could buy it from Namco if they had the money. <br><br>Trust me. Namco would NOT invest money in a factory, put Ads in sales magazines (for arcade owners), make sales flyers, and only make a small handful of Ridge Racer Full Scale Units. You need bulk sales to make it worth the investment.", "time": 1673459012, "resto": 9560672}, {"no": 9561640, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)13:26:42", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_6818", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673461602935259, "time": 1673461602, "md5": "SfdVd3rwDOmEMVQDwg7+sw==", "fsize": 510149, "resto": 9560672}, {"no": 9561830, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)14:52:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9561548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9561548</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1993 was pre-internet</span><br>Are you shitting me?", "time": 1673466764, "resto": 9560672}, {"no": 9562034, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)15:55:36", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "elevator-action_01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 576, "h": 768, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673470536829457, "time": 1673470536, "md5": "x4SdT43jZqzJ0HfHdX6rzg==", "fsize": 81280, "resto": 9560672}, {"no": 9562065, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:06:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9561495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9561495</a><br>Even simple arcade games will never play properly on your emulation.", "filename": "images - 2023-01-12T100613.146", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 220, "h": 319, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673471185901038, "time": 1673471185, "md5": "dKoj1sGqFLyBnnJFDFQIqg==", "fsize": 14551, "resto": 9560672}, {"no": 9562490, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)19:01:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9561423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9561423</a><br>It&#039;s actually Attack from Mars pinball.

My favorite part of the game was the hectic trip up the vertical shaft after defeating Mother Brain, with the countdown. So good. The first half of the song that plays during this part is dark and dramatic and oppressive, almost making you feel like you&#039;re not gonna make it\u2014but then wait! The second half of the song starts playing, and suddenly, it&#039;s triumphant and encouraging, as if the game&#039;s telling the player not to give up hope just yet. As long as you keep pushing, there&#039;s still a chance that you&#039;ll succeed\u2014and I did, and it was glorious. https://youtu.be/V2k01qmi99k<br>And of course, the revelation that Samus is a woman at the end was sadly something that I missed out on, since I took too long. That&#039;s okay, though\u2014everyone knows Samus is a girl, and the whole point of the twist is that it never mattered that she was a woman in the first place.<br>A regret I have is never having found all the power-ups. A guide would&#039;ve helped out with this, but I was committed to finishing the game without one. As a result, I never wound up finding the Screw Attack, one of Samus&#039;s more iconic weapons. I still had a wonderful time with this game, though. Yes, it has definitely aged in some areas, but what game from the &#039;80s hasn&#039;t?

If I&#039;m not mistaken a lot of the Capcom CPSII game conversions like Vampire Savior use this resolution, either at 224 or 240 vertical lines. If the vertical resolution is 224 lines, it should mean that it&#039;s really 240 lines with 8 empty lines at both the top and bottom of the image. Those 16 pixels on the left and right sides of the image are squashed inwards to fill the same amount of space as 320 pixels normally would.

FF1 is easy. It&#039;s a JRPG, so it&#039;s easy. Also, it&#039;s a JRPG so its biggest problems by far are those inherent in the definition of the genre.

Play a version with them fixed or play an original version, and you&#039;ll have about the same experience. People can&#039;t shut up about them because only nerds care about old games like these and nerds can&#039;t stop their stupid brains from fixating on objectively quantifiable technical details, or from driving them to tell everybody else over and over about the special non-obvious knowledge they know so they can feel as if they&#039;ve solved the problem of others&#039; ignorance. Ignore that kind of nerd and forget about the stupid FF1 bugs. The only &quot;difficulty&quot; in these games is that they may require of you much patience.

Don&#039;t worry about other factors because that&#039;s the only thing that might get in your way.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

It&#039;s supposed to make up for its weaknesses in sheer luck and agility, but in practice, it&#039;s a total paperweight. It becomes better after class change, but that&#039;s not saying much when even a fourth-rate Knight w/Icebrand can out-damage a first-rate Ninja w/Katana. But in a bugfixed/remade version? Thief becomes MUCH more viable and almost feels like another class entirely, and Ninja&#039;s access to Haste and bugfixed Temper means it&#039;s not to be underestimated. Meanwhile, both the Black and White Mages are simply too damn squishy even accounting for bugfixed Int, and taking full advantage of them by decking out their magic slots makes them lowkey the most expensive classes to maintain, so they&#039;re hardly worth wasting slots. This ironically makes the default party of the NES/MSX version the best beginner-friendly one in the long run since it has the most reasonable variety; in the original/bugged version, Thief is just too much of a drag in the long run and you&#039;re better off replacing it with literally anything else. I dunno why remakes then swap out Monk and Red Mage for White and Black Mages. That&#039;s just a straight-up worse setup even in those versions. All the good magic can be learned by Red Wizard, and physical stats are way more important in this game, so it&#039;s a nobrainer.

It also does the thing with the two castles as well as the possessed ally, the one where you track down Dracula&#039;s parts, and so on. The audio samples for the music are also on the rough side for the GBA, and being designed around the original GBA screen in mind, the colors are bright and starkly saturated, which can look harsh on a lit screen.<br><br>That said, I think Harmony Of Dissonance is a good game, the two castles are implemented in a SUBSTANTIALLY better manner than Symphony itself did (even if secretly holding out on half of the game&#039;s map unless you pay attention is very cool and based), the two castles are distinctly different and you go back and forth to progress, involving some creative problem solving, rather than the upside down castle just being awkward to traverse.<br>In spite of rough instrument samples, I think the compositions are very good and I enjoy them a lot, and the oddly saturated colors (or occasionally very gray with stark red highlights), all have this abrasive visual (complimenting the music) which makes me think of Dario Argento&#039;s Suspiria, among other things.

However, one can use save states in many different ways and I believe some qualify more as cheating than others, and in the end there&#039;s always another topic of discussion, and that is if the fact that it&#039;s cheating matters more than one&#039;s enjoyment.

Save only at the start of a level to replicate unlimited continues and avoiding getting sent back to the beggining.<br>3. Save only so that you don&#039;t have to input a long password every single time you come back to your run.<br>4.

As far as buttons go, just within the conventional Sanwa stuff there&#039;s the foam pads, which change the travel and make the bottom mushy but do a good job of turning that plastic smacking into a quieter thud, and the elastomer cap style which have pretty much normal travel but are a grippier material I don&#039;t love and seem to mostly turn high pitched noises into lower pitched noises rather than being massively quieter overall.

A fully 3d fps with online deathmatch was huge. It was the beginning of e-sports. It was one of the first FPS games to have multiplayer-only maps.

Quake has better enemies, but I would expect it to, since it&#039;s a different genre. As for atmosphere, Mario has a fairly light and varied atmosphere, compared to the neverending darkness of Quake. Quake is significantly more replayable because of the higher difficulty ceiling, online multiplayer, and mods.
