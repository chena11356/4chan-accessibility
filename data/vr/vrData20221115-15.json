I doubt that the anon I quoted was implying that everyone in the country was hunting down and destroying supposedly sacrilegious games in the name of Jesus, baptizing any babies and manchildren they found on their way. Likewise, I was not implying universality either, just that it was a cultural undertone. You&#039;d have people who made a career out of claiming that this or that was evil and satanic, and that your children needed God and Jesus and yadda yadda yadda. You had people that formed parent groups which aimed to stop the production of things they thought were subversive, whether it was D&amp;D manuals or Twisted Sister albums. The US actually has a much longer history of religious revivals and fervor than I am experienced enough to comment on, but in terms of pop culture, the energy has been a slow but consistent undercurrent especially in more conservative areas. In terms of pop culture, you had things like the Beatles album burnings in the 60s after they said they were bigger than Jesus, but those were more like isolated incidents to the public eye. The late 20th century brought the proliferation of cable TV, VHS tapes by mail, and trashy talk shows/late night TV weirdos, which really allowed it to spread further and to cover more topics. And maybe it&#039;s just that I grew up in a conservative area, but I happened to see or know a number of people who dealt with this when growing up. Hell, even now I still meet people who had these experiences growing up, and I&#039;m not even in a conservative area anymore. <br>Again not saying it was universal, but it definitely got around.", "time": 1668540934, "resto": 9411180}, {"no": 9417535, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:22:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Renting two games on the Friday to return on Monday.

If you desire lower TVL, you&#039;d have to use a custom mask pattern that uses more pixels (Sony Megatron has patterns that use up to 7).", "time": 1668527892, "resto": 9401125}, {"no": 9417372, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:54:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9416621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9416621</a><br><a href=\"#p9416624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9416624</a><br>I&#039;m sure you get what you want by being autistic about it.", "time": 1668538444, "resto": 9401125}, {"no": 9417392, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:00:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9416621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9416621</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can tell because it looks shit and inauthentic as hell.</span><br>You realise it only looks shit on shit monitors, you TFTard.<br>Also I don&#039;t think you know how Trinitrons looked like.", "filename": "1667190361820267", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1668538843899113, "time": 1668538843, "md5": "e/NDlQ0nJDpp9uQb2HdKww==", "fsize": 4079113, "resto": 9401125}], "last_modified": 1668538843}, {"no": 9394716, "now": "11/06/22(Sun)15:49:20", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Welcome to the /vr/ NES challenge #2", "com": "Last one hit bump Limit. <br><br><a href=\"/vr/thread/9364572#p9364572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9364572</a><br><br>Let&#039;s keep it going.", "filename": "1666744199286810s", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 250, "h": 135, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 135, "tim": 1667767760034844, "time": 1667767760, "md5": "j5Xb3RRWGQYd31GFjSSqCg==", "fsize": 3615, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "welcome-to-the-vr-nes-challenge-2", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 172, "images": 16, "omitted_posts": 167, "omitted_images": 16, "last_replies": [{"no": 9416068, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)23:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1668485697, "resto": 9394716}, {"no": 9416161, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:06:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9414960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9414960</a><br>kek", "time": 1668488791, "resto": 9394716}, {"no": 9416370, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)02:49:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9415342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9415342</a><br>That&#039;s the best part of 8-bit games", "time": 1668498567, "resto": 9394716}, {"no": 9416931, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)09:47:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "gaming didn&#039;t get good until SNES anyway", "time": 1668523632, "resto": 9394716}, {"no": 9417390, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:59:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9416931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9416931</a><br>b8", "time": 1668538788, "resto": 9394716}], "last_modified": 1668538788}, {"no": 9389864, "now": "11/04/22(Fri)20:41:55", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/vr/ct - The Barrens Edition", "com": "Previous: <a href=\"/vr/thread/9352896#p9352896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9352896</a><br><br>Awesome Downloads:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OpenRCT2 - Currently the best way to play Rollercoaster Tycoon.

The Plus/4 was a sort of productivity computer with the C16 and Europe-only C116 as low end entries. The 264 line quickly flopped in the US market but proved relatively successful in Europe. The sound was limited compared to the C64&#039;s SID chip and there were no hardware sprites; as a tradeoff the Plus/4 had more colors (121 total) and hardware text blinking along with a faster CPU (1.7Mhz against the C64&#039;s 1.2Mhz) and a better, more fully-featured BASIC interpreter.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 264 line also suffered from reliability issues. The CPU and graphics chip, the TED, were made with the newer 3.5 micrometer HMOS process rather than the old 5 micrometer NMOS process used in the C64 chipset. MOS struggled to get the new process to work reliably; it had been used in the C64 PLA chip which suffered a high failure rate. According to Commodore engineer Bil Herd, the doping process used was flawed and would result in a runaway thermal effect and chip failure. Consequently, failed TED chips became a frequent problem in the Plus/4.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Plus/4 was not a major success but the C16, which was more reliable overall, sold decently in Europe as a low cost home/gaming computer despite its scant (for 1985) RAM size (16k with 11k usable for software).</span>", "filename": "Commodore_Plus_4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 544, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 170, "tim": 1668387826643787, "time": 1668387826, "md5": "sfqcRC8qt5zMzQVZ7Nr65g==", "fsize": 78855, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-commodore-264-line-intended-by-jack-tramiel", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 23, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 18, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 9414374, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)11:48:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "http://davbucci.chez-alice.fr/index<wbr>.php?argument=varie/plus4/plus4.inc<wbr>&amp;language=English<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The worst I am seeing right now are some people posting their theories that the chips should have been designed to run even cooler and more money spent and one person in particular has called everyone involved in the design/production processes incompetent to include process engineers, chip designers, mechanical designers, hardware engineers and purchasing agents, meanwhile they have never actually been exposed to production, design or real life physics on any level, and they simply don&#039;t listen when we explain how things really work from having been there and with experience making millions of these things.&quot;</span><br><br>I think Bil was being a bit defensive here and didn&#039;t really want to admit that Commodore weren&#039;t especially good at designing hardware.

Surreal and unsettling would be a good place to start. A weird curio from a bygone era? Yep. An avant-garde art piece? Yeah, probably that too. I&#039;m hesitant to call it a good game, because it&#039;s barely a game at all, but I&#039;ll certainly say this... it&#039;s interesting.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The game is extremely linear, mostly shuffling you around from location to location with a few things in any given environment to interact with and, once you do, you&#039;ll be shuffled off to the next area. This has the effect, intended or not, of making you feel rather uncomfortable as you&#039;re given virtually no control over anything. Practically every game amounts to simply doing what the developers intended, but it&#039;s rarely as on the nose as it is here, to the point that it feels less like exerting your own will and intellect to reach a desired conclusion that was planned by the developers and more like doing what they want, regardless of what you want. The distinction is arguably superficial but, in this case, it&#039;s palpable just the same.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graphically the game is a strange mishmash of steampunk, art deco, and some kind of unidentified Eastern Bloc country aesthetic. Things frequently take a turn for the surreal, and you often travel from one location to the next in something approximating an out of body experience - you&#039;ll be looking at a monitor of something and then suddenly move through the monitor into that location, for example.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adding to the surreal and unsettling quality is a fantastic, otherworldly soundtrack by Koji Ueno. It sometimes reminded me of the work of Akira Yamaoka, with things frequently turning into walls of abstract industrial noise.

Bandai was a licensing powerhouse after all.<br><br>The system was quite capable too! Handily shitting all over the cpus of the gameboy and neo geo pocket- this was the only system of the 3 that could run a full ass web browser.<br><br>Nearly the entire library runs at 75 fps. Why? Idk but it\u2019s quite nice. Games are smooth with lots of animation and fast clean scrolling. Hundreds of sprites dotting the screen without hiccup. <br>The system is no slouch in audio hardware either. Having a capable synth setup, AND cool ass sample capabilities- it has a sound that when used to full potential reminds me of some neo geo titles.<br><br>Despite the device being a properly capable 16 bit handheld for the time, the thing SIPS power. A single AA battery will keep the thing in active gameplay for well over 40 hours. That\u2019s not 40 hours standby- that\u2019s 40 hours of straight gameplay. On ONE battery. Gbc could barely muster 10 on 2 of the things.<br>This was also a console that only cost about $30 on release.", "filename": "6930D498-A4EA-4706-B748-CEF889F1787E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 267, "h": 189, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 176, "tim": 1668420133696263, "time": 1668420133, "md5": "JaukUU5hoNJO++I8RMZeUg==", "fsize": 7746, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "its-far-better-than-you-think", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 36, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 31, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 9414882, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)15:24:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9414856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9414856</a><br>Why one at a time? <br>I\u2019m tempted to just try to make my own, I can solder and program.
