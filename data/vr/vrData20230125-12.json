Nearly nothing is left online.<br><br>The game is about a 5 year old American girl identifying as a bear (and portrayed as such) going to dangerous locations after hearing voices in her head. The game opens with her being refused a bus ride, that bus is bombed by terrorists and everyone is dead, the terrorists are gunned by an airplane and everyone is dead, and the girl inspects the bus and goes &quot;It can&#039;t be helped&quot;. Then she has to avoid dying by starvation, getting hugged to death by a pedophile cop, getting killed in the crossfire of other terrorists in a public park where a schizophrenic woman thinks the heroine is daughter, and then an alien locale that defies description. I&#039;m saddened the walkthrough was taken offline. I really want to see how this goes now that I learned more Japanese. The backstory intro roll itself (which is in English) alone is a riot.<br><br><a href=\"#p9583554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9583554</a><br>Bless you, dear anon.<br><br><a href=\"#p9583580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9583580</a><br>It&#039;s an American copyright troll doing the takedowns.", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 718, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1674094242012865, "time": 1674094242, "md5": "ptKuveEyiYf25KDEUoq8EA==", "fsize": 512332, "resto": 9583470}, {"no": 9583592, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:12:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9583582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9583582</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;getting killed in the crossfire of other terrorists in a public park where a schizophrenic woman thinks the heroine is daughter</span><br>Pretty sure the protag is also schizophrenic.", "time": 1674094368, "resto": 9583470}, {"no": 9583609, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;This Mac version was designed for Mac OS 8, and also runs in Mac OS 9.

All the FX2 did was support larger ROMs than the FX1, the FX1 otherwise performs the same as the FX2. Many people assumed the FX1 runs slower from trying to use Star Fox 1 as the doner cart, but the chip used in Star Fox 1 was slower variant called the Mario Chip. The ROM of Star Fox 2 is small enough to be fully addressable with the FX1. The most likely reason that Star Fox 2 was going to use a FX2 chip is that they were probably not producing the FX1 anymore, not that it needed it. Even if the FX2 cost more to make, having production of both FX1 and FX2 going on at the same time when any FX1 game would run the same on a FX2 would have cost more.<br><br>There are far less games that had a FX2 in them, and even less that had battery SRAM. About your only option outside of Tealand is Doom and Yoshi&#039;s Island, both rare and expensive.<br><br>Meanwhile the Dirt Trax FX and Stunt Race FX games can be had for $10-15 at times and there were tons of those. Yeah, it does suck to have to cannabalize older SNES games to make one of these, but there is no real way to create your own from scratch due to it being an FX game. No homebrew way to create your own FX chip. I mean, it can probably be implemented with a FPGA but I have zero clue how powerful (and thus expensive) an FPGA one would need. I tried to lookup the hardware in the FXPak but all I could find was that a prototype from 2011 used a Spartan 3 FPGA, no idea if the current carts also use that. Depending on the version they go from $18 to $120, most seem to be $18-40.<br><br>As for making it, many have made such a repro in the past.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

It&#039;s supposed to make up for its weaknesses in sheer luck and agility, but in practice, it&#039;s a total paperweight. It becomes better after class change, but that&#039;s not saying much when even a fourth-rate Knight w/Icebrand can out-damage a first-rate Ninja w/Katana. But in a bugfixed/remade version? Thief becomes MUCH more viable and almost feels like another class entirely, and Ninja&#039;s access to Haste and bugfixed Temper means it&#039;s not to be underestimated. Meanwhile, both the Black and White Mages are simply too damn squishy even accounting for bugfixed Int, and taking full advantage of them by decking out their magic slots makes them lowkey the most expensive classes to maintain, so they&#039;re hardly worth wasting slots. This ironically makes the default party of the NES/MSX version the best beginner-friendly one in the long run since it has the most reasonable variety; in the original/bugged version, Thief is just too much of a drag in the long run and you&#039;re better off replacing it with literally anything else. I dunno why remakes then swap out Monk and Red Mage for White and Black Mages. That&#039;s just a straight-up worse setup even in those versions. All the good magic can be learned by Red Wizard, and physical stats are way more important in this game, so it&#039;s a nobrainer.

I am here to tell you that emulation and the secondhand market are both very wrong. Please delete your unauthorized reproductions and used copies within 24 hours. The only ethical way to consume video games is to buy a rendition that is currently sold through physical or digital retailers. For FINAL FANTASY, the Pixel Remaster series is an excellent choice. It is the latest incarnation of the classic FINAL FANTASY series, remastered for modern audiences with &quot;retro&quot; sensibilities. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is currently available on PC via Steam, Android via Google Play Store, and iOS via App Store. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is also coming soon to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4, where they were available physically. For FINAL FANTASY III or FINAL FANTASY IV, you may alternatively or additionally purchase our 3D remakes, which are still available on digital markets. The 3D remakes offer an experience similar but alternative to the 2D originals, making them worthwhile playthroughs. Remember, by purchasing only these versions of the FINAL FANTASY series, you are supporting the company that brought you the definitive editions of these legendary video games. As much as I too have a certain fondness for these classic role-playing video games as they appeared on Game Boy Advance and Sony PlayStation Portable, Square Enix will no longer receive the desirable monetary compensation through these obsoleted platforms, so it is therefore not recommended that you seek those ancient versions of these video games.

In DQ2 towns tend to work like hubs from which you may lead several adventures, and come back to between these adventures: using Cannock to go to the cave in the east, then to the cave in the west, before venturing further. Using Hamlin to go to Moonbroke, find the item in the swamp, then the tower in the east before venturing further.

This usually means stuff like video being heavily downsampled, audio being downsampled, or sometimes audio/video being removed completely.

FFVII itself as a game had issues throughout its development and the translation isn&#039;t exactly perfect so that was always going to lead to problems with understanding the plot considering probably the majority of FFVII (true fans that is) that played the game were super young kids to early teens at most.<br><br>Well honestly I guess I&#039;m getting at here is that Sephiroth almost comes across to me as like he&#039;s a DBZ villain", "time": 1674509203, "resto": 9590493}, {"no": 9596570, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)16:27:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596516</a><br>sephiroth makes the story much more personal. ff7&#039;s most memorable scenes all involve him, from him killing the midgar zolom, him killing aeris, the whole nibelheim massacre, the final showdown at the end in the lifestream, etc<br>making the plot chrono trigger 2 with jenova would&#039;ve been far less effective imo", "time": 1674509249, "resto": 9590493}, {"no": 9596572, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)16:28:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596516</a><br>Having an ayylmao spacemommy as the villain is kinda weak.", "time": 1674509303, "resto": 9590493}, {"no": 9596583, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)16:36:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596570</a><br><a href=\"#p9596572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596572</a><br>Its weird I kind of agree and don&#039;t. The jenova being the overall villain lets say if that happened it would have at least made the plot simpler to follow I think even if also less memorable and also cliche since its been done before. Didn&#039;t even matter if Sepiroth&#039;s body was the last boss you fought since it would have just been a body jenova controlled. However it would at least have made things easier for the devs to explain or even just fans themselves to understand the conclusions. <br><br>With how the story is not though I do agree with what you guys say. But it also does turn Sepiroth into as I said, almost like he&#039;s some godly DBZ villain. I think like someone said earlier maybe things would have made a lot more sense if he to was an ancient and was also the brother of Aeris. Then some of the ass pulls he does in regards to his magnificent prowess (kek sorry I just had to) would make more sense or be justified from a fan perspective. He&#039;s just anime badass supreme over here really. And due to the fandom at this point he seems to be the true star of the entirety of FFVII at this point with his coolness factor which detracts a bit imo from how great everything else about the game was. I don&#039;t like what they did with FFVII compilation stuff really. I get the feeling the remake trilogy or whatever may even make him become a misunderstood hero. He&#039;s too liked by fanboys.

The 65C02 assembly codes resemble that of the 6502 and have shorter and simpler commands than the 68000, thus it excelled at simple 2D tasks.

PC-E&#039;s display controller is more straightforward from what I know. Yeah it could render more colors, but you couldn&#039;t have too much parallax effects, and 3D effects would be slower.

Nudging is not something the general public does to machines. It&#039;s someone only very specific players do. And Nudging, shifting, or moving the machine *will* cause issues over time. They loosen screws, bolts, and wear out the machine connections at joints. It&#039;s a physical movement of the machine afterall. Maybe not cause issues right away, but it will over time. <br><br>I&#039;ve even seen instances where a player nudges too hard and can cause cracks in the glass. Do these people take responsibility? Nope. They just quietly walk away and leave the arcade without saying anything. Now the arcade owner has to pay to replace the glass. And the pinball is now out of service for days or weeks depending on how quickly they replace the glass. <br><br>Nudging (or any other &quot;pro&quot; pinball techniques) causes problems over time when a single player does it. Now imagine a pinball machine in a public arcade. It gets played dozens of times a day by many different players. More if it&#039;s popular location. It wears out the machine faster. Pins are just pieces of wood and metal after all. It&#039;s gonna break eventually if you keep stressing the connection points with movement. <br><br>You might be able to get away with it with newer machines but These older pinball machines aren&#039;t made anymore and sourcing replacement parts are difficult if something serious breaks. They should be respected and treated with an extra level of care from players if it&#039;s an older machine. This isn&#039;t the 1980s or 1990s anymore.

Today, pinball is most commonly an arcade game in which the ball is fired into a specially designed cabinet known as a pinball machine, hitting various lights, bumpers, ramps, and other targets depending on its design. The game&#039;s object is generally to score as many points as possible by hitting these targets and making various shots with flippers before the ball is lost. Most pinball machines use one ball per turn (except during special multi-ball phases), and the game ends when the ball(s) from the last turn are lost.</span>", "time": 1674419628, "resto": 9570085}, {"no": 9593713, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)15:48:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592287</a><br>I just got high score #1 on my local arcade machine.

I dont remember the exact value but i ordered a set of two fat ps3s and the postage ended up being something crazy like 120 dollars but it still worked out cheaper than buying locally as one was a backwards compatible model. Anime figures on average are about 25 dollars postage when i order those. Although it used to be cheaper before the russia ukraine bullshit. Japan post has a postage service called small air parcel which was very cheap and i think i used to be able to get figures shipped for like 10-15 dollars but they cant fly here anymore because they used to go over ukraine. These are all airmail and it will arrive within a week you can get seamail which is cheaper but takes like 2 months or something so ive never tried it", "time": 1674486065, "resto": 9593701}, {"no": 9595724, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)11:01:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9595631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9595631</a><br>Good to know, thanks for the informative post.

I know it&#039;s a matter of taste, and if you don&#039;t enjoy something I do then that&#039;s fine really, but I can&#039;t help but feel that a lot of people don&#039;t give Sonic a fair enough shot and end up missing out on experiences they might&#039;ve loved otherwise. When it comes to Sonic, the reason you run into things and get hit is because, well, you&#039;re going fast and, depending on how quick your reflexes are, you might not be able to react to things in time, it&#039;s something that varies from player to player and that&#039;s fine, but I can see why some would go through this and assume that it&#039;s all memorization...<br><br>Still, all video games require us to memorize sections we&#039;re having trouble with, and we&#039;re not supposed to be good at a video game as soon as we pick it up, it&#039;d be shallow otherwise, if you could just run and win, then no one would&#039;ve cared about Sonic, it&#039;s a franchise that rewards you for sticking around. One more thing that can help, is that Sonic&#039;s vulnerable when he&#039;s just running, but not when he&#039;s jumping... or rolling into a ball, always make sure to press down in slopes, not only do you gain speed, but you also protect yourself. Also, if you prefer something like Mario, then I can&#039;t recommend Sonic&#039;s 8bit library enough, they&#039;re a lot more Mario like than the original Genesis installments, Sonic 1 is excellent on both Game Gear and Master System, if you go for Sonic 2 then always pick the Master System version, otherwise it&#039;s too punishing, but if you go for Sonic Chaos then go for Game Gear, otherwise it&#039;s too simple. I hope you can give Sonic another fair shot, but if you prefer not to then that&#039;s your choice, but trust me, they&#039;re excellent video games.", "filename": "1656183688449", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2419, "h": 1171, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1674472582803650, "time": 1674472582, "md5": "UgJgu6Yjv2a1TYRi6mfaAg==", "fsize": 1802199, "resto": 9594740}, {"no": 9595434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)07:28:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9594740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9594740</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog (plus 8-bit)</span><br>Love both.

I basically ignored it except for being a less weird looking and slightly less cheap feeling second controller than the one with a Saturn style d-pad we had and thought it was weird until I somehow realized you could press the analog button and use it to trail brake in Gran Turismo without eating shit, and thankfully that usage ignores how bad the d-pad and face buttons were. (must have mashed on it in something enough the square button is really bad though, maybe Smackdown) Felt like a privilege to be able to use a DualShock 2 for PS1 games after we got a PS2.", "time": 1674352384, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591635, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:04:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591471</a><br>Which one?", "time": 1674353049, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591637, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:05:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591497</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he wants the D</span><br>Faggot", "time": 1674353110, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591640, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:06:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591637</a><br>I don&#039;t want the D, I have the D", "time": 1674353176, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591658, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:12:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591640</a><br>No, you pick the D", "time": 1674353546, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591913, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:34:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591470</a><br>Get on my level, normalfag.", "filename": "410AA2JRWBL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 386, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1674362062970980, "time": 1674362062, "md5": "tmPEvj0VT0TN8n3SZSLwcA==", "fsize": 24921, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591918, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:38:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591635</a><br>Ape Escape", "time": 1674362295, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591923, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:39:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591918</a><br>Ape Escape only works with the DS, doesn&#039;t work with the analogue", "time": 1674362391, "resto": 9591470}, {"no": 9591924, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)23:40:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dual Analogs are cool but the design of the analog stick housing is really bad.</span><br><br>Remember this was on a console that had self destructing CD drives.<br>The try holding the optical pickup bar was plastic, and next to the power supply, so the heat coming from it deformed the plastic and made the optical pickup be lower than it should be.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it.

This has been mislabeled for decades, confusing people to no end. Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white. Realistically, you&#039;ll probably have to settle on some sort of compromise between true blacks and a bit of black crush as no display is perfect.

They feature weaknesses that are hard to guess and hard to tell when you\u2019re doing it right versus wrong. For instance, phantoon does his special attack when you super missile him. A new player unfamiliar with his patterns will have a tough time linking that attack to a super missile hitting him and as such will probably stumble through the fight. The worst offender is draygon with the grapple zapple. If you don\u2019t use the grapple against it the fight is really really hard for a new player. Finally, Ridley is practically immune to missiles, taking 180 to die from them as opposed to 20 charge shots, making him not only wall players using regular boss strategies (use missiles and supers) but also doesn\u2019t give any indication that charge shots are doing more (other than noticing the faster color change on him). These bosses seem like an area where the game fails to communicate to the player, unlike the entire rest of the game, which is filled with thoughtful touches. <br><br>Thoughts?", "time": 1674452578, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9594943, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)00:57:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9594635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9594635</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;samefagging 47 minutes later</span><br>lol sure<br>perhaps...your opinion isn&#039;t very popular", "time": 1674453438, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9595360, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;underrated</span><br>what the fuck is wrong with you<br>what do you think that word means?<br><br>seriously what the fuck do you think it means<br>&quot;underrated&quot;<br>jesus christ", "time": 1674473606, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9595525, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:51:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is Super Metroid still fairly underrated?</span><br>Since the franchise itself still is and Super Metroid has never even sold 3 million + copies to my knowledge I would say yeah its way too underrated.

There is no excuse for anyone to not have played it. Its one of the finest examples ever of 2D gaming and especially within the action platformer genre of 2D games. I don&#039;t give a damn what excuses people come up with or some fat fuck neckbeard troll that would reply to this post saying it is wrong. Super Metroid is that damn good. It would be impossible to have a list of the greatest 2D action platformer games of all time and not include it.

Most FF fans are completely artistically illiterate and can&#039;t see any nuance. Sephiroth is shown to be cold and ruthless even when he was a &quot;hero.&quot; He was raised to be a killing machine, held up as a figurehead for Shinra&#039;s propaganda, showered with praise for slaughtering any perceived enemy, and we learn from Lucretia that he was never even held by his mother as a baby; he was whisked off by scientists to be a research specimen the moment he was born. You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see how fucked up someone would be from living a life like that. Even before the Nibelheim incident, he was, at best, a functional sociopath with a massive superiority complex, but most players completely miss all of that and take the claim that he&#039;s a hero at face value. <br><br>I&#039;d also argue that he doesn&#039;t actually give a shit about Jenova or the Ancients. Those are just post-hoc rationalizations he uses to justify his desires. When he reads in Gast&#039;s research notes that Jenova is an Ancient, he claims that entitles him to take the planet back from the humans who betrayed the Ancients. Later, when he travels through the Lifestream and learns the truth about Jenova (that she was actually just a monster that wiped out the Ancients), he twists it around and says that he&#039;s entitled to rule the planet because Jenova was even greater than the Ancients were. In other words, all he really wants is to satisfy his own ego by elevating himself up to godhood compared to the rest of the world, and he&#039;ll use whatever excuse he can come up with to justify it.", "time": 1674613383, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka is\u2026 Sephiroth</span><br>this nigga doesn\u2019t understand how numbers work", "time": 1674614692, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600392, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka\u2026 gets his plans foiled</span><br>You didn\u2019t even play the game.

There&#039;s at least a dozen Kojima-tier absurd plot twists that precede it, but basically the character being executed believes that its a mock execution, because the chief of police pardoned him but had to keep up appearances because he&#039;s known for being tough on crime. Usually on stage, that character acts like a chad with no fear of death, and his girlfriend is singing these joking lyrics about what a good actor he is while the music itself is really tense and clues you in that he&#039;s actually fucked and the police chief didn&#039;t actually give the order to pardon.

Especially today, Gorby is hated by many of people, but especially those who idolize USSR. <br>Technically, Gorby had good intentions of gradually turning USSR into more free-market and democratic country. But, he came at the worst time possible. Oil profits crashed after the end of theOPEC oil embargo of the early &#039;80s, and USSR was worn down by cold war and its own internal conflicts ready to explode (see <a href=\"#p9599561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599561</a>). Everything was slowly going to shit very fast, and the country could no longer afford to import food with oil bucks.<br>Gorby decided to start gradual transition to free market. However, unlike China, which started implementing free market from the bottom (first farmers going private, then small businesses, then small factories, then large factories, and so on), he did it from the top. This only created a very dysfunctional system that achieved nothing and satisfied no one. The country was nearing a huge food crisis, the internal conflicts and unrests were happening one by one, but Gorby was mostly trying to promote free speech, democracy and stuff like that. <br>All this led to Yeltsin getting power and the collapse of the Soviet union. Plenty people lost their jobs overnight, the country entered into a huge inflation and economic downturn, while corruption reached insane levels and the country went into a lawless period called &quot;the wild &#039;90s&quot;, with organized crime getting out of control. To this day, Russia is burdened with the consequences of this, from plenty people who were left jobless because they depended on state economy, to politics, when all these new states around Russia turned very anti-Russian. <br>This is how Gorby got his image of either a weak bumbling idiot, or a corrupt bad guy who destroyed USSR.

We generally modified their assets to enhance visual quality and clean up and optimize code.&quot; Traver adds an analogy to describe how the partnership worked. &quot;Konami had made it very clear earlier on that we at Silicon Knights were creating the VCR to play their movie.&quot;<br><br>This new imagining of the visuals also extended to the cutscenes. Where characters previously had static faces and eyes made of pixels, on GameCube they had full animation and lip synching for dialogue - all of which was re-recorded with most of the original cast. In the position of director was Japanese filmmaker Ryuhei Kitamura, known for his high octane action films. As Kitamura explains, it was Hideo Kojima&#039;s love of films that landed him the job. &quot;Hideo came and watched my first feature Versus and loved it and we became very good friends.

Neversoft, at that point most well know for Tony Hawk&#039;s Pro Skater, took that engine and simply made what was, at least for its time, the best Spider-Man video game ever made... and they stopped there, focusing mostly on Tony Hawk from that point onwards. However, that wasn&#039;t the end of it for good, even though it was 2000, and Sam Raimi&#039;s 1st film came out in 2002, Activision made sure to release a lot more.<br><br>In that very same year we got a port on Nintendo&#039;s Game Boy Color, which was quite different, with areas being connected while Spider-Man leveled up to make progress in them more viable, a lite MetroidVania feel. In 2001 we got ports of Neversoft&#039;s original, though they were almost identical, besides making 100% completion a lot easier, since the Quick-Change suit, which used to require 10.000 points to unlock on the Zip-Line training, now required 7.500, still difficult, but much more possible. 2001 also gave us a sequel to Neversoft&#039;s original, this time by Vicarious Visions, called Enter Electro, only on PS1.<br><br>Activision wasn&#039;t satisfied with all of that, and got both Torus Games and Vicarious Visions, which was already working on Enter Electro, pump out a couple of portable titles, one for Game Boy Color and another on Game Boy Advance. Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six was a sequel for the original Game Boy Color port of Neversoft&#039;s original, and it got rid of the more open style in favor of traditional levels. Mysterio&#039;s Menace is the one I wonder the most about though, it can be seen as a sort of Spider-Man 3... but is it a sequel to The Sinister Six or Enter Electro?

I&#039;ve decided that I&#039;ll beat it, just to complete this series whole, but I&#039;ve got to say that to me this is the least enjoyable installment. I don&#039;t mind the idea of interconnected areas and a pseudo MetroidVania style, but the execution was not ideal at all, for quite a few reasons unfortunately:<br><br>1. All areas are nicely condensed and fun to explore except for a single one, the Sewers, which just happen to be where you&#039;ll spend most of your time by far, and with no map at all.<br>2. Flying enemies are the worst to fight against, as Spider-Man&#039;s not well equipped to deal with them, so they take a lot of health away, especially the bats... in the Sewers, of course.<br>3. Control isn&#039;t responsive, it takes a second for Spider-Man to respond, and not only that, he keeps too much momentum while on the ground, but his jumping barely goes forward.<br><br>I kept playing, giving up, picking it up again, then giving up... until I got sick of it and decided that either I went after a guide or I&#039;d give up on this for good, so I swallowed my pride and used a guide. I feel that the experience is much better now, especially with a map of the Sewers, getting all of the hidden upgrades and taking the best routes so bats don&#039;t take away all of your health is ideal too, and almost kind of fun... but overall I can&#039;t help but feel that they dropped the ball on this one, both The Sinister Six and Mysterio&#039;s Menace were huge improvements.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spider-Man most dangerous enemies are bats and seagulls for some reason</span>", "filename": "1656370330300", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 315, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1674517000459049, "time": 1674517000, "md5": "/89rTA0ntqNkwPS35lwlAw==", "fsize": 148080, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597368, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9596867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9596867</a><br>Well, just a little update, I&#039;ve managed to beat it, though I&#039;m not sure if it was a 100% run or not... I&#039;ve found 2 guides, one from IGN back in the day, and another by Legomondo, I found both to be excellent, but regarding the Defense Upgrade, which are items you find in levels to upgrade your defense to a maximum of 6, there&#039;s something odd. Legomondo&#039;s guide mentions that Doc Ock&#039;s Lab has a Defense Upgrade, but you can level up both your attack and defense to 4 through XP, and then there are 2 Attack Upgrades you can find, which I did, but for defense it mentions a 3rd one in the last level, even though I had already found 2 by then and it doesn&#039;t make much sense to reach level 7 even though there isn&#039;t even a slot for it, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a mistake in the guide or not, but anyways I went into the last bosses completely leveled up in all fronts, so I suppose it counts as a 100% completion, though I&#039;m not sure due to the guide.<br><br>Anyways, leaving my 100% completion OCD aside, I want to talk about this installment, a GBC port for one of my favorite video games of all time, which is the PS1 original by Neversoft, of course I didn&#039;t expect them to make something as good as that, but I was frustrated by my experience. I&#039;ve mentioned how cryptic the Sewers are, and how you spend a lot of time lost there and getting swarmed by bats, flying enemies in general feel quite cheap. I still dislike how Spider-Man controls aswell, his jumping and momentum to be more specific, this should be one of the most agile characters in fiction, but he sure doesn&#039;t feel like that here. A lot of the concepts just aren&#039;t fleshed out enough, like how you pretty much have to grind for XP so you can fully level up Spider-Man... grinding, in a Spider-Man video game, doesn&#039;t feel right... also, if they wanted to make a MetroidVania, which I&#039;m down for, they could&#039;ve at least given players a map...<br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "1639702839705", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 858, "h": 858, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674528526223632, "time": 1674528526, "md5": "bD4XImdxFxHFgWOLFTgp2w==", "fsize": 141475, "resto": 9595717}, {"no": 9597389, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597368</a><br>I know it all sounds quite negative so far, but it&#039;s not all bad though, far from it. One thing that I must stress though... if you&#039;re going to play this, do yourself a favor and use a guide, or else you&#039;ll probably want to quit as soon as you go to the Sewers for the 1st time, not knowing where to go because everything looks the same, getting attacked from all directions, with tons of bats swarming you and taking away all of your health as you try to find upgrades and fail because they&#039;re all hidden in the most cryptic manner possible... it takes a nosedive in quality here so a guide is a must, at least to me. Anyways, I was going to talk about what I liked... and there was lots of it, there&#039;s a reason I tried so hard to keep up when I could&#039;ve just given up, there are lots of qualities here. Well, the 1st thing you&#039;ll notice is how it looks and sounds, not only are all sprites and environments well detailed for GBC standards, we&#039;ve also got some quality tunes and SFX in the OST... and the best part to me is its atmosphere, it&#039;s dark, grim, but not edgy and overdone, it feels appropriate for the story told, which is also a good time really.<br><br>We have a password system that works well, as intended, and has an atmospheric and moody password screen too which I love... and while I think they messed up a lot of what they went for with this MetroidVania lite style, mostly in execution, some of it does work, when you know how to get all of the upgrades and power Spider-Man up, also some grinding to fully level him up, you feel the difference from early on, how you take enemies down quicker and with ease, when they used to give you trouble.

Also, instead of having some levels you just want to skip through, like the city, subway and docks, and then levels that are ridiculously cryptic, like the sewers and lab, all levels here are well designed, not too linear, but also not too confusing to navigate, and you have a Spider-Sense that activates when you keep Spider-Man standing still, that points to your objective so you know where to go.
