All I know is that when you instantly rewind, there won&#039;t be a cognitive learning process as your brain needs to learn (adapt to) a certain pattern with expectations and outcomes. Rewinding just brings you back to the moment right before dying, but not the moments leading up to it. Yet you&#039;ll still receive the dopamine reward in both cases, taking away the motivation to become better at the game. Rewinding also drastically reduces the possibility of failure, and failure is when your brain actually learns in order to adapt and overcome. Hence the absence of learning. <br><br>8 and 16 bit games especially have been designed with this learning process in mind. It&#039;s the literal structure of those video games. When using save states or rewinds, you bypass this learning process and don&#039;t experience the game in full how it was intentionally designed by the brightest minds of the gaming industry. What you&#039;re left with is a powerpoint slide of dopamine shots that only serve as escapism. The element of &#039;play&#039; almost completely disappears.

Nothing.<br><br>In short, rewinding makes you a worse gamer in the long term. This is simple cognitive neurology, any scientist would agree. Save states and rewinds therefore make for an objectively inferior experience as you only experience a small aspect of the game.

The &quot;survival horror&quot; tension is incredibly effective. Every time I enter a new room my ass is clenched listening for zombies because I don&#039;t want to get bit or waste bullets. You don&#039;t know what&#039;s going to come next, especially when there are enemies like giant spiders that you wouldn&#039;t necessarily expect to be in a zombie game. And on top of that the game is extremely well designed so that you can anticipate what comes next based on the items you found in the area you&#039;re currently in, due to familiarity with games in general, but you still don&#039;t know exactly. So it creates a very satisfying give and take where you feel like you&#039;re using your brain to survive while at the same time reacting in the moment to the unexpected.<br>It&#039;s also interesting to think about how this was the game that started the franchise. I know all about Umbrella and the t-virus and the characters etc. but if you played this game when it came out that would&#039;ve been completely new, off the cuff, no big plan to create a franchise that would spawn a million more games. You would have no idea that there was a laboratory hidden under an elevator disguised as an ornate fountain, it would&#039;ve been mind blowing.

I can offer some of their thoughts. <br><br>Some arcade machines kept track of how much they earned in the hidden operator test settings. Data would display on how much money/quarters that players put inside the machine on each difficulty. You could track the data. <br><br>If you made the difficulty too high, then casual players would give up and stop playing because it was too hard.<br><br>If you made it too easy, then the game wouldn&#039;t be seen as a challenge and your casual players would easily beat the on less quarters. Which means you earn less money.<br><br>The idea was to find the perfect middle ground. You could adjust default CPU difficulty on a scale from level 1 to level 10 in many games.<br><br>If your arcade was in an area with mostly casual players and children, then you kept the difficulty on moderate. You go easy on the kids to lure more quarters out of them. Give them just enough hope and they will give you more quarters. <br><br>For an arcade that had a lot of &quot;pro players&quot;, operators kept the difficulty on high because they would be more of a challenge to pro players. <br><br>For some games like Fighting games, you could even adjust the default damage level.<br><br>For example, in the Philippines the the damage level was actually kept on 50% instead of the normal 100%. Kids didn&#039;t have a lot of money, so arcade owners would lower the damage so the players that visited often would be able to &quot;feel&quot; like they got their money&#039;s worth. Matches would be extra long due to lower damage. But this kept visitors coming to arcades. This happened in many countries in Asia, South America, and the Pacific Islands where kids had less money. <br><br>In America and Europe the damage was set to 100%<br><br>This led to an interesting scenario in &quot;Marvel VS Capcom 2&quot; when they were trying to host worldwide tournaments.

Emulation does not (and will never) count. <br><br>There is a reason that official record holder websites like Twin Galaxies and other websites exist. And the rule is that it must be on original hardware. It&#039;s to hold everyone to same rules and same standards.<br><br>Games like Donkey Kong require a 4 way joystick (original manufacturer design). And Using other joysticks with more available directions actually give an unfair advantage in game. There are active lawsuits right now in the real world about records being false because of using the wrong joystick. <br><br>PC computers are not universal. Everyone has different setups. Emulation can be used to cheat and there have been numerous cases of people cheating. Like with DDR and Guitar Hero record holders who&#039;ve been caught faking their records. They record themselves with the gameplay speed reduced to around 90% or 80% (because they can&#039;t do it at 100% speed), then use a video editing program to speed it back up to 100%. <br><br>Or people trying to claim &quot;Shoot Em up&quot; or &#039;Run and Gun&#039; game records, but use autofire.

But there&#039;s a magic to playing the games in order of release and seeing the evolution there.

Even when the game wasn&#039;t even a year old yet there was an interview with the series creator on Famitsu and he talked about how people complained about that inventory system.

The Switch Brigandine game is fun, too, if you like the original. Not much it terms of changes, so it&#039;s just more of the same rather than changing or trying to revamp the system.

I\u2019m always confused when people act like 3&amp;K is the best of the genesis games. Its not a terrible game but I prefer 1, 2 or CD. Sonic 1 and 2 are great for reasons you mentioned. Linear, fast and fun almost arcade style games. Race through the level and beat the boss quickly, stopping only to get the chaos emeralds. Multiple paths but the best is always fast and gives lots of rings. Metropolis Zone in Sonic 2 feels like a preview of Sonic 3. Its long and gets old. The added content in 3 seems to just slow everything down. It felt like it was competing with something slower and more methodical like DKC of Yoshi Island rather than trying to be fast, arcadey sonic. All the different powerups and different kinds of bonus zones complicated things in the wrong way. <br><br>Of course levels like labyrinth Zone and Marble Garden Zone in Sonic 1 slow things down too. I love these levels. The difference is they are simpler in design and not as long and just don\u2019t feel as padded out. Most levels in Sonic 3 wear out their welcome by the first zone in my opinion. Those slower levels in Sonic 1 remind me of 80\u2019s platforming games. Alex Kidd, SMB, etc. The long ones in 3&amp;K feel like Metropolis Zone times 3<br><br>Sonic CD is more about exploration and collection so the levels are more open. You can breeze through levels like in previous sonic games or you can try to find the collectables. Its a different game and I would say its a great twist. Rather tham just being longer and having more cinematic showpieces like 3, theres a real purpose and you\u2019re actively looking for something.<br><br>I don\u2019t mean to be too hard on 3&amp;K. Saving makes up for my complaints and moves it from an arcade platformer and turns it into a longer experience like DKC, Super Metroid or Castlevanias. Instead of playing the whole game, the player is meant to play a level or two per sitting, keeping things fresh.

Sonic CD was great too as a one-off experimental title, but it wasn\u2019t the direction I would have taken the series.

Special and super moves are intentionally more difficult to do than basic punches and kicks to balance their usefulness and power. So say, doing Zangief&#039;s spinning pile driver. It&#039;s one thing to be able to do the move while practicing, but it&#039;s another to be able to do the move consistently at just the right time and under the pressure of fightingyour opponent. That is one of the displays of skill at the heart if these games and which makes sense because they&#039;re based on martial arts which are 99% practice in most cases. <br><br>So taking that aspect away or minimizing it the way smash does, has the effect of making it more accessible, but it also removes a level of skill. It&#039;s very much like in cart racing games where the player&#039;s ability to win is based more on the meta game of power ups and attacks rather than precise driving in a more sim based racer. So it&#039;s not bad, it&#039;s just different. <br><br>It would be like if you took basketball but gave players the ability where if they are within a certain range of the basket they can hit a button and have the ball automatically go in. It lowersthe barrier of entry for people who want to play basketball because they don&#039;t have to practice getting the ball in the net, just running around on the court.

There are a number of reasons for me.<br><br>1. First off, I don\u2019t pay hundreds of dollars for anything emulatable. The only game I\u2019ve ever spent over $100 on is a PS3 game that emulates like absolute shit. I might buy Steel Battalion someday. I VERY rarely spend more than $30 even. I just have a lot of old stuff and hunt for deals, which is part of the fun for me<br><br>2. I like to browse. Buying physical games from my local shop keeps them in business so I can browse. This is actually helped by the prices of sought-after games shooting up\u2014since those are unavailable I look over the shelf for something affordable that seems interesting. It pushes me to explore the console\u2019s library more and I\u2019ve found some of my favorite games of all time this way.<br><br>3. While I don\u2019t intentionally buy games as an investment, the value of my collection is at this point far beyond what I paid for it. If I managed to sell my collection off at going rate (unlikely without years of work, I know) I could pay the down payment on a house at this point<br><br>4. If I have a big rom list I just don\u2019t play anything. Having physical games in my shelf encourages me to play through them, and browsing what I have can remind me to start or finish a game. It creates a contact point that just doesn\u2019t exist for a rom list.<br><br>5. Maybe the most schizo point, but I don\u2019t trust that piracy will remain as easy at it is now forever. Just because the internet has stayed relatively unregulated for this long doesn\u2019t mean it will be that way forever. I could write a manifesto about this but won\u2019t here and now.<br><br>6. They\u2019re neato and old hardware is cool. Fixing consoles and such taught me soldering skills that I\u2019ve used to make money as a side hustle. I like being the guy with shelves of old games. My friends think its cool I have certain rare games.

Maybe it isn&#039;t the same experience, but it&#039;s the same thing at the end of the day. You both played the game. Real hardware is not any objectively better experience. Emulation is definitely easier, faster, you&#039;re able to play the game with whatever controller you like, you can play it on any monitor you like, you can play it even better than the original console could. It if anything is the more objectively better way to play and at the very least as valid as playing the original. If you like collecting thats fine, but you should admit you just like it for the superficial collecting aspect. If it was merely about experiencing the game there&#039;d be no problem with emulation. If at the end of the day all you care about is consuming the story the author wrote or playing the game the developers made then theres nothing wrong at all with kindles or audiobooks or emulation because they&#039;re all equally valid and just as good if not better than the originals.

Gameplay is based around generals, the player has up to 4 teams each with 1 general and 5 units composed of fighters, archers, and mages (offensive or defensive).

Everything is made to make you realize they were going through their own adventures of their own while you were. This gives them weight and personality and puts everyone on the same level. How many RPGs have each character put on the same level of importance like that? Certainly not DQ3.<br>- The way towns work like hubs. You usually use the same town in between several small quests; either that or there is a good reason to come back to the town later on. This makes the world feel organic, real; vs the tired routine &quot;each area is composed of one town, one dungeon, clear that, reach next area, repeat&quot; which DQ3 started.<br>- The adventure elements, namely the treasure hunting; DQ2 probably started the &quot;you must find X number of magical key items as a goal&quot; trope for jRPGs (unless you count Zelda as an RPG), but unlike later/other use of that trope in which the key item is merely a meaningless token for denoting that you beat a dungeon; here you must go through adventure game mechanics to acquire them, acquire clues, solve puzzle, beat dungeons too sure but not only, and almost each one is acquired differently.

The game is based on the Doraemon licence, a series of manga and anime I&#039;m only vaguely familiar with (it aired for a short time two decades ago in my country).<br>In some ways it is reminiscent of the Mother series, the game starts in a realistic modern day (for the time) area, in this case Japan, before venturing into other worlds and eras. You play as yourself accompanying Doraemon in his search of allies (who come and go, but who actually leave their inventory behind when they do!), you enter your name and your sex, and there is a different character for boys and girls (this came out after DQ4). The story doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, each area has its own side plot and feel like they could be an episode from a series.<br>The musics are really good often sounding upbeat and joyous, great sounding drums and bass, and varied enough. Graphics are good enough but nothing extraordinary, some of the enemies don&#039;t look very good; but they are very varied with lot&#039;s of different locations.<br>Some interesting mechanics: there is a party chat you can use to remember what to do next and there is a seperate bag for inventory items (which can contain up to 100 items!), two things the DQ series would only introduce later on. Money is used to buy items (but not equipment, which is only found) but it is also used to cast spells and you only earn money from fights once you get back to a town.<br>Spells are treated like inventory items, so you can assign them to whomever, with the added downside of clogging the inventories quickly. However most spells don&#039;t work on the field (the cure spell even got consumed when I tried, so don&#039;t do that!)<br>[cont]", "filename": "Doraemon - Giga Zombie no Gyakushuu (Doraemon - The Revenge of Giga Zombie)", "ext": ".png", "w": 768, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675956766121789, "time": 1675956766, "md5": "b8RBojNRL9mYz0nJqhuSRA==", "fsize": 118911, "resto": 9619418}, {"no": 9646551, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)10:33:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9646547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9646547</a><br>[cont]<br><br><br>Difficulty is very easy, there is basically no grinding whatsoever and if you really needed it, leveling up just once makes a big difference. When a character dies, he&#039;s back to 1HP once the fight is over. If the entire party dies, you&#039;re back to the last save location (in a town) but you lose neither progress nor money. So the game is very lenient and just wants you to have a good time; but you still don&#039;t want to die in combat (no reviving) and enemies remain strong, so despite being a leniant game with no grinding, combat still manages to remain engaging.<br>On the downside, only a few defensive spells work at all during boss fights, few combat items did too; so it&#039;s all just the attack command against them. Also enemies in random encounters get quickly repetitive as you fight the same 3 enemies over and over in each area; although most areas are short enough it doesn&#039;t become too much a burden. You also get a Repel spell that actually works if you&#039;re tired of it. Enemies often behaved similarly too and rarely used spells so there were little incentive to prioritize targets.<br><br>All in all, a simple and easy but quirky and fun experience that managed to suck me in with its offbeat world.

It mixes elements from command based adventure games, going around still first person screens, talking to NPCs, solving puzzles, and RPG elements with random encounters, turned based fights, shops, equipment and spells. If you know Cleopatra no Mahou, it plays exactly like that, except that in Cleopatra the RPG elements are light and the adventure elements more developed, but in Maharaja it is the contrary.<br>The adventure elements are pretty simple, there is the occasional item puzzle and NPC to talk to in order to progress, but there is nothing that should make you require a guide. Along the game you can buy better equipment and acquire many spells, which you don&#039;t get right away on level up as you need to backtrack to town and to Shiva&#039;s temple to learn them.<br>The game&#039;s main pro is its graphics, environments are colourful and varied. Enemies look good and have various animations (idle, attacking, etc), and musics are pretty good as well.

There are 3 towers, 2 forests and a final castle. All 3 towers use the same design with the rooms and layout being identical in all floors of all 3 towers and only the palette changing. The 2 forests use the same visual design as well. Finally, navigating the final castle can easily get confusing. As you go around still screens, you never know what angle the next screen will use, for instance you may enter a room to the east and find yourself facing north on the next screen. This leads to easily turning in round on yourself, triggering random encounters in the process, just to get your bearings.<br>Also while there is a spell to warp to known places, there isn&#039;t one to exit a dungeon, so you&#039;ll find yourself backtracking a lot, with the point of views making it look like you&#039;re literally walking backwards.<br>Grinding a bit is necessary, but very fast, and you&#039;ll find that just 1-2 levels gained make a huge difference. The game isn&#039;t very long otherwise (around 8 hours, which is still longer than Cleopatra).<br><br>Conclusion: a hybrid mix of adventure and RPG elements that excels at neither, but fun nonetheless if your expectations aren&#039;t too high.

Then, you may decide to either cooperate with the other players, even going as far as teaming up to move and fight together (regrouping and splitting whenever you feel like, but also sharing gear and items), or you may decide to play against each others, and you can even fight the other players if you meet them on the field.<br>Simply using 2 players working together will make the game much easier however.<br>There are three boards, three different stories, but they all basically boil down to the same thing, with only the size of the board changing, though you may get an occasional &quot;plot twist&quot;, which can randomly change a scenario.", "filename": "Sugoro Quest - Dice no Senshitachi (The 100 World Story - The Tales on a Watery Wilderness)", "ext": ".png", "w": 768, "h": 960, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676285021510604, "time": 1676285021, "md5": "ilSWtJ5TtVTHJnYCbVh7+A==", "fsize": 77954, "resto": 9619418}, {"no": 9657857, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)05:44:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9657856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9657856</a><br>[cont]<br>The sidequests you can trigger are also semi-randomized but you will quickly find the same ones repeating.

Growing up without really using the internet I didn\u2019t even know there was a console war. I played gameboy and NES and later on N64 and Gameboy Color and then GameCube and Gameboy Advance then Wii and DS and I just never ran out of things to play. I also wasn\u2019t exactly rich so I hardly even came close to playing everything. Looking back at PS1 and 2s vast library I nor any of my friends, even my well off ones, had even half the games on those lists and knew of maybe only a couple of the larger ones like Metal Gear Solid they never got. Comparing something retroactively to its potential versus its actuality is a bit foolish. Games were expensive when you were a kid, piracy hardly golden. Hell, one of my friends wanted to borrow a game to pirate a copy for himself and he ended up destroying my disk, so I was very piracy averse after that experience for years. If you want to compare and argue about it now potential matters, but I don\u2019t think it matters when you actually talk about the reality of the situation. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had Symphony of the Night growing up, nowadays it\u2019s my second favorite Castlevania behind Rondo of Blood and only slightly beating out Castlevania 3. But I didn\u2019t play any of these games before I was an adult, what I played growing up was was Castlevania 1 and 2 on my dads NES, and I didn\u2019t play any of the ones on my N64 because. Well I never actually saw any at GameStop or at a yard sale. I played rogue squadron and army men and Mario and Zelda. My pals with their PlayStations played Spyro and Crash and a lot of shitty shovelware I don\u2019t really remember (like army men Kek)<br><br>And we all played on our game boys and gameboy advances because that\u2019s just what you did.

Plus we would skirmish and no one ever unlocked everything (except me I eventually finished everything in AW2 years after they had all moved on lmao) so some games you just had to get for yourself so you\u2019d wait for your birthday or do yard work and mow grass to get it. But seriously even my pal who\u2019s dad was a doctor who would continually buy and update his computer to play the newest games on PC, and then would give his son his hand me downs, didn\u2019t get every game. I mean they had an Xbox even? And he had a lot of games for it but not everything that would show up on a top 10 best Xbox games list. Even if they could technically have afforded them all he had neither infinite time nor infinite knowledge and my friend was playing on his gameboy as much as his fancy Alienware computer or fancy new Xbox none of us had. We\u2019d all go over to his house to play halo or some of his exclusive four player party games, because that\u2019s just what you did. You played games and shared with your friends.

So when you play the remaster with twin stick control, it&#039;s super fucking easy. Like I am on Normal and have not come even close to dying at any point. I think the remaster supports a control option that mimics the original though, but I haven&#039;t tested it. It also has the Wiimote aiming controls if you&#039;re into that. If you have a Switch-compatible GC controller, it can be used to control the game exactly as it was on the original hardware. Visually the remaster is exceptional, and runs at 60FPS somehow despite the Switch&#039;s dogshit hardware.<br><br>Ultimately, I would recommend the remaster without any caveats, unless your mission is specifically to play the original code of the game in its purest form. The remaster is a straight visual upgrade without sacrificing any of the original&#039;s art direction or atmosphere. Control options are varied enough to give you whatever you want.

At the bottom of the HUD there are two multi-function display (MFD) windows in the bottom corners and the inventory display in the bottom center. Both MFD windows on either side have the same tabs of info and do the exact same things. The problem is, when you pick up items and audio logs the windows display the new info and you have to manually tab to what you had previously. This was tedious to no end, so the key is getting down your preferred MFD button map. Assuming your movement is based around the WASD keys, I set my Q button to always display the mini map on my left MFD, and since E is the freelook button, I set my R button to always display my current weapon on my right MFD. So now when an audio log or searching a box for items takes up an MFD, you have buttons that can quickly snap back either display to more pertinent information.<br><br>Next the inventory display. The inventory has a few tabs from left to right, but no mapping for each specific tab like the MFD windows. In keeping with the Q and R for the left and right window, I set my X button to cycle forward the inventory tabs. If I missed a tab and went too far, I only have to press the X button a couple more times and I&#039;m back to where I want to be. Q on the left, R on the right, and X in the middle. (X is also used to center your character when you are leaning with the Z or C button, and when not leaning pressing X literally does nothing, your character does not make any weird twitches).", "time": 1676321931, "resto": 9655785}, {"no": 9659090, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:59:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9659078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9659078</a><br>A minor note on guns in this game: when a clip runs out of ammo, the gun does not auto-reload.

So you can send your armies there to harvest the gold.<br><br>Either way it wasn&#039;t until Dr Gast found Ifalna who clarified that Jenova was not a Cetra but rather a shape shifting alien who destroyed the Cetra. And that Jenova was the enemy of the Planet. Hojo didn&#039;t give a fuck though. Even after finding Hojo and Ifalna he forged ahead with his experiments out of curiosity of what Jenova would do. And since no one updated Gast&#039;s notes from when they were still working in the Mansion, Sephiroth got the wrong idea after reading them. Believing that Jenova was a Cetra that was done dirty by humans and the world belonged to her. Just like his father though, Sephiroth didn&#039;t care and forged ahead after finding out the truth and went with his own insane Meteor plan. And Hojo, who is also insane, decided to help Sephiroth, knowing Sephiroth hates him, just to see what would happen. <br><br>What I&#039;m saying is that Hojo is the real villain of FF7", "filename": "1665947043620552", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 523, "h": 666, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676057344729541, "time": 1676057344, "md5": "DaAIkJxKplb+GWgDesnjng==", "fsize": 93572, "resto": 9649678}, {"no": 9649827, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)14:33:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9649818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9649818</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And Hojo, who is also insane</span><br>Hojo injected himself with Jenova cells.<br>He wasn&#039;t really insane, just another puppet like Cloud and Sephiroth.<br>Jenova is the real villain of FFVII", "time": 1676057619, "resto": 9649678}, {"no": 9649832, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)14:35:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9649827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9649827</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hojo injected himself with Jenova cells.</span><br>When?

These games are filled to the brim with bullshit that wastes your time and 7 is easily the worst of the bunch. I think the far worst issue though is that it doesn&#039;t even do anything cool with its concept beyond its initial reveal. The shard system is a repetitive, arbitrary series of progression bottlenecks that results in the worst exploration across the entire series. Coincidentally, it was also the longest fucking game before XI released. Had some of the islands &amp; shards just existed as optional content the sense of exploration and flow would have felt way better. Not only that, but there&#039;s no fucking reason for the current linear implementation because once the islands are all finally revived, THEY DON&#039;T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. You finish rebuilding the world and then they throw the high-level monsters indiscriminately across every continent and put the path of progression in some wack ass underwater tunnels. The one point where reusing content would have actually been cool, having you traverse the world you built as you would in a typical DQ game but in a potentially unique route from the order you originally brought the islands back in, and now with super tough guys roaming about, could&#039;ve been ludo.
