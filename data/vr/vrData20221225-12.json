The scope, atmosphere, vehicles, and the fact that you could see for miles within the game was very new. Before Halo you had... Shadows of the Empire, where you could use a jetpack intermittently or ride a motorbike during a level or two, but in Halo you could turn a level into a ghostbike/plane/sniper/sword level. So it combined genres like racing, shooting, and close-quarter platforming. Halo had a verticality that was stunning and it felt more like a strategy game where timing, coordination and close perception of the AI&#039;s movements all became decisive elements. One player would notice the AI doing one thing and the other player would see it doing something else and gradually its defensive wall would be pared back. Unlike the AI in &#039;Doom&#039; or &#039;Shadows...&#039;, the AI in Halo seemed particularly animated, ingenious and funny. The atmospheric effects and textures brought everything much closer, the level design was repetitious but convincingly exotic. Also the sense of collaboration between immediate and later online friends was new. Booting up worms on the dc in 2001 was nothing like the hype surrounding halo 2 by Christmas 2004.

I think the original games had better music and a handful of better lines of dialogue, but FRLG was pretty great otherwise. I like held items, natures and all the other gen 3 junk and honestly like being able to play Red or Green with that stuff thrown in. I liked the way the Pokedex was presented and how the game gives you a little recap of what you last did whenever you load a save.

It did a lot of cool things and to me really freshened up the series up to that point. The only thing it missed was doing the physical/special split for attacks. That came a gen later. Would have been sweet to see it introduced with R/S/E instead. Was probably the most logical change to ever come to this franchise but by the time it showed up I was already done with Pokemon so I never played past the third gen of games. It was also nice to see those secret bases be a thing even if there was only a few limited locations for it. Was nice you could link up with friends, even have your friends character persist in your world. The fashion shows were also a fun divergence from the main game. Something this series desperately needed instead of just constant battling. Also made lesser mons and attacks not always completely worthless. Just too bad it was never expanded on really to my knowledge. Pokemon should have went out its way to vastly expand on concepts outside the catching and battling but I guess that leaves no room for milking so of course it wasn&#039;t happening.<br><br>Now as for the GB/GBC era, I actually prefer this era. Especially R/B/Y games. Its just preference and nostalgia admittedly. I also though prefer the look of this era to the later gens.

And some of those boards were also brittle or poorly made. Sega Model 3 and Hikaru boards were notorious for having so many problems. Hikaru boards especially were bad because they were known for breaking because of bad solder joints. Capacitors would literally break off the board when arcade businesses tried to move the machine to another part of the building in a normal move. It was so bad that Sega discontinued them only after a few games were made with them, and arcade owners complained to Sega about poor quality. <br><br>Those boards use proprietary parts. They are incredibly difficult to repair because the only way to fix them is to get Sega or Namco to warranty fix it. Or find another same arcade board and salvage parts from. <br><br>Once Sega and Namco stop offering warranty repairs, many arcades would just throw out the machines once they break because it was such a headache to keep the machines going.

Namco was ALWAYS the #1 seller in arcades in the 1980s and 1990s. Especially in Japan Namco was King.

Sega would spend huge amounts of money in trying invent bigger and better games than Namco. The Sega/Namco rivalry was intense and legendary. Namco and Sega constantly one upping eachother and stealing eachother employees. <br>Namco remained number #1, but Sega pushed them really, really, really hard. Namco had to constantly innovate to keep their top spot. <br><br>Namco even thought about releasing their own home console in the 1990s to compete with Sega for the home console market. But cooler heads at Namco prevailed. The Namco Executives felt that it would financially reckless to spread themselves too thin like Sega was doing. <br><br>Namco then decided to ONLY focus on three main things. Making console games, arcade cabinets, and running their Namco arcades/theme parks. In addition, Sony paid Namco a lot of money to exclusively make games for the Sony Playstation. So it made more financial sense to support Sony rather than make their own console. <br><br>Meanwhile Sega was spending HUGE amounts of money making console games, arcade games, making home consoles (Sega Genesis, Saturn, etc), pinball machines, huge Sega Theme parks, sponsoring Sega Race car teams, making Sega Brand Toys, dumping huge amounts of money into marketing to compete with Nintendo and Sony, and several other things. <br><br>Namco ended up being correct. Sega had spread themselves too thin. Sega had almost went bankrupt and went into DEEP debt. While Namco was stable and financially secure. Namco even tried to buy Sega during the early 2000s.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they&#039;re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#039;t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Malak&#039;s existencial catchphrase &quot;Ha-ha-ha!,&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to Michael Knight&#039;s Prima Official Game Guide: Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption Expansion.

The blackjack (note: there is no specific spot you have to hit guards with it, you can do it from any direction, even the front, provided they aren&#039;t in combat) works as a mechanic, because the choice to use it or not use it changes the way the game it played, if you knock guards out you get the burden of hiding their bodies, so other AI don&#039;t see them.

It&#039;s not quite the same genre, but I find strategy RPGs like Fire Emblem have much better combat, because each map is supposed to be a challenge whereas most encounters in a JRPG are just there to waste your time.

Linda Cubed is essentially Pokemon but not UTTER DOGSHIT. The concept is simple, go around the map, and fight animals. But if you hit them too hard, they explode. So you have to work out which skills to use to not kill them in a single hit, because you have to collect over 200 of the fuckers to beat the game. And half the animals only spawn under certain conditions, so you have to work out how to find them before you can fight them.<br><br>This also makes leveling mostly meaningless. You can grind up to max level in the first area of the game, it makes no impact on the difficulty because it&#039;s all about NOT doing too much damage. You can carve up the animals to make new equipment like weapons and armor. A few animal types can be used as party members, with their own leveling system. The whole game is on a timer that starts ticking whenever you&#039;re on the world map, there&#039;s no real penalty for dying in a fight other than getting kicked back to a hospital, which will cost you some time.

Even though Mario 2 was a bit weird and different, it was kinda the norm for Nintendo sequels to be a bit different. Also, the dream sequence helps it. Nintendo actually made a lot of merch for Mario Bros. 2, I remeber a kid in my school wearing a Super Mario Bros. 2 t-shirt, with Mario in the &#039;super jump&#039; position. You know, when you crouch long enough and the character starts glowing. Also, the first DiC Mario Cartoon (Super Mario Bros. Super Show) was basically a combination of Mario 1 and Mario 2: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkW<wbr>YP95WbbY<br><br>The first Mario game was already kinda dream-like and weird. So the weirdness of this game went by barely noticed. But for me, I thought Mario 2 was an improvement over Mario 1 in so many ways. Better looking graphics, bigger maps, you could move in all directions, the pick up and throw mechanic was neat, I liked the 4 character option. Going from Mario 2 to 3 was a bit jarring, as Mario 3 is the actual evolution of Mario 1 and 2 (JP), and Mario 3 did incorporate some of the grab and throw mechanics, but was also a step back for me as a kid. Like why did it go back to just Mario and no 4 character option? Mario couldn&#039;t pick up and throw anything like he could in Mario 2. i think by the time Mario World came out, I remember reading about Mario 2 being Doki Doki Panic in Japan.

Howard Phillips made the right call when he suggested that they just convert Doki Doki into Mario 2 instead. The general reception for Mario 2 was really positive. The game looked good for a NES game in 1988, sprites looked more cartoony. I think the game being a bit easier made it preferred over Mario 1. I don;t think anyone really noticed, given the fantasy book like setting of Mario 1.

TTYD is an amazing sequel that did some things wrong but still was a success. 64&#039;s an extremely well paced game with an incredibly inviting and well-crafted world to explore. I like Rogueport, a lot, but it&#039;s walled off every other area in the game by warp pipes, whereas most of them are physically connected to 64&#039;s Toad town. It&#039;s also the one game that made Peach cool, her segments give her a presence in the story not even games where she&#039;s playable have managed to match. TTYD might have a darker story, but I think what&#039;s in PM64 is incredibly well presented and depicted, and with the &quot;story book&quot; aesthetic at its peak. It&#039;s a consistently pleasant experience, whereas TTYD is peaks and valleys. The chapter with Doopliss is at the same time, the best and worst classic Paper Mario chapter of all time. The gameplay and level design are really iffy but the fairytale homage it puts Mario in, the visuals, the bad guy, the way you befriend Vivian, it&#039;s all great. 64 never quite gets that original, but it has, in my opinion, the best title drop in the history of videogames.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jM<wbr>7jMDeO3Q<br><br>All in the execution. I&#039;d choose 64 as my fave but that&#039;s cause I prefer the restrained tone, and its welcoming world, but TTYD really built up on it on meaningful ways, it is a great sequel and if you consider combat to be the core of these games, then the innovations made by TTYD cannot be understated. Going back from TTYD you&#039;d definitely feel shortchanged with the combat, specially with how you have to spend potentially an hour with no action commands (I recommend blazing through the prologue).<br><br>It&#039;s really up to you if you appreciate 64&#039;s cohesive world, charm and respect the foundation it set or TTYD&#039;s more &quot;meta&quot; approach and its satisfying mechanics.

(Also I have never paid a dime for any CRT, including a PVM, but that&#039;s a whole other conversation - I just think people who have all these random reasons why CRTs are a huge burden or whatever are trying to convince themselves they don&#039;t want one more than anyone else)", "time": 1671860679, "resto": 9513931}, {"no": 9514507, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)00:51:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9514398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9514398</a><br>Explain this statement.", "time": 1671861112, "resto": 9513931}, {"no": 9514512, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)00:54:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9514507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9514507</a><br>He&#039;s poor", "time": 1671861292, "resto": 9513931}, {"no": 9514604, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)02:21:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9514512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9514512</a><br>Nah, I just don&#039;t like overspending for onion garbage that will do the same thing.

It&#039;s been known since forever ago that Woolsey didn&#039;t deliver the most faithful translation, not to mention all the censorship, which is why we got that old Sky Render fan translation over twenty years ago (that we now know to be amateurish as fuck). Then the GBA game came out, and its translation was recognized to be much more accurate, but it had two problems: first, by that point, Woolsey&#039;s script had obtained meme status, and while the GBA script kept some of his lines, it changed or tossed enough of them out to piss a vocal part of the fanbase off. Second, the GBA version had problems of its own, namely shit music, slowdown and lower resolution, among others. So now you have a bunch of Woolsey fanboys who like the idea of a more accurate script while still staying true to the Woolsey &quot;flavor&quot;, all on the mostly superior SNES version, and before long, we got the Ted Woolsey Uncensored hack. Problem is, its creator didn&#039;t know a lick of moon, so all he did was mix and match bits and pieces of the Woolsey, GBA and Sky Render scripts as he pleased, and to top it off, he decided to also make it an overarching &quot;game improvement&quot; hack that fixed a gorillion longstanding bugs and added QoL changes. This effectively set the mold for all like-minded hacks that followed, all of which were made by people with no nip-speaking credentials, and all of which were convinced they could do it better than the last, especially given they&#039;re not constrained to just script changes, but outright game changes as well, so every new release is just feature creep.
