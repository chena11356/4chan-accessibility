However, one can use save states in many different ways and I believe some qualify more as cheating than others, and in the end there&#039;s always another topic of discussion, and that is if the fact that it&#039;s cheating matters more than one&#039;s enjoyment. Anyways, save states are used for a variety of reasons:<br><br>1. Save whenever faced with an obstacle so that you take no damage at all.<br>2. Save only at the start of a level to replicate unlimited continues and avoiding getting sent back to the beggining.<br>3. Save only so that you don&#039;t have to input a long password every single time you come back to your run.<br>4. Save only when you absolutely must leave and want to pick up from where you left off.<br><br>Of course there are more uses, but these are the main ones I can think off. I used to do #1 when I got into emulation as a kid, but eventually it got shallow and I stopped. I&#039;ll only do #3 if the passwords are long, because in general I love inputting them. I&#039;ve never used #4. However, #2 is the most interesting to me, and from my experience it can improve the experience, depending on what you&#039;re playing. If I&#039;m playing something really good, then I don&#039;t mind getting sent back to the begging, because the early stages are fun, but if I&#039;m playing something mediocre or bad, I feel that recreating unlimited continues through save states is better than quitting altogether.", "filename": "AnotherClumsyHalicore-size_restricted", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 478, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 239, "tim": 1674176170712726, "time": 1674176170, "md5": "0dKEumtSwbBlckz+bfuomA==", "fsize": 412793, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-do-you-feel-about-save-states", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 34, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 26}, {"no": 9586264, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)19:58:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I save state because I won&#039;t want to be arsed to do it over again.

Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it. Also, some DS games could have some form of interaction with prior GBA titles if two relevant ones were inserted, typically bonuses in a DS sequel to a GBA game.", "time": 1674085495, "resto": 9571779}, {"no": 9583639, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:32:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9582349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9582349</a><br>There&#039;s too much shit to keep up with as is.

As for level design, Mario levels feel like a bunch of bunch of abstract block combinations, compared to Quake levels, which feel more realistic and cohesive, each with plenty of secrets and even 4 secret levels. Quake has better enemies, but I would expect it to, since it&#039;s a different genre. As for atmosphere, Mario has a fairly light and varied atmosphere, compared to the neverending darkness of Quake. Quake is significantly more replayable because of the higher difficulty ceiling, online multiplayer, and mods. As for gameplay, they&#039;re both near the apex of their genres, the 3d platformer and the boomer shooter, and you&#039;re free to prefer either.<br><br>Graphics have gotten better in both genres, and both the 3d platformer and FPS genres have undergone changes, but I see a lot of FPS fans who want to go back to the good old days of FPS when games like Blood and Quake were new. I don&#039;t think fans of 3d platformers want the genre to regress -- they&#039;re happy with the improvements made by Mario Galaxy and Mario Odyssey. So I suppose Mario 64 has aged worse, since while people like it, people want to move on from it to newer and better things, which is not something you can say of Quake, what with the interest in returning to the past with retro-style boomer shooters.", "time": 1674217420, "resto": 9585008}, {"no": 9587237, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)07:25:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "SM64 was revolution<br><br>Quake was evolution", "time": 1674217507, "resto": 9585008}, {"no": 9587254, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)07:39:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "SM64 was breakthrough in third person camera design and controls, which influenced a large chunk of the industry.<br>Quake&#039;s engine would be the foundation for a lot of other engines thanks to their licencing program, some which are still being used to this day (IW9/Titanfall).

There are a few other dependencies in babel_static_functions.txt, but other than that you pretty much just inherit from SyncEnabledMonster or ChainEnabledMonster and use the appropriate hold state calls to make sure your monsters don&#039;t get their actions clobbered by signals at the wrong times.

A lot of the stuff in Babel is fairly highly coupled, specifically for fear, but there&#039;s also things I never did like making weapons attract monster attacks and other fuckery with targeting. Once you get a grip on the basics of exactly what I did to get sync/chain to work you&#039;ll see it&#039;s fairly straightforward, honestly not complex at all. If you want to get more complex and make a mod that isn&#039;t trying to be vanilla+, but maybe a little more out there, there&#039;s a TON of things that you can do just by throwing triggers around and manipulating states. The Cacodemon, for example, uses the same kinds of signals for its dodges.

You can use some other rasterization method (scanline fill or ray casting, for example). Collision detection and visibility work with planes. Read something on how compiler tools process the map data from the editor, and why. If I recall correctly, Quake-related engines combine all static brushes into one complex enclosed space (the \u201cinside\u201d of the map where everything exists), then subdivide it with each face plane to produce many subvolumes touching each other. You can also check GoldSrc and Source documents from Valve, their principles are similar.<br><br>When you have planes, you know you have planes by definition. When you have polygons, you need additional calculations to get normals from positions of vertices (which accelerators can implement in hardware, but you can&#039;t), and, sometimes, to recover the fact that polygons belong to the same plane.", "time": 1674188541, "resto": 9580932}, {"no": 9586641, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:46:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are there any source ports for Unreal Gold?", "time": 1674190010, "resto": 9580932}, {"no": 9586648, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9586641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9586641</a><br>No, the source code for all versions of UE are proprietary.

Yes, its true that NOA and NOE during the NES years often had a bias against overt themes regarding themes and symbols of many IRL faiths and/or religions as per their pre-ESRB political correctness game censorship guidelines, which also forbade references to alcohol, illicit drug use, and, most on-screen bloodshed. However, as much as there are references to Christianity here and there, especially in the early years of the franchise, that the Cross is not an exclusively Christian symbol, just as the Six-pointed star is not exclusive to Judaism. True, the special book in the early Zelda games is literally called a &quot;Bible&quot;, and cross imagery in a number of areas, the bulk of them in the early titles. But what makes you so damn sure that the word &quot;Shimpu&quot; is specifically meant to mean a Christian Priest? How fluent in Japanese are you, really? The language is often vague, its written form (aside from Kanji, which acts somewhat more like Chinese does) is a syllabary, is more reader dependent in its structure than any of the languages of Europe, and those of the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. I also add that even in the pre-Majora&#039;s mask era of LOZ, there are also other lore and folkloric beings from different parts of the world present. Fairies (Celtic and Germanic Lore) can be found in every game in the series. The Master Sword in Link to the past/Triforce of the Gods is very much reminiscent of Celtic Arthurian legend and lore.

With a button I can just make a grenade throw and it automatically returns me to my weapon afterwards, that&#039;s smooth and I don&#039;t need to come to a halt, you can make the gameplay faster for it, and in return increase the challenge for the player to match their abilities.<br><br>In Half-Life, I find myself not using hand grenades all that often because that requires that I stop shooting what I&#039;m using now and switching to another weapon, manually throwing it, and then switching back.

Otherwise Halo is 2 years late; There were multiple landmark games that did Halo before Halo; Halo simply revolutionized the already mega-popular console FPS by having a very smooth, stable framerate (especially compared to 90s 3D consoles), good gameplay, dual-stick controls (which it standardized after years of uncertainty), and system link which meant you could do 16 fucking players at once. I think Halo is way overrated and definitely fills the void of &quot;This is the first FPS I ever played and thus its the greatest ever&quot; as so many things inevitably do for people (like all the narutofags who obsessed over it despite it being a shitty comic), but to say it has no merits, especially for when it came out, is absurd.

But Nextech who was in charge of porting the Saturn game, had issues with RE2 to the Saturn, which caused its&#039; cancellation.I think Sega may have suggested making the game for the Dreamcast, instead. Nexttech made the Code Veronica game engine, which was essentially the RE2 game engine running with 3D environments. I almost thing Code Veronica was going to be a 3D remake of RE2, before Capcom decided to make it a new game. Code veronica was originally planned to have both Leon and Claire, with Leon being replaced by Steve Burnside. When Code Veronica was first shown off to the public, the game was treated like a technical showcase for the Dreamcast, and it was the first &#039;next generation&#039; Resident Evil game. The game did get released months before the PS2. The real-time cinematics and cinematic game models were really impressive for their time.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible). The rest should be played in original form where possible, give or take a translation/restoration patch.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I mostly care about translation accuracy</span><br>The ChaosRush one is the one you want then, preferably with an enhancement that makes the game play more like rereleases / as intended. Default is probably better since Chaos Edition looks like it makes a bit too much guesswork with DND equivalents.

The GBA version might be best overall, but it feels like Square was being vindictive at times about their official PSX versions of 4&amp;5 being outshined at the time by unofficial SFC translation hacks, so they overlocalized it to the point a few key scenes almost feel like parody. You&#039;ll see some defend these edits, but it&#039;s clear in reality that they have trash taste. SFC original does have a GBA script port. The base fan translation is showing its age, but you could try checking out Spooniest&#039;s &quot;Legend of the Crystals&quot; addendum instead.

It becomes better after class change, but that&#039;s not saying much when even a fourth-rate Knight w/Icebrand can out-damage a first-rate Ninja w/Katana. But in a bugfixed/remade version? Thief becomes MUCH more viable and almost feels like another class entirely, and Ninja&#039;s access to Haste and bugfixed Temper means it&#039;s not to be underestimated. Meanwhile, both the Black and White Mages are simply too damn squishy even accounting for bugfixed Int, and taking full advantage of them by decking out their magic slots makes them lowkey the most expensive classes to maintain, so they&#039;re hardly worth wasting slots. This ironically makes the default party of the NES/MSX version the best beginner-friendly one in the long run since it has the most reasonable variety; in the original/bugged version, Thief is just too much of a drag in the long run and you&#039;re better off replacing it with literally anything else. I dunno why remakes then swap out Monk and Red Mage for White and Black Mages. That&#039;s just a straight-up worse setup even in those versions.

But Ultima Underworld really marked the beginning of the genre, and RPGs in general, transitioning into 3D. It&#039;s worth noting Underworld was heavily influenced by Dungeon Master and its UI and interface makes a lot more sense if you&#039;ve played DM or Eye of the Beholder. Thing is that once they&#039;d made a 3D dungeon it made way more sense for it to be a single character game with you swinging your sword around and jumping and swimming in real time rather than a first person view of an entire party of characters doing these things. Obviously there were a few attempts to merge the new fully-3D first person RPGs with party mechanics like Might and Magic 6-9 and Wizardry 8 but they were few and far between and in the end single character games won out for 3D RPGs in general.<br><br>Here&#039;s a quote from an interview with Doug Church, the lead programmer behind Underworld 1 and 2 , System Shock and Thief 1, about this. It&#039;s from an interview from December 1992 about Ultima Underworld 2:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Q: GB: Will the game be single person still, or will a party join you in the dungeons? If no party, why not?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doug: Still a single player game. The action/motion nature of UW makes a party very hard to deal with. Say there was a chasm of lava, and you want to jump it, so you run and jump and make it. Your companion who you make carry all the food jumps as well, but is carrying so much that their top speed is too low to make the jump, and they fall in the chasm. Lots of problems like this crop up, along with the interface issues of real time control of the first person characters. Basically, we think that restricting the game enough to make it a party game would ruin a lot of the things it does well.</span><br><br>https://web.archive.org/web/2004050<wbr>2002424/http://www.uo.com/archive/f<wbr>tp/text/intrview/lglass.txt", "filename": "ultimaunderworld", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673922282079770, "time": 1673922282, "md5": "AvjfW/z6hRGBK9sdNkGyfA==", "fsize": 413357, "resto": 9576089}, {"no": 9578489, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:14:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576089</a><br><br>Not sure what you&#039;re talking about Etrian Odyssey is fairly recent", "time": 1673943283, "resto": 9576089}, {"no": 9578620, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)05:04:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576089</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and what would be the best starter game for it from your personal experience?</span><br>Lands of Lore is babies first blobber.

Granted these aren&#039;t usually first-party, but still, the first two Paper Mario games I remember having a cooler combat system than most other JRPGs, I really like how the stats work in Fire Emblem (speed is maybe too important, but then I like how they&#039;re not all equally important but even some of the less powerful ones it&#039;s still important to have a bit of), and even though you obviously CAN play single-player Pok\u00e9mon in a very braindead way and win, in my experience it&#039;s easier to find a way to play it that does produce tense and challenging situations than it is in most JRPGs, which I wouldn&#039;t really know how to make challenging without resorting to romhacks.<br><br>The single-combat format is unique as well, and a lot of the moves are also pretty creative in their functionality and I like that it actually tells you each move&#039;s accuracy and doesn&#039;t pull that BS where major enemies are immune to status moves.

The objective should have simply been designed to be a fun one instead.</span><br>Since 99% of people disagree with you, maybe come up with something more quantifiable than &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;tedious&quot;. The things we can measure objectively all tilt in favor of Nintendo&#039;s quality, be it Mario&#039;s snappy controls that respond near perfectly (talking about Odyssey, but obviously 64 was insane for its time where other games had tank controls--something I assume you just ignore), Mario having a lot of moves you can string together with relatively small time windows and rhythms that are literally methodologically and scientifically validated to be experienced as enjoyable by people, how well everything flows into one with just the right animations and weight to Mario. It&#039;s hard to tell how good something is when viewing it in isolation, though, so let&#039;s just look at the much lauded Jak games: You have to roll to long-jump, which is less visceral and chancier in tight spots than Mario&#039;s quick duck, while it&#039;s too easy to accidentally roll when you actually want to crouch for a high jump because the stick has to be 100% neutral, which doesn&#039;t have a good flow. It lacks Mario&#039;s rhythm and risk and reward (even the easiest platorms in Mario can be a challenge if you want to do things like backflips instead of standard jumps, but it always feels rewarding). You can constantly challenge yourself with timing triple jumps and dives to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and pits while still having to factor those into your timing if you want to go fast while also having the advantage of higher/longer jumps. The closest to that Jak has is spamming rolls and wide jumps, which is more like the rolling in Zelda, doesn&#039;t really give you an advantage outside of going faster and doesn&#039;t require any skill or timing, besides being impossible or needlessly risky to use in tight spots due to its clunkiness", "time": 1673792353, "resto": 9572387}, {"no": 9573313, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)09:23:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9573297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9573297</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since 99% of people disagree with you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The intended means of getting that star are in the filename, you&#039;re meant to awkwardly measure a fall from a terrible perspective while an owl carries you.

It also does the thing with the two castles as well as the possessed ally, the one where you track down Dracula&#039;s parts, and so on. The audio samples for the music are also on the rough side for the GBA, and being designed around the original GBA screen in mind, the colors are bright and starkly saturated, which can look harsh on a lit screen.<br><br>That said, I think Harmony Of Dissonance is a good game, the two castles are implemented in a SUBSTANTIALLY better manner than Symphony itself did (even if secretly holding out on half of the game&#039;s map unless you pay attention is very cool and based), the two castles are distinctly different and you go back and forth to progress, involving some creative problem solving, rather than the upside down castle just being awkward to traverse.<br>In spite of rough instrument samples, I think the compositions are very good and I enjoy them a lot, and the oddly saturated colors (or occasionally very gray with stark red highlights), all have this abrasive visual (complimenting the music) which makes me think of Dario Argento&#039;s Suspiria, among other things.

At most I could maybe $8K and the owner wouldn&#039;t come down in price.<br><br>It was 10 years old and the machine kinda worn, but it still worked. The interior needed to be redone.

Namco is actually well known for being financially responsible. It would not surprise me if 100 or 200 were made.

You could have gotten it for cheap if you had a few thousand dollars back then.

And one of the big reasons for that is that there weren&#039;t any european actor when it comes to hardware. The closest there have been were electronics company making computers in the DOS era and a bunch of them were just locally built versions of licensed american templates. That&#039;s mostly because it&#039;s hard to grow large enough to cover all the necessary R&amp;D when your potential market is a lot smaller than that of the US or when you aren&#039;t massively subsidized the way japanese electronics companies were. So no one was large enough to produce much. Amstrad and Sinclair tried but that alone wasn&#039;t enough to create an ecosystem distinct and large enough in Europe. It doesn&#039;t help that consumer technological lag was very real in plenty of places in Europe : a lot of local electronics companies were slow to adopt new formats and importing was too pricey for many. So if you lived in Italy, Portugal, Spain, parts of France or Germany in the 90s, you&#039;d be mostly surrounded by 80s tech. In the 2000s, the Eurozone ended up making importing much easier too. <br>That mostly leaves devs. Some have pretty actively tried to make somewhat distinctive types of games. Think Quantum Games or Eric Chahi&#039;s games with an emphasis on narrative and stripped-down gameplay. There is also a whole scene of computer devs in eastern Europe, which was especially active in the years after the fall of the USSR when the markets there opened and your average Ivan could get a computer that isn&#039;t an east-german Robotron piece of shit.<br>tl;dr : <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pre-Eurozone disparate market made it impossible for local tech to grow in a unique way, no one was big enough to do unique hardware (save for maybe Sinclair or the Minitel project)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tech penetration among consumers took forever</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the devs that try to grow unique local stuff usually end up with bombs or pretty niche success</span>", "time": 1674141039, "resto": 9579771}, {"no": 9585562, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)14:01:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "After all these years I must say probably my favorite campaign shooter with Half Life 2 <br>(2007 and directX 9)", "filename": "H2x1_NSwitchDS_CrysisRemastered", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 62, "tim": 1674154898921975, "time": 1674154898, "md5": "gbHVkMp+l/Oo9DaXbsSxUA==", "fsize": 1367079, "resto": 9579771}, {"no": 9585719, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)15:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9583975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9583975</a><br>For me Gekido was a mix between fighting force and street of rage.", "time": 1674158436, "resto": 9579771}, {"no": 9586373, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)21:07:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9584741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9584741</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan doesn&#039;t copy America</span><br>They do though.", "time": 1674180472, "resto": 9579771}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9585989, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)17:24:18", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "100%", "com": "Nowadays the concept of completion in video games is more widespread than ever before, with pretty much every single release, no matter what genre it&#039;s from, having tons of achievements/trophies for players to go after, making that percentage number go up and up until it reaches 100% and they can claim that they&#039;ve completed what they are playing.

So I decided to try myself. Specifically on SNES, beating Lavos after reaching the end of time, before returning to 1000AD. My rule was the title/save name for the chapter couldn&#039;t change from &quot;End of Time&quot; to &quot;The Village of Magic&quot;. Thus I could grind in 65,000,000 BC to make it a bit faster. I did this via emulator, using turbo/fastforward but otherwise no assist/cheat/etc.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After many hours of grinding to LVL 90 I finally did it (88:25 of game time, less realtime with fast-forward). Was able to get to the final form at about LVL 70, but the last form is a beast to do with the low level equipment. Grand Stone is an insta-wipe (chrono can occasionally survive if lucky+full HP) So I needed Lifeline via chrono+marle+robo. Magic damage wasn&#039;t as much of a problem as everyone had maxed Mdef at that level, but did still require pretty constant healing. Luminaire is a heavy hitter, but expensive: robo tackle was the MVP with level scaling dmg and MP efficiency -- didn&#039;t quite one-shot the left bit, but close enough to allow a one-two punch.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interestingly, this doesn&#039;t appear to have unlocked NewGame+, which is a bummer.</span><br>I saw a TAS do it too at a low 40s levels, but I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s not possible normally without extreme luck<br>https://youtu.be/OJTUR67myH8", "filename": "chrono trigger art", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1366, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673989222779143, "time": 1673989222, "md5": "31KMhJKajRAqGNIjvQgCMg==", "fsize": 467050, "resto": 9577756}, {"no": 9580021, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9579958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9579958</a><br><a href=\"#p9580010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9580010</a><br>But a couple weeks ago I replayed and finally used Crono, Ayla, Robo the whole way, and it was great.
