Truthfully I&#039;ve spent more time collecting the ROMs than actually playing them so far. But as a Mega Man fan I really enjoy the &quot;Zook&quot; series. There are two on GBC (Zook Hero Z and Zook Hero 2) and one on GBA (Rockman &amp; Crystal). Of course they aren&#039;t the level of quality you would expect from official Mega Man games, but they&#039;re very fascinating, but that&#039;s been my experience with just about every bootleg I&#039;ve played on any system! There&#039;s also a similar game called Rockman 8 on GB, but I haven&#039;t tried that one yet. I&#039;m really excited to try out all the various Digimon RPGs, like Digimon Crystal II, Digimon D-4, Digimon Sapphire, etc, as well as an original RPG (so I guess technically not a bootleg?) called Sheng Shou Wu Yu that taizou, the author of hhugboy, speaks highly of on his blog. That one hasn&#039;t been translated to my knowledge, so I&#039;m gonna try to use google lens or something to play it. If you like platformers, there&#039;s Crash II Advance and Rayman IV, which are next on my list to try. If you haven&#039;t already, check out https://hhug.me, the blog of the author of hhugboy. He posts all of his dumps there and describes the games alongside screenshots, and shows what the carts and boxes look like and sometimes links to the manuals, if you&#039;re into that aspect of it.", "time": 1670138000, "resto": 9458216}, {"no": 9464634, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:35:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I launch gran turismo 4 on my ps2 but for some reason the first tab that pops up is non-responsive to my dualshock 2 wtf?

Also, no boss again, just a dumb simon says game that goes on for WAY too long.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Level 5, I turned off the game at this point and decided to back to it later.
