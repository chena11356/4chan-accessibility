A flamethrower would also be nice for damage over time, a nice contrast to the BFG where you have to be looking at the enemy to damage them.

All of the home ports of Virtua Fighter 1 are locked down to 30fps. The 32x game retains 30fps for the majority of the game, but has some slowdown during the win/ lose cutscenes.

This means it could either be a CPU bottle neck, memory bottlenecks, etc. Odds are the game just didn&#039;t get the final bits of optimization the PS1 port got due to the Saturn port being rushed out sooner.<br><br>The other thing to keep in mind is that Sony had their performance analyzer that could tell devs exactly where the bottleneck was in their code and how to fix it. Neither Sega nor Nintendo had anything like that. So that helped developers produce faster code.<br><br>So while VDP1&#039;s fill rate is lower than the PS1&#039;s GPU, it&#039;s not the massive performance gap many think it is. Most of these games aren&#039;t doing anything that should be getting close to that limit. To hit that limit you need to be doing something really dumb like rendering the entire frame with transparent polygons or not having any code to sort and eliminate non visible polygons.", "time": 1672251743, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9524701, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:37:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9524669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9524669</a><br>The Playstation&#039;s fillrate advantage only really starts to shine with Gouraud shaded polygons, which are drawn twice as fast and which was used to great effect in games like Crash, Spyro and FF7.", "time": 1672252628, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9524723, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:42:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523967</a><br><a href=\"#p9523987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523987</a><br><a href=\"#p9523995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523995</a><br><a href=\"#p9524010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9524010</a><br><a href=\"#p9524030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9524030</a><br><br>There is no way you&#039;re this fucking stupid lol.

The PS1 was sold at a similar loss to the Saturn when it launched in 1994 in Japan. This has been revealed by recent interviews from employees involved in both companies. PS1 cost about 50,000 Yen per unit to produce, Saturn cost about 54,800 Yen. Yes Saturn is more, but it&#039;s not $100 more. Both systems were sold at a $100 loss as well. The biggest cost issue in both systems wasn&#039;t the number of chips, it was the RAM. RAM prices were stupid high during this time and fell dramatically in the next 3 years.

If you bought a game with your PS1 at launch, you&#039;d be paying the same amount. 2-3 weeks after the PS1 launched Sega released a Saturn that didn&#039;t come with a game for $299.

Gouraud Shading doesn&#039;t really have much of a performance hit on VDP1. If you want to know how that figure is actually determined it basically boils down to this. <br><br>- A non textured pixel takes about 1 clock cycle to draw. <br>- A textured pixel takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A textured and gouraud shaded pixel still takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A half transparent pixel takes about 6 cycles to draw. <br><br>So compared to untextured pixels it&#039;s 6 times longer to draw, compared to textured it&#039;s 3 times longer to draw. So this is where your up to 6 times longer comes from. So with those values we can say that the max theoretical fillrate of VDP1 is 26-28 Million pixels per second depending on what resolution mode the Saturn is in and if you&#039;re drawing all untextured pixels. This is probably how the theoretical value listed earlier was determined. For Textured and Gouraud shaded pixels it&#039;s about 13-14 Million pixels per second. For half transparent pixels, it&#039;s about 4-5 Million pixels per second. <br><br>That&#039;s still a pretty significance performance hit for half transparencies. Throw in that they don&#039;t work correctly all the time and it&#039;s easy to see why most devs went with meshes. <br><br>That all said, if you&#039;re not doing half transparencies VDP1&#039;s fillrate is still more than enough for most games. At 320x240 resolution at 30fps you have enough fillrate to draw the entire frame buffer about 6 times per frame. So if you&#039;re sorting and culling polygons properly and not trying to draw everything as half transparent, you really shouldn&#039;t be hitting the fillrate limit.", "time": 1672264899, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9525165, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523969</a><br>Held back only by the small cartridge space.

There&#039;s also another thing in this thread that&#039;s worth pointing out too: most of the titles posted are either Sega Saturn, obscure PC-E or PS1/PS2 titles, the reason which is that the technology to actually inject and rewrite text, make sure it fits the boxes, etc. is a much more difficult task than translating the script itself wholesale.

I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

Play if you like quirky games like Wario Ware and rhythm games.<br>3. Advance Wars\u2014personally not a fan, but those who liked it spent hundreds of hours in it. Very addictive strategy game.<br>4. WarioWare\u2014quirky and addictive, one of the more original games for GBA. If you&#039;ve never tried it, do. If you did, still fun to see where it all started from.<br>5. Metroid Fusion\u2014it&#039;s 2D Metroid, enough said. It&#039;s great despite some say it&#039;s not Super Metroid.<br>6. Mother 3\u2014not a perfect RPG, but one many people want to play now. Play if you like Earthbound or want an RPG with plot.<br>7. Wario Land 4\u2014some praise this is as pinnacle of GBA or even best platformer ever, others will write it off as good but ultimately weaker than the GBC ones. Regardless, well worth a try.<br>8. Mario &amp; Luigi\u2014actually very good RPG, only brought down by bing bang wahoo style and kinda whatever graphics.<br>9. Kirbies in general\u2014always fun and worth a play. Play if you like Kirby, don&#039;t play if you&#039;re sick of platformers.<br>10. Mega Man Zero 3 &amp; 4\u2014decent games, but got pretty overrated recently as some &quot;official canon classics&quot;. I beat them all, they&#039;re fun and good but not really masterpieces. Play if you like Mega Man X series and / or have played the other 9 games already.<br>Not on the list:<br>SNES ports, especially Mario ports\u2014kind of obsolete in current day and age, maybe save for SMW as you can collect dragon coins in it, but that&#039;s it.<br>Pokemons\u2014you either love them or hate them. If you love them, you probably know which ones to play anyway, and may prefer remakes. <br>Zelda: Minish Cap\u2014it&#039;s more Zelda. Play it or skip it, it&#039;s alright if you want more ALTTP but thats about it.<br>Treasure games\u2014no comment.<br>Mega Man Battle Network\u2014one of those monster / card collect series that just goes on and on.", "time": 1672043990, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518704, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:53:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518654</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his list is baaad, look at my list look at my list! </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the same but has one-dollar-store Symphony of the Night with ladyboy characters!</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9518683</span><br><a href=\"#p9518687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518687</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;then takes it so seriously he deletes his post over a typo and uses alt codes</span><br>I hope you are a janny because otherwise you need to touch snail shells right now", "time": 1672044817, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518708, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:59:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518704</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look at my list look at my list</span><br>I never posted a list.

The go-to example of this is probably The First Templar (way too easy) or Gran Turismo 5 (requires a retarded amount of dedication) not to mention all of the online-only trophies which were functionally impossible to get. <br><br>Nowadays, while there are a lot of games releasing solely for trophy hunters to get an easy platinum, most other achievement lists are designed by the developers themselves rather than a third party.

Even when you consult a level map to get every coin possible, ratchet scrolling means you have to be basically perfect. There&#039;s also the ironman challenge for SMW, or the extra hard cheevos for F-Zero X. It&#039;s also worth mentioning that the API&#039;s implementation is a fantastic training tool for indie devs since you have to dive deep into the code and tinker with lots of stuff just to make a functioning trophy.<br><br>There are definitely games which don&#039;t need achievements at all.

The only people making immediate profit off of the project are the people selling pre-built add-ons for the DE-10 Nano to be used with the MiSTer FPGA project, and of course Terasic for each DE-10 Nano unit sold. Sorg, the main developer, is not directly profiting off this project, but he does accept donations which is a huge difference from providing services for pay. Some add-on sellers do state on their website that a portion of each sale will be donated to Sorg so this kind of transparency shows which sellers we should be buying from as well if you don&#039;t plan to build your own add-ons.<br><br>Most vocal people in the &quot;just emulate for free&quot; category don&#039;t actually provide any solid arguments or convincing points to add weight to their posts so I would prefer to disregard them. <br><br>There is a surprising amount of people in the MiSTer FPGA community who already have hardware collections and are convinced they can sell parts of their collections with no regrets.

QuackShot (Sega Genesis): It&#039;s not a complete piece of cake, but it&#039;s really enjoyable and well made, short and has unlimited continues, so as long as you keep going it should be a matter of time.<br><br>2. World Cup Italia &#039;90 (Sega Genesis): I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re into football/soccer, but this is a simple one, a tournament of 7 matches, just spam diagnoal long balls and try to do a header or bicycle kick.<br><br>3. Sonic Chaos (Sega Master System/Sega Game Gear): I&#039;d say this is the easiest 2D Sonic platformer ever made, just keep going to the right and you&#039;ll beat it, if you want 100% completion though...<br><br>4. Lucky Dime Caper &amp; Deep Duck Trouble (Sega Master System/Sega Game Gear): A similar situation to QuackShot, they&#039;re both good, fun and short, with unlimited continues, just keep playing them.<br><br>5. World Cup Italia &#039;90 (Sega Master System): Another 7 match tournament, just select a good team like Brazil, run up the pitch or do long passes, and score by passing it sideways near the box.<br><br>6. Donald Duck no Mahou no Boushi (SNES): A straightforward adventure even on the hardest difficulty setting, same situation as the previous Donald Duck titles I&#039;ve mentioned, and a good time too.<br><br>7. Crash XS &amp; Crash 2 (GBA): Lovely adaptations of Crash&#039;s PS1 gameplay into 2D, completing them 100% isn&#039;t so simple, but just getting to the end should give you much trouble at all, both are a good time.<br><br>I hope I was able to help out, OP.

Depends on the game. Beatemups are usually easy to clear in a sitting, and RPGs, while they take time, are just a steady grind of getting stronger until you win. There are some games where, as a kid, my bros and I would play for a bit, have fun, then swap cartridges to something else, with some titles remaining perpetually unbeaten. But we were never particularly bothered by it. It sounds like a bizarre thing to say, but &quot;you have to be able to beat it&quot; never felt like a required selling point back in the day. Just trying to get farther for the explorative reward of seeing the next level or the new enemy types was exciting enough. It was fun to be able to go to school the next day and tell kids &quot;dude I got to level 4 once and there&#039;s these grey octopus things that shoot missiles!&quot; on some game. <br><br>Part of it comes down to ownership vs rental though. It wasn&#039;t common for kids in our region and generation to own lots of games, we weren&#039;t super rich. So we&#039;d get one or two a year for birthday/Christmas, and borrow them between ourselves. When rentals became a thing it greatly expanded the number of titles we were able to play, and at only 3 days a pop it was common to return a game without clearing it, to try something else, then come back to it and rent it again at a later date (unless it was so awesome that it was worth renting multiple times in a row; when Street Fighter 2 came out on SNES I think we stayed up 25 hours playing that). <br><br>I do have some distinct memories of games I did beat, though. Zelda 1 multiple times - always an immersive adventure. Final Fantasy 1 as well, and grinding or no the last dungeon can get tricky if you&#039;re not smart with your spellcasting. Castlevania 1, was pretty proud when I could sit down and beat that in a single run.

Getting the bracelet opens up a big chunk of the game world - you&#039;re still cut off from a large amount of the northern mountains and the southeast, but you&#039;re pretty free. The third dungeon does little to expand world access, but the fourth dungeon comes with flippers that let you swim to a few more places and the fifth dungeon gets you the Hook Shot that opens up the southeast.

I think the original games had better music and a handful of better lines of dialogue, but FRLG was pretty great otherwise. I like held items, natures and all the other gen 3 junk and honestly like being able to play Red or Green with that stuff thrown in. I liked the way the Pokedex was presented and how the game gives you a little recap of what you last did whenever you load a save.

I don&#039;t remember the world map being quite as good as the ones in gen 3, but liked the story and all the new Pokemon.

Would have been sweet to see it introduced with R/S/E instead. Was probably the most logical change to ever come to this franchise but by the time it showed up I was already done with Pokemon so I never played past the third gen of games. It was also nice to see those secret bases be a thing even if there was only a few limited locations for it. Was nice you could link up with friends, even have your friends character persist in your world. The fashion shows were also a fun divergence from the main game. Something this series desperately needed instead of just constant battling. Also made lesser mons and attacks not always completely worthless. Just too bad it was never expanded on really to my knowledge. Pokemon should have went out its way to vastly expand on concepts outside the catching and battling but I guess that leaves no room for milking so of course it wasn&#039;t happening.<br><br>Now as for the GB/GBC era, I actually prefer this era. Especially R/B/Y games. Its just preference and nostalgia admittedly. I also though prefer the look of this era to the later gens. Some gameplay and ideas from later games inserted into these older looking games instead would be perfect to me.
