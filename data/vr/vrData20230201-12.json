I think a collection is most appreciated when it represents the tastes and spirit of the collector. That being said, its possible for you or anyone else to get into Gamecube even with the recent high prices if you set your goals correct.<br><br>For instance, you may be be totally happy building a collection just consisting of Paper mario and 5 or 10 other games you really enjoy. Set a goal to get there. If you have more disposable income it makes it easier obviously but even if not you can collect it slowly over time. Start with Paper Mario, the game is up over 100 dollars now but if you keep an eye out you can probably snag it around 80 CIB and in good shape if you&#039;re willing to hunt around a few months. Also, maybe you have some other things you could sell towards that game. Games you own but don&#039;t really care for, some old guitar that&#039;s been sitting in your closet collecting dust for 10 years, whatever. Use the Marie Kondo method to find what sparks joy to get rid of and apply the same method to the games you build into your collection.<br><br>I had the fortune to collect some Gamecube games before the price jump but still finish my collecting during 2020 and 2021. Just collect slowly and thoughtfully and it will be a rewarding experience for you.<br><br>I&#039;ve gotten into collecting for several consoles that people say its &quot;too late&quot; to collect for by this method and its been an enjoyable experience. Even after collecting those games its also been a good investment as the value has steadily risen compared to what I paid, which is cool- not that I&#039;m planning to sell anything now.

Same with the PS2 I just got a network adapter with a FMCB card and I download whatever it I want to play onto my HDD and voil\u00e0. <br><br>Of course if collecting is your thing that won&#039;t be a solution for you.

Yes, the whole series is sold on sex, but the first two games have a much more quality execution and are focused on the game. After him, the games are just cheap ogling without the backbone that held it up. I think the most telling proof is in how many women are fans of the first Xbox game.

FFVII had a great story and everyone loved the characters but there was a certain cartoonishness to it and everything was rendered purely in text on in pre-rendered cutscenes where no one spoke. Resident Evil was very cinematic but the &quot;acting&quot; was cheesy and amateurish. The Characters in MGS were the first, for a lot of people, where you felt like there was a genuine performance behind it, with actual voice acting like you&#039;d find in an animated film and not just some guy reading off a cue card. It felt like an important threshold had been crossed. It was a benchmark for quality.<br><br>And it was also a good game that didn&#039;t play like anything else. Stealth was an underutilized mechanic so a game based around it seemed fresh and unique. It had memorable bosses, tons of cool gadgets, challenging but fair difficulty...it was just mild-blowing.

For the most part, that means the moveset: You can constantly crank up the game&#039;s BPM (very much in accordance with the perfectly fitting soundtrack) and challenge yourself by timing triple jump, dives and other moves to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and platforming while still having to factor those into your timing if you don&#039;t want to mess up the rhythm. This may not apply to every level and the game has its low points, but it&#039;s precisely such low points that corroborate what I&#039;m talking about. Even the easiest levels and platforming can be a challenge and involve risk and reward and pressing your luck in an addicivetly fun way.<br><br>Of course I&#039;m by and large talking about Mario&#039;s moveset and what the levels allow you to do with it, which also includes things like doing backflips instead of standard jumps.

This has been mislabeled for decades, confusing people to no end. Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white. Realistically, you&#039;ll probably have to settle on some sort of compromise between true blacks and a bit of black crush as no display is perfect.

It&#039;s a weird mixture of management sim, real-time strategy and god game with light rpg elements. The idea is that in a Diablo or a Wizardry or any classic rpg dungeon crawler you play as a hero wandering into a dungeon that&#039;s populated with hundreds of different monsters. In Dungeon Keeper you&#039;re running the dungeon, building tunnels and different rooms in order to attract more and more vile monsters and then you have to keep them happy, train them up, mine for gold in order to keep them paid and so on. Then occasionally you&#039;ll end up tunneling into either another dungeon or you&#039;ll be invaded by a group of heroes at which point it becomes something closer to an rts.<br><br>Really great and unique. God-tier atmosphere. Good sequel that had a lot of UI and common sense improvements but the atmosphere just wasn&#039;t there in the same way. Still an okay follow-up though. In both games the AI&#039;s a bit shit but that&#039;s forgivable considering it was the late 90s. Only real problem is that there hasn&#039;t been a real, true follow-up since DK2.

Enemies are less bulky in Contra and there aren&#039;t cheap shots right out from the gate.<br><br>I also recommend the Shinobi series, Streets of Rage series, Road Rash series, and Rocket Knight Adventures.", "filename": "tumblr_m4uyoyM66i1qegdapo1_500", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1675105471770439, "time": 1675105471, "md5": "McKcX0ANV/CAoSxnZG11HA==", "fsize": 847830, "resto": 9615028}, {"no": 9616104, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)14:09:34", "name": "Ben Silvervan", "com": "<a href=\"#p9616095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9616095</a><br>megaman x on snes might more fun than the nes megaman games if you haven&#039;t played them much before", "time": 1675105774, "resto": 9615028}, {"no": 9617362, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:14:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9615028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9615028</a><br>NES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Batman</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gremlins 2 : The New Batch</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vice : Project Doom</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Friday The 13th</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Snake, Rattle &amp; Roll</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ducktales</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Splatterhouse : Wanpaku Graffiti</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadowgate</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lone Ranger</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S.C.A.T.</span><br>The last is a sidescrolling shooter, but it gives you the grace of having a pair of &quot;Options&quot; by default, which you can leave to sweep back and forth to provide an arc of covering fire, or lock in position to help with focusing certain fire.<br><br>Game Boy (Color)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wario Land (probably one of the best &#039;Mario&#039; games)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wario Land 2</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue/Yellow</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Gold/Silver/Crystal</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Legend Of Zelda : Link&#039;s Awakening</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Legend Of Zelda : Oracle Of Seasons/Ages (in case you missed these)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Metroid II : The Return Of Samus (ditto)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tetris</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kirby&#039;s Pinball Land</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Duke Nukem</span><br>Duke Nukem is a re-imagining of Duke Nukem 2, in a rather cartoony style.

Nobody came even close to answering OPs actual question. <br><br>First of all, as far as I know, 480p is never enabled by default in any game on the PS2. Including the DVD menu, for what it&#039;s worth. <br><br>But to make it even simpler, you really have two options if you want to use your PS2 on a modern flatscreen. <br>1. Just use composite cables running into the RetroTink 2X Pro. Composite cables on the PS2 do not support progressive scan, so the system will always output 480i. Every PS2 game supports 480i, and the 2x Pro will de-interlace this (essentially removing the bottom field, then doubling the top field I guess) to make it 480p for your modern television. Easy peasy. <br>2. Pony up for a 5x Pro, which is probably way more than you want to spend, but DOES support 480p pass through, as well as can handle 1080i inputs, which some PS2 games do support (though most people say these settings unilaterally look like shit, I&#039;ve never seen it myself since I use a CRT). Either way using a 5x-Pro your childhood favorite ATV Offroad Fury 2 will look as good as it possibly can running out of original hardware onto a modern TV. <br><br>This is a significantly more complicated process, but<br>3. Softmod your PS2 (basically, buy a Free McBoot memory card on ebay, google it) and get GSM running, which is a piece of homebrew software will allow you to force your PS2 into whatever settings you prefer. I don&#039;t think it really makes sense for you to do, but it can force 480i games into 480p so you could run it into a much less expensive digitizer than the 2X Pro. You&#039;d still need a way to get it going though, so probably pointless... <br><br>Either way, hope that helps.", "filename": "1631858032534", "ext": ".gif", "w": 56, "h": 56, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 56, "tim": 1675235931960742, "time": 1675235931, "md5": "O3HsKkf2QBDOnx1//J37bA==", "fsize": 124944, "resto": 9620493}, {"no": 9620887, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)02:45:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9620538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620538</a><br>there is no PS2 game that is not able to do 480i<br>but I don&#039;t think it particularly looks good on modern screens which is why a lot of people force it into 480p with a frevpdthemcboot card", "time": 1675237556, "resto": 9620493}, {"no": 9621149, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)06:12:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9620772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620772</a><br><a href=\"#p9620843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620843</a><br><a href=\"#p9620887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620887</a><br>I appreciate all the help anons, 2X should be more than sufficient for my needs", "time": 1675249947, "resto": 9620493}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9617034, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)21:04:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Literally Samus&#039; worst mission.<br><br>Why did she accept this?", "filename": "thumbnail-2-1024x1024", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675130645115775, "time": 1675130645, "md5": "pJwUK5boV3e1n1A5G6utmA==", "fsize": 160547, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "literally-samus-worst-mission", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 31, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 20}, {"no": 9617038, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)21:05:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "3ds remake is way better.", "time": 1675130727, "resto": 9617034}, {"no": 9617040, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)21:06:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;why did she accept the mission to eradicate a bioweapon used by terrorists?</span><br>gee idk, probably cause she doesn&#039;t want the universe to be threatened with a nuke or something. of course, it didn&#039;t work out too well in the long run, but hindsight 20/20 yada yada.", "time": 1675130780, "resto": 9617034}, {"no": 9617663, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)01:56:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9617034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9617034</a><br>Accept?

The story is a bit more than your usual &quot;kill evil overworld&quot; but the dialogues and cutscenes go way too fast to truly appreciate it, although the many references to ancient cultures help make it seem more mature.<br>You can run in towns, you can carry up to 16 items per character (versus the traditional 8, and you&#039;re gonna need them!), battle speed can be set to &quot;so fast you barely have time to realize wtf is going on&quot; plus you can make the loading of fights faster by holding a button. Message speed is pretty fast too, I never once felt like hitting the fast forward key. When you target a dead enemy, you will automatically attack the next enemy (though only within the same group). All of this makes grinding really fast, and are the kind of QOL the vast majority of Famicom RPGs (and even beyond) lack.<br>Tons of interesting mechanics: you have spells and skills, each with their own MP pools. Starting from chapter 2 onward you can also absorb most enemies and then summon them for use in battle, each absorbed enemy can be used once but they have infinite MP. They have to be used intelligently for healing/fighting/tanking and it&#039;s an essential mechanic in some parts of the game. Also, blocking actually matters a lot, and when you are low on health, enemies deal less damage and you are more likely to dodge attacks. So the game is challenging but forgiving at the same time (I once managed to make it back to town with 1hp left, that included surviving a fight with that 1 HP).<br><br>[cont]", "filename": "Shinsenden - The Legend of Immortals", "ext": ".png", "w": 768, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675197665360906, "time": 1675197665, "md5": "4wR29EniTPHiWDWW+JUvJA==", "fsize": 150145, "resto": 9619418}, {"no": 9619479, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)15:42:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9619475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9619475</a><br>[cont]<br><br><br>But yes the game is very challenging (did I mention that running away from battles never work?

The kinds of straight line designs consisting mostly of increasingly scripted setpieces is something which Call Of Duty would pioneer, and that series didn&#039;t even get into that formula for real until the mid/late 2000s.

As the result of nationalist and supply and demand economic policies, there was little incentive to invest on manufacturing tools and improving labour skills. Manufacturing cost was expensive compared to their competitors, so most of the British wealthy chose to invest in the service sector. Politicians like Callaghan tried to push back against this shift and make British manufacturing competitive again by taxing the service sector, limiting pay raises and such, but it was met with heavy pushback which led to what was known as &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;. Thus, Thatcher was elected, and she deregulated the market while pursuing a monetarist policy that hurt British exports. Trade unions were seen to be a scary and powerful that threatened the crumbling British industry back then, but Thatcher&#039;s policy to remove their bargaining power altogether was proved even more detrimental to the industry<br><br>TL;DR manufacturing lost, finance won. They couldn&#039;t keep up with the rapid pace of the Japanese and German industry, and those who tried to save it did a few blunders that caused a pushback.

I sadly may have deleted that version of the game, not knowing how rare that direct 3D patch was. But it was real. I was playing Carmageddon with accelerated graphics. I am not lying, BTW. I do think this ATi patch was done by the same group that did the Tomb Raider direct 3D patch from ATi, that later surfaced. Maybe I have this version on an old HDD, but I am not sure anymore. I still have stacks of old CDR&#039;s from back in the day too. One of them might have a copy. But I need to set up a disc drive. I have never seen anyone mention this D3D patch.

I thought it was a standard patch that anyone could download from fileplanet or something. And then I saw the LGR videos on the original Carmageddon, and Clint mentioned how hard it was to play the game on anything but DOS. I remember leaving a comment in the video telling him to get the Direct3D patch. Which I later tried to find myself, but couldn&#039;t come up with any results online. I do remember this patch having ATI in the filename. The original Tomb Raider was released on DOS for the PC. It had multiple hardware acceleration patches for 3DFX, Matrox, S3 Virge, PowerVR, and such.

It is a well known issue with the OG Xbox from hardware versions 1.0 through 1.5 - so almost all of them. Only 1.6 are exempt from this problem I believe. Since you meantioned the system clock not working it&#039;s pretty much guaranteed that it leaked and ceased to function. The end result of this failure is the acid corroding the circuits underneath or near where the cap is placed on the board, eventually killing the power button.

I never knew why they did that when it seemed so arbitrary, but my instincts are they created something cool, wanted it in the game, and put them in just to do it, just for visual variety and to just kinda be noticed.

Most FF fans are completely artistically illiterate and can&#039;t see any nuance. Sephiroth is shown to be cold and ruthless even when he was a &quot;hero.&quot; He was raised to be a killing machine, held up as a figurehead for Shinra&#039;s propaganda, showered with praise for slaughtering any perceived enemy, and we learn from Lucretia that he was never even held by his mother as a baby; he was whisked off by scientists to be a research specimen the moment he was born. You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see how fucked up someone would be from living a life like that. Even before the Nibelheim incident, he was, at best, a functional sociopath with a massive superiority complex, but most players completely miss all of that and take the claim that he&#039;s a hero at face value. <br><br>I&#039;d also argue that he doesn&#039;t actually give a shit about Jenova or the Ancients. Those are just post-hoc rationalizations he uses to justify his desires. When he reads in Gast&#039;s research notes that Jenova is an Ancient, he claims that entitles him to take the planet back from the humans who betrayed the Ancients. Later, when he travels through the Lifestream and learns the truth about Jenova (that she was actually just a monster that wiped out the Ancients), he twists it around and says that he&#039;s entitled to rule the planet because Jenova was even greater than the Ancients were. In other words, all he really wants is to satisfy his own ego by elevating himself up to godhood compared to the rest of the world, and he&#039;ll use whatever excuse he can come up with to justify it.", "time": 1674613383, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka is\u2026 Sephiroth</span><br>this nigga doesn\u2019t understand how numbers work", "time": 1674614692, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600392, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka\u2026 gets his plans foiled</span><br>You didn\u2019t even play the game.

Curtains Down from Blood Money is a lot more satisfying when you understand the context of the scene the target is playing out, for instance.<br><br>The opera is called Tosca, and thats the ending scene. There&#039;s at least a dozen Kojima-tier absurd plot twists that precede it, but basically the character being executed believes that its a mock execution, because the chief of police pardoned him but had to keep up appearances because he&#039;s known for being tough on crime. Usually on stage, that character acts like a chad with no fear of death, and his girlfriend is singing these joking lyrics about what a good actor he is while the music itself is really tense and clues you in that he&#039;s actually fucked and the police chief didn&#039;t actually give the order to pardon. He gets shot and dies with a look of shock on his face, and his girlfriend jumps off a cliff to avoid arrest, then curtains the end.<br><br>So in a meta sense, the two targets are actually playing the roles of the two opera characters, and 47 is actually playing the role of the executioner.

Ironically all a pirated cart of it would have to do is be too cheap to even include a SRAM chip and it would bypass it, even if you have no knowledge of patching/hacking ROMS, all you would have to do is inflate the ROM size to 4MB with blank filler and then it would work since the Genesis required games to use a more complicated save method if their ROMS were that large, and that&#039;s assuming you are not using an emulator that just simply has the option to disable SRAM saves.

There are several characters, Gau included, that are potentially way more powerful than Sabin can ever be, but the issue here is twofold: one, you have to know how to equip and build them up to get them to that bullshit OP stage, and two, it typically takes quite a bit more work. So like you said, you have to know which of Gau&#039;s Rages are the broken ones and you gotta take time off to hunt for them, which can be tedious as fuck. For another example, Terra and Celes&#039;s ultimate setup (with maxed MBlock plus the Gem Box) requires not only figuring out that maxed Mblock makes you almost invincible, but also hunting down all the necessary equips, which are scattered all over the WoR, so you likely won&#039;t achieve it until near the end of the game. Meanwhile, the only obstacle Sabin has to maxing out his potential is figuring out where Duncan is, which isn&#039;t hard at all. It&#039;s quick, it&#039;s easy, can be done super early, and then spammed relentlessly.

Its a game that needs to be looked at from a 1997 point of view. It still has a lot of 2d platformer elements to it like linearity although you can move freely. Take Mario 64 out of the equation and it looks good with big open levels. Crash was out in 97, but Croc is more open and exploration based.

They have a lot in common and Mario beats Crocs ass.<br><br>What else was out in 97? Jumping Flash is a somewhat similar game but in first person. Ninpen Manmaru on Saturn is similar in quality. A little less collection and a little more obstacle course. Chameleon Twist on N64 was similar in quality, it had some better bosses but more linear levels.

Let\u2019s say croc is better than all of thesewith JD as a question mark.<br><br>That leaves Croc as a middle tier 3d platformer at the time it was released. But this was so early and 3d platformers were so primitive that they hadn\u2019t really all gotten refined gameplay, camera and control wise. Within a few years in the late 90s many 3d platformers that I\u2019d consider better were released on the N64, PS1 and Dreamcast.

NES games run great, you can move with the joystick.<br><br>Ocarina of Time and Master Quest run very well, with the later adding some very challenging content. You can set the C buttons either to X, Y, and Z or use the directions on the C stick. I ended up using the C stick since it was easier to visualize. It was a little weird at first, but after a few hours I was a pro at flinging the stick to use items. Z targeting becomes L targeting which is just as effective. I really enjoyed playing these with the GC controller. As for the content, it has dome minor changes like the fire temple music, mirror shield, etc.<br><br>Unfortunately, what people are saying about Majora\u2019s Mask emulation is true.

OoT was a very good start on 3D combat but right now I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry and <s>Dark Souls not retro though</s>.<br><br>The prior focuses on giving the player as many combat options as possible and makes that the fun of the game. Launchers, flying attacks, guns, ways to combo enemies, parries, everything you could want to do. These games are more about being stylish than just outright winning the fight. However this limits the enemy design as these games can quickly become unfun if there&#039;s too many enemies you can&#039;t combo effectively, or if the bosses act in a way that&#039;s too limiting to your arsenal.<br><br>While the latter is the exact opposite, you have an extremely narrow set of options in combat. Block, dodge, light swing, heavy swing, shoot projectile and maybe a few more options. While this seems limiting it allows the developers to focus much more heavily on challenging enemy design based on how enemies respond and require you to use the few options in your arsenal. People generally love boss fights in these kind of games for this exact reason, every single boss is like learning a song in a rhythm game since its mostly been simplified to &quot;when do I dodge and when do I hit?&quot;.<br><br>OoT has a lot of options that lack purpose. Yes you can angle your swipes, horizontally or vertically, but what value does that have over just hitting the B button? The answer is none because enemies don&#039;t respond to things in ways that warrant you to change that. Would crouch stabbing have any value if it wasn&#039;t just objectively the best DPS in the game? I don&#039;t think so, because no enemies have a mechanic where you need to crouch to evade their attacks. Dodge mechanics are hardly even necessary because only a tiny few enemies can threaten your shield, I can&#039;t even think of any other than Darknuts.<br><br>So I think that answers your question, quality &gt; quantity.", "filename": "20245725_1390952080994962_7348464048814365511_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 658, "h": 370, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674842161091574, "time": 1674842161, "md5": "zWcQa8zfOLvO/HZ8GMt9rQ==", "fsize": 25081, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607775, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry</span><br>you are wrong<br>it&#039;s <s>the batman arkham games</s>", "time": 1674842493, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607783, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:04:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607775</a><br>i really only see other superhero games copying that but yeah that one is influential unfortunately, I don&#039;t think its as much as the 2 I said though.", "time": 1674842640, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9608043, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:54:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607519</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;second song</span><br>good job proving my point with one of the most grating instruments used.", "time": 1674849272, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609634, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br>They should increase the quality instead of reducing the quantity", "time": 1674905120, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609819, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you want peak sword combat, check out Jedi Outcast", "time": 1674913481, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609823, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>the harmonica? not my fault you got shit taste", "time": 1674913581, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610042, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>This might be the wrong board for you if you need the clearest music possible and can&#039;t appreciate retro music by merit of memorable melodies <br><br>Kakariko is THE comfy-village music", "time": 1674920798, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610047, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:47:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609819</a><br>This game is the definition of janky", "time": 1674920873, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610052, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:49:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dark Souls not retro though.</span><br>But that&#039;s influenced by Zelda in the first place and extremely basic.
