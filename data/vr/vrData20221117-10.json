But I was absolutely blown away by Leopard, it was such a quantum leap forward. Even Snow Leopard, with &quot;zero new features&quot;, impressed me because it was like Leopard but faster. A number of things have changed since then. <br><br>First, all of the older versions of Mac OS X had very long development lead times. Tiger was in development for 18 months, and Leopard was in development for over 2 years. Now, they&#039;re pumping out a new version of Mac OS every year. The Mac team doesn&#039;t really have enough time to refine the software or to fully think through the features, so we will often get a half-baked release like Yosemite which is followed up by a &quot;stable&quot; release like El Capitan. And speaking of the Mac team, the political environment inside Apple has now changed. The iPhone has eclipsed the Mac as Apple&#039;s flagship product. Anyone who wants to advance within Apple knows that they need to get on the iOS team, so all the best talent goes there. The core Mac team is comprised of the also-rans, and some of the lower performers from the iOS team are sent over to the Mac team. These people are not stupid by any means, after all they work for Apple, but they are not Apple&#039;s A-Team. Previously, Mac OS X releases were very polished because Apple had its very best and brightest working on them.

Surreal and unsettling would be a good place to start. A weird curio from a bygone era? Yep. An avant-garde art piece? Yeah, probably that too. I&#039;m hesitant to call it a good game, because it&#039;s barely a game at all, but I&#039;ll certainly say this... it&#039;s interesting.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The game is extremely linear, mostly shuffling you around from location to location with a few things in any given environment to interact with and, once you do, you&#039;ll be shuffled off to the next area. This has the effect, intended or not, of making you feel rather uncomfortable as you&#039;re given virtually no control over anything. Practically every game amounts to simply doing what the developers intended, but it&#039;s rarely as on the nose as it is here, to the point that it feels less like exerting your own will and intellect to reach a desired conclusion that was planned by the developers and more like doing what they want, regardless of what you want. The distinction is arguably superficial but, in this case, it&#039;s palpable just the same.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graphically the game is a strange mishmash of steampunk, art deco, and some kind of unidentified Eastern Bloc country aesthetic. Things frequently take a turn for the surreal, and you often travel from one location to the next in something approximating an out of body experience - you&#039;ll be looking at a monitor of something and then suddenly move through the monitor into that location, for example.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adding to the surreal and unsettling quality is a fantastic, otherworldly soundtrack by Koji Ueno. It sometimes reminded me of the work of Akira Yamaoka, with things frequently turning into walls of abstract industrial noise. If the bizarre visuals and storytelling aren&#039;t enough to make you uneasy, the music ought to do the trick.</span><br><br>https://www.zombs-lair.com/gadget-c<wbr>ollection", "filename": "2glzDFD", "ext": ".png", "w": 510, "h": 750, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668506698232772, "time": 1668506698, "md5": "ivD+zb9HhdFodwBytFKC4g==", "fsize": 662825, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gadget-is-hard-to-describe-surreal-and-unsettling", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 11, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 4, "last_replies": [{"no": 9419107, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)09:04:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9416592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9416592</a><br>This game looks fucking awesome.

Of course when we&#039;re talking about natively PAL-produced content. Shows converted from one format to the other have their own share of problems.<br>Now, for games it&#039;s NTSC hands down. Most games were produced with NTSC in mind and many PAL ports are broken (speed, aspect ratio, etc.). I have no problem with playing proper PAL conversions though. Of course with NTSC/PAL for games I mean line/refresh standards, not the color encoding.
