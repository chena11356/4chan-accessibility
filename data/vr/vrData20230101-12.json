There&#039;s also another thing in this thread that&#039;s worth pointing out too: most of the titles posted are either Sega Saturn, obscure PC-E or PS1/PS2 titles, the reason which is that the technology to actually inject and rewrite text, make sure it fits the boxes, etc. is a much more difficult task than translating the script itself wholesale.

I don&#039;t know if power is completely cut to the cartridge memory when the &quot;Reset&quot; button on the console is used, but using that instead of On/Off still led to memory being erased.<br>From further reading, the only two things I&#039;ve discovered are:<br>1) multiple people in similar situations who said they had broken pin/trace connections to the chips, so they soldered wires directly from whichever pin(s) were disconnected to the appropriate chip. I&#039;d have to spend a lot of time continuity testing and then finding a wire to put on there, which is more work than I&#039;m willing to do, or;<br>2) I also saw a post from a guy saying that he owns two N64s, and one of them wipes the game data from cartridges he uses with it. If my problem is with the N64, that&#039;s possibly another can of worms, and would very likely be the same approach/solution as above. The only other game I have to test with is Mario Kart 64, which holds its data no problem. I don&#039;t think it utilizes the same CR2032 battery-based save system / PCB model, so I&#039;m not sure if an N64-based fault would necessarily lead to data wiping on it anyway.", "time": 1672427710, "resto": 9517990}, {"no": 9530506, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)14:17:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Finished up my x station install, about to do a triple bypass on my genesis.

A flamethrower would also be nice for damage over time, a nice contrast to the BFG where you have to be looking at the enemy to damage them.

There needs to be a classification centered around tech, because it (very directly) affects the gamut of possible aesthetics and mechanics, and if I might add: I also believe the terminology needs to be different. &quot;Gen&quot; is already meant to be used in a chronological sense.

The PS1 was sold at a similar loss to the Saturn when it launched in 1994 in Japan. This has been revealed by recent interviews from employees involved in both companies. PS1 cost about 50,000 Yen per unit to produce, Saturn cost about 54,800 Yen. Yes Saturn is more, but it&#039;s not $100 more. Both systems were sold at a $100 loss as well. The biggest cost issue in both systems wasn&#039;t the number of chips, it was the RAM. RAM prices were stupid high during this time and fell dramatically in the next 3 years. What was over $200 worth of RAM in both systems dropped to under $5 worth of RAM in the span of 2-3 years.<br><br>People love to point to $399 vs $299 but forget to look at the difference in launch dates.

Gouraud Shading doesn&#039;t really have much of a performance hit on VDP1. If you want to know how that figure is actually determined it basically boils down to this. <br><br>- A non textured pixel takes about 1 clock cycle to draw. <br>- A textured pixel takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A textured and gouraud shaded pixel still takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A half transparent pixel takes about 6 cycles to draw. <br><br>So compared to untextured pixels it&#039;s 6 times longer to draw, compared to textured it&#039;s 3 times longer to draw. So this is where your up to 6 times longer comes from. So with those values we can say that the max theoretical fillrate of VDP1 is 26-28 Million pixels per second depending on what resolution mode the Saturn is in and if you&#039;re drawing all untextured pixels. This is probably how the theoretical value listed earlier was determined. For Textured and Gouraud shaded pixels it&#039;s about 13-14 Million pixels per second. For half transparent pixels, it&#039;s about 4-5 Million pixels per second. <br><br>That&#039;s still a pretty significance performance hit for half transparencies. Throw in that they don&#039;t work correctly all the time and it&#039;s easy to see why most devs went with meshes. <br><br>That all said, if you&#039;re not doing half transparencies VDP1&#039;s fillrate is still more than enough for most games. At 320x240 resolution at 30fps you have enough fillrate to draw the entire frame buffer about 6 times per frame. So if you&#039;re sorting and culling polygons properly and not trying to draw everything as half transparent, you really shouldn&#039;t be hitting the fillrate limit.", "time": 1672264899, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9525165, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523969</a><br>Held back only by the small cartridge space.

Most casuals don&#039;t want to have the headaches of worrying about things like accuracy or input timing and are quick to dismiss any discrepancies they think are irrelevant, they just need the game to run and that&#039;s it. Software emulation and MiSTer may be visually difficult to distinguish under several circumstances to the average person such as color output or ability to render the game in sync with everything else. The line can be tough to draw for most on which is better because the FPGA-based emulators have quickly caught up and even exceeded it&#039;s cycle accurate software counterparts in many technical areas. For any applicable cores, MiSTer has more accurate sound (certified against MDfourier). Most importantly, no core has input delay that isn&#039;t native to the original game or hardware, something all software emulators still haven&#039;t nailed down without the use of run-ahead (banned on speedrun). Input delay is always a subject easily dismissed by the typical casual because you&#039;re not practicing a game enough to begin to care about getting optimal input timings in, you just need to play your game and that&#039;s it.

People have definitely been burned by the lies these devices were sold upon. Also, the popularization of the Raspberry Pi and the RetroPie project have really marred the image of dedicated emulation devices specially because they are low powered devices which underperform against most other emulation solutions. MiSTer is a project being developed on the DE-10 Nano which is another low powered device. The main difference is that it is FPGA which means [in laymen&#039;s terms] it is more flexible when it comes to running closer to the real hardware it is imitating since the core [emulator if you wanna call it that] is actually attempting to run at the real clock speed of the target hardware. A lot of people are understandably skeptical, others have already settled for other solutions [besides hardware] and prefer to not research yet another way to play due to caution of finding out it&#039;s not worth it afterall.

It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow\u2014must play for everyone. If you pick just 1 game, make it this one.<br>2. Rhythm Tengoku\u2014best rhythm game I&#039;ve played. Play if you like quirky games like Wario Ware and rhythm games.<br>3. Advance Wars\u2014personally not a fan, but those who liked it spent hundreds of hours in it. Very addictive strategy game.<br>4. WarioWare\u2014quirky and addictive, one of the more original games for GBA. If you&#039;ve never tried it, do. If you did, still fun to see where it all started from.<br>5. Metroid Fusion\u2014it&#039;s 2D Metroid, enough said. It&#039;s great despite some say it&#039;s not Super Metroid.<br>6. Mother 3\u2014not a perfect RPG, but one many people want to play now. Play if you like Earthbound or want an RPG with plot.<br>7. Wario Land 4\u2014some praise this is as pinnacle of GBA or even best platformer ever, others will write it off as good but ultimately weaker than the GBC ones. Regardless, well worth a try.<br>8. Mario &amp; Luigi\u2014actually very good RPG, only brought down by bing bang wahoo style and kinda whatever graphics.<br>9. Kirbies in general\u2014always fun and worth a play. Play if you like Kirby, don&#039;t play if you&#039;re sick of platformers.<br>10. Mega Man Zero 3 &amp; 4\u2014decent games, but got pretty overrated recently as some &quot;official canon classics&quot;. I beat them all, they&#039;re fun and good but not really masterpieces.
