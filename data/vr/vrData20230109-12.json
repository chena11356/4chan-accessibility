It also has a pretty nice DSP in it for doing echo, reverb, 3D sound, etc. <br><br>The Dreamcast kind of takes that chip, removes all the FM Synth features and instead adds ADPCM compression support and increases the channels to 64.

Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

Even coming from great SNES RPGs like FF6 and Chrono Trigger, the music quality LEAP I heard in S1 impacted me greatly. Truly a generational jump that I felt and heard in my late teenage years. That jump from 16bit to 32bit was prominent with Suikoden. From the opening cinematic, to starting in Gregminster Palace, to the battle music, to the sound effects - I just cannot emphasize how much the sound in this game impacted me. To this day, when I think of Suikoden (outside of just playing it, again.. for the 20th time or mode...), I hear sound effects or music in my thoughts.<br>The Soul Eater spell &quot;Hell&quot; is my favorite, most remembered spell sound effect. When I think PS1 or think S1, I hear this sound in my mind. And yes, it&#039;s basically a down-pitched Black Shadow. Also the same sound they used in other spells, like Fire Rune&#039;s &quot;Explosion&quot;. I love this sound. Love how when I remember the sound I can picture the spell&#039;s visual effect in my mind. Reminds me of Luminaire from CT, and Ultima from FF6.<br>cont.", "filename": "mainv_pc_en-us", "ext": ".png", "w": 980, "h": 1045, "tn_w": 234, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673215712557849, "time": 1673215712, "md5": "6BhuAlhVZ6ZPHDLDQLqmGg==", "fsize": 318749, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-know-this-is-probably-gonna-end-up-just-me", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 11, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 9554083, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)17:08:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9554081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9554081</a><br>So when I heard there was gameplay footage out there for S1 and it had some battle/Rune gameplay in it, I sought it out solely hoping the footage featured the Soul Eater. I found this link, and at 0:15 I was immediately let down. Not only can I barely hear the sound effect for it, that iconic rising/building sound from the OG S1 isn&#039;t there at all. Most of the other Rune spells sound just like OG S1, if not very close homages. But Black Shadow sounds so dull. Wet fart kinda dull. No impact kinda dull. There&#039;s no building or rising anymore to match the visual. And whatever sound effect they ARE using is dull, on its own and in comparison to the OG.<br>Again, very much anticipating. Can&#039;t wait, will buy. I&#039;m just a S1 fanatic who focuses on little details that don&#039;t matter in the big picture, nor to the masses. But this one little thing upsets ME greatly.

You have to roll to wide jump, which is less visceral and chancier in tight spots than Mario&#039;s quick duck, while it&#039;s too easy to accidentally roll when you actually want to crouch for a high jump because the stick has to be 100% neutral, which doesn&#039;t have a good flow, and it generally lacks Mario&#039;s rhythm and risk and reward. Of course you can&#039;t copy Mario 1:1, but devs always fail to copy and likely even understand the thing that makes 3D Marios fun (and the only 3D platformer that still matters today), which is exactly rhythm and risk and reward. Even the easiest platorms in Mario can be a challenge if you want to do things like backflips instead of standard jumps, but it always feels rewarding. You can constantly challenge yourself with timing triple jumps and dives to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and pits while still having to factor those into your timing if you want to go fast while also having the advantage of higher/longer jumps. The closest to that Jak has is spamming rolls and wide jumps, which is more like the rolling in Zelda, doesn&#039;t really give you an advantage outside of going faster and doesn&#039;t require any skill or timing, besides being impossible or needlessly risky to use in tight spots due to its clunkiness.<br><br>There are some interesting moves and occasional fun platforming, but it&#039;s few and far between and it (but especially its sequels) bogs itself down with boring vehicle segments or extremely shallow combat, like already in the first few minutes of 3 where you have to kill 20 goons with the simplest combo string to be allowed to progress", "filename": "Owless", "ext": ".gif", "w": 320, "h": 180, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673233732759643, "time": 1673233732, "md5": "FZeWte8HwEq/eDg75zJbiQ==", "fsize": 3156953, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9554872, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:17:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9554850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9554850</a><br>autism", "time": 1673234234, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9554974, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:50:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9553591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553591</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;widely seen as an equal or better than the first</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;widely seen</span><br>The only people I&#039;ve ever heard say any game other than the first one is the best were contrarians on here.<br><a href=\"#p9553623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553623</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;copied Mario&#039;s moveset but somehow made it clunkier</span><br>To me it felt more like Crash but in an actual 3D game.", "time": 1673236210, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9554995, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:58:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9553591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553591</a><br>the only good parts are the levels outside the open world, the rest is dog shit, this happens way too often in open world games.", "time": 1673236717, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9555001, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:59:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9553603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553603</a><br>No one thought that about the gameplay when it came out.

The difficulty is unforgiving as they basically never give you HP in the last half of the game and expect you to simply die and try again. The ammo not refilling on death is annoying. The final boss is very disappointing. The plot is fun but even as a kid I felt like the ending just comes out of nowhere and all of a sudden the game is over.

Because the Oracle games have key details that don&#039;t line up with other games like how the Master Sword is found, it was believed to take place at the very end of the timeline. By finally destroying Twinrova in a linked game, the cycle is severed.

Recreating his father\u2019s commercial venture under the name Koey in July 1978, the Erikawa struggled in a context where more and more textile was being produced and imported from outside of Japan. In October 1980, Keiko gifted Yoichi a MZ-80C computer, an expensive present. The computer fascinated Yoichi, who immediately learned BASIC and Assembler, and then wrote software : a first one to help him manage the business\u2019 inventory, another for their finances. In truth, the limited complexity of their operations did not require any computer but eh \u2013 it was fun to code. Still, the software attracted some interest from larger companies, and soon Koey was selling business software. Seeing the potential of the booming personal computer market, Yoichi also started a computer shop in addition to his initial venture as a chemical wholesaler. With the little personal time he had left, Yoichi Erikawa started \u2013 as a hobby really \u2013 to code a small wargame on his computer, something simple given the limitation of the MZ-80C and of his own skill as a coder : Kawanakajima no Kassen, Keiko handling the art on the box and in the manual.

I am STILL stuck on smb2 nes after playing it casually for a year and I save state every world. I save stated at the beginning of each level on smb1, the all star version is smb 1 every world, and smb2 every level, which makes more sense given the difficulty, and I think that&#039;s probably a better way to learn to platform anyways. I recommend Kirby&#039;s adventure too, it gets harder at the end and has fun things to find/figure out and I felt better at Mario after playing it, though I&#039;m a brainlet.

Sonic might be a little bit more of a platformer, but in the sense of actually having to calculate and time jumps to avoid enemies or traps, they&#039;re not in the same league as other platformers.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

Insider Jeff Grubb (via Games Radar) confirmed the report and added it will &quot;almost certainly&quot; be free-to-play with Runner customization being the main source of microtransactions. He described the game&#039;s style as &quot;vibrant&quot; but &quot;brutalist,&quot; with a &quot;boxy&quot; sci-fi aesthetic.

I hate this comparison being thrown around, but in many ways Ecco is like Demon&#039;s Souls was compared to other contemporary games. <br><br>From an objective standpoint there are many harder retro games, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania 3, Super Ghouls n Ghosts, Battletoads, 1ccing Gradius etc (all of which get regular threads here by people declaring that the difficulty is overstated) are all much harder than anything Ecco throws at you, even the last levels. Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed. You can call it tedious, but it was never meant to be a bing bing wahoo rush to the finish type game. Unreliable just makes no sense, if you want to permakill an enemy, you can. It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere. Along with that love is the understanding it doesn&#039;t appeal to everyone, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing.

I had a good enough time, though I found it pretty easy once you got Second Chance. Then I played KH2 which I had never played. I dropped 2. I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too. I ended up dropping 2 because the combat just wasn&#039;t very interesting to me and the amount of cutscenes was just frustrating with how often it took control away from you. And that Roxas intro was so dull.<br><br>Overall, I think KH1 was the better game, even though it had its annoyances; I found that I probably didn&#039;t finish the game as a retarded child because I kept thinking &quot;where the fuck do I go&quot; and it&#039;d be things like climbable vines that didn&#039;t stand out well enough against a tree and things like that.", "time": 1672255749, "resto": 9524382}, {"no": 9524851, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:35:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9524836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9524836</a><br>It&#039;s because KH1 at least somewhat feels like an action RPG.

The actual Arwing stages are lame and poorly paced, with the ugliest ship design in the series and terrible sound effects (the laser shots sound like splashing water).

There is a fine line between corney (but fun) and cringey and this game crossed it.

Actually Bulk Slash was a similar game and did this 3D target finding and detroy thing much better nearly a decade earlier. Jet Force Gemini did something similar and much better as well.

Maybe Capcom wasn&#039;t really too hot on the notion of near-arcade perfect ports of their arcade games in 1996-98. They were still in the arcade business and arcade operators would be pretty annoyed by Capcom releasing something that would take away from their earnings. The ports of SFZ3 and XMVSF require an expensive RAM cart and were probably considered halo products and gifts for long time fans as the CPS2 was nearing the end of its lifespan.

Really blew me away how good that game was. <br><br>Baldur&#039;s Gate II - Most engrossing D&amp;D CRPG I ever sunk a major amount of time into. I&#039;m pretty sure this game is responsible for my sizable D&amp;D collection between the pewter figures and First through 3.5 edition books, and the paperback novels. <br><br>FF7 - First JRPG I was ever able to enjoy and it let me try and enjoy other JRPGs. It was a shared gaming experience where everyone was playing it at the same time and exchanging stories and tips with one another about the game. <br><br>Morrowind - I still have my giant display box that I picked up from EB. Giant time sink of a game that was just so easy to fall in love with. The enchantment / magic system was so much more open ended. The world was less restrictive than the sequels.", "time": 1673164071, "resto": 9552478}, {"no": 9552643, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:50:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9552602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9552602</a><br>Streets of Rage was great.<br>MGS1 is my favorite.

The music is a downgrade though, with no Simpsons themes. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64o<wbr>FzeYYRrc", "filename": "s-l500 (4)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673091583155851, "time": 1673091583, "md5": "f5/vsnDxpO0p5+nX3ZH6hg==", "fsize": 55094, "resto": 9549219}, {"no": 9550194, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:42:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9550190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9550190</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bart&#039;s sprite looked good for 8-bit.

They managed to get a few extra colours in Bart&#039;s sprite, and it doesn&#039;t look bad on the NES. They didn&#039;t use a black outline, so he kinda looks like an animation cell without the outlines. To be honest, not a bad likeness. Acclaim created this off company called Flying Edge, which was a publisher for Sega (Genesis/ MD/ GG/ SMS) games, as Nintendo had some contract shit going on. Acclaim made it pretty clear that they owned Flying Edge. They ported Bart vs The Space Mutants to the Genesis/ MD, and did give the game a 16bit update. It does look better, but still not amazing. This port was used as the basis for the 8bit Sega versions. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk9<wbr>bw5_wAuo", "time": 1673100870, "resto": 9549219}, {"no": 9550412, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)09:29:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "To be honest, I can&#039;t think of a single Simpsons retro game that I legitimately liked, outside of the Konami beat em up.
