We have to go back</span><br><br>It amazes me that there was a time in history where making a $250,000 arcade game (with a real Mazda sports car) was actually profitable for a company. There were actually businesses that bought these huge Ridge Racer arcade machines. And Namco made big money.<br><br>Today, you can barely get people to leave their house let alone go to an arcade. But back then? Arcades were filled to the brim with people. It was so popular that Sega and Namco&#039;s arcade factories could NOT keep up with demand. <br><br>Here&#039;s another thing you may not know. Arcade games were so in-demand and so valued that even the mob and organized crime bought expensive arcade machines (instead of land) to hide their money from the government. <br><br>What the mob would do is buy the most expensive machines they could get their hands on like a Sega R360, some premium driving game, or whatever. Then take these machines and store them in a barn or some other building in the middle of nowhere. Only a few trusted people would know where they were stored. Then they wait several months to a year, and then resell their machines to get their money back. <br><br>That&#039;s why you hear all these stories about people finding arcades in &quot;random barns&quot; 20 years later in the countryside in the middle of nowhere. Where no arcades ever existed or were ever close by. Many of these are NOT random finds. They were put there for a reason until organized crime could reclaim them. <br><br>Sometimes the mob would get taken down and the arcade machines would get forgotten about in the confusion. <br><br>Also the arcade market crashed hard in the late 1990s/early 2000s. So it wasn&#039;t even worth the effort to retrieve the arcade machines sitting in barns anymore. A single machine previously worth $10,000 dollars is now worth almost nothing. Arcade owners were literally throwing their arcade cabs into dumpsters. Arcades were shutting down across the West.", "filename": "5eb9a1138762167e4cb1625e0b852265.gif_mw680", "ext": ".gif", "w": 320, "h": 240, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1668822254264935, "time": 1668822254, "md5": "XrmhE4diFn5MsWJeC4UiZQ==", "fsize": 2581519, "resto": 9414251}, {"no": 9426235, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:50:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9414251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9414251</a><br>jurrasic park lost world. this is my white whale of arcade games to buy for my house", "time": 1668822658, "resto": 9414251}], "last_modified": 1668822658}, {"no": 9409603, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)14:48:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The ending isn&#039;t a happy ending.", "filename": "FFVII", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1440, "h": 810, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668282494396534, "time": 1668282494, "md5": "ZATmayUNs3o1xgeZabuc/A==", "fsize": 284853, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-ending-isnt-a-happy-ending", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 118, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 113, "omitted_images": 11, "last_replies": [{"no": 9425989, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)18:44:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9425906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9425906</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Made in China</span>", "time": 1668815044, "resto": 9409603}, {"no": 9426117, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)19:38:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9425989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9425989</a><br>It ain\u2019t a bootleg.", "time": 1668818327, "resto": 9409603}, {"no": 9426132, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)19:48:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9425906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9425906</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chinese Engrish toy box is a reliable source</span><br>Lol.

The superior 90s handheld that deserves far more credit than it receives <br><br>With a library matching the Dreamcast in number and variety, it\u2019s 200 games cover genres that portable gaming frankly sucked at beforehand. <br><br>Here you\u2019ll find some of the best strategy RPGs and fighters handhelds ever had to offer in 99.<br><br>Backed by the powerhouse that was square, the console got a lot of big name titles from the developer. Final fantasies, mystery dungeons, and a fucking clock tower- the selection of quality RPGs on the console kicks the shit out of what the gameboy color and NGPC was offering that same year.<br><br>Being the first handheld with a widescreen, it made real nice for fighting games and vertical puzzlers.<br><br>From pocket fighter to guilty gear, to digimon and one piece, the system has a healthy selection of fun brawlers that play very well on the small screen.<br><br>On the note of one piece, the console was notable for its anime tie ins. Bandai was a licensing powerhouse after all.<br><br>The system was quite capable too! Handily shitting all over the cpus of the gameboy and neo geo pocket- this was the only system of the 3 that could run a full ass web browser.<br><br>Nearly the entire library runs at 75 fps. Why? Idk but it\u2019s quite nice. Games are smooth with lots of animation and fast clean scrolling. Hundreds of sprites dotting the screen without hiccup. <br>The system is no slouch in audio hardware either. Having a capable synth setup, AND cool ass sample capabilities- it has a sound that when used to full potential reminds me of some neo geo titles.<br><br>Despite the device being a properly capable 16 bit handheld for the time, the thing SIPS power. A single AA battery will keep the thing in active gameplay for well over 40 hours. That\u2019s not 40 hours standby- that\u2019s 40 hours of straight gameplay. On ONE battery.

Surreal and unsettling would be a good place to start. A weird curio from a bygone era? Yep. An avant-garde art piece? Yeah, probably that too. I&#039;m hesitant to call it a good game, because it&#039;s barely a game at all, but I&#039;ll certainly say this... it&#039;s interesting.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The game is extremely linear, mostly shuffling you around from location to location with a few things in any given environment to interact with and, once you do, you&#039;ll be shuffled off to the next area. This has the effect, intended or not, of making you feel rather uncomfortable as you&#039;re given virtually no control over anything. Practically every game amounts to simply doing what the developers intended, but it&#039;s rarely as on the nose as it is here, to the point that it feels less like exerting your own will and intellect to reach a desired conclusion that was planned by the developers and more like doing what they want, regardless of what you want. The distinction is arguably superficial but, in this case, it&#039;s palpable just the same.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graphically the game is a strange mishmash of steampunk, art deco, and some kind of unidentified Eastern Bloc country aesthetic. Things frequently take a turn for the surreal, and you often travel from one location to the next in something approximating an out of body experience - you&#039;ll be looking at a monitor of something and then suddenly move through the monitor into that location, for example.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adding to the surreal and unsettling quality is a fantastic, otherworldly soundtrack by Koji Ueno. It sometimes reminded me of the work of Akira Yamaoka, with things frequently turning into walls of abstract industrial noise. If the bizarre visuals and storytelling aren&#039;t enough to make you uneasy, the music ought to do the trick.</span><br><br>https://www.zombs-lair.com/gadget-c<wbr>ollection", "filename": "2glzDFD", "ext": ".png", "w": 510, "h": 750, "tn_w": 170, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668506698232772, "time": 1668506698, "md5": "ivD+zb9HhdFodwBytFKC4g==", "fsize": 662825, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gadget-is-hard-to-describe-surreal-and-unsettling", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 14, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 9, "omitted_images": 4, "last_replies": [{"no": 9421574, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:30:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sadly the interaction is really poor.
