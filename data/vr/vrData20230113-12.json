Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

This all-you-can-play model will take the edge off how they don&#039;t actually *own* anything in that library, whose contents are subject to change without notice.<br><br>There will be nothing for us to back up, unpatch, crack, pirate, or preserve, because all the code and assets will be out of reach on some corporate cloud server. You will have no recourse when they change a game, retire it, or revoke your access for whatever reason.<br><br>No matter how digitally locked down they are, movies, music, and ebooks can at least be recorded through the analog hole (i.e. filming the screen), but games will be at the absolute mercy of rightsholders.<br><br>t.

Compare this with CPS2 games that have more big and unique, sometimes animates objects in their backgrounds.<br>Next, the chatacters animations. MK Trilogy sprites are very thin and don&#039;t have much unique animations. SF Alpha games are kind of simple too but Darkstalkers and Marvel vs games have more elaborate attack animations that take a large chunk of screen (and VRAM). MK Trilogy being this lightweight on animations is pretty much confirmed by the PS1 version: it easily holds 4 unique characters for 2 on 2 combat in PS1 RAM - when one character is defeated the game doesn&#039;t stop to load the second one from the disc. No Capcom game manages to have four complete and unique characters in a single fight on PS1 because they take much more memory than Mortal Kombat ones.<br>N64 has more RAM and doesn&#039;t have to deal with loading from the disk at all, so it allows SIX unique characters in 3 on 3 combat. Great, right? But here&#039;s the deal: the animation quality is worse than in PS1 version. So while there are six characters in N64 RAM, even having only two of them on screen, N64 can&#039;t animate them as fast as PS1 version. This is barely a cart size issue - adding a couple of frames to each character standing idle animation would make them look a whole lot smoother and this takes a very little space of ROM. MKT ROM has a enough of padding (aka unused space) for this. Even without using the unused space they could just remove that fancy MK logo in flames title screen and shitty looking MK1 stages and add better animation instead.

The sprites themselves are very nicely and smoothly animated but they are very small in size. And finally, the game doesn&#039;t run at 60 fps.

Inventory is counted in weight and not slot, you can drop items anywhere and pick them up again, items can be thrown to damage enemies, most of the weapons are melee weapons and the guns only have about 30 bullets to be found in the entire game, shotgun shells get wet when exposed to water, and melee combat has 4 different moves that determine reach, speed, and blocking.

It turned into a janky mess once most people moved on to Battlefield 2 or Battlefield Vietnam. All the players left behind figured out the most efficient way to play was to either bomb people from so far up they can&#039;t be hit by AA fire, to nail people with tank fire like an artillery cannon, or to dump grenades near them. Since then, every map with planes will be the players who reached the aircraft first dominating everyone on the ground, all maps with tanks are determined by which side has more tank spawns, and maps without vehicles or jeep-only are grenade and explosive pack battles. If you find that fun, the game is still playable, otherwise it&#039;s been dead for a really long time.<br>I played the shit out of the game when it first came out, and I&#039;ve played it a bit off and on the last couple of years. I get more enjoyment out of playing singleplayer with the bots than I do playing online with the sweaty try-hards all using the same maximum efficiency play-style that are the only people left playing anymore. If I can&#039;t have fun and get involved in crazy battles and jeep races, then I might as well just play against the AI. The AI is far from a great experience, and certainly nowhere near as dynamic as the servers used to be, but at least it doesn&#039;t insta-kill you from outside of your visible range.

Due to inaccurate timings, almost all N64 emulators run the game too well with fewer framerate drops, which on paper and for the purposes of regular intended gameplay is a good thing, but it means you don&#039;t get the movement boosts you&#039;d normally get when the game lags.

At Nintendo&#039;s showing of it&#039;s new &quot;gamecube&quot; they showed a non-interactive demo of what it can do. Samus Aran made an appearance in this demo. It&#039;s finally what we&#039;ve all been waiting for! A new Metroid! From the screenshots I have seen this is what I can tell. It&#039;s 3d first of all, second of all you can see one of the classic metroid doors in d3 in the back. And there is a horde of little monster things chasing Samus. I hope this game is good. It is kind of hard to imaging turning metroid into a 3d game without changing the game in some drastic and horrible way. What I don&#039;t understand is why everyone has to make a 3d game these days? Why can&#039;t they just use the tremendous power to make a 2d game with 3d sprites and backgrounds, but have the game be incredebly enourmous. They could easily make a game like Super Metroid, add the usual sequel story, new planet (of course), and about 20 times the size. Also hordes of new guys, weapons, and secrets, and all that good stuff. You don&#039;t have to make it a 3d game, but if you want you should have pre-rendered 3d backgrounds and 3d sprites, but keep the camera so it is still the same as all the other metroids. Can you imagine how hard it would be to wall, bomb, or space jump in 3d?

One character class (Onion Knight), which kinda sucked anyway and was a major pain in the ass to master.<br>3. The updated translation, it sticks to the straight to the point, no bullshit script of the PSX release as opposed to going all Shakespearean on your ass. Some people will love it, others will hate it - there&#039;s two crowds of FFT fans, plenty of arguments have been made for both translations over the years.<br><br>So that&#039;s what you&#039;d miss out on. But holy fuck do you get so much more, with Continue+ and NG+ options, three additional endgame characters you can recruit (demons) after you&#039;ve finished the game for the first time, additional skills, being able to change the difficulty, stat resetting option once you&#039;ve reached level 99 with a character (won&#039;t take long, trust) and would like to improve your builds, fuckloads of quality of life little patches etc. Can&#039;t go back to the vanilla FFT after this, PSX or PSP, this mod rocks", "time": 1673166894, "resto": 9551446}, {"no": 9552690, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:37:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9551524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9551524</a><br>PS1 version modded with the extra stuff the PSP version added is the best of both worlds.
