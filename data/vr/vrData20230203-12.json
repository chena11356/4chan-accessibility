This has been mislabeled for decades, confusing people to no end. Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white. Realistically, you&#039;ll probably have to settle on some sort of compromise between true blacks and a bit of black crush as no display is perfect.

No more licensed music for an enjoyable soundtrack of stupid but fitting pop music, hiding the volleyball and friendship development behind forced horny segments, it&#039;s just not the same. I think once Itagaki was gone they just gave in, he was probably the only person stubborn enough to insist on making a gravure that you could play or watch; The games after him are overwhelmingly focused on sex at the cost of the rest. Yes, the whole series is sold on sex, but the first two games have a much more quality execution and are focused on the game. After him, the games are just cheap ogling without the backbone that held it up. I think the most telling proof is in how many women are fans of the first Xbox game. They didn&#039;t come for the tits (necessarily...) but for the volleyball and friend making. That was a game that knew how to cater to more than just desperate men.

Eventually the Japanese game came out, and IIRC I even downloaded a ROM for it and tried playing it, but obviously didn&#039;t get far. By the time the actual game came out here, I think I was already turning off of Pokemon and was getting hardcore into Zelda and FF instead. I did replay Gen 1 a couple of times during that time frame, though, so maybe I just turned into a stuffy Genwunner in record time, I dunno. Whatever the case, It took like a decade before I touched another Pokemon game, namely Emerald, Lead Green and Platinum. I did get Soul Silver, but I think having played the previous three nigh back-to-back burned me out, with the last straw being me forgetting to save and turning it off after hours of progress (I was tired and possibly drunk lol).

When I revisited it cca 10 years ago I found it to be a very interesting adventure game but I hated how easy it was to get the wrong ending.

Its more of an experience than a straight up video game. 9/10<br><br>I also played 2 around the same time about 10 years ago or so and getting the In Water ending on the first run made quite an impression. I liked the game a lot and its atmosphere appealed to me more than the occult stuff from 1. Mechanically it&#039;s more of the same. One of the best games ever made.<br><br>3 I didn&#039;t like much at all. Already on the first run it felt very short and I didn&#039;t appreciate how action heavy it was. Protagonist did nothing for me and some of the segments (haunted house) felt very cheesy. Probably the least favorite in the series.<br><br>4 has arguably the best premise, setup and jumpscare in the series but the execution is absolute dogshit. Worth playing once but I&#039;m never replaying it in this life.<br><br>Homecoming - better than expected. It has a suprisingly good atmosphere and its an okay enough horror game - especially if you consider what the genre became later on.

For the most part, that means the moveset: You can constantly crank up the game&#039;s BPM (very much in accordance with the perfectly fitting soundtrack) and challenge yourself by timing triple jump, dives and other moves to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and platforming while still having to factor those into your timing if you don&#039;t want to mess up the rhythm. This may not apply to every level and the game has its low points, but it&#039;s precisely such low points that corroborate what I&#039;m talking about.

Manufacturing cost was expensive compared to their competitors, so most of the British wealthy chose to invest in the service sector. Politicians like Callaghan tried to push back against this shift and make British manufacturing competitive again by taxing the service sector, limiting pay raises and such, but it was met with heavy pushback which led to what was known as &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;. Thus, Thatcher was elected, and she deregulated the market while pursuing a monetarist policy that hurt British exports.

With the third game, the situation in the city is untenable and those who survived have to flee before the place gets bombed flat to contain the outbreak.<br>The fourth game goes onto its own story, which has some separation from the earlier titles, but there&#039;s a running plot thread from the previous ones which ties into it, and it&#039;s very obviously meant to set up some sort of conclusion for a future entry.<br><br>Resident Evil is, overall, not that well written, not that deep, and it&#039;s clear that there&#039;s barely an idea for where the overarching story was heading. However, the story actually does progress, the first three games are about making your escape, essentially, but throughout this it&#039;s also about trying to find some answers and some evidence regarding the Umbrella Corporation, which are responsible, and this ends up being concluded in the fifth game. VERY poorly, even by the standards of a series which wasn&#039;t well written and which was fumbling in the dark for an overarching plot, but nonetheless there was one and it was building towards something.<br><br>Zelda doesn&#039;t.

I can go back to even Special Stage 7 in it now and just knowing that this is the way things are done. You can call this autism, but this is something you have to deal with in almost any old platformer. There&#039;s a boss in Mega Man 6 where you&#039;ll likely never do him without taking damage without knowing that there&#039;s a safespot you can just stand on, and Mega Man is also aimed at kids and is usually really easy. Sonic Advance already has Special Stages hidden only for the players that go out of their way to find them and just like almost any Sonic game before, Special Stages rely on you memorizing the layout and understanding how they work to beat them, as otherwise you will be just slamming your head at them and lose. That&#039;s not to mention that things like halfpipes have problems like them being designed for two players (the ring lines are doubled but you can only get one of them if you&#039;re playing alone) and yet the Tails&#039; AI doesn&#039;t just fail to help with that, he can get in front of you and crash into bombs, and as far as I know, there is no consistent way to avoid this without disabling Tails entirely as I ran into this problem many times. This is what I mean by inconsistent: you know what to do in those halfpipes, but Tails can just get in front of you anyway and you just have to deal with it. In Advance 1, you go out of your way to get to the special springs, which are always located in the same location, and if you play those special stages the exact same way each time, you will always succeed. To me, that is enough for good design. I don&#039;t care about debating whether this is autism or not, it works, has always worked and will continue to work and that&#039;s all.

Also, it feels like it was influencial to the genre, as many small things this game did would find their way to other (better) RPGs: the AI partners can be found in Musashi no Bouken and SD Keiji - Blader, the humour (including a 4th wall breaking joke mentionning the console itself) in Ninjara Hoi!, the way the teleport spells involves an animation showing the character go around the world map physicall in Jubei Quest (and Ninjara Hoi! too iirc), and there is also progression being alted by a fat sleeping monster blocking the road, that you have to find a way to wake up (Pok\u00e9mon).", "filename": "Momotaru Densetsu (The Legend of Peach Boy)", "ext": ".png", "w": 768, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675197061241802, "time": 1675197061, "md5": "EqnBU/Qgb2TDkmAzcxblQw==", "fsize": 108939, "resto": 9619418}, {"no": 9619462, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)15:33:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;SD Gundam Story Knight Gundam Legend</span><br><br>Very obvious DQ clone, everything in the system and menus is identical to DQ2/3.

They have to be used intelligently for healing/fighting/tanking and it&#039;s an essential mechanic in some parts of the game. Also, blocking actually matters a lot, and when you are low on health, enemies deal less damage and you are more likely to dodge attacks.

You see, if you swapped Teddy ane Roid around, their names would be more fitting. Teddy gives the image of someone as soft and cudley as a teddy bear. Roid gives you the idea that this person has roid rage. But clearly, in the game, it is Teddy that is the steroid abuser and Roid that is the soft one. This creates a scene in which the two are diametrically at odds with each other. Indeed, one cannot have both Roid and Teddy in the party, because Teddy will dismiss Roid as a &quot;weakling&quot;.This stirs up a sense of rage within our dear boy. While he does not literally succumb to roid rage from what we see, he nonetheless is rageful enough to plant a robot that isn&#039;t there when Teddy isn&#039;t in the party, steal a combat tank, and feign the party&#039;s rescue as he obliterates Teddy.

The truth is that the mountain monster who slayed Teddy&#039;s patents was unsuspectedly under his nose the whole time: Roid. It was Roid&#039;s robot that also did in Teddy&#039;s parents.

No one can define it</span><br>Then let me give you an idea. Most ideas of &quot;minimum wage&quot; are based on trying to keep up with the rate of inflation relative to the arguably arbitrary number that MW started at many decades ago.<br><br>To be &quot;fair&quot;, it should be tied not to inflation, but to the GDP and the national prosperity<br>as a whole.

If we did that the number would go way way up. The per capita income of the US is about $62,000/yr. But since only half those people are in the workforce (many are children, etc.), we double that, to get $124,000. With 2080 hours in a work year, that comes out to about $60/hr. If everyone were paid the same, that is what you might make. This doesn&#039;t take into account the open secret that the majority of the wealth of the 1% is hidden and squirreled away in offshore accounts and shell corporations.<br><br>If you don&#039;t want to tie it to the GDP of the nation, then it should be tied to profits of the employer. Every employee should get paid in a percentage, not a flat rate.

But, back in the early 2000&#039;s, I remember downloading a pirate copy of the original DOS release of Carmageddon via a P2P program , I think it was Kazzaa, but could have been Lime Wire. I used them all, so I forget. This version of Carmageddon that I had on my PC came with a ATi D3D patch that could run the game in Windows XP without DOS. I sadly may have deleted that version of the game, not knowing how rare that direct 3D patch was. But it was real. I was playing Carmageddon with accelerated graphics. I am not lying, BTW. I do think this ATi patch was done by the same group that did the Tomb Raider direct 3D patch from ATi, that later surfaced. Maybe I have this version on an old HDD, but I am not sure anymore. I still have stacks of old CDR&#039;s from back in the day too. One of them might have a copy. But I need to set up a disc drive. I have never seen anyone mention this D3D patch. I downloaded it from a P2P network with a pirated copy of the game. Surely I couldn&#039;t have been the only one with this version? I have never even seen LGR talk about a D3D port. Despite how much he talks about the game.", "time": 1675132813, "resto": 9615034}, {"no": 9617254, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:39:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9617127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9617127</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This version of Carmageddon that I had on my PC came with a ATi D3D patch that could run the game in Windows XP without DOS.</span><br><br>I know this sounds like a LARP, but believe me.

The 3D accelerated version was something that I had on my old desktop for years. I found it via P2P network, by downloading it from another user. It was the standard disc image release of the game. But it came with a couple additional binaries for native windows compatibility with D3D rendering. The game ran flawlessly on Windows XP for me. I thought it was a standard patch that anyone could download from fileplanet or something. And then I saw the LGR videos on the original Carmageddon, and Clint mentioned how hard it was to play the game on anything but DOS. I remember leaving a comment in the video telling him to get the Direct3D patch. Which I later tried to find myself, but couldn&#039;t come up with any results online. I do remember this patch having ATI in the filename. The original Tomb Raider was released on DOS for the PC. It had multiple hardware acceleration patches for 3DFX, Matrox, S3 Virge, PowerVR, and such. But in more recent years, an ATi Direct3D windows patch surfaced, that was completely unknown outside of ATi. The Carmageddon d3d patch I had did the exact same thing, but with Carmageddon. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6p<wbr>tYJcly_w<br><br>I wish it was something that I kept.

It&#039;s more chaotic and requires you to have better judgement on how to spend the missile bombing. Also, collecting fruit is pretty seamless and fast, as enemies leave fruit trails behind them, all you have to do is move acordingly and don&#039;t do any mistake while moving, and you can get the fruit on your way without any need for a detour. <br>The shop can be navigated within seconds, even split seconds. Or you can choose to not use the shop at all, if you don&#039;t want to.<br>Even if you want to argue that shooting with the face buttons is ideal (it&#039;s not IMO, and the devs agree), the C-buttons are more compact and act much better as a secondary d-pad than the DC&#039;s face buttons. However, the intended way to play Bangai O on the N64 is by using the d-pad to move and the stick to shoot. Might take some time to get used to it but once it clicked I could never go back to the face buttons.<br>Both versions are worth it, I think DC is better for beginners and N64 better for people who want more challenge.

You go through two &quot;puzzles&quot; that essentially solve themselves with how braindead they are, and it concludes with the laughable first Lisa encounter, where she knocks you out and then does... nothing before fighting you when you wake up. <br>The Guardhouse is turned into a straight line with zero exploration despite that area being the most open to expansions given its size in the original concepts.", "time": 1675122923, "resto": 9616634}, {"no": 9616793, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)19:02:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9616723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9616723</a><br>The only way it improves upon the original is the graphics and sound, but that&#039;s the minimum you&#039;d expect.
