That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

The PS1 was sold at a similar loss to the Saturn when it launched in 1994 in Japan. This has been revealed by recent interviews from employees involved in both companies. PS1 cost about 50,000 Yen per unit to produce, Saturn cost about 54,800 Yen. Yes Saturn is more, but it&#039;s not $100 more. Both systems were sold at a $100 loss as well. The biggest cost issue in both systems wasn&#039;t the number of chips, it was the RAM. RAM prices were stupid high during this time and fell dramatically in the next 3 years. What was over $200 worth of RAM in both systems dropped to under $5 worth of RAM in the span of 2-3 years.<br><br>People love to point to $399 vs $299 but forget to look at the difference in launch dates.

Gouraud Shading doesn&#039;t really have much of a performance hit on VDP1. If you want to know how that figure is actually determined it basically boils down to this. <br><br>- A non textured pixel takes about 1 clock cycle to draw. <br>- A textured pixel takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A textured and gouraud shaded pixel still takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A half transparent pixel takes about 6 cycles to draw. <br><br>So compared to untextured pixels it&#039;s 6 times longer to draw, compared to textured it&#039;s 3 times longer to draw. So this is where your up to 6 times longer comes from. So with those values we can say that the max theoretical fillrate of VDP1 is 26-28 Million pixels per second depending on what resolution mode the Saturn is in and if you&#039;re drawing all untextured pixels. This is probably how the theoretical value listed earlier was determined. For Textured and Gouraud shaded pixels it&#039;s about 13-14 Million pixels per second. For half transparent pixels, it&#039;s about 4-5 Million pixels per second. <br><br>That&#039;s still a pretty significance performance hit for half transparencies. Throw in that they don&#039;t work correctly all the time and it&#039;s easy to see why most devs went with meshes. <br><br>That all said, if you&#039;re not doing half transparencies VDP1&#039;s fillrate is still more than enough for most games. At 320x240 resolution at 30fps you have enough fillrate to draw the entire frame buffer about 6 times per frame. So if you&#039;re sorting and culling polygons properly and not trying to draw everything as half transparent, you really shouldn&#039;t be hitting the fillrate limit.", "time": 1672264899, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9525165, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523969</a><br>Held back only by the small cartridge space.

I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

I like held items, natures and all the other gen 3 junk and honestly like being able to play Red or Green with that stuff thrown in.

Would have been sweet to see it introduced with R/S/E instead. Was probably the most logical change to ever come to this franchise but by the time it showed up I was already done with Pokemon so I never played past the third gen of games. It was also nice to see those secret bases be a thing even if there was only a few limited locations for it. Was nice you could link up with friends, even have your friends character persist in your world. The fashion shows were also a fun divergence from the main game. Something this series desperately needed instead of just constant battling. Also made lesser mons and attacks not always completely worthless. Just too bad it was never expanded on really to my knowledge. Pokemon should have went out its way to vastly expand on concepts outside the catching and battling but I guess that leaves no room for milking so of course it wasn&#039;t happening.<br><br>Now as for the GB/GBC era, I actually prefer this era.

Doing this multiple times during every trek across the overworld gets annoying quick since the harp song+warp cutscene can&#039;t be skipped.

The dungeons have rooms larger than the screen, unlike LA, but they do nothing with the extra space. Seasons has a few neat nods to Zelda 1, some of the dungeon layouts and bosses are directly inspired by that game. The story isn&#039;t anything special, Link gets sent by the Triforce to two different kingdoms where the Twinrova witches are trying to manipulate the local villains into kidnapping the sages of (game title) so they can light some magic flames to bring back Ganon.

Also, there are two releases of Night Trap for the Sega CD. The second release actually improves the colour encoding. The devs at Digital Pictures were not happy with the colour output. They were originally planning on releasing Night Trap on the SNES Playstation add-on, before Sega picked up the publishing for the Sega CD. Devs would have preferred the higher color palette of the SNES Playstation.

Play if you like quirky games like Wario Ware and rhythm games.<br>3. Advance Wars\u2014personally not a fan, but those who liked it spent hundreds of hours in it. Very addictive strategy game.<br>4. WarioWare\u2014quirky and addictive, one of the more original games for GBA. If you&#039;ve never tried it, do. If you did, still fun to see where it all started from.<br>5. Metroid Fusion\u2014it&#039;s 2D Metroid, enough said. It&#039;s great despite some say it&#039;s not Super Metroid.<br>6. Mother 3\u2014not a perfect RPG, but one many people want to play now. Play if you like Earthbound or want an RPG with plot.<br>7. Wario Land 4\u2014some praise this is as pinnacle of GBA or even best platformer ever, others will write it off as good but ultimately weaker than the GBC ones. Regardless, well worth a try.<br>8. Mario &amp; Luigi\u2014actually very good RPG, only brought down by bing bang wahoo style and kinda whatever graphics.<br>9. Kirbies in general\u2014always fun and worth a play. Play if you like Kirby, don&#039;t play if you&#039;re sick of platformers.<br>10. Mega Man Zero 3 &amp; 4\u2014decent games, but got pretty overrated recently as some &quot;official canon classics&quot;. I beat them all, they&#039;re fun and good but not really masterpieces.

If you love them, you probably know which ones to play anyway, and may prefer remakes. <br>Zelda: Minish Cap\u2014it&#039;s more Zelda. Play it or skip it, it&#039;s alright if you want more ALTTP but thats about it.<br>Treasure games\u2014no comment.<br>Mega Man Battle Network\u2014one of those monster / card collect series that just goes on and on.", "time": 1672043990, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518704, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:53:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518654</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his list is baaad, look at my list look at my list! </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the same but has one-dollar-store Symphony of the Night with ladyboy characters!</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9518683</span><br><a href=\"#p9518687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518687</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;then takes it so seriously he deletes his post over a typo and uses alt codes</span><br>I hope you are a janny because otherwise you need to touch snail shells right now", "time": 1672044817, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518708, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:59:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518704</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look at my list look at my list</span><br>I never posted a list.

Depends on the game. Beatemups are usually easy to clear in a sitting, and RPGs, while they take time, are just a steady grind of getting stronger until you win. There are some games where, as a kid, my bros and I would play for a bit, have fun, then swap cartridges to something else, with some titles remaining perpetually unbeaten. But we were never particularly bothered by it. It sounds like a bizarre thing to say, but &quot;you have to be able to beat it&quot; never felt like a required selling point back in the day. Just trying to get farther for the explorative reward of seeing the next level or the new enemy types was exciting enough. It was fun to be able to go to school the next day and tell kids &quot;dude I got to level 4 once and there&#039;s these grey octopus things that shoot missiles!&quot; on some game. <br><br>Part of it comes down to ownership vs rental though. It wasn&#039;t common for kids in our region and generation to own lots of games, we weren&#039;t super rich. So we&#039;d get one or two a year for birthday/Christmas, and borrow them between ourselves. When rentals became a thing it greatly expanded the number of titles we were able to play, and at only 3 days a pop it was common to return a game without clearing it, to try something else, then come back to it and rent it again at a later date (unless it was so awesome that it was worth renting multiple times in a row; when Street Fighter 2 came out on SNES I think we stayed up 25 hours playing that). <br><br>I do have some distinct memories of games I did beat, though. Zelda 1 multiple times - always an immersive adventure. Final Fantasy 1 as well, and grinding or no the last dungeon can get tricky if you&#039;re not smart with your spellcasting. Castlevania 1, was pretty proud when I could sit down and beat that in a single run.

Kirby was pretty easy, too.<br><br>On the other hand, it was roughly two years later until I finally managed to finish the original TMNT. Shit was hard. I think I was actually in high school before I managed to finish Bayou Billy. IIRC, Contra ended up coming out in what was basically the middle of the school year for us, and the withdrawal was unbearable. It was like the whole country was desperately waiting to get home, plow through their homework, and then obsessively play Contra until a parent literally tore us away from the television.

He went absolutely nuclear over all this, and he ended up conflating all these things together and made up a narrative that the libretro team was making millions off of his stolen code, and used it as an excuse to cease working on Duckstation altogether, which then pissed off dicksuckers in Reddit, Twitter and Resetera, who promptly attempted to cancel libretro and RetroArch.

Most casuals don&#039;t want to have the headaches of worrying about things like accuracy or input timing and are quick to dismiss any discrepancies they think are irrelevant, they just need the game to run and that&#039;s it. Software emulation and MiSTer may be visually difficult to distinguish under several circumstances to the average person such as color output or ability to render the game in sync with everything else. The line can be tough to draw for most on which is better because the FPGA-based emulators have quickly caught up and even exceeded it&#039;s cycle accurate software counterparts in many technical areas. For any applicable cores, MiSTer has more accurate sound (certified against MDfourier). Most importantly, no core has input delay that isn&#039;t native to the original game or hardware, something all software emulators still haven&#039;t nailed down without the use of run-ahead (banned on speedrun). Input delay is always a subject easily dismissed by the typical casual because you&#039;re not practicing a game enough to begin to care about getting optimal input timings in, you just need to play your game and that&#039;s it.

PDAs were even more rare (at least where I lived), plenty people didn&#039;t know they existed, and few had one. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We are sort of stuck in this stagnant time for phones without any major innovations what so ever. It\u2019s bizarre. </span><br>The truth is, you can only invent something once. Like you can&#039;t just invent Wi-Fi again, or frontal phone camera again. <br>But in the 90\u20132000s, there were a lot of new tech advances, some fundamentally new things, like e.g. Wi-Fi\u2014they just weren&#039;t popularized yet. And we had a whole new transition of old tech going digital, mobile, and wireless\u2014digital cameras, digital media storage, 3G, etc. And once more, you can&#039;t just &quot;transition to digital&quot; again\u2014it happened once, and that&#039;s it.<br>A lot of the tech that iPhone introduced wasn&#039;t exactly &quot;new&quot;, it had been floating around for years. It simply got mature enough for mass market around late 2000s\u2013early 2010s. Kind of like how VR had been around since forever, but got truly big only in recent years. <br>But sooner or later, you implement all of those ideas that were &quot;floating around&quot;. The competition all copies each other and there&#039;s not much new to introduce. You basically use up all the innovations that had accumulated for decades.<br>So yeah, phones have been stagnating.

The DPI race is also over, because frankly, the difference between Full HD phone and 4k phone is negligible. Phone cameras still do improve, but the megapixel race is also kinda over. Going thinner and lighter is not really impressive anymore. Processors and graphics? You already have pretty damn strong CPUs in phones, considering most people use them only to play cookie clickers, and many phone games look about as good as console ones. Hell, I think Apple was the first company ever to use 5-nm chips in their tech. Storage? Stopped being a problem with 128gb phones becoming the norm.

That&#039;s not even getting into issues like nonsensical location jokes and references / skits that are extremely dated. There are lots of translators today, both by people who do it for a living or for fun or even AI / MTLs are getting in on the action, all of which pretty much renders that original &quot;worth learning&quot; part moot. On top of that, that&#039;s not even getting into the nightmare of localizations and the script purity question. Even with all of those compounded factors, there are people who still pushed through with it and there&#039;s a ton more people who know Japanese now than there was a decade or two ago, leaving a very saturated field of translators who are constantly fighting over rights to translate. There&#039;s also another thing in this thread that&#039;s worth pointing out too: most of the titles posted are either Sega Saturn, obscure PC-E or PS1/PS2 titles, the reason which is that the technology to actually inject and rewrite text, make sure it fits the boxes, etc. is a much more difficult task than translating the script itself wholesale.
