I don&#039;t want dbps to stop, but at recent years when we are having more than 50 new wads a year that have at least same or higher quality than dbp usually, i wouldn&#039;t get angry about most of them not getting an award, while many other sets don&#039;t get award either.

Possibly my biggest problem with Cross, even bigger than the total shitshow exposition dumps at the end of the game, is that Cross has extremely long combat animations and the intro/outro to combat is long even by JRPG standards, and enemies flat out interrupt your turn and do long animations of their own, and you can&#039;t even spend those animations menuing like you can in the original game (benefit of ATB!). Just comparing sequences in Trigger and Cross where you have to kill packs of enemies, the reptite tower is totally painless because it takes Crono half a second to draw his sword and transition into combat, and it takes two seconds to mash through text boxes at the end of combat, meaning that when you fight multiple packs of enemies it doesn&#039;t feel like your time is wasted and its all one big connected action sequence. Meanwhile, killing all the enemies is Gaea&#039;s Navel and ESPECIALLY clearing Marbule is like pulling fucking teeth, i can&#039;t believe you could honestly play those sections without thinking that they needed to rethink how they present the combat system.

Eventually the Japanese game came out, and IIRC I even downloaded a ROM for it and tried playing it, but obviously didn&#039;t get far. By the time the actual game came out here, I think I was already turning off of Pokemon and was getting hardcore into Zelda and FF instead. I did replay Gen 1 a couple of times during that time frame, though, so maybe I just turned into a stuffy Genwunner in record time, I dunno. Whatever the case, It took like a decade before I touched another Pokemon game, namely Emerald, Lead Green and Platinum. I did get Soul Silver, but I think having played the previous three nigh back-to-back burned me out, with the last straw being me forgetting to save and turning it off after hours of progress (I was tired and possibly drunk lol).

Units belonging to a general can not leave the current screen the general is on, so it is him that gives the overall movement of the team.<br>Nice graphics and musics.

The game uses background graphics for the characters, unless it is currently the unit in play in which case it will turn into sprites for the time being. Smart.<br>On the bad side, the game rarely goes beyond the battle-&gt;town-&gt;repeat routine. Most of the game has the same two musics on loop (battle and town), despite the musics being of quality.

And if that wasn&#039;t enough, most items from chests in dungeons respawn so it is easy to farm them (MP refills or sell for money etc) <br><br>Some interesting mechanics, the main one being that you can have up to 3 parties you can switch to in combat. The first party is your main characters, hero+warrior+mage. The second party is made of &quot;Idols&quot;, godly creatures that you find along the way and which mostly just use spells and are AI controlled. The third party consists of soldiers you can hire, you must pay for them and their gear so I never bothered with them. Only the party active at the end of a battle recieves exp. Idols may be fused together to create new idols, however they&#039;ll start over from lvl1, though usually know better spells so it is worth it.<br>Also you can pawn items instead of selling them.<br><br>The game is huge and there are a lot of dungeons, some of which can get a bit mazey, but the dungeons look great and most of them have dedicated art and palettes.<br>The overworld is huge also and once you get the boat, it&#039;s like looking for a needle in a haystack, again and again...

The intro sequence briefly covers the history of the Middle East from 622 CE, the first year of the Islamic calendar, including a brief description of the Hijra, up until 1104 CE, the year of Sadler&#039;s birth. The game then starts in Baghdad, where Sadler rescues Rumi, and follows Sadler to Persia and then Babylon, where he must defend the Euphrates River from pollution by an oil magnate, encounter the Assyrian queen Semiramis and Babylonian goddess Ishtar, and visit the Tower of Babel in search of unicorns, before heading to Alexandria, becoming baptised in a Jewish village, and searching for Ouroboros. Eventually, Sadler makes his way back to Baghdad and murders the Caliph.

It might have been a zero-sum project. Just barely not incurring a loss for the company. When we released 2nd Impact and 3rd Strike, I think the overall project became more profitable at that point.

Fifth one is really solid but also has a very unique gimmick so not a great place to start. 6th one is the most solid over all but it&#039;s also where the series ends and unlike other megaman games, the story isn&#039;t afraid of actually finishing so it&#039;ll be a shame if you actually want to experience the story of the games. <br><br>My recommendation is to skip 1 and start with 2.

I never put much thought into it until I replayed both games recently on the DC. There are a few monstrous flaws SA2 has that SA1 does not have, and for those reasons alone I wonder why I still see people online claiming that 2 is markedly better than 1. Even on /vr/ I&#039;ve seen people say SA1 is outright bad and that SA2 is the best Sonic game. <br><br>1. The structure of the original is a lot better than the sequel. Both SA1 and SA2 feature radically different gameplay styles, speed levels, shooting levels, exploration levels, etc. But in SA1, you&#039;re given a lot more control over the kinds of levels you want to play, whereas in SA2, if, for example, you just want to play Sonic&#039;s levels, you&#039;re held hostage and forced to play through Tails&#039; and Knuckles&#039; stages in between speed stages. I think there&#039;s even, multiple times, instances where you play as Tails-&gt;Tails-&gt;Knuckles or some combination like that during the hero story. I think SA1&#039;s approach, separating the character stories, was a much more reasonable option. <br><br>2. SA1 tends to get the little nuanced things right. For example, in SA1 when you play as Knuckles, your emerald radar can detect all three emerald shards at once in a level, if you&#039;re close enough to them. Whereas in SA2, pretty much purely for the sake of trying to pad the game out, your radar can only detect a single shard at a time. It&#039;s a pretty cheesy and transparent way to make Knuckles&#039; levels not seem so short.", "filename": "010", "ext": ".png", "w": 1036, "h": 912, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 220, "tim": 1675638963718126, "time": 1675638963, "md5": "Tzo5pmiJPXmH/QcH/OH4NQ==", "fsize": 3021022, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sonic-adventure-sonic-adventure-2", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 8, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 9635673, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)18:16:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "3. The original Sonic Adventure felt more like the Genesis titles in terms of level design. Similarly to those games, there are tons of little shortcuts you can take throughout most of Sonic&#039;s stages thanks to how potent his spinball is in the game. SA2 unfortunately neutered the shit out of the spinball in that regard, and the levels are a lot less shortcut friendly and just generally less interesting. <br><br>4. I&#039;ll also mention variety, although that&#039;s not really an objective positive or negative. I think Tails&#039; levels are more interesting in SA1 since the shooting levels already exist with E-102 Gamma. That being said Amy&#039;s levels are a bit booty so whether or not you like the additional gameplay variety is up to personal taste. I thought Big&#039;s stages were inoffensive. <br><br>5.

From only being able to delete saves on controller 1, to supporting copying and/or moving saves, to supporting all 4 controllers, to supporting hot-swapping of cards/controllers or not.

They&#039;re weird and have this sense of levity and slightly fantastical wonder which captivated me even as a kid, but they were also serious in tone, the stakes and motivations always felt real, even when it got mildly out of hand with Moonraker, the tension was there, and there was some grim violence to back it.<br><br>Dalton&#039;s 007 is like an opposite to Moore&#039;s, and that&#039;s why I really love those movies. This James Bond is more grounded and cynical, more dark and brutal, he&#039;s far more cold blooded towards his much more cruel enemies, he doesn&#039;t hesitate to kill, and there&#039;s just far less levity and goofy fun. Some who love Moore&#039;s movies hate that, but I love it, BECAUSE it&#039;s very different, and because it&#039;s closer to the books, straying from that isn&#039;t inherently a huge problem, but there&#039;s a value in capturing it.<br>The Living Daylights was probably the most &#039;realistic&#039; movie yet in the series, with a spy plot which was actually very grounded and well planned, featuring fight choreography which felt quite real, yet also very elaborate and creative, the opening fight with the assassin in the kitchen is incredible in setup and execution, by far the best brawl in the series. Yet it still has that 007 charm, it still has the far out gadgets, it still has the gorgeous girl, it still has the lively music, and the scheming mastermind.<br><br>As much as I love Moore&#039;s 007, that was a long stint, and it couldn&#039;t go on forever, moreover the change in direction was ultimately very good, A View To A Kill was already nudging towards that, and I love that movie for it.

It does however keep up the same grounded tone of the Dalton ones, more so even, but the movie would probably have been very similar if they had gotten Dalton to do it as his last one.

I maxed the clock at 999 hours on the original long, long before I stopped playing and other than Tri on the Wii and the World/Rise games I&#039;ve put at least several hundred hours into every one. <br><br>Playing the original now would be kind of sad because the online was such a major component but it&#039;s still an awesome game regardless and the offline game is quite a complete experience in it&#039;s own right. If you like it there&#039;s plenty more Monster Hunter out there to jump into including Generations Ultimate which is basically the best the series has ever been and still has a decent player base. <br><br>That said, the player bases as in all online games are always a little funny. One thing we still joke about is the first time I actually got my PS2 hooked up online. I almost always use greatsword, but happened to have a hammer on me when I came into the hub. I was HR1 so an online newbie, and the first thing said was &quot;hey welcome to MH! Hammers suck btw&quot; because there was an early (wrong impression that they did) but neither happened to notice the hammer I had was the Breathcore which is the most powerful one in the game.", "filename": "1422292661333", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 634, "h": 386, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1675557544467747, "time": 1675557544, "md5": "GBgw30BVLl8abHz5mRd2Iw==", "fsize": 57902, "resto": 9629895}, {"no": 9633623, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)01:25:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9632553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9632553</a><br>It\u2019s right stick attack and they didn\u2019t drop it until 3U", "time": 1675578328, "resto": 9629895}, {"no": 9634213, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)09:04:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9633623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9633623</a><br>They dropped it after the first game.

The gameplay is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the mechanics will go over a typical viewer&#039;s head. There&#039;s also Atari&#039;s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they&#039;re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Atari games truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#039;t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev&#039;s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

The projector-based hub was always disappointing to me, I think it would have been a lot more impressive if they kept the world map but made it a map of London instead. If I had to push further, I&#039;d rather it not have been London at all, I think it would have been much more interesting if they invented a fictional Victorian-esque city to set the game in, because it always took me out of the game how it went from a fictional land like Gallowmere to a real city like London.", "time": 1675504164, "resto": 9627423}, {"no": 9630597, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)04:56:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9630586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9630586</a><br>A lot of things felt off about it. What really irked me the most was how insanely difficult it felt for so many bad reasons. The first game was hard too, but it didn\u2019t feel like completely unfair bullshit the way ME2 did. I\u2019m not sure if it was the camera, controls, or both\u2014 but whatever the case, the game felt much worse to play than ME1. The fact that the setting and characters also managed to be a lot less entertaining than the first game didn\u2019t help much either. <br><br>One thing it did have that I think really stood out was the OST.

The first time I played it as a kid, I missed the chalices from the third level onwards (not necessarily a bad thing making finding them a puzzle in itself) but as a result fighting everything from the freakshow onwards was a struggle, especially up to Kew Gardens when I still only had the short sword. Conversely, having a new weapon just to deal with enemies on the next stage doesn&#039;t feel very exciting. If you play the first game using only the starting weapons, you can still make decent progress without feeling like you&#039;re hitting a wall constantly.

Some might argue that&#039;s game-breaking but I have still beaten the game without doing that.
