Shinra&#039;s end goal was to create Neo Midgar by finding The Promised Land, a place with allegedly infinite Mako, and putting a reactor on top of it. And their goal with Jenova&#039;s corpse was to take cells from it and artificially create a human with the abilities of the Cetra. So the hybrid could speak to the Planet, point the way to The Promised Land, and Shinra could print infinite money. Which is just deranged. Imagine reading the Bible and getting to the scripture that speaks of Heaven having streets of gold. And rather than seeing that as God&#039;s promises to encourage you to get closer to God and reach a spiritual enlightenment, instead you decide to take the information you can find and make a lab baby that can possibly infiltrate heaven. So you can send your armies there to harvest the gold.<br><br>Either way it wasn&#039;t until Dr Gast found Ifalna who clarified that Jenova was not a Cetra but rather a shape shifting alien who destroyed the Cetra. And that Jenova was the enemy of the Planet. Hojo didn&#039;t give a fuck though. Even after finding Hojo and Ifalna he forged ahead with his experiments out of curiosity of what Jenova would do. And since no one updated Gast&#039;s notes from when they were still working in the Mansion, Sephiroth got the wrong idea after reading them. Believing that Jenova was a Cetra that was done dirty by humans and the world belonged to her. Just like his father though, Sephiroth didn&#039;t care and forged ahead after finding out the truth and went with his own insane Meteor plan.

Clive, for better or worse, cannot hinge on the reputation of previous characters to succeed. He has to tell his own story in his own setting. Everyone already fucking likes Cloud.

No one complained about Barrett telling Tifa to hold on to her rage even though he never said that in the OG.

Weaker than the lv4 he starts the game with and only slightly stronger than the lv3 you meet Barrett at. Or how he starts finding plotholes in his own story when you first reach Junon. On the 2nd playthrough FF7 gets better because you start to realize how it all falls into place. Like with the level thing. Despite everything Cloud said, he didn&#039;t know what it actually felt like to be as strong as a SOLDIER 1st class. So he couldn&#039;t replicate the feeling of that strength in his memory.

Those games are too antiquated for me to enjoy anymore (I know you can play with kb+m, but it doesn&#039;t feel great IMO, havent tried since you could first do that though so might be better now), but there&#039;s a lot they did right.

That&#039;s why I always recommend for people to play on an easy difficulty for their first-time since it&#039;s more fair. Either way, playing on Death Incarnate is totally beatable, and it&#039;s pretty cool how RTCW actually changes the enemy behavior to be tougher on Hard beyond just making them more tanky or whatever.

When you do this in RTCW, the basic enemies will often retreat to reload, which gives you an opening of a couple seconds to counter them and be more aggressive. At the very least, it&#039;ll reset their windup and allow you to take them down more effectively. If they&#039;re especially tanky, wallpeak them and whittle them down first before running in and filling your crosshair with their soon to be dead bodies.<br>2) Headshots do a lot more damage, so keep your crosshair up around that area.<br>3) You can lean around corners with the &#039;q&#039; and &#039;e&#039; keys. This lets you scope out an area and line up shots. You&#039;re invisible to the enemies when you do this, so you can&#039;t be shot at unless they enter your non-leaning line of sight. <br>4) You can hold down CAPS LOCK by default to walk slowly, which lets you stay scoped in with your Mauser rifle while moving, as well as quietly open doors.<br>5) Crouching heavily increases your accuracy with your automatic weapons. It&#039;ll lock your cone of fire to less than half of what it normally is when you hold down the trigger. <br>6) The Sten does more damage per shot than the mp40, as does the Thompson if you have any ammo for it. Learn to use the Sten against singular foes, so the overheating drawback won&#039;t come into play. FG-42 is great too. Flamethrower doesn&#039;t do direct damage, but all enemies ticked with it will die to afterburn. Very useful against a certain infamous late-game enemy as well. You can hold down the grenades to &quot;cook&quot; them, letting you release them on the 3rd or 4th *click* to time your throws right. <br>7) If you&#039;re overwhelmed out in the open with no immediate potential to get to cover and break line of sight, strafing horizontally to them while sprinting will throw their aim off a little bit compared to just standing still. You can also strafejump at will even if your stamina bar is at 0%.", "filename": "Blazkowicz_RTCW", "ext": ".png", "w": 888, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676576961180707, "time": 1676576961, "md5": "42sDRCeE3CmAGNlR46on2Q==", "fsize": 1671176, "resto": 9665624}, {"no": 9667448, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)15:09:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9666640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9666640</a><br>what is this?<br>https://twitter.com/KensLabyrinthII<wbr>", "filename": "1671798680999", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676578162438517, "time": 1676578162, "md5": "oq5fO/xdZZFH6fa4utnhzg==", "fsize": 3573597, "resto": 9665624}, {"no": 9667449, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)15:09:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9667387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9667387</a><br>Q3 and UT are just all around sexy", "filename": "82AF60ED-FD38-4B70-A663-302D6CB68C4A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 560, "h": 800, "tn_w": 87, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676578177993331, "time": 1676578177, "md5": "zYKcte3lpjxf+9BVFx8new==", "fsize": 85551, "resto": 9665624}, {"no": 9667451, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)15:09:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9667009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9667009</a><br>What&#039;s wrong with it?

You&#039;re nothing without your B&amp;Bs with most characters. A combo considered &quot;easy&quot; in smash: in a specific percentage range, with Mario, grab, throw downwards, and right as the opponent bounces from the floor, shorthop -&gt; up tilt -&gt; up tilt -&gt; up B. The opponent can escape the combo with DI, so you have to follow the direction where he moves as you execute the combo, and you may have to turn that up b into nair or something else.

Hell from our perspective, this is how traditional fighting games are, since with command inputs the character does everything for you as long as you have those inputs memorized. Smash is, like basketball, easy to get into but hell to get good at, and is much harder to predicts. The ball doesn&#039;t just. get in the basket if you throw.

Got a good controller and read up on what people use - now what initially felt impossible feels trivial with ZERO practice. That&#039;s legacy, not skill. I had to immediately jump into training mode and memorize the b&amp;bs cause fighting games don&#039;t really have an accessible beginner pipeline. there&#039;s no items mode on to play with experienced players so we all have fun (while in basketball I played a ton of &quot;throw here, then from 3, then half-court&quot; games with my more experienced friends), the inputs can&#039;t really be learned on the fly (as you would learn basketball or football or boxing), you have no choice but to commit to the game before you even see what it&#039;s about. Unless you&#039;ve played fighting games before, there&#039;s absolutely no reason why a quarter circle -&gt; punch would throw a projectile. It&#039;s just not intuitive. That&#039;s legacy, and that&#039;s the sort of learning path that would&#039;ve made sense in the arcade days were people met face to face and you could get tutorials IRL.

You can parry and throw objects to do some damage, however you also have some melee attacks that you can perform with the square button + the direction of the dpad (even if the main four characters&#039; attacks aren&#039;t that powerful), usually the meta is to farm the ball from yellow to red until its outline becomes a rainbow, where then you can perform special attacks that can do massive damage once you grab it, these special attacks are also done differently depending on what direction of the dpad you&#039;re holding while the character holds the special ball for those 3 seconds that happens. Trying to unlock every character legitimately is a fun little distraction that you can do (specially if you play it on either a PSP, a phone, or one of those chinese handelds where you can pick it up and play after you wake up your device from sleep mode), and i&#039;m sure that playing with other people is the best way to enjoy the game, as some sort of party game.", "filename": "Rakugaki Showtime_p002 copy-fs8", "ext": ".png", "w": 2156, "h": 3056, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676596761023570, "time": 1676596761, "md5": "F1NdsyxU22wz2XHUYiRdNQ==", "fsize": 360488, "resto": 9665385}, {"no": 9668803, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)23:28:28", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Looking_Glass_Studios_(1993)_(From_-_Ultima_Underworld_II_Labyrinth_of_Worlds_for_PC)", "ext": ".png", "w": 480, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1676608108019466, "time": 1676608108, "md5": "0Gnf+N0DYV7l/sZa9Tb3ug==", "fsize": 74377, "resto": 9665385}, {"no": 9668819, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)23:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9666918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9666918</a><br>This.

Of course Disney isn&#039;t an entity focused on bringing joy or anything like that, though many people there had that intention back then, and maybe even today, but still, a company has a single true goal, making money and staying on top, and a way to do that is expand into different markets to make more money somewhere else. In the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s Disney truly caught on to video games and their growth, and we got many gems thanks to that.<br><br>I&#039;m mostly familiar with SEGA&#039;s Illusion series, which is what I grew up with, on my good old Mega Drive, though that series also had plenty of releases on both Game Gear and Master System, which I&#039;ve played now that I&#039;m all grown up and thoroughly enjoyed for what they were. I didn&#039;t grow up with just Mickey and Donald though, there were also tons of video games based on Disney films, like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King, which are the ones I remember most fondly, though there were many others like Aladdin. Disney&#039;s video games kept being made when the jump to 3D happened, on PS1 and N64, and quality was still good.<br><br>Nowadays though... we&#039;ve got Kingdom Hearts and not much else, so if you&#039;re not into that series then there&#039;s not much to see, back then when Disney would put out a new film it was a matter of time before we got a video game adaptation, regardless of how good or bad they were, we had them at least. Of course, this could all change with the new Disney Illusion Island, for Nintendo Switch, it looks like a modern World of Illusion and I&#039;m really into that, hopefully it lives up to the name.

I love the art style they went with, while the 16-Bit version went with a more iconic Mickey look, this went with a more classic one, with the completely black eyes, similar to his first few appearences. Also, while it keeps the stomping mechanic, it adds the whole element of grabbing and throwing objects, and it&#039;s used so well... I&#039;m impressed with how much fun I had playing this, the level design is superb for a 2D platformer, it looks nice, sounds nice, controls nice, it&#039;s all you can really ask for.

They intentionally cultivated an image that the Gamecube was for kids, from the small discs to the controllers to the color scheme of the console itself. First party stuff like Luigis Mansion, Super Mario Sunshine and especially Windwaker coming off the heels of more mature Zelda titles were all clearly aimed at elementary school aged kids. There were a few standouts like Metroid Prime but those kinds of titles were really the exception. RE4 was the only &quot;must have&quot; title that was marketed towards an older audience and that got ported to the PS2 pretty quickly. <br><br>Assuming the gaming audience was largely born between 1985-1993 for the Gamecube&#039;s generation, it&#039;s easy to see how it got hamstrung. You play Mario on the SNES as a young kid, you play Mario 64 which is a great improvement when you are getting into being a tween and then the GC comes out and it&#039;s more of the same stuff you played when you were in elementary school.<br><br>Meanwhile the PS2 was marketed and perceived as a direct continuation of the PS1, with the idea that the audience who had played it when they were in elementary school would in turn continue playing their console as teens. Outside of the obvious advantages of having an inbuilt Hi-Def CD player and DVD player it&#039;s early must have games were largely continuations of more mature franchises. Armored Core 2, MGS 2, Tekken Tag Tournament, Gran Turismo 3 were all &quot;your favorite PS1 title but even better&quot; and easily appealed to people who had played those titles when they were younger. You didn&#039;t feel like you were playing a game marketed at little kids if you played MGS1 and then picked up MGS2.

All I know is that when you instantly rewind, there won&#039;t be a cognitive learning process as your brain needs to learn (adapt to) a certain pattern with expectations and outcomes. Rewinding just brings you back to the moment right before dying, but not the moments leading up to it. Yet you&#039;ll still receive the dopamine reward in both cases, taking away the motivation to become better at the game. Rewinding also drastically reduces the possibility of failure, and failure is when your brain actually learns in order to adapt and overcome. Hence the absence of learning. <br><br>8 and 16 bit games especially have been designed with this learning process in mind. It&#039;s the literal structure of those video games. When using save states or rewinds, you bypass this learning process and don&#039;t experience the game in full how it was intentionally designed by the brightest minds of the gaming industry. What you&#039;re left with is a powerpoint slide of dopamine shots that only serve as escapism. The element of &#039;play&#039; almost completely disappears.

Nothing.<br><br>In short, rewinding makes you a worse gamer in the long term. This is simple cognitive neurology, any scientist would agree. Save states and rewinds therefore make for an objectively inferior experience as you only experience a small aspect of the game.

So when you play the remaster with twin stick control, it&#039;s super fucking easy. Like I am on Normal and have not come even close to dying at any point. I think the remaster supports a control option that mimics the original though, but I haven&#039;t tested it. It also has the Wiimote aiming controls if you&#039;re into that. If you have a Switch-compatible GC controller, it can be used to control the game exactly as it was on the original hardware. Visually the remaster is exceptional, and runs at 60FPS somehow despite the Switch&#039;s dogshit hardware.<br><br>Ultimately, I would recommend the remaster without any caveats, unless your mission is specifically to play the original code of the game in its purest form. The remaster is a straight visual upgrade without sacrificing any of the original&#039;s art direction or atmosphere. Control options are varied enough to give you whatever you want.

It&#039;s why there is a much more &quot;horrifying&quot; reaction to finding eviscerated corpses in a field of flowers on a bright sunny day, than finding an eviscerated corpse in some grimey war-torn battlefield. On a battlefield, it&#039;s to be expected, something that circumstance dictates as the norm, but in a lovely nature-esque field on an other-wise normal day, it becomes a jarring warning, something that alerts the individual to some danger they were previously unaware of. Horror has a much more visceral feeling than the mere common-place &quot;raping&quot; of one, which occurs daily and quite often within the animal world, in fact it is really only a subject within human society to classify &quot;rape&quot; as something altogether different from sex at all. They are one in the same.<br><br>Horror though, even animals can feel horror. It is far more powerful, dangerous, and unnerving of a feeling than some petty unwanted sexual advance. But, alas, a simple mind such as yours cannot comprehend the depthful, archaic, primordial feelings one associates with true &quot;horror&quot;.

Our brains are neurons firing electrical impulses that determine everything we do. We&#039;re sadly capable of all kinds of neurological degeneration that changes our &quot;programming.&quot; The original Mega Man X dealt with this because half of the OG series hadn&#039;t been made yet so the original robots weren&#039;t given the same depth of personality at the time.

What it comes down to is CRT being at its core an analog technology. It affects everything, even how frame rate works (modern monitors literally pause and hold the frame, they don&#039;t blast the field in and out leaving an afterglow the way a CRT would). The fidelity of the image is only limited by that of the human eye and the capacity of the tube. If you tone down the visibility of the scanlines to account for people seated at a healthy distance, then you get what probably just looks like a mild bloom effect. It&#039;s like trying to get the polaroid you took to look like the oil painting you saw in the museum. At the end of the day you&#039;re still looking at a polaroid and not a painting.<br>Something else people don&#039;t mention often is that it&#039;s one thing to imitate a CRT in a still image, but it&#039;s quite another to do it in motion. And I think that&#039;s almost certainly impossible for the above reasons. The concept of frame rate is very different for a CRT to that of an LCD.

But there&#039;s a magic to playing the games in order of release and seeing the evolution there.

Even when the game wasn&#039;t even a year old yet there was an interview with the series creator on Famitsu and he talked about how people complained about that inventory system.

The Switch Brigandine game is fun, too, if you like the original. Not much it terms of changes, so it&#039;s just more of the same rather than changing or trying to revamp the system. I prefer the story and characters of the original probably just because of the nostalgia/familiarity but there&#039;s an obvious difference in the design with the new game having the giant anime tits that you&#039;d expect out of any modern offering.

A lot of them are locked behind the postgame (thee&#039;s dark side of the moon but also darker side, and every kingdom opens up a bunch of additonal levels) so most people don&#039;t even notice.

Very fun and rewarding.<br><br>regarding 3D Sonic, take SA2 for example, the only one I like despite being mediocre. The sonic levels are decent, but most of the time you&#039;re just on a rail-esque run that doesn&#039;t require a lot of thought unless you&#039;re aiming for a high rank, except when you&#039;re in a janky part of the level that makes the camera move weird and you don&#039;t even know what the fuck is going on, then suddenly it&#039;s hard for a few seconds. Falling to a pit doesn&#039;t feel like your fault most of the time since it&#039;s not like you could&#039;ve predicted it with such speed. Still fun though. Then there&#039;s the Tails/Eggman levels. The platforming is absurdly simple, the gun autoaims for you and kills everything in side, and there&#039;s really nothing to do but walk to the end of the level and hope it&#039;s over soon. Then there&#039;s Knuckles/Rogue levels, where the core gameplay itself is just a long, boring, tedious &quot;hot! cold!&quot; treasure hunt.

LJN was originally an independent company, during the NES years. But Jack Friedman sold LJN to Acclaim in the early 90&#039;s and used that money to fund THQ. This thread is all about Nintendo licensing, and any 3rd party game publisher that had a contract with Nintendo pre-1991/ 1992 were locked down to Nintendo&#039;s hardware and could not publish their games on any competing console. I think the FCC cracked down on Nintendo by 1991 and Nintendo had to change their contracts and remove the exclusivity deal. EA was never a Nintendo publisher and worked with Konami/ Ultra on the NES. They jumped over to the Genesis/ MD in 1990. LJN created a separate company called Arena Games, so they could publish Genesis/ MD games and work around Nintendo&#039;s contracts. Acclaim created the company Flying Edge, which would publish Genesis/ Sega games exclusively. Flying Edge was a division of Acclaim, and Arena was a division of LJN.

Though, less of a deal seeing Capcom. Street Fighter II SCE was one of the first actual Genesis/MD games that Capcom made in-house. But there were Capcom games on the Genesis that were ported by Sega before that. From 1989-1990, Sega has very few third party publishers for the Genesis. TENGEN was one of them.

Like, I never really asked why it was in a weird black cart. the game looked like this, and was a generally better version of Pac-Man. Or at least closer to the arcade game, but still not exact. the NES game is still at a smaller resolution compared to the arcade game. the Cherry sprites missing details. But, it was a solid enough port. Namco used the same port too? I also remember renting the TENGEN Ms. Pac-Man NES port too. It looks closer to the arcade game, but the screen has to scroll. Giving you 3/4th of the screen. But still, not a big annoyance. But the game does have co-op option, and the option for smaller and more compressed maps that fit the screen, and the option for larger maps. Namco game has the whole map viable on screen, like the Pac-Man NES port, but graphics are less than arcade accurate. The TENGEN game has to scroll to use arcade resolution graphics.

The NES10 basically does the equivalent of pressing the reset button if the other chip on the cart ever fails it&#039;s security check (Hence why the NES keeps resetting if there is no cart inserted), so disabling it works for bypassing the DRM. The Famicom never had it, so it could not be integrated that well into the console unlike later Nintendo systems, which is why just simply removing the pin from the chip that sends the reset signal disables the DRM completely instead of prevents the console from working at all.<br><br>No idea if it could cause damage, but it likely was not good for it.

Growing up without really using the internet I didn\u2019t even know there was a console war. I played gameboy and NES and later on N64 and Gameboy Color and then GameCube and Gameboy Advance then Wii and DS and I just never ran out of things to play. I also wasn\u2019t exactly rich so I hardly even came close to playing everything. Looking back at PS1 and 2s vast library I nor any of my friends, even my well off ones, had even half the games on those lists and knew of maybe only a couple of the larger ones like Metal Gear Solid they never got. Comparing something retroactively to its potential versus its actuality is a bit foolish. Games were expensive when you were a kid, piracy hardly golden. Hell, one of my friends wanted to borrow a game to pirate a copy for himself and he ended up destroying my disk, so I was very piracy averse after that experience for years. If you want to compare and argue about it now potential matters, but I don\u2019t think it matters when you actually talk about the reality of the situation. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had Symphony of the Night growing up, nowadays it\u2019s my second favorite Castlevania behind Rondo of Blood and only slightly beating out Castlevania 3. But I didn\u2019t play any of these games before I was an adult, what I played growing up was was Castlevania 1 and 2 on my dads NES, and I didn\u2019t play any of the ones on my N64 because. Well I never actually saw any at GameStop or at a yard sale. I played rogue squadron and army men and Mario and Zelda. My pals with their PlayStations played Spyro and Crash and a lot of shitty shovelware I don\u2019t really remember (like army men Kek)<br><br>And we all played on our game boys and gameboy advances because that\u2019s just what you did.

Plus we would skirmish and no one ever unlocked everything (except me I eventually finished everything in AW2 years after they had all moved on lmao) so some games you just had to get for yourself so you\u2019d wait for your birthday or do yard work and mow grass to get it.

I love how much you&#039;re encouraged to just run around and explore shit. Only downside to the game is how much training you have to do each time you get a new Digimon.
