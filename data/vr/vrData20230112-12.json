Compare this with CPS2 games that have more big and unique, sometimes animates objects in their backgrounds.<br>Next, the chatacters animations. MK Trilogy sprites are very thin and don&#039;t have much unique animations. SF Alpha games are kind of simple too but Darkstalkers and Marvel vs games have more elaborate attack animations that take a large chunk of screen (and VRAM). MK Trilogy being this lightweight on animations is pretty much confirmed by the PS1 version: it easily holds 4 unique characters for 2 on 2 combat in PS1 RAM - when one character is defeated the game doesn&#039;t stop to load the second one from the disc. No Capcom game manages to have four complete and unique characters in a single fight on PS1 because they take much more memory than Mortal Kombat ones.<br>N64 has more RAM and doesn&#039;t have to deal with loading from the disk at all, so it allows SIX unique characters in 3 on 3 combat. Great, right? But here&#039;s the deal: the animation quality is worse than in PS1 version. So while there are six characters in N64 RAM, even having only two of them on screen, N64 can&#039;t animate them as fast as PS1 version. This is barely a cart size issue - adding a couple of frames to each character standing idle animation would make them look a whole lot smoother and this takes a very little space of ROM. MKT ROM has a enough of padding (aka unused space) for this. Even without using the unused space they could just remove that fancy MK logo in flames title screen and shitty looking MK1 stages and add better animation instead. But they didn&#039;t because N64 can&#039;t run it as smooth anyway.", "time": 1673501177, "resto": 9561618}, {"no": 9563216, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:33:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9562805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9562805</a><br>There are certainly no 1800 sprites in Mario Kart.

Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

Consoles and arcades were in a decline starting in 1980. Computer gaming was on the rise during the same period. All thanks to the new cheap micro-computers like the Apple II, Atari ST, C64, etc. Computer gaming hit a slump in 1985 until 1988-89 when VGA started getting widespread and not just cutting edge. Consoles hit a slump themselves in 1993 and didn&#039;t recover until 1996, and arcades were going down in profits during the same time. Never hear anyone talk about the computer videogames crash of 1985-1988 or the videogames crash of 1993-1996.<br>The only difference is there was a major recession in the early 1980&#039;s.

The cards are weird, I don&#039;t think they really detract from the gameplay but I&#039;m not keen on how RNG they are, and they&#039;re a little too abstract for me. I mean obviously the combat isn&#039;t very realistic and that&#039;s fine, but when characters fight with weapons or magic even if it&#039;s not realistic you can still accept it as a part of the world, whereas these cards are totally abstract game mechanics that don&#039;t correspond to anything within the narrative. I also think that when characters have mid-battle conversations that are supposed to be serious, all the little cards scattered around undermine it a bit and make it look silly. It&#039;s not THAT big a deal, but still.<br><br>Anyway, maybe it was different in the older versions or maybe not, but I&#039;ve played up to midway through chapter 2 (chaos route) and it doesn&#039;t feel that tactical to be honest. Most battles I just smash my dudes into the other dudes and don&#039;t have to pay that much attention to come out on top, even if the squishier party members get targeted they aren&#039;t too squishy and I can get someone to revive them so it doesn&#039;t really matter. I feel like I could&#039;ve won about half the storyline battles by just leaving the computer in charge of my units and walking away from the screen. I don&#039;t like mechanics that let you undo turns so I haven&#039;t used the one in this game, and the only problem it&#039;s caused is making recruiting enemy units more annoying since they&#039;re pretty hard to persuade and my guest party members keep killing them. Speaking of which I&#039;ve never liked Matsuno&#039;s obsession with AI-controlled party members and wish they&#039;d&#039;ve included an option to control them manually.

At Nintendo&#039;s showing of it&#039;s new &quot;gamecube&quot; they showed a non-interactive demo of what it can do. Samus Aran made an appearance in this demo. It&#039;s finally what we&#039;ve all been waiting for! A new Metroid! From the screenshots I have seen this is what I can tell. It&#039;s 3d first of all, second of all you can see one of the classic metroid doors in d3 in the back. And there is a horde of little monster things chasing Samus. I hope this game is good. It is kind of hard to imaging turning metroid into a 3d game without changing the game in some drastic and horrible way. What I don&#039;t understand is why everyone has to make a 3d game these days? Why can&#039;t they just use the tremendous power to make a 2d game with 3d sprites and backgrounds, but have the game be incredebly enourmous. They could easily make a game like Super Metroid, add the usual sequel story, new planet (of course), and about 20 times the size. Also hordes of new guys, weapons, and secrets, and all that good stuff. You don&#039;t have to make it a 3d game, but if you want you should have pre-rendered 3d backgrounds and 3d sprites, but keep the camera so it is still the same as all the other metroids. Can you imagine how hard it would be to wall, bomb, or space jump in 3d?

One character class (Onion Knight), which kinda sucked anyway and was a major pain in the ass to master.<br>3. The updated translation, it sticks to the straight to the point, no bullshit script of the PSX release as opposed to going all Shakespearean on your ass.

The one pain is making sure your wheel is one device, because RA mapping is dogshit and doesn&#039;t support multiple devices. My wheel is 3 devices, a high end DIY DD wheelbase, DIY pedals, and a cheap logitech shifter. I use a combo of HidHide and Joystick gremlin to hide the 3 controllers and merge them into a new one, then map them to NeGcon. It can be fiddly setting the buttons right because RA is retarded when it comes to mapping names, you&#039;ll probably need a new profile for every new game because the mapping changes.<br><br>The main issue is that you&#039;re not going to get any FFB, at least not from consoles. RR4 had a form of FFB for the Jogcon, but the decomp effort hasn&#039;t cracked it yet, and might never do so. The game plays well with a basic centering effect anyway, I had a lot of fun. For arcade stuff, you&#039;ll have a much better time although the FFB plugin can take some tweaking. 6th gen you can get FFB emulation for both PS2 and GC, I haven&#039;t tried Xbox.<br><br>PS1 and Saturn should both be fine, you can emulate the Arcade racer for Saturn and it works with almost every racing game. One thing to bear in mind is that you&#039;ll want a very low steering range, both the NeGcon and arcade racer are set to 180 degrees and I think 270. Too much steering and you&#039;ll be moving way too much, these games expect you to hit full lock on most turns.

However my research confirms around 25 to 30 Ridge Racer Full Scale Units were exported for Western/Foreign markets. They were spread across the USA, UK, Spain, France, Middle East, Australia, etc. <br><br>And around 20 Ridge Racer Full Scale were used in Asian markets. Namco themselves kept several units in reserve to use in their Namco branded theme parks and Namco arcades in Japan. Several independent arcade owners in Asia had a Ridge Racer Full Scale too.

Tried it right now and found no obvious issues with stuttering or the menus. If you aren\u2019t using Snes9xRX then you have to try Starfox 2. The nintendo logo has a tiny bit of stuttering but everything else plays great.

It wasn&#039;t until later, once the generation that actually grew up with the consoles from childhood, that the hobbyists and obsessive autismal types took over, which simultaneously led to massive improvements (with ample help from much higher computing power, of course) but also gave the scene the stink of constant autistic shitfits it&#039;s known for today.", "time": 1673471878, "resto": 9559502}, {"no": 9562132, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:28:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9562017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9562017</a><br>DK64 is fully playable, though it does have something of an issue where physics don&#039;t work precisely as they do in real hardware due to the fact that it was programmed to accelerate your character&#039;s movement proportional to the amount of lag, so the more the game lags, the more momentum your character picks up. Due to inaccurate timings, almost all N64 emulators run the game too well with fewer framerate drops, which on paper and for the purposes of regular intended gameplay is a good thing, but it means you don&#039;t get the movement boosts you&#039;d normally get when the game lags. This only matters if you&#039;re trying to pull off certain glitches and sequence breaks, though. It also leads to characters in the title screen demo gameplay not moving quite as expected and perhaps on certain cutscenes, but that&#039;s even more minor.

I am STILL stuck on smb2 nes after playing it casually for a year and I save state every world. I save stated at the beginning of each level on smb1, the all star version is smb 1 every world, and smb2 every level, which makes more sense given the difficulty, and I think that&#039;s probably a better way to learn to platform anyways. I recommend Kirby&#039;s adventure too, it gets harder at the end and has fun things to find/figure out and I felt better at Mario after playing it, though I&#039;m a brainlet.

Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed.

It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere.

Compared to DC, GCN doubles the number of dungeuns, adds new character classes, completely overhauls and rebalances the classes for the better, adds an absolute fuckton of new rare weapons to find (the main reason to play the game long-term) and makes their droprates almost reasonable compared to the absurdly low droprates on DC. The Spread Needle is no longer so OP as to completely dominate online play to the point where you won&#039;t get a single hit in if a teammate is using one. It fixes the glitch that allowed players to teamkill. It fixes the glitch that allowed players to go through locked doors. You no longer drop your money and equipped weapon when you die, to be ganked by other players. It adds a quick item select like the one in Monster Hunter that makes it MUCH easier to use items and spells that aren&#039;t assigned to your main 6 buttons. (On DC, you&#039;re stuck with JUST those 6 actions, at least two of which will be your basic attacks. Have fun juggling all those spells if you&#039;re a spellcaster) Spells now go up to Lv 30 instead of capping at Lv 15, and only Spellcasters can go above level 20, giving you an actual reason to use a spellcaster. GCN also adds splitscreen multiplayer, which is the best reason to play it. You can play online on private servers, either through a Gamecube with a broadband adapter, or a Wii with a lan adapter, but be warned; you have to take alot of precautions playing any console version online. Any rando in your lobby or your game can potentially freeze your game with a cheat device, causing you to lose all unequipped items on your character.
