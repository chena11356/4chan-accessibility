Fortunately some manufacturers have started to change this naming convention to better reflect what those settings do, like LG with their last year OLED models.<br>Now, to do this adjustment properly you&#039;ll need to sit in a dark room and bring out a brightness test pattern of sorts, for example the color bars in the 240p Test Suite. Then you turn down the brightness all the way and make your way up until the bar nearest to black gets barely visible (is a bit brighter than black). Similarly for the contrast, you want to avoid near-white highlights getting blown out, so you should be able to differentiate the value that&#039;s nearest to white from pure white. Realistically, you&#039;ll probably have to settle on some sort of compromise between true blacks and a bit of black crush as no display is perfect. But hey, that ghosting should be gone at least.", "time": 1674540713, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9597950, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)02:07:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;build gbsc, forget jumper</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;plug it into pc crt</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crt goes berzerk &quot;117khz 240hz out of range&quot; with green flashes of light</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fix gbs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now pc monitors makes progressively louder high pitch squeal at 640x480, gone in other resolutions</span><br>di...did I fuck up?", "filename": "06a", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 606, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1674544066693093, "time": 1674544066, "md5": "CwRG4KYruIQjk+3tsEyo9Q==", "fsize": 32915, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598045, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:03:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597950</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fuck up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ask if you fucked up</span><br>lol. why?", "time": 1674547438, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598059, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9597859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9597859</a><br>cheers, i&#039;ll try that out later", "time": 1674548000, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598074, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9598045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9598045</a><br>Yeah but did I fuck up enough to where my crt will die?", "time": 1674548507, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598121, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:52:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588807</a><br>What model is pic rel from?", "time": 1674550331, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598176, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:14:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9591052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9591052</a><br>Infinite is good fun", "time": 1674551693, "resto": 9588703}, {"no": 9598265, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)05:36:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588703</a><br>Yeah.

NES games run great, you can move with the joystick.<br><br>Ocarina of Time and Master Quest run very well, with the later adding some very challenging content. You can set the C buttons either to X, Y, and Z or use the directions on the C stick. I ended up using the C stick since it was easier to visualize. It was a little weird at first, but after a few hours I was a pro at flinging the stick to use items. Z targeting becomes L targeting which is just as effective. I really enjoyed playing these with the GC controller. As for the content, it has dome minor changes like the fire temple music, mirror shield, etc.<br><br>Unfortunately, what people are saying about Majora\u2019s Mask emulation is true.

I never knew why they did that when it seemed so arbitrary, but my instincts are they created something cool, wanted it in the game, and put them in just to do it, just for visual variety and to just kinda be noticed.

I think a collection is most appreciated when it represents the tastes and spirit of the collector. That being said, its possible for you or anyone else to get into Gamecube even with the recent high prices if you set your goals correct.<br><br>For instance, you may be be totally happy building a collection just consisting of Paper mario and 5 or 10 other games you really enjoy. Set a goal to get there. If you have more disposable income it makes it easier obviously but even if not you can collect it slowly over time. Start with Paper Mario, the game is up over 100 dollars now but if you keep an eye out you can probably snag it around 80 CIB and in good shape if you&#039;re willing to hunt around a few months. Also, maybe you have some other things you could sell towards that game. Games you own but don&#039;t really care for, some old guitar that&#039;s been sitting in your closet collecting dust for 10 years, whatever. Use the Marie Kondo method to find what sparks joy to get rid of and apply the same method to the games you build into your collection.<br><br>I had the fortune to collect some Gamecube games before the price jump but still finish my collecting during 2020 and 2021. Just collect slowly and thoughtfully and it will be a rewarding experience for you.<br><br>I&#039;ve gotten into collecting for several consoles that people say its &quot;too late&quot; to collect for by this method and its been an enjoyable experience. Even after collecting those games its also been a good investment as the value has steadily risen compared to what I paid, which is cool- not that I&#039;m planning to sell anything now.

There are several characters, Gau included, that are potentially way more powerful than Sabin can ever be, but the issue here is twofold: one, you have to know how to equip and build them up to get them to that bullshit OP stage, and two, it typically takes quite a bit more work. So like you said, you have to know which of Gau&#039;s Rages are the broken ones and you gotta take time off to hunt for them, which can be tedious as fuck. For another example, Terra and Celes&#039;s ultimate setup (with maxed MBlock plus the Gem Box) requires not only figuring out that maxed Mblock makes you almost invincible, but also hunting down all the necessary equips, which are scattered all over the WoR, so you likely won&#039;t achieve it until near the end of the game. Meanwhile, the only obstacle Sabin has to maxing out his potential is figuring out where Duncan is, which isn&#039;t hard at all. It&#039;s quick, it&#039;s easy, can be done super early, and then spammed relentlessly.

Retro overpricing was heavily ramping up by then.<br><br>I sold just the BOXES for some of my old consoles and N64 games for several hundred altogether. In fact, I sold some of the extra consoles I had lying around that I no longer need and they went for much less than the empty boxes, unless it&#039;s a more recent console.<br><br>I was never much of a collector, at most I like to collect some of the more noteworthy games or ones from the past that I just really liked but I never cared too much about the boxes or condition over just playing the games. I have no desire to have a &quot;full collection&quot; for a console like some have, at least, not in physical form. I lucked out a bit though, went on a spending spree for old N64 and PS1 games around 2006, a little before the retro-boom. I remember it being considered expensive to pay more than $10 for a PS1 or N64 game that wasn&#039;t something rare, Amazon was full of hundreds of sealed boxed copies of Perfect Dark for $3 each. Managed to snag dozens of the N64 and PS1 games I always wanted to play, or had rented and loved but never owned for $1-5 each. Even ones that are expensive nowadays like Conker, the Banjo games, 007, every WWF game, Yoshi&#039;s Story, Mystical Ninja, Bomberman, and a few others... sadly I think I didn&#039;t get Diddy Kong Racing or the Turok games. Most are just the cart, but a few like Conker are CIB... that have actually degraded a bit because I had no idea I should have stored them well at the time.<br><br>That being said a few are special to me, such as a copy of Megaman 1 complete in box that I got for a mere 25 cents at a garage sale less than a year ago. I was very very tempted to sell it since that tends to go for over $300, but I wanted to just have at least one thing special since as far as I am aware nothing in my entire game collection since I started gaming in the NES era is special or rare and decided to keep it.<br><br>(Also, WATA can go burn in hell)", "filename": "4epcp7otecu61", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 56, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674767519588898, "time": 1674767519, "md5": "jrc566A+xXK+o89/saOSVw==", "fsize": 302432, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9605283, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)16:18:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604935</a><br>Yep, in box too.", "time": 1674767900, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9605526, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)17:45:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605270</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WATA grading</span><br>Useless", "time": 1674773159, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9605950, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9605283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9605283</a><br>hot glue....", "time": 1674783781, "resto": 9604935}, {"no": 9606187, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:39:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9604935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9604935</a><br>No. I even reserved it and got it the day it came out.

As the result of nationalist and supply and demand economic policies, there was little incentive to invest on manufacturing tools and improving labour skills. Manufacturing cost was expensive compared to their competitors, so most of the British wealthy chose to invest in the service sector. Politicians like Callaghan tried to push back against this shift and make British manufacturing competitive again by taxing the service sector, limiting pay raises and such, but it was met with heavy pushback which led to what was known as &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;. Thus, Thatcher was elected, and she deregulated the market while pursuing a monetarist policy that hurt British exports. Trade unions were seen to be a scary and powerful that threatened the crumbling British industry back then, but Thatcher&#039;s policy to remove their bargaining power altogether was proved even more detrimental to the industry<br><br>TL;DR manufacturing lost, finance won. They couldn&#039;t keep up with the rapid pace of the Japanese and German industry, and those who tried to save it did a few blunders that caused a pushback.

OoT was a very good start on 3D combat but right now I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry and <s>Dark Souls not retro though</s>.<br><br>The prior focuses on giving the player as many combat options as possible and makes that the fun of the game. Launchers, flying attacks, guns, ways to combo enemies, parries, everything you could want to do. These games are more about being stylish than just outright winning the fight. However this limits the enemy design as these games can quickly become unfun if there&#039;s too many enemies you can&#039;t combo effectively, or if the bosses act in a way that&#039;s too limiting to your arsenal.<br><br>While the latter is the exact opposite, you have an extremely narrow set of options in combat. Block, dodge, light swing, heavy swing, shoot projectile and maybe a few more options. While this seems limiting it allows the developers to focus much more heavily on challenging enemy design based on how enemies respond and require you to use the few options in your arsenal. People generally love boss fights in these kind of games for this exact reason, every single boss is like learning a song in a rhythm game since its mostly been simplified to &quot;when do I dodge and when do I hit?&quot;.<br><br>OoT has a lot of options that lack purpose. Yes you can angle your swipes, horizontally or vertically, but what value does that have over just hitting the B button? The answer is none because enemies don&#039;t respond to things in ways that warrant you to change that. Would crouch stabbing have any value if it wasn&#039;t just objectively the best DPS in the game? I don&#039;t think so, because no enemies have a mechanic where you need to crouch to evade their attacks. Dodge mechanics are hardly even necessary because only a tiny few enemies can threaten your shield, I can&#039;t even think of any other than Darknuts.<br><br>So I think that answers your question, quality &gt; quantity.", "filename": "20245725_1390952080994962_7348464048814365511_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 658, "h": 370, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674842161091574, "time": 1674842161, "md5": "zWcQa8zfOLvO/HZ8GMt9rQ==", "fsize": 25081, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607775, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry</span><br>you are wrong<br>it&#039;s <s>the batman arkham games</s>", "time": 1674842493, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607783, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:04:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607775</a><br>i really only see other superhero games copying that but yeah that one is influential unfortunately, I don&#039;t think its as much as the 2 I said though.", "time": 1674842640, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9608043, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:54:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607519</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;second song</span><br>good job proving my point with one of the most grating instruments used.", "time": 1674849272, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609634, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br>They should increase the quality instead of reducing the quantity", "time": 1674905120, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609819, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you want peak sword combat, check out Jedi Outcast", "time": 1674913481, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609823, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>the harmonica? not my fault you got shit taste", "time": 1674913581, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610042, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>This might be the wrong board for you if you need the clearest music possible and can&#039;t appreciate retro music by merit of memorable melodies <br><br>Kakariko is THE comfy-village music", "time": 1674920798, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610047, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:47:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609819</a><br>This game is the definition of janky", "time": 1674920873, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610052, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:49:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dark Souls not retro though.</span><br>But that&#039;s influenced by Zelda in the first place and extremely basic.

They shot a Battletoads made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at Battletoads into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.

I even found myself in a dead man walking scenario because I was playing too slow: a jump I didn&#039;t have enough momentum to make, but I couldn&#039;t backtrack for said momentum<br><br>so the game is all about dying and dying and learning everything by heart while mastering the somewhat unique controls (this was long before controls in games were streamlined and standardized and every game plays the same), it will test your memory and your muscle memory and your patience.

You&#039;ll need the Parent ROM, and whatever Clone ROM you want for that specific region/revision of the game. Merged is the BIOS files, parent, and all clones in the same .zip file, meaning all needed files to make the Parent work are present, and with some work you can get the Clones to work as well. Which is good if you aren&#039;t picky about the region/revision. Un-Merged is the parent and clones having their own .zip files that contain ALL needed files to work. There&#039;s a great deal of duplication because of this, but every single .zip file is stand-alone and you can be certain that one .zip will have everything you need.<br>Split is for people who want to be efficient and have everything, Merged is for people who want to have everything but have a cleaner directory with less .zip&#039;s.

Connect your controller of choice.<br>2. Go to Control Panel &gt; Device Manager &gt; Human Interface Devices &gt; HID Conform Game Controller &gt; Your Controller &gt; Properties &gt; Details &gt; pick Hardware IDs from the drop down menu and note it down.<br>3. Write a text document like pic related to permanently map your buttons to player 1 using your controller&#039;s hardware ID*** (see 2nd post). Save as a cfg-file and name it a single word without any spaces or special characters.<br>4. Put the new cfg-file into a directory called &#039;ctrlr&#039; inside your MAME program directory. Create it if it doesn&#039;t exist already.<br>5. Open mame.ini &gt; Under section &#039;# CORE SEARCH PATH OPTIONS&#039; set &#039;ctrlrpath&#039; to &#039;ctrlr&#039;. Under section &#039;# CORE INPUT OPTIONS&#039; set &#039;ctrlr&#039; to the name of your remap cfg-file. Leave out the file extension.<br>6. Delete &#039;default.cfg&#039; in the &#039;cfg&#039; directory of your MAME installation. Your remap is the new default now!

Most FF fans are completely artistically illiterate and can&#039;t see any nuance. Sephiroth is shown to be cold and ruthless even when he was a &quot;hero.&quot; He was raised to be a killing machine, held up as a figurehead for Shinra&#039;s propaganda, showered with praise for slaughtering any perceived enemy, and we learn from Lucretia that he was never even held by his mother as a baby; he was whisked off by scientists to be a research specimen the moment he was born. You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see how fucked up someone would be from living a life like that. Even before the Nibelheim incident, he was, at best, a functional sociopath with a massive superiority complex, but most players completely miss all of that and take the claim that he&#039;s a hero at face value. <br><br>I&#039;d also argue that he doesn&#039;t actually give a shit about Jenova or the Ancients. Those are just post-hoc rationalizations he uses to justify his desires. When he reads in Gast&#039;s research notes that Jenova is an Ancient, he claims that entitles him to take the planet back from the humans who betrayed the Ancients. Later, when he travels through the Lifestream and learns the truth about Jenova (that she was actually just a monster that wiped out the Ancients), he twists it around and says that he&#039;s entitled to rule the planet because Jenova was even greater than the Ancients were. In other words, all he really wants is to satisfy his own ego by elevating himself up to godhood compared to the rest of the world, and he&#039;ll use whatever excuse he can come up with to justify it.", "time": 1674613383, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka is\u2026 Sephiroth</span><br>this nigga doesn\u2019t understand how numbers work", "time": 1674614692, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600392, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka\u2026 gets his plans foiled</span><br>You didn\u2019t even play the game.

Curtains Down from Blood Money is a lot more satisfying when you understand the context of the scene the target is playing out, for instance.<br><br>The opera is called Tosca, and thats the ending scene. There&#039;s at least a dozen Kojima-tier absurd plot twists that precede it, but basically the character being executed believes that its a mock execution, because the chief of police pardoned him but had to keep up appearances because he&#039;s known for being tough on crime. Usually on stage, that character acts like a chad with no fear of death, and his girlfriend is singing these joking lyrics about what a good actor he is while the music itself is really tense and clues you in that he&#039;s actually fucked and the police chief didn&#039;t actually give the order to pardon. He gets shot and dies with a look of shock on his face, and his girlfriend jumps off a cliff to avoid arrest, then curtains the end.<br><br>So in a meta sense, the two targets are actually playing the roles of the two opera characters, and 47 is actually playing the role of the executioner.

But sadly, I don&#039;t think I have the files anymore to prove that it was ever real. But, back in the early 2000&#039;s, I remember downloading a pirate copy of the original DOS release of Carmageddon via a P2P program , I think it was Kazzaa, but could have been Lime Wire. I used them all, so I forget. This version of Carmageddon that I had on my PC came with a ATi D3D patch that could run the game in Windows XP without DOS. I sadly may have deleted that version of the game, not knowing how rare that direct 3D patch was. But it was real. I was playing Carmageddon with accelerated graphics. I am not lying, BTW. I do think this ATi patch was done by the same group that did the Tomb Raider direct 3D patch from ATi, that later surfaced. Maybe I have this version on an old HDD, but I am not sure anymore.

Its a game that needs to be looked at from a 1997 point of view. It still has a lot of 2d platformer elements to it like linearity although you can move freely. Take Mario 64 out of the equation and it looks good with big open levels. Crash was out in 97, but Croc is more open and exploration based. Croc is different enough from Crash and good enough in its own way to be unique and fun in comparison. This isn\u2019t the case when compared with Mario 64. They have a lot in common and Mario beats Crocs ass.<br><br>What else was out in 97? Jumping Flash is a somewhat similar game but in first person. Ninpen Manmaru on Saturn is similar in quality. A little less collection and a little more obstacle course. Chameleon Twist on N64 was similar in quality, it had some better bosses but more linear levels. I\u2019d say all four are about even.<br><br>Tomb Raider was better but of course its very different. It still blew Croc and most of these others out of the water as a 3d platformer, but its a bit of an apples to oranges comparison. Same applies to Goemon on N64. <br><br>I\u2019ve never played Floating Runner, Soultrap or the first N64 Doraemon but they probably suck. Jersey Devil is on my to do list and might be good, idk. Croc shits all over Bubsy. That leaves the Sonic World part of Sonic Jam, which controls better with an analog stick but isnt really much of a game. Let\u2019s say croc is better than all of thesewith JD as a question mark.<br><br>That leaves Croc as a middle tier 3d platformer at the time it was released. But this was so early and 3d platformers were so primitive that they hadn\u2019t really all gotten refined gameplay, camera and control wise. Within a few years in the late 90s many 3d platformers that I\u2019d consider better were released on the N64, PS1 and Dreamcast.

At one point there were THREE different competing pitches for a Mario Paint 64, some ignored by Nintendo of America because they didn&#039;t want to release the other one (like what happened with Disaster Day of Crisis Wii around the same time as Project Hammer... at that time Nintendo of America was openly mocking some games in official PR as the excuse why Europe had them but not America. That kind of mentality.) In the end none of those attempts released in North America, and one was cancelled and partially repurposed for the Mario Artist lineup. Mario no Photopi was on a regular N64 cart and still was snubbed by NoA (who had a knack for rejecting the N64DD or announcing on their own that N64DD software will be cartridge only in the West, which couldn&#039;t have helped the device&#039;s fortunes as it was repeatedly delayed in Japan past commercial viability despite being ready around 1998 or so (even a NA prototype exists, and the N64DD has extensive font support for English and European languages that goes unused).<br><br>Sin and Punishment was always intended to be released outside of Japan, there&#039;s some NoA credits for the translated voice acting too, but they decided to cut short everything related to it around late 1999... then somehow Conker, Dr Mario and Paper Mario were alright as late as 2001. That&#039;s one and a half years of software drought before the GC with no real reason.<br><br>No wonder NoA got a big house cleaning from the Japanese HQ shortly after to massively reduce their independence, and then some more after Project Hammer (which siphoned AAA budgets on lavish CG cutscenes for no real reason while first party games were passed over over &quot;budget&quot; penny pinching) and then after they killed the Wii momentum in 2009.", "time": 1675096390, "resto": 9613757}, {"no": 9615818, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)11:43:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9613757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9613757</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pokemon Stadium</span><br>???", "time": 1675097015, "resto": 9613757}, {"no": 9615962, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)12:54:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9615818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9615818</a><br>The original one with a small roster and not as many people to fight", "time": 1675101285, "resto": 9613757}, {"no": 9616285, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)15:26:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9613757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9613757</a><br>FUN and SOUL: The Boxart", "time": 1675110410, "resto": 9613757}, {"no": 9616568, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)17:23:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No, none of those would be worldwide hits.", "time": 1675117404, "resto": 9613757}, {"no": 9617372, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:17:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9616568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9616568</a><br>Indeed, imagine thinking Pok\u00e9mon would be a hit", "time": 1675138675, "resto": 9613757}, {"no": 9617380, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:19:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9616568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9616568</a><br>With the right marketing most of those could.

No more licensed music for an enjoyable soundtrack of stupid but fitting pop music, hiding the volleyball and friendship development behind forced horny segments, it&#039;s just not the same. I think once Itagaki was gone they just gave in, he was probably the only person stubborn enough to insist on making a gravure that you could play or watch; The games after him are overwhelmingly focused on sex at the cost of the rest. Yes, the whole series is sold on sex, but the first two games have a much more quality execution and are focused on the game. After him, the games are just cheap ogling without the backbone that held it up. I think the most telling proof is in how many women are fans of the first Xbox game. They didn&#039;t come for the tits (necessarily...) but for the volleyball and friend making. That was a game that knew how to cater to more than just desperate men. I think its decline is generally ignored (vs something like ninja garden 3) because people just assume that babes in bikinis=trash game.

I think this game was excellent when it came to the music (that main menu theme!) and the overall plot and presentation was great. Lara never looked better imo. The gameplay is what kills it. The last levels from Strahov onward are simply unfinished and cut extremely short. I would have loved to see more of that world and the stuff they would have us raid from tombs. Each classic tomb raider game really did something completely different from the last one. Collecting an Atlantean artifact from lost civilisations that developed from a cataclysm, destroying an Italian cult focussed around a Chinese dagger that turns you into a dragon hunting through sunken ships (interesting choice of tomb), Collecting meteorite splinters from all over the world for a weird social darwinist gone power-mad only to then kill him, and then a game focussed around the apocalypse being started by a haughty Lara picking up the amulet of Seth (1999 had many apocalypse plots, even V:tM Redemption), Chronicles was all over the place, and finally this weird cinematic plot of a serial killer and Icons that you need to collect and periapt shards you need to defeat the weird half-angel Nephilim race. <br><br>Tomb Raider was a wild ride. It really pisses me off that the gameplay for the final game was so piss-poor. There is lots of potential in that game and afaik they wanted to do so much more.
