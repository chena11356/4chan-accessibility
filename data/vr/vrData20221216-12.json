MiSTer is a project that is taking advantage of a cheap FPGA that people can buy, called the DE-10 Nano. The DE-10 Nano is cheap because it is made for college students, and is subsidized by Intel. The DE-10 Nano has an FGPA on board, as well as an ARM chip. It has various connectors on the board for expandability. MiSTer has a bunch of FPGA cores (much like the cores you would see on one of the Analog systems) for consoles, handhelds, arcade boards and computers. Developers are constantly adding more cores and improving on existing cores. A hobbiest community has popped up around this project, which has led to a lot of hardware addons that can be installed onto the DE-10 Nano, such as extra RAM, a digital or analog I/O board, USB hub (these things make up the most common MiSTer setup that you have likely seen, which is a sandwich of three boards with the DE-10 Nano in the middle)... etc. There are people who have made specialized expansion boards like the MiSTercade, which allows it to be used in a typical JAMMA arcade cabinet. At a base level, you really just need the DE-10 Nano, and preferably a RAM stick, the rest is optional.<br><br>MiSTer can be appealing to enthusiasts because it offers better accuracy/latency compared to software emulation. It&#039;s also very easy to set up and use in a variety of scenarios, without having to invest in a bunch of extra shit like flash carts, upscalers, custom cables... etc. It is an all-in-one solution for many of the systems that a retro gamer would be interested in. By its nature, it is also very customizable. <br><br>I still think that software emulation is a good option, especially on a budget since you can probably do it on hardware that you already own, however I do like my MiSTer quite a bit and I find that I am playing more /vr/ games than ever since getting it.", "filename": "mister-sandwich", "ext": ".png", "w": 611, "h": 856, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670246300392107, "time": 1670246300, "md5": "fcC4uIUOYU6IZ0kAMoy3Dw==", "fsize": 945737, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468185, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)11:56:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467832</a><br>I was just fishing for (you)s and shitposts but this high effort response doesn&#039;t deserve it", "time": 1670259366, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468240, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)12:25:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467669</a><br>Cope comes for free with being a poorfag as well kiddo", "time": 1670261105, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468353, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)13:15:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9465495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9465495</a><br>Yes.

The mugger in the street and the thug in the alley are possible soft-locks. If you&#039;ve already hit the mugger a few times, the next hit results in death. The only way past him after that, and the thug in the alley, is the $20 bill in your wallet(or one you steal from Sugar Shack after knocking her ass out). If you spend that $20 on a new gun to avoid another soft-lock, then you can wind up stuck with the mugger or thug with no way out.<br>Why buy a new gun? Because there is a random soft-lock in the sewers after you get rid of the murder weapon. I had it happen to me. After throwing away the gun, you can encounter the Alligator in the sewers. Only way to survive the gator is to shoot him. No new gun = stuck in the sewers with no way out other than death.<br>I actually recommend headed to the police station prior to going to the sewers just to encounter Sugar Shack, knock her out, and take her money to get yourself the new gun before going into the sewers, so you still have a $20 for the mugger, then staying out of the alley where the thug is. This way you avoid both potential soft-locks.<br>Another softlock happens if you enter a cab and travel but don&#039;t have the 3 coins to pay off, or leave Peoria St with less than 6 coins.

Perhaps it&#039;s part of an appeal to the genre but so many other games in this genre generally feel more along the lines of &quot;passion projects&quot; with a number of apparent flaws that would turn off average consumers, only RE and SH really feel like true &quot;big budget&quot; experiences. I was only born in 98 but to anyone that grew up with it just how long did RE stay relevant?

Even Silent Hill, its greatest rip-off, is absolutely nothing like Resident Evil. It has virtually no item management, and ammo is not scarce at all. Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist.

SH3 both tries to tell a deeper narrative happening around the protagonist and those around her but also have her experience her own personal journey, it&#039;s a very ambitious narrative that, overall, I would say works out well but doesn&#039;t feel quite as cohesive as the prior two entries. Generally I think people see SH3 as having &quot;less meaning&quot; in what the game, and this is true in a few regards but still pretty inaccurate to the overall. Honestly I think the symbolism and themes go over people&#039;s heads because they&#039;re so heavily based in the feminine experience. If you&#039;re a guy I feel like it&#039;s likely you just kind of don&#039;t think about things like the game&#039;s various menstrual imagery, though some things like the hole leading to the final boss are hard to miss.<br><br>I always have a hard time deciding between SH1 and SH3 as my personal favorite. SH3 has a lot going for it with the most refined gameplay and graphics of the series, but it&#039;s also the most obviously compromised of the first three games. The game has essentially no exploration outside of the dungeons and a handful of &quot;grab thing, walk a room over, use thing&quot; moments. It&#039;s a great game on its own merits, but how it compares to prior entries and their strengths gives a lot of differing thoughts. I would say that, as simply a &quot;video game&quot;, that SH3 is the best, as to be expected being the newest, but it&#039;s clear pure gameplay is not why people love horror games.", "filename": "Ffn6nbWVQAAigcN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670955746219477, "time": 1670955746, "md5": "PMYuoi9u29tzPP5ZgPM7Cg==", "fsize": 63545, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488604, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Allow me to put this retarded discussion to rest.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 wikipedia is wrong </span><br>Okay school teacher.", "filename": "1649719663676", "ext": ".png", "w": 552, "h": 32, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 7, "tim": 1670955848062248, "time": 1670955848, "md5": "SWb5cKYBsciKWJJ4uj/yWQ==", "fsize": 5896, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488609, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488604</a><br>I know you must be genuinely retarded but yes, that is why wikipedia is generally agreed to be a fucking non source for anything unless wikipedia directly links to the actual source, literally fucking anyone can write in it and unless someone decides that what was written was wrong (and the cucks in charge agree with the changes) then that is the information present <br><br>fuck off literal NPC", "time": 1670956080, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488610, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *actual*, real thing that separates a &quot;survival horror&quot; game from something else is the true permanence of consequence</span><br>That has literally nothing to do with survival horror.

Normally you would say the sub-genre, but if you said &quot;action game&quot; then you know what the gameplay will revolve around: hand-eye coordination challenges. There are action games that are also horror. Not survival horror. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; notice how you again conceded the inventory management point. </span><br>You never finished your point or responded to mine. What does moving the items around do fundamentally to the gameplay? You aren&#039;t prevented from continuing the game if you don&#039;t move them around. The reason it&#039;s even mentioned as a thing in other RE games is because you have to make sure that you have space for key items, which requires sacrificing already limited space. <br>When I mentioned RE4 has unlimited inventory space for key items, you said it would be absurd to try to play the game otherwise. Why? Because then you&#039;d have to balance your weapons and ammo with the key items. Crazy? For a game that emphasizes combat, not for a survival horror game.", "time": 1671052283, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9491469, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)16:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9475249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9475249</a><br><br>are you me, im 35 now and have a daughter and i suddenly got the urge to play all silent hill. i was to scared to when i was younger, also bought original re and dino crisis", "time": 1671052650, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9492090, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9491454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9491454</a><br>ok fine, re4 isn&#039;t survival horror because there&#039;s unlimited space in your inventory for key items. i guess i&#039;ll go play REAL survival horror like silent hill or fatal frame with their re1-inspired inventory syste-...uh oh", "time": 1671071460, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9492118, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:47:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "For me?

Basically the analog stick started dropping inputs, so for example if you were running forward as Link in OoT he would stop and start - essentially unusable. Both had the exact same problem. <br>Unfortunately they both had fallen just outside the warranty window, and their support didn&#039;t even reply when I sent them like a &quot;Hey, anything I can try to do to fix these?&quot; <br>About a year later someone on twitter was asking about them, and I outlined that whole chain of events to them and said that I don&#039;t recommend them at all. From that tweet, their PR/customer support team reached out to me and ultimately actually shipped me two of the newer wireless versions by way of apology. And the wireless one has held up a lot better than the originals. At least, so far. <br>So maybe the takeaway is, they used to be utter crap, and now are (hopefully) a lot better. The analog stick on all of these these is just kind of weird though. <br><br>In the interim I used the wired Retro-Bit Tribute64 (which is modeled after the famous Hori N64 controller) and I actually liked this a lot better than any of the Brawler64s. The only problem with these is that the connector has an absolute death grip on the controller port, which is why I switched back to the wireless Brawler64 for right now - since I didn&#039;t want to be unplugging and replugging that controller all the time, and wireless controllers just keep things a bit more tidy. You know how it is. <br><br>There is an N64 controller purist on this board who will tell you that the analog stick sensitivity and deadzones of any of these 3rd party controllers is crap compared to the original - he&#039;s got charts and whatnot to back it up.

The logical conclusion is to get the correct controller for each of the consoles you plan to emulate. Because of the gulf in quality between first party controllers and third party USB clones, you&#039;re going to want first party original controllers and of course because there is no way to connect them to a PC, high quality adapters for them so for every emulator you&#039;ll have to drop around $25-50 + $25-45 for controllers and adapters. Before you know it you&#039;ll be knee deep in a bin full of controllers with different dongles. Hope you got high quality ones, chink ones don&#039;t even last 5 cycles.<br><br>So the cost of free emulation after a $1000 + PC is pretty high. That&#039;s about $80 for each console you want to emulate. Now you just have to spend time configuring every game for every emulator, setting up hacks so they actually run, pining for fixes in nightly releases and tweaking CRT shaders.<br><br>Will it be worth it?", "time": 1671074102, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490758</a><br>dogshit dpad", "time": 1671075021, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492228, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9491105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9491105</a><br>have sex, touch grass, and take meds, freak", "time": 1671076393, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492292, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:35:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490375</a><br>Why didn&#039;t they go all out and give it triggers?

It&#039;s objectively the PS3 controller and I&#039;ll tell you why. Xbox controllers don&#039;t have the gyroscope or whatever it&#039;s called (six axis motion?) and the PS4 controller comes close, but it doesn&#039;t have pressure sensitive face buttons. Most controllers have pressure sensitive triggers, but that&#039;s it. Basically, this is the only controller that allows you to lightly press any button and also registers tilt. Why does this matter you ask? Because there are a few games where this is absolutely needed. If I remember correctly, the Metal Gear solid games from the ps2 needed this and when they were ported to xbox they needed to redo these mechanics. Also you can emulate the ps3 nowdays so there&#039;s Heavely Sword, etc. The only downside is that it doesn&#039;t use a micro usb like the PS4 controller, it uses a mini usb.

For example, Star Fox on real hardware: <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaW<wbr>PTnHUEAY<br>(note how the intro cut sscene ends at the right music cue) <br><br>30fps overclock: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ6<wbr>pWTe-Sd8<br><br>Polygon cutscene ends way before the music ends. The devs designed Star Fox around its awful framerate. In order to make Star Fox look right at 60fps, the game would have to be modified to match the timing of the new framerate.

Going from being the King&#039;s Field and AC devs to then hitting there stride with the Souls formula and getting themselves out of that perception of being a lower tier company. I guess filling in that mecha niche helped them to be carried as you put it. Just think of all those other companies that were in their shoes at one point. Most didn&#039;t make it to today. They either got bought out and completely gutted until they were a soulless in name only company or they just were outright made defunct. Lets take EA for example, you got Bioware which was actually honestly at the time of EA&#039;s acqusition a much bigger and more known company than From. People loved Bioware even prior to EA.

I generally call these types of games &#039;gun-formers&#039;. Gunformers, are the types of games that feature maze like level design with lots of platforming and your primary weapon being projectile. Turrican was kinda the type of game that spawned this genre. I would say Metroid, but Metroid has too much exploration to fall into this category. Robocop vs Terminator, Judge Dredd (SNES game), Cool Spot, because you shoot all the time, Earthworm Jim 1 at least, Alien 3 Mega Drive/ Genesis, Demolition Man. I&#039;m sure others can think of more. That&#039;s the genre I put Vectorman in, as most of the levels follow that formula. Vectorman tries to mix it up with different formulas, though. Game looks really nice, it has a generally good soundtrack (to me), the levels are good. Some bosses are cool looking. But some are way to gimicky. Like the train boss is not good. the disco stage boss where you spin around in circles is a bit lame. It&#039;s OK for one of these games. But Hard Corps is better overall. Contra III on the SNES is better. I remember playing Vectorman 2 all the way up to the half way point, but never fully completed it. Vectorman 2 is a spectacle for the hardware, with enhanced simulated lighting and bigger sprites, it is an impressive tech demo for the hardware in 1996. Anyway. Not too bad as a sequel. I feel like the levels were a little more streamlined, but the game made harder. It has the generic 3D tunnel effect stage, found in all of the Genesis/ Mega Drive games, like Garfield and batman and Robin. Also wasn&#039;t a fan of the over head stages with the rocket. I rank it as B tier series.

Battling itself actually helps remove monsters stress. As you accumulate larger amounts of cash, it&#039;s definitely good to prioritize buying all the more expensive stress relieving, fatigue relieving, and sleep helping items you&#039;ll see in the shop like the cups and gems, as can afford them of course, don&#039;t skip out on them, they&#039;ll make it easier for new monsters. Also don&#039;t let your monster get fat or malnourished, fat monsters get fatigued more and underweight monsters get stressed more.<br><br>Also take it easy on baby monsters, just do the most basic training until its more mature aka when Holly tells gives you that cue that it&#039;s an &quot;important time&quot; or whatever she says, that&#039;s when you start the coach routines<br><br>Always focus on like 3, maybe 4 main stats to train your monster in. Having a balanced monster doesn&#039;t really work because there&#039;s only so much time you can put into training during its lifespan, you want your monster to excel hard in specific areas, not be average in many areas, so take that into consideration when deciding what monster you wanna raise and how you want it to grow/what moves you want it to learn<br><br>When you&#039;re stronger and start doing sparring with the intention of learning new moves specifically, it&#039;s not really worth it unless you&#039;re gonna learn a new move, so don&#039;t bother wasting the money and time unless it says there&#039;s a chance your monster will learn a new move, and honestly I say theres no shame in saving before and restarting until you learn the move", "time": 1670371774, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9471981, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Jell<br>but the one I used to win with was Hare", "time": 1670372119, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472112, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:14:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471460</a><br><a href=\"#p9471549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471549</a><br>What are you doing, dude?", "filename": "1308028510381", "ext": ".png", "w": 496, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1670375679755307, "time": 1670375679, "md5": "vQBz/xGhIxFw/6o0Q324aA==", "fsize": 134450, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472651, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)00:50:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Kato, named him Risk and built him pure agi and int?/tech?(the one that increases the damage of the green skills) and spammed the twister/tornado claw.

One of the things that impressed me most about PSO on GCN is that everyone can have their own characters on their own memory cards, and are completely independent. If you start a party with friends in FF Crystal Chronicles, your character is stuck in that party. In PSO though, you can play with one group of friends one day, and then take your memory card and use the same character with a completely different group of friends the next day. 4 players can play together with 4 different characters on 4 different memory cards, even though the gamecube only has 2 memory card ports.<br><br>One caveat though; the camera sucks in split screen.

Nobody on our team had worked on an online game, so one of the challenges was getting the team to understand what made online games fun. I had a lot of people play the game, but a lot of them were turned off by the dark fantasy. They would say, \u201cit\u2019s disturbing,\u201d or, \u201cI don\u2019t get why it\u2019s fun.\u201d Trying to unify the team and getting them to understand the direction we wanted to take the game in was very difficult.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: Did you have LAN parties, where you played in a controlled environment so that the team could understand the cooperative elements?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We installed Diablo on everyone\u2019s PC in the office and had a closed LAN and spent many days playing together so that the team could learn what network gaming was all about.</span>", "time": 1670435067, "resto": 9471103}, {"no": 9473767, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)12:45:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9473764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9473764</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: Was there a point where you saw people starting to get the appeal, like the satisfaction of seeing a rare item drop, where you felt the team really get into the game?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some people like Setsumasa stayed around until 10 or 11 p.m. at night after people left the office. He would connect Diablo to the network and play until morning, wake up to work, and then play again. Some of us weren\u2019t going home much at the time. Some people would go home just to bathe, sleep a few hours, come back into the office to work, and then play Diablo at the office. It was mostly in the name of research, though. There are a number of games that we used as inspiration. Diablo was obviously one of them. I had heard that Dragon Quest was inspired by remaking Ultima with a Japanese audience in mind. So our concept was, \u201cLet\u2019s make a Diablo game that would appeal to the Japanese audience.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: With good results. Even though Diablo is a distinctly American game, PSO feels like a very distinctly Japanese game. And yet, it\u2019s not just palatable to Japanese gamers but to everyone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think Diablo is an amazing game, but it\u2019s not a game that appeals to Japanese players. Our suspicion was that Japanese gamers would prefer to cooperate and work together to defeat something more than to compete and fight against other players. That\u2019s why we created PSO to be a cooperative role-playing game. Diablo has cooperative elements but it also has PK and an element of killing other player characters. We eliminated those elements and focused on how we could make a fun, cooperative RPG experience. I think that\u2019s the biggest difference between PSO and Diablo.</span>", "time": 1670435127, "resto": 9471103}, {"no": 9473789, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)12:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I remember there was an MMO called Lineage which looked like Diablo.

Looking back with the benefit of hindsight regarding what I hate the most about games &amp; consoles today, I see that generation as being relatively pure.

Their hardware angle was set and leaned into, their policy and strategy on the brave new werld of microtransactions, unfinished beta AAA releases, bloatgramming, and various other consumer abuses that old games lack were set and normalized.<br><br>Maybe retro can be defined by exactly in which ways companies abused consumers. Back in the day your lives were tied to a real life quarter that you popped into the machine, so the market wanted HARD games that you learned to play by dying repetitively. When the move to console came it wasn&#039;t long till this shifted. Instead of incessantly killing you (unpopular with millenials), the games were filled with meaningless content and time wasters. Companies believed that time spent playing on a home console was a sales leader driving new game purchases. Sounds right to me.

It&#039;s been known since forever ago that Woolsey didn&#039;t deliver the most faithful translation, not to mention all the censorship, which is why we got that old Sky Render fan translation over twenty years ago (that we now know to be amateurish as fuck). Then the GBA game came out, and its translation was recognized to be much more accurate, but it had two problems: first, by that point, Woolsey&#039;s script had obtained meme status, and while the GBA script kept some of his lines, it changed or tossed enough of them out to piss a vocal part of the fanbase off. Second, the GBA version had problems of its own, namely shit music, slowdown and lower resolution, among others. So now you have a bunch of Woolsey fanboys who like the idea of a more accurate script while still staying true to the Woolsey &quot;flavor&quot;, all on the mostly superior SNES version, and before long, we got the Ted Woolsey Uncensored hack. Problem is, its creator didn&#039;t know a lick of moon, so all he did was mix and match bits and pieces of the Woolsey, GBA and Sky Render scripts as he pleased, and to top it off, he decided to also make it an overarching &quot;game improvement&quot; hack that fixed a gorillion longstanding bugs and added QoL changes. This effectively set the mold for all like-minded hacks that followed, all of which were made by people with no nip-speaking credentials, and all of which were convinced they could do it better than the last, especially given they&#039;re not constrained to just script changes, but outright game changes as well, so every new release is just feature creep.

Rolls give banjo acceleration. You then jump mid roll to shoot a decent chunk further and to stop the slowdown from the roll. Speedrunners also have a technique to cycle between the two continuously. That, and there also triple jump tricks to stay in the air longer, where Banjo moves quicker than on the ground. The talon trot is actually not the best speed technique even though it looks like it. Also, people don&#039;t realize there are techniques used to climb and scale vertical platforms, which all involve precision jumping.

But overall anime and Japanese media has become big and ingrained enough that the Working Designs/4Kids/Saban levels of translating something is more met with derision than &quot;oh boy anime&quot;. Even when Nintendo tossed memes into localized scripts of their games, people are more likely to groan and wish they weren&#039;t there now.<br><br>I think part of it too is that Working Designs translated Magic Knights Rayearth, which has the honor of being the last western Sega Saturn game. If it were anything else, sure, but Rayearth was an established franchise and WD putting on their trademark brand of humor soured a lot to them: even back when the game was new, people felt it was an awkward and out of place translation for the game because the anime was available and already had fans. So you have a game that hits a lot of &quot;oh should I check this out&quot; flags (last console release in the west, based on a beloved series, etc) and get hit with &quot;eh, they made it worse&quot; is sort of an &quot;the Emperor isn&#039;t wearing any clothes&quot; moment for them.<br><br>Also they put an ammo system into Silhouette Mirage and that personally rankled me because it meant you never wanted to experiment with different weapons due to the cost to use them, then they added grinding for money on top of it.

The difference is that in Die Hard Arcade, the building is called the Nakatomi building, and you can see the Nakatomi symbol here and there. That\u2019s been cut out of the Japanese version.<br>Sega Saturn Magazine: Are there differences between the characters in both versions?<br>Makoto Uchida: Yes, quite a lot. For Die Hard Arcade, 20th Century Fox told us to not stray from the story of Die Hard too much. Since the movie didn\u2019t revolve around the president [of the U.S.] , we were told to make the girl appearing in the game into the daughter of the head of Nakatomi.

Claims they went into a random beer hall for food and drink, and not long after they arrived, happened to be there for a surreal display, in which an old guy (called &quot;grandpa&quot; by the staff) came in, they revealed a bunch of previously covered images of Nazi symbols and a large portrait of Hitler, and played the Nazi period version of the national anthem while everybody stood at attention, with some singing along (the old guy saluting the portrait). <br><br>Coworker says he was really lucky that despite being American military, he 1) had German ethnicity and looked the part (and the others more or less passed for &quot;European&quot;), 2) he knew German well enough to pass as someone who might be from around the area, and 3) none of his non-german speaking compatriots had said anything to anyone and so had plausible deniability. Said they had been eating and drinking normally before that point, but upon seeing all that (and apparently spotting a number of knives and brass knuckles and other weapons at different tables) decided they should GTFO. Compatriots thanked him for picking a lunch place that all but could have gotten them killed.<br><br>Thinking about it again, my only conclusion is that it must have been a small pocket of extremist germans hiding out in this small town.

I remember playing Doom3 at the time and I enjoyed that at least as much as HL2, and Doom3 is not a fantastic game by any means. Many weapons in HL2 feel off and sloppy (the pistol that goes &quot;paff paff paff&quot;, the smg that just spits out bullets in a weird spray without any real recoil in between bullets but just a random cone of dispersion, etc). The characters and story feel forced, HL did not have a linear story you had to follow, the story was just a backdrop to the action. In HL2 you are forced to sit through what is essentially cutscenes with a lot of &quot;who cares&quot; characters that you are supposed to care about.
