I think the original games had better music and a handful of better lines of dialogue, but FRLG was pretty great otherwise. I like held items, natures and all the other gen 3 junk and honestly like being able to play Red or Green with that stuff thrown in. I liked the way the Pokedex was presented and how the game gives you a little recap of what you last did whenever you load a save.

Would have been sweet to see it introduced with R/S/E instead. Was probably the most logical change to ever come to this franchise but by the time it showed up I was already done with Pokemon so I never played past the third gen of games. It was also nice to see those secret bases be a thing even if there was only a few limited locations for it. Was nice you could link up with friends, even have your friends character persist in your world. The fashion shows were also a fun divergence from the main game. Something this series desperately needed instead of just constant battling. Also made lesser mons and attacks not always completely worthless. Just too bad it was never expanded on really to my knowledge. Pokemon should have went out its way to vastly expand on concepts outside the catching and battling but I guess that leaves no room for milking so of course it wasn&#039;t happening.<br><br>Now as for the GB/GBC era, I actually prefer this era.

The blackjack (note: there is no specific spot you have to hit guards with it, you can do it from any direction, even the front, provided they aren&#039;t in combat) works as a mechanic, because the choice to use it or not use it changes the way the game it played, if you knock guards out you get the burden of hiding their bodies, so other AI don&#039;t see them.

There was an anon whose assessment on this was very on point and I still agree with him. The missions are all designed in a really weird way where the designers seem to expect you to know what to do ahead of time. It could&#039;ve been a &#039;Victorian Star Fox&#039;, but the design just isn&#039;t as tight. Everything&#039;s structured around comboing with special weapons and quickly dispatching shit, but it&#039;s never exactly clear what/where you&#039;re supposed to be aiming at in the enemy ships in order to damage them. There&#039;s mission variety, but many objectives enter a fail state before you&#039;re even given an opportunity to get a visual on it or figure outhow to damage it properly; from an automaton that&#039;ll have destroyed half a town by the time you&#039;ve got a handle on how to fight it, to a merchant ship defense mission where the whole lot&#039;ll be fucked within a minute if you try to fight the swarms attacking them, to the Dorado ship that hides its underbelly underwater and takes forever to kill, every stage fails in its own manner to provide any sort of clarity regarding pivotal goals and mechanics its obfuscated. I eventually figured out, for example, that the game&#039;s mob fighters just infinitely spawn as a means of restocking special weapons/building combos, and so shouldn&#039;t be targeted, but by then I was near at the end of the game.<br><br>I hear this does get more intuitive and fun after like 5+ playthroughs, but it was getting annoying.

The tapwave looks cool, but it actually is awkward to hold and the controls are not so great. The games are pretty good for the small amount that was developed. The ngage has obtuse controls, but it has tony hawk and tomb raider and they are pretty good considering what they were ported onto. Tony hawk is actually really fun to play and is the only version with 2 player mode. The ngage actually pretty cool and I always enjoyed having 6 face buttons, a little awkward at times but not as bad as the zodiac.

PDAs were even more rare (at least where I lived), plenty people didn&#039;t know they existed, and few had one. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We are sort of stuck in this stagnant time for phones without any major innovations what so ever. It\u2019s bizarre. </span><br>The truth is, you can only invent something once. Like you can&#039;t just invent Wi-Fi again, or frontal phone camera again. <br>But in the 90\u20132000s, there were a lot of new tech advances, some fundamentally new things, like e.g. Wi-Fi\u2014they just weren&#039;t popularized yet. And we had a whole new transition of old tech going digital, mobile, and wireless\u2014digital cameras, digital media storage, 3G, etc. And once more, you can&#039;t just &quot;transition to digital&quot; again\u2014it happened once, and that&#039;s it.<br>A lot of the tech that iPhone introduced wasn&#039;t exactly &quot;new&quot;, it had been floating around for years. It simply got mature enough for mass market around late 2000s\u2013early 2010s. Kind of like how VR had been around since forever, but got truly big only in recent years. <br>But sooner or later, you implement all of those ideas that were &quot;floating around&quot;. The competition all copies each other and there&#039;s not much new to introduce. You basically use up all the innovations that had accumulated for decades.<br>So yeah, phones have been stagnating. But that&#039;s just because the &quot;transition to digital&quot; is largely over, it has been done, perfected, and now it&#039;s just marginal improvements.", "time": 1672123392, "resto": 9512032}, {"no": 9520878, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)01:52:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9512032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9512032</a><br>It\u2019s weird to think it was only around for that long, but it had software support longer than that, and the micro came out in 2005.<br>When the DS came out I was done with handhelds.

The DPI race is also over, because frankly, the difference between Full HD phone and 4k phone is negligible. Phone cameras still do improve, but the megapixel race is also kinda over. Going thinner and lighter is not really impressive anymore. Processors and graphics? You already have pretty damn strong CPUs in phones, considering most people use them only to play cookie clickers, and many phone games look about as good as console ones. Hell, I think Apple was the first company ever to use 5-nm chips in their tech. Storage? Stopped being a problem with 128gb phones becoming the norm. Internet? 4G already offers 100-300mbps on paper, that&#039;s more than enough in the era of streaming.<br>Then again, in other things we&#039;re just simply stuck (kinda).

Play if you like quirky games like Wario Ware and rhythm games.<br>3. Advance Wars\u2014personally not a fan, but those who liked it spent hundreds of hours in it. Very addictive strategy game.<br>4. WarioWare\u2014quirky and addictive, one of the more original games for GBA. If you&#039;ve never tried it, do. If you did, still fun to see where it all started from.<br>5. Metroid Fusion\u2014it&#039;s 2D Metroid, enough said. It&#039;s great despite some say it&#039;s not Super Metroid.<br>6. Mother 3\u2014not a perfect RPG, but one many people want to play now. Play if you like Earthbound or want an RPG with plot.<br>7. Wario Land 4\u2014some praise this is as pinnacle of GBA or even best platformer ever, others will write it off as good but ultimately weaker than the GBC ones. Regardless, well worth a try.<br>8. Mario &amp; Luigi\u2014actually very good RPG, only brought down by bing bang wahoo style and kinda whatever graphics.<br>9. Kirbies in general\u2014always fun and worth a play. Play if you like Kirby, don&#039;t play if you&#039;re sick of platformers.<br>10. Mega Man Zero 3 &amp; 4\u2014decent games, but got pretty overrated recently as some &quot;official canon classics&quot;. I beat them all, they&#039;re fun and good but not really masterpieces.

If you love them, you probably know which ones to play anyway, and may prefer remakes. <br>Zelda: Minish Cap\u2014it&#039;s more Zelda.

The go-to example of this is probably The First Templar (way too easy) or Gran Turismo 5 (requires a retarded amount of dedication) not to mention all of the online-only trophies which were functionally impossible to get. <br><br>Nowadays, while there are a lot of games releasing solely for trophy hunters to get an easy platinum, most other achievement lists are designed by the developers themselves rather than a third party.

Even when you consult a level map to get every coin possible, ratchet scrolling means you have to be basically perfect. There&#039;s also the ironman challenge for SMW, or the extra hard cheevos for F-Zero X. It&#039;s also worth mentioning that the API&#039;s implementation is a fantastic training tool for indie devs since you have to dive deep into the code and tinker with lots of stuff just to make a functioning trophy.<br><br>There are definitely games which don&#039;t need achievements at all.
