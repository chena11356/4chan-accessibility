The Spyro games on the GBA are isometric to capture the 3D gameplay of the original games. The GBA in general had a lot more isometric platformer type games than the SNES or the Genesis. Tony Hawk series being a primary example. The GBA had like 5-6 isometric Tony Hawk games. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26<wbr>QnlpaVaA&amp;t=1091s<br>Boktai: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-<wbr>AOaEv0wg<br>Sabre Wulf: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On6<wbr>qrTOiFgY<br>Scurge: Hive : <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ3<wbr>0O799emQ&amp;list=PLuB7mLeC2g3EOC3xLX1B<wbr>QTlpuPViUI0OX<br><br><br>Plus there are a lot of isometric RPG&#039;s/ RPG-likes on the GBA too.

But the Nintendo DS really helped end the life of the GBA sooner than expected. But GBA games were still backwards compatible on the DS and sold alongside it.

None on Neo Geo and CPS2, Mode 7 on SNES.<br>- Scaling. None on CPS2, only shrinking on Neo Geo, both shrinking and enlarging on SNES via Mode 7 (although only BG layer)<br>- Transparency. None on Neo Geo and CPS2, averaging transparency, substracting transparency, addition transparency (something N64 is not capable of, lmao) on SNES.<br>- Real audio DSP - the first in home consoles. CPS2 also has one, but not Neo Geo.<br>Now Neo Geo has power where it actually matters - overclocked CPU and large ROM size which let it brute force some of the best graphics and sound in 2D games, but it was way more conservative and safe bet from hardware standpoint. I am not arguing which one is better overall, of course SNES can&#039;t compete for the most part.

It&#039;s such a stupidly precise jump and failure takes off 16 health out of your 20. You have to walk to the very edge of the first platform to make the jump AND you need to delay your double jump.

Thankfully the spikes deal very little damage so failure isn&#039;t so bad.<br>(2-2): There&#039;s a long jump to pass over insta-kill spikes. Requires a jump similar to 1-1 to make, that is jumping off at the edge + delaying your double jump. Easier to make than 1-1<br>(3-2): There&#039;s an enemy here, the blue maggots, that defy the combat of the game. They charge at you and do not freeze when you hit them. Also gluttony is really hard without magic.<br>(4-1): There&#039;s a part where you have to jump over fire that deals 8hp with goblins blocking your jumps. I just try to get lucky here with spamming attacks and it usually works. Also the platforms are hard to jump on for some reason, you have to land in the middle.<br>(4-2): Random boulders knocking you into pits. I&#039;ve never died to this however.<br>(5-1): There&#039;s a part with a crab and a flying flail guy that&#039;s just pure RNG if you get through it undamaged or not.<br>(6-1): There are 3 ways to get through this stage, and two of them are insanely hard that lead to instant death if failed to platform correctly. The third way is a fast secret way that leads to healing + 1up in a swamp.
