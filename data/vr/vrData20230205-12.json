Few NTSC games (from top of my head, some Megaman games and Metal Max) I couldn&#039;t boot into due to a region-checking feature within the roms themselves flipping out that I&#039;m using a PAL system, but there&#039;s tools out there to deal with that, you patch the game to remove the region lock and it works great. What else... Fan translations work, as do the vast majority of the romhacks, unless they&#039;ve added some sort of a Fastrom or MSU-1 feature.

You can explore towns, talk to people, shop, etc However the combat is tactical grid based. Unlike in FE or Famicom Wars, an attacked unit will not retaliate on the turn it is attacked. Gameplay is based around generals, the player has up to 4 teams each with 1 general and 5 units composed of fighters, archers, and mages (offensive or defensive). Units belonging to a general can not leave the current screen the general is on, so it is him that gives the overall movement of the team.<br>Nice graphics and musics.

You can replay battles to grind for exp/gold and the game seems to expect you to do that at least if you want to buy an acceptable amount of gear in shops.<br>What&#039;s impressive about it is the amount of characters the game can have on the screen at once. The game uses background graphics for the characters, unless it is currently the unit in play in which case it will turn into sprites for the time being. Smart.<br>On the bad side, the game rarely goes beyond the battle-&gt;town-&gt;repeat routine. Most of the game has the same two musics on loop (battle and town), despite the musics being of quality. A waste on that side as well as with graphics, a mangaka was hired for monster designs but you only see enemy designs in small windows when you select them (there are no battle anims).<br>Also, the game insists on using the same few palettes for the majority of towns, even when it really doesn&#039;t fit.

Typical DQ/FF clone material, the story is very clich\u00e9 JRPG stuff, but the game looks great, both in the world and its vibrant colours and the enemy design (lot&#039;s of really big enemy art in combat), and sounds great too and the OST has many tracks, some even dedicated to specific towns or shops.<br><br>Easiest RPG I&#039;ve played on the system in terms of difficulty, it&#039;s almost insulting how easy it is.

And if that wasn&#039;t enough, most items from chests in dungeons respawn so it is easy to farm them (MP refills or sell for money etc) <br><br>Some interesting mechanics, the main one being that you can have up to 3 parties you can switch to in combat. The first party is your main characters, hero+warrior+mage. The second party is made of &quot;Idols&quot;, godly creatures that you find along the way and which mostly just use spells and are AI controlled. The third party consists of soldiers you can hire, you must pay for them and their gear so I never bothered with them. Only the party active at the end of a battle recieves exp. Idols may be fused together to create new idols, however they&#039;ll start over from lvl1, though usually know better spells so it is worth it.<br>Also you can pawn items instead of selling them.<br><br>The game is huge and there are a lot of dungeons, some of which can get a bit mazey, but the dungeons look great and most of them have dedicated art and palettes.<br>The overworld is huge also and once you get the boat, it&#039;s like looking for a needle in a haystack, again and again...

Software emulation can overcome most of the delay at the expense of reduced accuracy.", "time": 1675328121, "resto": 9624132}, {"no": 9624192, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)03:57:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9624180</span><br>shitposting outside of /b/ is a bannable offense anonkun", "filename": "csvsce", "ext": ".gif", "w": 540, "h": 786, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675328263090302, "time": 1675328263, "md5": "il55swCo2dU+vsbWAR62SQ==", "fsize": 87070, "resto": 9624132}, {"no": 9624198, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)04:03:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;make more accurate form of emulation</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t support n64, dreamcast, ps2, anything that needs it really</span><br>what were they thinking?<br><br>an FPGA PS2 would actually be really good - PS2&#039;s hardware quirks mean it&#039;ll never be possible to emulate correctly in software, PCSX2 sucks for many other reasons, and there&#039;s no ODE for PS2 (OPL is not good enough)", "time": 1675328581, "resto": 9624132}, {"no": 9624205, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)04:05:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9624198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9624198</a><br>mcbooft and burned dvds anonkun<br>i have a few ps2 laying about, all in working order<br>i dont expect a micropc to run ps2\\n64\\etc<br><br>however<br>jaguar is supposedly in the works<br>sega saturn and ps1 are practically done<br><br>it is so much better than the &quot;just buy a pi lol&quot; posters &amp; has about 1/10000 the amount of shillposts", "time": 1675328713, "resto": 9624132}, {"no": 9624214, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)04:09:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9624205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9624205</a><br>burning discs &quot;works&quot; but esr has compatibility issues, dual layer discs have problems with mechapwn, modchips are awkward to install, PS2 DVD drives are notoriously unreliable and burning discs is simply less convenient <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;just buy a pi lol&quot; </span><br>Do people still do that?

Eventually the Japanese game came out, and IIRC I even downloaded a ROM for it and tried playing it, but obviously didn&#039;t get far. By the time the actual game came out here, I think I was already turning off of Pokemon and was getting hardcore into Zelda and FF instead. I did replay Gen 1 a couple of times during that time frame, though, so maybe I just turned into a stuffy Genwunner in record time, I dunno. Whatever the case, It took like a decade before I touched another Pokemon game, namely Emerald, Lead Green and Platinum. I did get Soul Silver, but I think having played the previous three nigh back-to-back burned me out, with the last straw being me forgetting to save and turning it off after hours of progress (I was tired and possibly drunk lol).

Fifth one is really solid but also has a very unique gimmick so not a great place to start. 6th one is the most solid over all but it&#039;s also where the series ends and unlike other megaman games, the story isn&#039;t afraid of actually finishing so it&#039;ll be a shame if you actually want to experience the story of the games. <br><br>My recommendation is to skip 1 and start with 2.

Pressed CDs have physical pits that the laser bounces off of, you can&#039;t just drill pits onto a blank CD like that so burned disks instead have an organic dye that the laser literally burns marks onto. These marks can throw off the laser in a similar method to the pits on a CD, but not in the exact same way, it requires more work for the laser to be able to read them. <br> <br>Furthermore CDs are not perfect, those microscopic tracks are not all going to all be pressed into a perfect spiral. A CD-R even moreso, especially when we&#039;re talking about some 25 year old bargain bin burner and definitely if you are stupid enough to just burn it at the highest speed possible. Even with some autophile-grade thousand dollar burner set to 1x, it will never come close to a pressed CD-R in terms of the microscopic spiral of pits not being all over the place. On top of all this, the motor spindle is not perfect either, certainly not within microscopic-level precision. Even the spindle on just the drive reading the disk is going to wobble, and that&#039;s exponentially more wobble when you add in the fact that the disk was burned and the burner&#039;s spindle also introduced wobble during the burning process.<br><br>What all this means is that a burned disk is leagues below a pressed disk in terms of quality and it requires much more effort to read through all of these significantly higher levels of imperfections.<br><br>An optical drive&#039;s laser isn&#039;t static, it has electromagnets that perform micro-adjustments so it can keep track of said groove of pits (or burned ink in this case) while reading the disk, but the harder it has to adjust the more it&#039;s going to wear itself out.

This James Bond is more grounded and cynical, more dark and brutal, he&#039;s far more cold blooded towards his much more cruel enemies, he doesn&#039;t hesitate to kill, and there&#039;s just far less levity and goofy fun. Some who love Moore&#039;s movies hate that, but I love it, BECAUSE it&#039;s very different, and because it&#039;s closer to the books, straying from that isn&#039;t inherently a huge problem, but there&#039;s a value in capturing it.<br>The Living Daylights was probably the most &#039;realistic&#039; movie yet in the series, with a spy plot which was actually very grounded and well planned, featuring fight choreography which felt quite real, yet also very elaborate and creative, the opening fight with the assassin in the kitchen is incredible in setup and execution, by far the best brawl in the series. Yet it still has that 007 charm, it still has the far out gadgets, it still has the gorgeous girl, it still has the lively music, and the scheming mastermind.<br><br>As much as I love Moore&#039;s 007, that was a long stint, and it couldn&#039;t go on forever, moreover the change in direction was ultimately very good, A View To A Kill was already nudging towards that, and I love that movie for it.

It does however keep up the same grounded tone of the Dalton ones, more so even, but the movie would probably have been very similar if they had gotten Dalton to do it as his last one.

Many shit on it because it&#039;s so unique and has a pretty deep learning curve until you&#039;re used to it. But once you are, no other game is like it. You really feel the difference in the weapons, swinging back and forth with the greatsword versus stabbing up and down with the lance. I understand the people who didn&#039;t like it, but to me it&#039;s sublime and the thing I missed most about the game on it&#039;s sequels. <br><br>I am a monster hunter super fan though, it&#039;s probably my favorite series of games ever. I maxed the clock at 999 hours on the original long, long before I stopped playing and other than Tri on the Wii and the World/Rise games I&#039;ve put at least several hundred hours into every one. <br><br>Playing the original now would be kind of sad because the online was such a major component but it&#039;s still an awesome game regardless and the offline game is quite a complete experience in it&#039;s own right. If you like it there&#039;s plenty more Monster Hunter out there to jump into including Generations Ultimate which is basically the best the series has ever been and still has a decent player base. <br><br>That said, the player bases as in all online games are always a little funny. One thing we still joke about is the first time I actually got my PS2 hooked up online. I almost always use greatsword, but happened to have a hammer on me when I came into the hub. I was HR1 so an online newbie, and the first thing said was &quot;hey welcome to MH!

That&#039;s around the era of the console gaming crash, because you had zero quality control for games publishing back then (Nintendo was one of the first to introduce a quality checking system with their Seal of Approval), leading to numerous copy-cat games and an infinite number of below-shovelware titles. On PC it was a bit different, because PC&#039;s back then were expensive, and almost exclusively owned and operated by adults, and if you were developing a game for it, you knew that your core audience was going to potentially be more limited and they were going to be more discerning with their purchases.<br><br>For consoles though, it was a free-for-all.

It had a hundred different guns, you could dual wield machinepistols and rocket launchers. Enemies reacted to what part of their body you shot them, even leading a splat of blood, if you snuck up on a guard and shot him in the asscheek, he&#039;d jump in terror and grab is ass lmao. Some of the death animations were really drawn out and dramatic, as well, and it made the shootouts much more intense, and it was fun miming them at school recess when playing with other kids, sometimes we&#039;d build guns out of Lego, but most of the time just imagining the pistols and machineguns in our hands.<br><br>Seeing Quake 2 on PC not long after, that&#039;s another which made a huge impression on me.

Between Quake 2 featuring special textures for enemies as they got injured, even squeezing off some last shots in their dying throes, or outright getting shot into pieces, and GE64s hit location functionality and elaborate animations, it would actually take quite some time until I was actually impressed by videogame violence again.

The levels were incredibly elaborate, beyond what I had seen in many other games.<br>Sure, Terminator had the realistic city ruins, Goldeneye had the lifelike military installations and hydroelectric dams, but Super Mario 64 had these places where you looked around at everything and looked to climb it to see where it took you, these places were all about the platforming, the acrobatics, the parkour, the veritable and sometimes literal mountain climbing. The first person shooters had a bit of that, sort of, but they were mainly about gunfighting, so the environments were designed with that in mind, even Quake 2, which offered some mobility options, didn&#039;t have the same open locations, and certainly not the same range of mobility (barring rocketjumping, but I didn&#039;t know that yet). Goldeneye had very little for movement options, you couldn&#039;t even jump like in Quake 2 or Terminator, and I was actually very disappointed upon learning that, but it didn&#039;t preclude me from enjoying that game, and Super Mario 64&#039;s extremely versatile and flexible jumping more than made up for that.<br><br>The first Bowser stage was real impressive to me, for the more demanding terrain, featuring moving platforms and teeters suspended over the deadly void, all set to an imposing music track. The fight with Bowser had an aggressive guitar theme, and you couldn&#039;t punch or jump on him, there was no axe to drop a bridge underneath him, no, you had to circle around him, grab his tail, and then swing that big fucker around, trying to send him into one of those big naval mines.
