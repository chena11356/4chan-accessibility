If you want to play FPS, get something bigger with grips that extend downwards, like the ones in the top corners. Or a smartphone clip for a ds4 or XB controller.<br><br>- It&#039;s not a great solution if you are going to use it on the go during short commutes, or if you have to change trains every 15-20 min. With no built-in battery and no off-button it keeps draining the phone&#039;s battery all the time, so you will want to disassemble it as soon as your train or bus gets to destination (and you need to be careful to not mess the usb port on the phone, that spring is extra strong).<br><br>Nothing of this is a problem if you will use it at home or get to sit on on public transport for 40 minutes without interruptions.<br><br>- Think carefully about which model you want, USB-C or Bluetooth.

Possibly my biggest problem with Cross, even bigger than the total shitshow exposition dumps at the end of the game, is that Cross has extremely long combat animations and the intro/outro to combat is long even by JRPG standards, and enemies flat out interrupt your turn and do long animations of their own, and you can&#039;t even spend those animations menuing like you can in the original game (benefit of ATB!). Just comparing sequences in Trigger and Cross where you have to kill packs of enemies, the reptite tower is totally painless because it takes Crono half a second to draw his sword and transition into combat, and it takes two seconds to mash through text boxes at the end of combat, meaning that when you fight multiple packs of enemies it doesn&#039;t feel like your time is wasted and its all one big connected action sequence. Meanwhile, killing all the enemies is Gaea&#039;s Navel and ESPECIALLY clearing Marbule is like pulling fucking teeth, i can&#039;t believe you could honestly play those sections without thinking that they needed to rethink how they present the combat system.

It&#039;s a similar process to comparing the SW OT to the prequels to understand what Luccas was responsible for (worldbuilding, grand scenery, creative aliens, sense of wonder, heroic story) and what he wasn&#039;t (dialogue, characters, the story making sense.)", "filename": "34d674e423e0611169a0aade194494d3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 671, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1675902723952469, "time": 1675902723, "md5": "REiEOVjJieg9YrhGfg2EeQ==", "fsize": 312827, "resto": 9634958}, {"no": 9644732, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:34:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What does it tell us about Kato? The entire city of dreamers fits with the pseudophilosophical meandering he&#039;s fond of, and is also entirely disconnected from the rest of the game. I&#039;m sure this was entirely his. He has said that he came up with the plot of Zeal, but we have to remember that he did not think of Crono&#039;s death, so he can&#039;t have written everything about Zeal. He definitely had a hand in Schala&#039;s story, but he can&#039;t have written everything about her either or he wouldn&#039;t have felt the need to retcon so much about her in Cross (even her hair is different!) and he definitely would not have written her brother out of the sequel when he was so central to her.<br><br>For other sections that you seem to have attributed to Kato, I&#039;m also confident in saying that he did NOT write Fiona&#039;s forest and the camp scene (goes against Cross&#039;s message of &quot;humans bad for environment&quot; and the campfire scene is contradicted in Cross), he did not write anything about prehistory (Cross even says that humans did not exist before Lavos arrived, retconning Ayla into a neanderthal), etc, he did not write any of the happy endings (he hated happy endings and retconned them into tragedies with his sequel) and he did not write any of the whimsical scenes of Trigger (too many to list).<br><br>Now, you may come and say that this means nothing, we can&#039;t actually compare the writing like that and he&#039;s responsible for more than I give him credit for, but then we need the answer to a simple question: If Kato wrote all that, why the hell did he feel the need to retcon, contradict or alter so much of it in the sequel? If Kato really is responsible for most of Trigger, as crossfags keep asserting, why the hell are the two games NOT mostly similar in theme, tone, or most of anything, really?

They&#039;re crooks, he can&#039;t get in trouble with Mario for that, right? This makes it yet better that Wario Land 2 starts with said pirates breaking into his castle when he&#039;s sleeping to rob him of the money he robbed from them (also flooding his basement), and thus begins his quest of getting back his stolen-stolen shit.<br>Wario being this absolute lout preoccupied with money makes him a lot more fun and interesting to me than Mario, and they figure that out even with the gameplay itself, Wario being less about jumping on top of enemies, and instead bumping them over to pick up and throw them, or giving them a running/jet assisted tackle sending them flying out the level.

It generally just boils down to &quot;I don&#039;t want to have this happen to me so I will avoid it even if it is more work&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t want to have to play half the game again just for this one thing&quot;.<br><br>I&#039;ve also seen people get irritated that games stop them from doing 100% of possible tasks and situations in a single playthrough, which is ironic given those games are usually designed to let you do have a reason to replay the game. I think it&#039;s something for people who like the game enough to play it once but not enough to want to replay it. The prospect of not being able to see everything just drives them up a wall. That said, those people are likely also very self-deprecating completionistswho put way too much pressure on themselves to finish games and to act like beating a game is another checkbox on a grocery list.

Some games just slap skip on the start button without telling you so, when it acts as pause everywhere else in the game and that&#039;s stupid and counter-intuitive. A perfect way to do this is to have the start button pause the cutscene and then offer you an option to skip or resume it, like in MGS4 or the Yakuza series, for example.

Sure, there are a few exceptions like Vanille sounding outright retarded in XIII, but for most of the time they&#039;re pretty good, even if I prefer Japanese voices overall (save for XII, the EN dub is phenomenal and I prefer it over JP).<br>On that note, which dub is supposed to be the main one for XVI?

Shit is like a one to many situation all of the time simply because Japanese doesn&#039;t have a lot of ways to skin a cat (especially when compared to the nightmare gobblrfuck that is English) and so you could probably take a script in Japanese, give it to 5 different translators, and get 5 different translations, depending on all manner of things. Likewise, from a single blurry texture you could get 5 different interpretations by artists.<br><br>It&#039;s the problem of having to define one answer to an open question. It&#039;s like when gunpei yokoi defended using a black and white screen on the game boy. He said that if you draw two circles on top of each other on a whiteboard and say &quot;it&#039;s a snowman&quot; then people will fill the gaps in their mind of what the snowman looks like. Ask one artist to draw a detailed snowman to be &quot;the&quot; snowman in this, and someone observing it will say that it&#039;s not what they had imagined. <br><br>This is why movie adaptations of books can often seem off vs .the originals, because you read them and have an idea of what the characters look and sound like, all for it to be torn up when you see the Hollywood version where one team of (hopefully) interested people decided what every character and element would look like and would sound like and forced it upon everyone else.<br> It&#039;s also why Bill Watterson fought tooth and nail against merchandise for Calvin and Hobbes; He never wanted to get to the point of making a movie or tv show and having to decide what Hobbes&#039; voice sounded like. That was for the reader to decide as they enjoyed the comic for themselves.<br><br>tl;dr a remake can basically never change graphics in any way without potentially alienating someone because there are too many ways to take something vague and turn it into something specific and inevitably, someone will like their own interpretation of it better.", "time": 1675843124, "resto": 9638681}, {"no": 9642783, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)03:02:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9642142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9642142</a><br>also there is one remake/graphical overhaul that comes to mind that felt absolutely perfect, and that&#039;s the 3D Classics releases by Sega.

The extra choices are fine in themselves.<br><br>The problem is the other differences. I think the biggest one is probably the travel distance, as you say. On a d-pad, if I need to move my Tetris Attack cursor four spaces to the right or if I&#039;m in any of the many games that let you tap right twice to run and I want to run, then I&#039;ll just gently and briskly tap on the right button a few times, because it&#039;s a button.

If you knocked out an opponent with hyper beam it eliminated the recharge effect allowing you to hyperbeam again.

Yeah, one could argue about how when the battery dies people would have to send the board to Capcom to get them to reload the key, but considering the battery lasts some 20 or so years that&#039;s hardly intentional planned obsolesce as the arcade cabinet itself is likely to be retired before that Nobody was expecting people to care about old games or that retro gaming would boom like it did.<br><br>And no in that the reason CPS2SHOCK was able to crack it in the early 00s was due to (if I remember correctly) an oversight Capcom left in from a CPS2 game they had converted to CPS1 hardware. I recall it was some older Street Fighter game, I guess they figured the revenue from arcades that could install the game in an old CPS1 cabinet was more profitable than keeping that old game out of bootlegger&#039;s hands. From what I remember they accidently left in an occasional call the game makes to the decryption hardware, which clued the team in that the CPS2 games didn&#039;t just decrypt the game once on boot but had to repeatedly confirm it for the board to keep decrypting the game or the system would stop decrypting. I am sure this would have eventually been figured out anyway (Especially since CPS3 was decrypted about 16 years ago) if they got the initial decryption done and then saw the game only works for a while, but it apparently gave them a target to know where to look and sped up the project.

I had it with my Sega CD unit. But, it also came with the Sega 5-in-1 collection, Sonic CD and Ecco the Dolphin. I always had such a weird mixed reaction to Sewer Shark. Gameplay, was a standard FMV shooter, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s too bad. The game does try to mix up the gameplay with randomization of the tubes, and there are a few alt-FMV scenes when you play better or worse. The best thing is the film making aspect of the movie, and it was miniature tunnels, puppets and live action. I remember seeing one black and white behind the scenes photo from a long time ago. Could never find it again. I think it was a B&amp;W scanned image. But it featured John Dykstra working on one of the model sewer pieces. Night Trap was pretty well documented during the filming process;. But Sewer Shark doesn&#039;t have much around it for behind the scenes material.

Tekken 3 does a significantly better job of blending the 3D fighting area with the 2D background image though, I will admit that. Virtua Fighter stages have an elevated platform over a flat plane (to facilitate Ring Outs), whereas Tekken fighters stand directly on the flat plane, which scrolls infinitely. The elevated platform makes the transition looks weird in comparison. The character models and textures (as well as the resolution) are where VF2 really excels when comparing the two.<br><br>You are absolutely right on your next point though - 3D platformers were a genre that didn&#039;t see a lot of releases on the Saturn - and also what it did get was mostly ports (this is a consequence of launching in an era where arcade games were incredibly popular). Had it lasted a full generation I&#039;m sure we would have seen quite a few hitting the system once consumers stopped being satisfied with home console ports of quick playing arcade games. &quot;Bringing the arcade into the home&quot; was a big deal in the mid 90s (and we were finally starting to get to the point where home console ports could be near arcade perfect or even arcade perfect), but that interest changed as gamers started wanting more in-depth games (the kind of games that detractors would call &quot;cinematic&quot;).<br><br>The Saturn had a lot of really excellent games, but it cannot and will not ever be able to compete with the PS1 in terms of the sheer quantity of games and the variety of geners available.

Most of the stages are really linear, secrets are easy and basic to get, actually challenging and interesting sections (like the long Heat Man disappearing blocks section) has glitches that screw them up, the bosses are either really basic or a pain in the ass and the game bothers more with it&#039;s presentation and style (awesome looking wily castle, alien wily hologram boss, mecha dragon) than substance (every wily fortress boss except the boobeam being extremely basic and uninteresting, while the boobeam is more annoying than anything because knowing the solution makes it into another boring boss you do the exact same way and move on). Mega Man to me is all about experimenting on replays - what if I use this weapon here? Or against this enemy? What if it will work better? Or what if there&#039;s a secret here? 2 fails at that - it&#039;s a game that&#039;s really easy to beat if you do it the exact same way each time while barely even using the weapons, but it limits experimentation heavily and because of that, it&#039;s way less replayable.

Units belonging to a general can not leave the current screen the general is on, so it is him that gives the overall movement of the team.<br>Nice graphics and musics.

The game uses background graphics for the characters, unless it is currently the unit in play in which case it will turn into sprites for the time being. Smart.<br>On the bad side, the game rarely goes beyond the battle-&gt;town-&gt;repeat routine. Most of the game has the same two musics on loop (battle and town), despite the musics being of quality. A waste on that side as well as with graphics, a mangaka was hired for monster designs but you only see enemy designs in small windows when you select them (there are no battle anims).<br>Also, the game insists on using the same few palettes for the majority of towns, even when it really doesn&#039;t fit. All of this makes the game very monotonous.<br><br>All in all the game feels like a wasted opportunity: published by Enix, allegedly took 3 years to dev and hired famous mangaka and composer, and all that for what? A tired town-&gt;battle routine, &quot;tactical&quot; gameplay that can easily boil down to &quot;just grind lol&quot;, enemy design in small windows that you don&#039;t get to see, and the same two musics looping for most of the game.<br>It IS a good game, but it should have been more.", "filename": "Just Breed", "ext": ".png", "w": 768, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 66, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675196243118922, "time": 1675196243, "md5": "fv/ipbAwYpGYMbj3FsbIdw==", "fsize": 252098, "resto": 9619418}, {"no": 9619425, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)15:18:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Moryo Senki Madara</span><br><br>By Konami, based on a Manga license unknown to me, but the double page ad for this game was all over Japanese magasines at the time of release.

The first party is your main characters, hero+warrior+mage. The second party is made of &quot;Idols&quot;, godly creatures that you find along the way and which mostly just use spells and are AI controlled. The third party consists of soldiers you can hire, you must pay for them and their gear so I never bothered with them. Only the party active at the end of a battle recieves exp.

Everything is made to make you realize they were going through their own adventures of their own while you were. This gives them weight and personality and puts everyone on the same level. How many RPGs have each character put on the same level of importance like that? Certainly not DQ3.<br>- The way towns work like hubs. You usually use the same town in between several small quests; either that or there is a good reason to come back to the town later on. This makes the world feel organic, real; vs the tired routine &quot;each area is composed of one town, one dungeon, clear that, reach next area, repeat&quot; which DQ3 started.<br>- The adventure elements, namely the treasure hunting; DQ2 probably started the &quot;you must find X number of magical key items as a goal&quot; trope for jRPGs (unless you count Zelda as an RPG), but unlike later/other use of that trope in which the key item is merely a meaningless token for denoting that you beat a dungeon; here you must go through adventure game mechanics to acquire them, acquire clues, solve puzzle, beat dungeons too sure but not only, and almost each one is acquired differently.

While there is stuff like Hydlide and very ancient action games on the PC which are older then the NES in all of those the items are pretty much either keys or provide some passive increase to your stats.

The world is too big, ambitious, and interactive for anything else to compare on the console. On the PS1? The entire survival horror genre. And once you get to the Gamecube era you can find plenty of action adventure games that can be argued to be on par. While Zelda 64 when judged according to the standards of it&#039;s time is a clearly bigger then say Ratchet and Clank, Sonic Adventure, or any other action adventure of the PS2 era judged independent of when they came out there is plenty these games do that Zelda 64 doesnt do or doesn&#039;t do nearly as well.

These are very unlikely to ever get translated because most fan translations rely on machine translation and because this is audio content it requires the person doing the translation to actually be fluent in Japanese since they can&#039;t just feed it through a machine translator; they actually have to listen to it and understand what&#039;s being said. And then someone has to read it and act it out and record it. Also timed events in the game line up with the radio broadcast, stuff that happens in the story will trigger events in game, so they would need to be careful that the timing of everything lines up correctly with the original recording. There is also music as a part of the broadcast, and there are no existing recordings (at least, not in the hands of the public) of the music which is separate from the dialogue, so the music would have to be completely replaced for the translated version.<br><br>Technically it should be possible to translate it, but it would be a lot of work and the requirements are too high for the people who translate games. Typically games get translated by people who want to play them (hence the machine translations), and people who can already play them don&#039;t want to translate them. So as I said before, unless you&#039;re fluent in Japanese then you&#039;re going to be missing out on much of the experience with these games.

The best way to define the SaGa games is that they are very heavily focused on gameplay and on having unusual systems. For that reason they are often as innovative as they are frustrating. The lead designer is Akitpshi Kawazu, who is also famous (or infamous) as designer of FF2. Another trademark is unpredictability; Several of his games seem designed to be difficult or impossible to easily figure out or to manipulate. Believe I&#039;ve read before that his philosophy is that games are another universe, and so they should be a complex universe of rules and events that aren&#039;t always obvious, or else the world ceases to be a real world and is reduced to a simple toy for the player&#039;s amusement. This leads to designs that include obtuse methods or entirely hidden systems that control things without the player immediately knowing about them. If you&#039;ve played other games be designed then you&#039;ll know what I mean (Crystal Chronicles on gamecube, Last Remnant, and WildCard come to mind).<br><br>I&#039;m not an expert but that&#039;s my understanding. The games are often strange but have a very unique style that you won&#039;t often see. Series is worth trying out, the first game is rudimentary but still interesting.

I played the absolute shit out of Gen 1, and was stoked when I heard about Gen 2. The wait for it seemed eternal to me at the time, though. Eventually the Japanese game came out, and IIRC I even downloaded a ROM for it and tried playing it, but obviously didn&#039;t get far. By the time the actual game came out here, I think I was already turning off of Pokemon and was getting hardcore into Zelda and FF instead. I did replay Gen 1 a couple of times during that time frame, though, so maybe I just turned into a stuffy Genwunner in record time, I dunno. Whatever the case, It took like a decade before I touched another Pokemon game, namely Emerald, Lead Green and Platinum. I did get Soul Silver, but I think having played the previous three nigh back-to-back burned me out, with the last straw being me forgetting to save and turning it off after hours of progress (I was tired and possibly drunk lol). I know I can always pick it up, whether the original or the DS remake, but I always get this nagging feeling that I already &quot;missed the boat&quot; on it and any magic it held would be lost on me, sort of like when I played ALttP after OoT, and so I always hesitate and decide against it.<br><br>Thanks for reading my blog.", "filename": "1405282271141", "ext": ".png", "w": 291, "h": 343, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675271766168312, "time": 1675271766, "md5": "oQ+WD8s0c10Yy2dt0kyY0g==", "fsize": 72914, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9621867, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:20:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9620563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620563</a><br>Ursaring mogs the entirety of gen 1.", "time": 1675272015, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9621873, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:21:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9621856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9621856</a><br>You&#039;re overthinking it.

Like I said, I think back to ALttP and how I just don&#039;t feel its magic the way so many who grew up with it do. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s an excellent game, and I&#039;ve played and beat it at least three or four times across emulation, the actual SNES cartridge and the GBA port, but I&#039;m always left thinking that it just doesn&#039;t feel as monumental as it apparently was, so I conclude that I just &quot;had to be there&quot; when it was the peak of its genre. Funnily enough, though, I absolutely &quot;get it&quot; for the first Zelda and even Zelda II, which I absolutely love despite its bullshit, and I played and beat those even later, probably because they are still quite unique in what they do, whereas ALttP is, in many ways, the prototype model for literally everything that came after, so despite doing it first much of it felt &quot;been there done that&quot;, but more barebones, so to speak.<br><br>Anyway, I don&#039;t want to derail the thread too much.

When I play GSC, there are always inevitable parts where I simply have to stop playing the game because I&#039;m in an area at the wrong time for what I want to do there, and that is not collect every Pokemon in the area, it&#039;s simply to catch the few who make up my team and train them as best I can against new Pokemon/trainers. <br><br>Now, you can say &quot;well too bad if you want certain Pokemon instead of using any random ones you find you have to wait for the right time of day&quot; and that&#039;d be fine if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that Gen 1 didn&#039;t require this, which allows me to compare and prefer one way over the other.", "time": 1675655385, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9636431, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)22:59:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9634208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9634208</a><br>tbf if you go and hike in the mountains a lot you can get real tanned", "time": 1675655966, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9636786, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:54:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9620369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9620369</a><br>Why did Gen 2&#039;s comfy atmosphere not prevent it from killing Pokemania?", "filename": "1675640035876553", "ext": ".png", "w": 317, "h": 421, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675666465241803, "time": 1675666465, "md5": "0Hrs+sfz7FL4WI57OGmr0Q==", "fsize": 8206, "resto": 9620369}, {"no": 9636808, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)02:08:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9636067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9636067</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;games should be cumbersome to be unique</span><br>There&#039;s a balance of effort and reward.

It&#039;s probably one of the best Star Wars games out there from a gameplay perspective. <br>But the story is hot ass. It&#039;s fanfic tier garbage. Fortunately it&#039;s just a backdrop to give some context to why you&#039;re going on all these missions and eventually end up fighting sith and getting into lightsaber battles, and you can kind of just tune it out because the game is so fun, but it got pretty annoying at times.<br>Jedi Academy really shines when you turn on or mod in lightsaber dismemberment. It&#039;s way too much fun to watch enemies turn into giblets, and it makes the game much harder in the second half once you start getting into lightsaber duels. The feeling of fighting with &quot;realistic&quot; lightsabers is awesome, both for the sheer power fantasy when you&#039;re up against standard mooks, and for how tense it is when you&#039;re dueling. <br><br>Republic Commando on the other hand has a much more solid story. You&#039;re following this squad of clone troopers who end up being really likeable, and the grittier take on the Star Wars setting is cool. The gameplay of Commando is good. Commando isn&#039;t the most polished game in the world, but neither is Jedi Academy desu. The only real problems Commando has are its lack of polish and the feeling that it doesn&#039;t really stand out as much as other games. It feels a bit like a Halo/Half-Life/Metroid clone. But it&#039;s a really good game, and worth playing if you&#039;re a fan of Star Wars. <br><br>Academy is better, but only by a little bit: because its story is bad, but the gameplay is so unique and fun.
