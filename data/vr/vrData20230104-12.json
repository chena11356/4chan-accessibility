Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

I wish there were a few more bullets at the start since shooting the elevated skeletons at the start feels drawn out with the shotgun. I really dislike that some of the rock/sand piles around the start have impassible lines for no reason since it can block your dodging without any telegraph. This is especially annoying since not all of them are like this. Like the other post said already, many descended midtextures are visibly clipping through the floor with software rendering (you can fix this by varying the brightness value or flat between the surrounding sectors). The ambush before the rocket launcher is a blatant example of hitscanners without cover, the computer in the center isn&#039;t tall enough to protect you. I wish there were some consistency about which doors are intractable since inert/onesided doors look the same as normal ones. Using spectres as soon as you enter a dark room twice in the same map feels kind of lazy. Both archviles feel poorly used since the first one is trivial since he can never get behind you and the other is just a test of patience since it can never get down the lift. I didn&#039;t realize there was a lift at first since there&#039;s no indication it&#039;s intractable and it looks the same as the surrounding walls. I feel like the revenant/imp ambush by the computer switches would work a lot better if the wall above you were shorter so the enemies could shoot down at you when they get caught against the wall. I have no idea what the switch before the blue key lift is for since it seems like you can and should safely ignore it. The lost souls in the end room feel completely pointless since you can just kill them before you hit the switch, I&#039;d honestly just remove them since the fight&#039;s hard enough anyway. You can also softlock yourself if you ride the perpetual lifts in that room up and jump over the wall.

Otex was designed from the ground up for this, I&#039;m not sure why so many people don&#039;t bother).

The way MGS2 handles wounds is more effective (even though it&#039;s like something out of a cartoon) because it plays out in real time instead of a menu, healing supplies are scarce on higher difficulty levels, and the tighter maps combined with the faster guards means that leaving a trail of blood is actually a serious problem, besides being much better and more streamlined gameplay anyway, while you get stuck on trees and other shit in MGS3 all the time because the gameplay formula is designed around blocky, sterile rooms and not messy jungles.

So help me out here.<br><br>Do you people push CRTs because you think they are superior to LCDs, and refuse to change? <br><br>Or<br><br>Do you people push CRTs because you have old equipment that simply isn&#039;t compatible with new LCDs TVs (like an old NES or SNES) without an adapter?<br><br>I work for a fairly busy independently owned arcade/family fun bar and we have a mix of CRT arcade games and newer LCD arcade games.<br><br>We do repairs on the older arcade CRT games, but parts are getting harder to acquire. I would like to preserve the original design of these machines as they were made from the arcade factory. I want people to experience what it was like when these machines came out in the 80s and 90s.<br><br>However....for some broken machines we can&#039;t find the original arcade monitors anymore. Or some of the machines just can&#039;t quite stand up to the heavy usage they once did back in the 90s and constantly go down for maintenance. Usually the issues revolve around the CRT monitors. <br><br>We are thinking about adapting old CRT TVs as replacement arcade monitors. But based on what we&#039;re reading some people expressed that this isn&#039;t the way to go. That it&#039;s a janky way of doing it, and not reliable. <br><br>A new debate has started between the the arcade techs, owners, etc. Basically if we are going to all this trouble of Trying to adapt CRT TVs for arcade use, then maybe we should just use replacement LCD panels instead and maybe find a way to use a scanline filter to try to get close to the CRT look.<br><br>The argument is that &quot;Its better to have people play these games even with an LCD compared to constantly having games go down due to CRT issues. Thar LCDs would solve 90% of the problems.&quot;<br><br>Others have said it&#039;s better to preserve the original condition from the factory or try to. Use CRTs.<br><br>I can see both arguments.

The reason is because there&#039;s a series of spike floors and ceilings that you have to carefully navigate through. In PlayStation version, this section is easier to navigate since the visibility is perfectly clear. In Saturn version, because the long spikes are affected by the new water effect, it&#039;s inadvertently harder to determine the spike tips and platform edges, making it easier to instantly lose a life. I can attest to game-overing here on Saturn while it was a breeze on PlayStation. There are more spikes in an optional area in the second half of the level, but they&#039;re shorter, the tunnel is a lot less narrow, and there&#039;s much less going on visually, so it shouldn&#039;t be a problem there.

The difficult controls give you a real sense of friction. It&#039;s like actually trying to learn something difficult. You fail over and over until you start to figure out the tricks and pretty soon you&#039;re cruising. It&#039;s a much more rewarding game. I also think the aesthetics just pop more.

Unlike SH1 and SH2, which are too generous with resources, SH3 actually provides a nice challenge in how you manage your resources, you get more physical weapons in order to never truly softlock yourself but the hand gun has been nerfed hard from SH2 and ammunition for your other guns is rather scarce, especially on higher difficulty. Level design has been refined and you get a good balance of feeling like you&#039;ve explored the whole area after completing each dungeon. Enemies are more designed around gameplay roles rather then strictly symbolism for the narrative, something not to everyone&#039;s liking, but it makes replays more interesting I feel. Other mechanics like stamina and the block also feel more refined and more consistently relevant in gameplay. On top of this I would say SH3 is in general the scariest as well, it has a lot of great moments like the mirror room and haunted house chase. SH3&#039;s real issue I would say lie in the narrative, which is honestly a bigger deal with a series like SH compared to other game series.<br><a href=\"#p9540105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9540105</a><br>A lot of people contribute the symbolism seen throughout the game to being ONLY in relation to James&#039; sexual frustration and I feel like it does a real disservice to the game.

The people who were producing basically any kind of visuals that are now considered the peak of &quot;soulful&quot; and &quot;retro&quot; graphics, were just extremely talented and disciplined people working within the limitations of older software/hardware. Retro fags like us who recognize the aesthetic appeal of that time are appreciating all these things in a completely different context. So when modern indie devs go for that look, they can usually recreate the technical limitations and specifics, but lack the top-of-the-line skill and the time-specific mindsets of those eras. An overblown example for comparison would be a modern archeologist trying to recreate ancient egyptian sculpture. He could get the tech down through research, but there&#039;s no way to recreate the mindset and education of those ancient artists. <br><br><a href=\"#p9537435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9537435</a><br>The hell are you talking about?

It&#039;s actually really annoying because you need to hold up and no other direction to jump up, and then to jump down, you must either press down or no direction at all, and then press right into the wall at the precise time. If you mess up your inputs at all or jump without the proper direction pressed, you&#039;re basically fucked. <br><br>The other thing is that you have to be *extremely* close to the top and bottom.

Here is how it came about:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Atari sued Activision they laid claim to certain \u2018proprietary\u2019 techniques. One technique for which they claimed ownership was first used by Bob Whitehead in the display code of the Atari Chess cartridge. This method moved the display objects back and forth every scan line to allow the game to display more objects. On the chess pieces, for example, Bob showed the odd pixel row of the odd numbered columns of pieces and the even pixel row of the even numbered columns. We called this the Venetian Blind technique since it made the pieces look like they were being viewed through a venetian blind.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One day in the lab at Activision while the lawsuit was in full swing, Bob and I collaborated on a practical joke. We made a display showing an architecturally accurate window with a view of a grassy hill at sunset. We covered it with a venetian blind effect that animated up and down (complete with the stacking up of the slats as they were gathered up by the blind mechanism). We took it to CES and showed it to a few people who were privy to the lawsuit, asking \u2018Is this what Atari means by the Venetian Blind Technique?\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The joke was on us in one respect, when we realized that we had made public our latest innovation (the background sunset) when we showed it to our competitors. (Several games in the lab were using this new idea, but they had not yet been published.) As it turned out, nobody picked up on our slip and nobody beat us to market with the sunset.\u201d ~ David Crane</span>", "time": 1672589122, "resto": 9523001}, {"no": 9536297, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)19:53:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523274</a><br><br>This guy is the most stupid-looking Pok\u00e9mon character I have seen so far.", "time": 1672620828, "resto": 9523001}, {"no": 9537420, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)07:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523389</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As you can probably tell, we&#039;re very excited</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an unparalleled achievement in storytelling, presentation and game design</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s one of those rare &quot;event&quot; games that are not to be missed</span><br><br>Normally I&#039;d expect this level of gushing to be reserved for a new Zelda game.

I feel like the XBLA port was one of the best versions (It is also on PSN?, but I have never played that one)<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGH<wbr>JHq0oHw8<br>This one has the arcade visuals, but runs at a higher resolution than the arcade game, and also 60fps. <br><br>The arcade model 2 board does not run at 60fps due to some sort of limitations of the board. It&#039;s really 57fps, but when used with the right type of CRT display, you don&#039;t really notice. But 57fps would look janky on LED&#039;s, so many of the later VF2 home ports are set to 60 for consistencies sake.", "time": 1672310406, "resto": 9525881}, {"no": 9526842, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:54:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9526825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9526825</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(It is also on PSN?, but I have never played that one)</span><br>Yes, along with Fighting Vipers and Sonic the Fighters.", "time": 1672311242, "resto": 9525881}, {"no": 9526843, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:55:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9526796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9526796</a><br>32x VF1 was based and great value if you already had Genesis.

The characters are tempered (somewhat), but there are still these game like elements. Like Sarah being the blonde brainwashed assassin trope. battle Arena did kind of the same thing with Sonya. Nina is the blonde brainwashed assassin type in Tekken. Why was that a thing in 3D fighters? Akira kinda being the series Ryu, though even more boring. Jackie looks like a Ken clone, but is more like Sarah. Jeffrey is oddly more original characters. Pai is teen idol trope. Lau Chan is/ was an antagonist to Akira. Maru is mysterious ninja trope. Shun Di = drunken old man (best character), Taka =- we added a Sumo wrestler. yeah, the characters are the most basic versions of tropes.

Each character looks appropriate to their fighting styles. Shenmue was originally conceived to be a Virtua Fighter RPG for Akira.

I did not play this on a arcade cabinet, but rather on a computer. I am quite young (18) so this could possibly had been an emulator that my dad set up. The game itself was very bright and colorful (it could have taken place in a place like Miami or California.) I also remember there being a mall/jewelry store level. The game to my memory wasn&#039;t that graphically advanced. You possibly played as a spy/gangster and there could have been a point where you get in an elevator. I unfortunately do not remember the gun play or guns that you could acquire. There is a small chance that the guns did not even show on screen when you had them.

One crazy idea that has been in my head for the past few weeks was a SMB3 NES/SNES rom hack I wanted to call &quot;Doomship Raider&quot;, where you could take over enemy airships by playing them, crudely build your own, fly to locations, and seize other players&#039; ships by invading them with your own. No idea how the gameplay of that would pan out, or if it would be any fun at all, but I recognize that without a bit of planning first, the ideas of the hack and the propositions of doing the network stuff in the first place would fall flat.

You can already do with games that don&#039;t have publicly available source codes, but with the meat and potatoes of it the possibilities are an order of magnitude greater, including the end-user possibly creating their own game with that code.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

The information and skills to repair CRTs are already no longer available in my area. Unfortunately, It is costly to even get started on soldering too, since I still have to get/learn a multimeter, helping hands, flux pens, solder wire, wick, etc. already setting me back hundreds. It isn&#039;t so simple to find &quot;practice boards&quot; as if $5 is insignificant as that is almost half of my pre-tax hourly earnings, not to mention sales tax from purchases made post-tax. The instructions for the stuff is in Chinese, which is notoriously difficult and useless language designed to keep people out and Google translate is still failing to get even instructions right.

I remember playing Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six as a kid, it was my first ever experience with a video game based on my favorite super hero, and it was quite good, nothing superb, but it doesn&#039;t deserve the poor reception it usually gets, it plays fine enough and has some good level design.<br><br>What I really remember from my childhood however, is the PS1 duology of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro. I couldn&#039;t believe how accurate these were, you really felt like you were Spider-Man, and the jump to 3D helped with that quite a lot. I recall growing up and hoping that there&#039;d be a 3rd installment, but there wasn&#039;t, the Sam Raimi films came out and, while I loved those, and both Spider-Man (PS2) and Spider-Man 2 (PSP) played like the PS1 duology, it wasn&#039;t set in the same universe... lately I discovered something though, the PS1 original was ported to GBC, which got a sequel... and a 3rd installment, Mysterio&#039;s Menace.<br><br>When I finally looked at Mysterio&#039;s Menace it really took me by surprise, the graphics, UI, power ups... everything seemed like the PS1 duology, and that&#039;s because, from what I&#039;ve read, this is a sequel to that, and not the GBC timeline, regardless if that&#039;s the case or not, it sure feels like it.

I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

While I love Space Harrier to a huge degree, I also like Ecco. They are very different, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. I hate this comparison being thrown around, but in many ways Ecco is like Demon&#039;s Souls was compared to other contemporary games. <br><br>From an objective standpoint there are many harder retro games, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania 3, Super Ghouls n Ghosts, Battletoads, 1ccing Gradius etc (all of which get regular threads here by people declaring that the difficulty is overstated) are all much harder than anything Ecco throws at you, even the last levels. Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed. You can call it tedious, but it was never meant to be a bing bing wahoo rush to the finish type game. Unreliable just makes no sense, if you want to permakill an enemy, you can. It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere. Along with that love is the understanding it doesn&#039;t appeal to everyone, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing.

The night time levels in New Orleans? were fun, sneaking your car inside the truck was such a bond move.<br>iirc they had the team need for speed team working on these levels. Explains the race mission.<br>Gosh, this game had so much going for it, idk why people prefer Nightfire over this, it has so many bond elements, and even has Brosnan&#039;s voice and John Cleese to top it off. It&#039;s also better farewell to Brosnan. Though it would&#039;ve been nice to flesh out Willem Dafoe&#039;s character a little more.<br><br>Honestly, Nigthfire peaked on the first level on the snow mansion, (not the first training level, that&#039;s a glorified qte on rails interactive cutscene) The quality starts to drop drastically afterwards. Like they placed all their eggs on that basket right away and nothing else in the game lives up to it,, missions just get simpler and straight forward after that MGS/NOLF like level at the start. I heard The multiplayer is quite good, but not as good as Agent Under Fire. I never played either MP, though. The vehicle section also felt like an afterthought, 1 button does all vehicle gadgets whenever the game lets you, the awful underwater level, and that atrocious flying mission that goes on forever.<br><br>Agent Under Fire campaign&#039;s at least stays fun through out the whole thing, short and sweet levels that don&#039;t over stay their welcome, and all are some kind of homage to a bond film.

The whole thing feels stiff. <br><br>If I saw this in 1993 at the arcades (I might have), I wouldn&#039;t play it more than a handful of times and never try it again. And based on what I saw, In the Hunt wasn&#039;t that popular at arcades. Not like later games of the 90s.<br><br><br>Like other anon said, the submarine levels in Metal Slug were much more well done, and approachable. It embraced the wackiness of the level without going overboard. You could hop in and out of a submarine as a diver and still shoot enemies. You could shoot bullets from your submarine (yes I know it&#039;s not possible in real subs, but I accept that for fun gameplay). You could move around in a larger area. And lastly your torpedoes actually matter. They have big power behind them. Metal Slug just got everything just right in gameplay and design. <br><br>In the Hunt feels like an earlier version of Metal Slug&#039;s submarine levels. An early version where things aren&#039;t properly fine tuned or correctly balanced. Like an early draft. But it has great artwork and sprites though.<br><br>I can see why hardcore schmup fans like In the Hunt, but I don&#039;t enjoy it as a casual player. And if I don&#039;t enjoy it, then I won&#039;t replay it.", "time": 1672711029, "resto": 9526418}, {"no": 9539567, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)23:54:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9539243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9539243</a><br>You have to use the green and blue missiles to one-shot enemies, the red is more for rapid-fire. There are tons of times where you peek out, pop a depth charge or missile and then slink away, it&#039;s pretty great. For damage output though, generally you want to pointblank with your depth charges or balloons. <br><br>The main issue is just the rank system. The game is much more fun and more manageable at lower ranks, but casual players are just going to pick up every powerup. I do also think it could benefit from a slightly faster movement speed. I think slower movement speed is great for the type of gameplay it rewards, but it could be just like 10-20% faster. <br><br>Metal Slug&#039;s submarine stages are just way too basic in comparison.
