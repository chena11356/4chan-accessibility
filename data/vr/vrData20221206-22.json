If you subvert peoples&#039; expectations that hard, you will get a lot of backlash until enough time has passed that they can appreciate what they got instead of what they wanted. To add to this, the Tanker chapter sets up what is essentially the &quot;perfect sequel&quot; to MGS1, which is then immediately moved away from, again entirely on purpose. This leaves the player feeling robbed of what they actually wanted, and creates a grudge against Raiden for seemingly standing in their way of a REAL sequel.<br><br>Once the initial kneejerk reaction had finally passed for everyone, reception naturally improved. New players also came into the game already knowing about Raiden and a general idea of what to expect, which makes an enormous impact on how one experiences a piece of media for the first time. On top of this primary reason, MGS1 had a fairly basic story that could be understood easily by anyone, but MGS2 is intricate and approaches a lot of ideas and themes that were unfamiliar to most players at the time. Not to say that they were not relevant to the state of the world, as they actually were, but many of those aspects simply were not known about or relevant to the average person playing. Fast forward to years later when much of what the game centers around is something the average person finally knows about and has been looking into in some fashion, and it becomes way more interesting to them.<br><br>Not to say that I was a miracle intellectual who understood it at the time of release -- I did not.", "time": 1670382021, "resto": 9463978}, {"no": 9472380, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:42:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9463978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9463978</a><br>I don&#039;t even understand how it was poorly received.

Battling itself actually helps remove monsters stress. As you accumulate larger amounts of cash, it&#039;s definitely good to prioritize buying all the more expensive stress relieving, fatigue relieving, and sleep helping items you&#039;ll see in the shop like the cups and gems, as can afford them of course, don&#039;t skip out on them, they&#039;ll make it easier for new monsters. Also don&#039;t let your monster get fat or malnourished, fat monsters get fatigued more and underweight monsters get stressed more.<br><br>Also take it easy on baby monsters, just do the most basic training until its more mature aka when Holly tells gives you that cue that it&#039;s an &quot;important time&quot; or whatever she says, that&#039;s when you start the coach routines<br><br>Always focus on like 3, maybe 4 main stats to train your monster in. Having a balanced monster doesn&#039;t really work because there&#039;s only so much time you can put into training during its lifespan, you want your monster to excel hard in specific areas, not be average in many areas, so take that into consideration when deciding what monster you wanna raise and how you want it to grow/what moves you want it to learn<br><br>When you&#039;re stronger and start doing sparring with the intention of learning new moves specifically, it&#039;s not really worth it unless you&#039;re gonna learn a new move, so don&#039;t bother wasting the money and time unless it says there&#039;s a chance your monster will learn a new move, and honestly I say theres no shame in saving before and restarting until you learn the move", "time": 1670371774, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9471981, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Jell<br>but the one I used to win with was Hare", "time": 1670372119, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472112, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:14:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471460</a><br><a href=\"#p9471549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471549</a><br>What are you doing, dude?", "filename": "1308028510381", "ext": ".png", "w": 496, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1670375679755307, "time": 1670375679, "md5": "vQBz/xGhIxFw/6o0Q324aA==", "fsize": 134450, "resto": 9471326}], "last_modified": 1670375679}, {"no": 9468393, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)13:42:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Why do mod makers care about the ZSNES market so much?", "com": "https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/sn<wbr>es/patches/4812readme.txt<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Listed below are the currently known issues:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;* When playing on ZSNES the game has a tendancy to crash when morphing into Raiden as Shang Tsung in Single Player Mode.

The bosses are generic giant insects + Tyrant (at least the Scorpion-train boss demanded some aiming precision) and the enemies are all things we saw in the last few games aside from the leeches or monkeys which are just dogs with extra annoyance stacked on. You&#039;re constantly backtracking three to five times just to ferry all your items from one place to another out of nagging concern that something might get used again. And while the partner AI is competent, their presence absolutely drags the already cautiously slow pace of a survival horror game down to a crawl, only picking back up whenever they&#039;re separated. All of it works, but none of it feels quite refined. Most damming is the final stint of the game and the sheer number of absolutely beautiful but absurdly empty rooms lacking puzzles, items, enemies, or anything else of note.<br>RE0 is a tale of two games.
