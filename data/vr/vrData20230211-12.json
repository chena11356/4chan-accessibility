All on eBay. 2/3 were Japanese used: 1000 and 1100. Had to return the &quot;excellent condition FW 3.18&quot; for being the latest firmware and having severe burn-in from the hot charging port. The other JP one arrived perfectly, exactly as the seller and I personally discussed, and had the correct FW, no mura spots, no burn-in.<br>It does matter to get a 3.60 or lower firmware, people are lying when they say high FW can easily get CFW.<br>Ordered a US 1000 Vita to replace the returned 1100.<br>No interest in the 2000. The IPS is easier to take care of and internal memory card is convenient but offers no good sub pixel arrangement for crispness, no good blacks or contrasts, plus the 1000 OLED has good motion controls.<br>The OLED must be properly cared for though. You can&#039;t overcharge it or max the current to 2A over 5v constantly or you&#039;ll get burn-in. And you need a sleep timer or screensaver to prevent mura/splotches from developing, and set the brightness low most of the time for the same reason. It&#039;s actually worrying how bright it is at max. Halfway was still pretty bright in light and minimum is highly visible in the dark. So far this Vita looks pretty worth it. I love my PSP and it won&#039;t replace it for those games or the superior XMB clicky sounds but Vita is very good at its own thing.<br>If you&#039;re willing to message sellers directly and talk like a human being, you&#039;ll get a really sweet deal on an excellent condition Vita and then it&#039;s just a matter of taking care of it properly.<br>One more thing. The JP vitas have a different battery model in them than the US and EU versions. They&#039;re all the same true capacity BUT the JPN ones have the top &amp; bottom 20%-iles locked off. For most people, this will help them not wreck their batteries in 3 years. For power users, it could be a concern if you need the freedom.

The most Important things I can remember:<br><br>- Buttons and d-pad are on a whole new level compared to the RG351V I own,Provided that you like clicky tactile feedback.<br><br>- The short grips don&#039;t make it comfortable for twin stick gameplay. If you want to play FPS, get something bigger with grips that extend downwards, like the ones in the top corners. Or a smartphone clip for a ds4 or XB controller.<br><br>- It&#039;s not a great solution if you are going to use it on the go during short commutes, or if you have to change trains every 15-20 min. With no built-in battery and no off-button it keeps draining the phone&#039;s battery all the time, so you will want to disassemble it as soon as your train or bus gets to destination (and you need to be careful to not mess the usb port on the phone, that spring is extra strong).<br><br>Nothing of this is a problem if you will use it at home or get to sit on on public transport for 40 minutes without interruptions.<br><br>- Think carefully about which model you want, USB-C or Bluetooth. Many Android games don&#039;t support USB controllers (Apex Legends, but that one is dead now).

Despite not winning, was cool to get to play the original cart in an actual competition and hell i won a full year of free rentals from hollywood video.", "time": 1675900847, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9644650, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:04:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9642874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9642874</a><br>I ripped off the plot of earthbound for a writing assignment.", "time": 1675901060, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9644678, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:16:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9642832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9642832</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anon creeping around his house at night scared of sligs at age 15 while Kevin down the street was sneaking into Becky&#039;s house to lose his virginity</span>", "time": 1675901773, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9644684, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9643506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9643506</a><br>That&#039;s the least Eddie players deserve", "time": 1675901906, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9645175, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)21:55:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9644487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9644487</a><br>You&#039;re doing it again", "time": 1675911314, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9645179, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)21:55:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9642670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9642670</a><br>I&#039;d like to listen to your presentation...", "time": 1675911339, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9645238, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)22:08:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9644253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9644253</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tldr play games with people you love and stop being a cynic anons, don&#039;t miss the point of the whole thing.</span><br>Great advice!", "time": 1675912114, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9645720, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)02:25:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9642874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9642874</a><br>teachers are awful people", "time": 1675927548, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9646872, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:36:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9642609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9642609</a><br>no", "time": 1675967794, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9647808, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:35:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9643506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9643506</a><br>fake, but still the funniest story itt", "time": 1675989317, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9647823, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:39:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9647808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9647808</a><br>I\u2019m not him but what about that sounds fake", "time": 1675989554, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9647825, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:40:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9645720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9645720</a><br>What are you, 15?", "time": 1675989615, "resto": 9642609}, {"no": 9647834, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:46:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I got a disc containing MAME32 and hundreds of ROMs from a guy at a computer store.

You can explore towns, talk to people, shop, etc However the combat is tactical grid based. Unlike in FE or Famicom Wars, an attacked unit will not retaliate on the turn it is attacked. Gameplay is based around generals, the player has up to 4 teams each with 1 general and 5 units composed of fighters, archers, and mages (offensive or defensive). Units belonging to a general can not leave the current screen the general is on, so it is him that gives the overall movement of the team.<br>Nice graphics and musics.

Typical DQ/FF clone material, the story is very clich\u00e9 JRPG stuff, but the game looks great, both in the world and its vibrant colours and the enemy design (lot&#039;s of really big enemy art in combat), and sounds great too and the OST has many tracks, some even dedicated to specific towns or shops.<br><br>Easiest RPG I&#039;ve played on the system in terms of difficulty, it&#039;s almost insulting how easy it is. Also characters auto-target the next enemy in combat so the &quot;spam X to win&quot; clich\u00e9 really applies here. At first characters were gaining levels every 2-3 fights, it was ridiculous. And if that wasn&#039;t enough, most items from chests in dungeons respawn so it is easy to farm them (MP refills or sell for money etc) <br><br>Some interesting mechanics, the main one being that you can have up to 3 parties you can switch to in combat. The first party is your main characters, hero+warrior+mage. The second party is made of &quot;Idols&quot;, godly creatures that you find along the way and which mostly just use spells and are AI controlled. The third party consists of soldiers you can hire, you must pay for them and their gear so I never bothered with them. Only the party active at the end of a battle recieves exp. Idols may be fused together to create new idols, however they&#039;ll start over from lvl1, though usually know better spells so it is worth it.<br>Also you can pawn items instead of selling them.<br><br>The game is huge and there are a lot of dungeons, some of which can get a bit mazey, but the dungeons look great and most of them have dedicated art and palettes.<br>The overworld is huge also and once you get the boat, it&#039;s like looking for a needle in a haystack, again and again...

You usually use the same town in between several small quests; either that or there is a good reason to come back to the town later on. This makes the world feel organic, real; vs the tired routine &quot;each area is composed of one town, one dungeon, clear that, reach next area, repeat&quot; which DQ3 started.<br>- The adventure elements, namely the treasure hunting; DQ2 probably started the &quot;you must find X number of magical key items as a goal&quot; trope for jRPGs (unless you count Zelda as an RPG), but unlike later/other use of that trope in which the key item is merely a meaningless token for denoting that you beat a dungeon; here you must go through adventure game mechanics to acquire them, acquire clues, solve puzzle, beat dungeons too sure but not only, and almost each one is acquired differently.

The game is based on the Doraemon licence, a series of manga and anime I&#039;m only vaguely familiar with (it aired for a short time two decades ago in my country).<br>In some ways it is reminiscent of the Mother series, the game starts in a realistic modern day (for the time) area, in this case Japan, before venturing into other worlds and eras. You play as yourself accompanying Doraemon in his search of allies (who come and go, but who actually leave their inventory behind when they do!), you enter your name and your sex, and there is a different character for boys and girls (this came out after DQ4). The story doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, each area has its own side plot and feel like they could be an episode from a series.<br>The musics are really good often sounding upbeat and joyous, great sounding drums and bass, and varied enough. Graphics are good enough but nothing extraordinary, some of the enemies don&#039;t look very good; but they are very varied with lot&#039;s of different locations.<br>Some interesting mechanics: there is a party chat you can use to remember what to do next and there is a seperate bag for inventory items (which can contain up to 100 items!), two things the DQ series would only introduce later on. Money is used to buy items (but not equipment, which is only found) but it is also used to cast spells and you only earn money from fights once you get back to a town.<br>Spells are treated like inventory items, so you can assign them to whomever, with the added downside of clogging the inventories quickly.

When a character dies, he&#039;s back to 1HP once the fight is over. If the entire party dies, you&#039;re back to the last save location (in a town) but you lose neither progress nor money. So the game is very lenient and just wants you to have a good time; but you still don&#039;t want to die in combat (no reviving) and enemies remain strong, so despite being a leniant game with no grinding, combat still manages to remain engaging.<br>On the downside, only a few defensive spells work at all during boss fights, few combat items did too; so it&#039;s all just the attack command against them. Also enemies in random encounters get quickly repetitive as you fight the same 3 enemies over and over in each area; although most areas are short enough it doesn&#039;t become too much a burden. You also get a Repel spell that actually works if you&#039;re tired of it. Enemies often behaved similarly too and rarely used spells so there were little incentive to prioritize targets.<br><br>All in all, a simple and easy but quirky and fun experience that managed to suck me in with its offbeat world.

Shinra&#039;s end goal was to create Neo Midgar by finding The Promised Land, a place with allegedly infinite Mako, and putting a reactor on top of it. And their goal with Jenova&#039;s corpse was to take cells from it and artificially create a human with the abilities of the Cetra. So the hybrid could speak to the Planet, point the way to The Promised Land, and Shinra could print infinite money. Which is just deranged. Imagine reading the Bible and getting to the scripture that speaks of Heaven having streets of gold. And rather than seeing that as God&#039;s promises to encourage you to get closer to God and reach a spiritual enlightenment, instead you decide to take the information you can find and make a lab baby that can possibly infiltrate heaven. So you can send your armies there to harvest the gold.<br><br>Either way it wasn&#039;t until Dr Gast found Ifalna who clarified that Jenova was not a Cetra but rather a shape shifting alien who destroyed the Cetra. And that Jenova was the enemy of the Planet. Hojo didn&#039;t give a fuck though. Even after finding Hojo and Ifalna he forged ahead with his experiments out of curiosity of what Jenova would do. And since no one updated Gast&#039;s notes from when they were still working in the Mansion, Sephiroth got the wrong idea after reading them. Believing that Jenova was a Cetra that was done dirty by humans and the world belonged to her. Just like his father though, Sephiroth didn&#039;t care and forged ahead after finding out the truth and went with his own insane Meteor plan.

Just comparing sequences in Trigger and Cross where you have to kill packs of enemies, the reptite tower is totally painless because it takes Crono half a second to draw his sword and transition into combat, and it takes two seconds to mash through text boxes at the end of combat, meaning that when you fight multiple packs of enemies it doesn&#039;t feel like your time is wasted and its all one big connected action sequence.

The Supra is a bit fat so it makes sense, but try turning in a bit earlier so you hit the inside kerb, it will shave off some time you&#039;re losing going wide+the kerb compressing the suspension will help you turn. On the hairpin exit on the other hand it seems like you stop turning left at one point because you already managed to get in the right direction before reaching the middle of the track surface, that means you&#039;re not carrying as much speed as you could. You can fix that by accelerating a tiny bit earlier and sacrificing a bit of entry speed if needed so you can get a better exit. Remember, corner exit speed is worth more than corner entry speed. You seem to be really aggressive on entry and it&#039;s probably fucking you over.

Some games just slap skip on the start button without telling you so, when it acts as pause everywhere else in the game and that&#039;s stupid and counter-intuitive. A perfect way to do this is to have the start button pause the cutscene and then offer you an option to skip or resume it, like in MGS4 or the Yakuza series, for example.

There was an astounding amount of shovelware by that time and there&#039;s no shortage of contenders for the absolute worst. But all those awful games were mostly unknown.

The gaming market was oversaturated and becoming something of a circlejerk with every console selling the same arcade ports. And the quality control, especially when it came to the 2600, could be very lax.

It was a console exclusive with a huge brand name attached to it and a major marketing push. People understandably expected at least a passable game. Something the kids they bought it for would enjoy for at least five minutes before getting bored or frustrated. And instead they got a game which was technically functional and had at least kind of unique but not really fun or intuitive gameplay.

But if you killed the turtles, which is likely if you destroyed the propeller, they become obstacles floating on water that make the traversal more difficult.<br>Brilliant design.

It had a decent amount of new IPs and third-party support (Baten Kaitos, Lost Kingdoms, Gotcha Force, Cubivore, etc).

Most of the games that utilized the RAM carts were Capcom 2D fighters, but there were some others (the port of Metal Slug uses the 1MB cart, for example).<br><br>Check the /vr/ wiki for recommended games, or post what genres you&#039;re into and we can recommend some.<br><br>gl;hf and don&#039;t forget to bully the bernieposter about the time he complained on /adv/ about his wife refusing to have sex with him but forgot to turn off his tripcode whenever you see him post.", "filename": "Segata_Sanshiro_PxZ2[1]", "ext": ".png", "w": 572, "h": 1041, "tn_w": 68, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675987256159173, "time": 1675987256, "md5": "c1LvGyJXOs+qPmBxZsvqVA==", "fsize": 466896, "resto": 9640365}, {"no": 9647845, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:50:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9647716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9647716</a><br>Thank you, I&#039;m planning on buying a PC engine next but I&#039;m definitely buying a Saturn after that.

Tengen was a subsidiary of Atari Games, and Atari Games was the arcade division of the original Atari. Atari Corp. released the Jaguar. Tengen was mostly notorious for making unlicensed games on the NES, and the Tetris thing. On the Genesis/Mega Drive, they were one of the first Sega licensed 3rd party publishers. I thought their Hard Drivin&#039;/ Race Drivin&#039; ports were good. The framerate never bothered me. Tengen did have some good arcade to Genesis ports . They did help sell the machine as an arcade system, and even published a few Japanese developed games in the west. A few sports games... Awesome Possum was them jumping on the Sonic bandwagon. Right beside Bubsy. The character Awesome Possum is almost like a tongue in cheek to Sonic.

The most noticeable one is the ice beam, and the arm cannon freezes over. These effects are not in Trilogy for whatever reason.

They&#039;re crooks, he can&#039;t get in trouble with Mario for that, right?

It generally just boils down to &quot;I don&#039;t want to have this happen to me so I will avoid it even if it is more work&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t want to have to play half the game again just for this one thing&quot;.<br><br>I&#039;ve also seen people get irritated that games stop them from doing 100% of possible tasks and situations in a single playthrough, which is ironic given those games are usually designed to let you do have a reason to replay the game. I think it&#039;s something for people who like the game enough to play it once but not enough to want to replay it. The prospect of not being able to see everything just drives them up a wall. That said, those people are likely also very self-deprecating completionistswho put way too much pressure on themselves to finish games and to act like beating a game is another checkbox on a grocery list.
