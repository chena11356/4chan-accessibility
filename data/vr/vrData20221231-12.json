Sorg, the main developer, is not directly profiting off this project, but he does accept donations which is a huge difference from providing services for pay.

Most casuals don&#039;t want to have the headaches of worrying about things like accuracy or input timing and are quick to dismiss any discrepancies they think are irrelevant, they just need the game to run and that&#039;s it. Software emulation and MiSTer may be visually difficult to distinguish under several circumstances to the average person such as color output or ability to render the game in sync with everything else. The line can be tough to draw for most on which is better because the FPGA-based emulators have quickly caught up and even exceeded it&#039;s cycle accurate software counterparts in many technical areas. For any applicable cores, MiSTer has more accurate sound (certified against MDfourier). Most importantly, no core has input delay that isn&#039;t native to the original game or hardware, something all software emulators still haven&#039;t nailed down without the use of run-ahead (banned on speedrun). Input delay is always a subject easily dismissed by the typical casual because you&#039;re not practicing a game enough to begin to care about getting optimal input timings in, you just need to play your game and that&#039;s it.

A flamethrower would also be nice for damage over time, a nice contrast to the BFG where you have to be looking at the enemy to damage them.

I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

In the west we get MANY games focusing on current day army shit. Hell, CoD is one of the largest gaming franchises ever, for instance. There is no stigma or cultural mores related to glorifying current day military combat. It&#039;s a fairly accessible field to anyone wanting to make a game about such a topic and it comes with a ready-made audience and so on. It&#039;s basically normal to such an extent you wouldn&#039;t even think twice about it.<br>But in Japan their SDF is not something any game I can think of glorifies or even uses in a current day setting. It&#039;s simply not done. So if you&#039;re a japanese military gear autist, historically, IMHO, your autism would have to be sated in some setting removed from the current day SDF. So they started inventing many different outlets for this. Gundam, Front Mission, Macross, etc...Even Ace Combat has thematically randomized factions. But the point is that THAT&#039;s how japanese military autists get their kick. They can argue about the gear, logistics, tactics, strategy, etc... in these fictional settings and so on.. it&#039;s definitely a thing. And yeah if SDF or some near-current day version of it every comes into play it&#039;s always done with some &quot;take&quot; on it rather than a straightforward gung-ho way military is in the west.<br>I think it&#039;s just a profound difference that possibly played a significant part in the mecha genre.

He went absolutely nuclear over all this, and he ended up conflating all these things together and made up a narrative that the libretro team was making millions off of his stolen code, and used it as an excuse to cease working on Duckstation altogether, which then pissed off dicksuckers in Reddit, Twitter and Resetera, who promptly attempted to cancel libretro and RetroArch.

The PS1 was sold at a similar loss to the Saturn when it launched in 1994 in Japan. This has been revealed by recent interviews from employees involved in both companies. PS1 cost about 50,000 Yen per unit to produce, Saturn cost about 54,800 Yen. Yes Saturn is more, but it&#039;s not $100 more. Both systems were sold at a $100 loss as well. The biggest cost issue in both systems wasn&#039;t the number of chips, it was the RAM. RAM prices were stupid high during this time and fell dramatically in the next 3 years. What was over $200 worth of RAM in both systems dropped to under $5 worth of RAM in the span of 2-3 years.<br><br>People love to point to $399 vs $299 but forget to look at the difference in launch dates.

Gouraud Shading doesn&#039;t really have much of a performance hit on VDP1. If you want to know how that figure is actually determined it basically boils down to this. <br><br>- A non textured pixel takes about 1 clock cycle to draw. <br>- A textured pixel takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A textured and gouraud shaded pixel still takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A half transparent pixel takes about 6 cycles to draw. <br><br>So compared to untextured pixels it&#039;s 6 times longer to draw, compared to textured it&#039;s 3 times longer to draw. So this is where your up to 6 times longer comes from. So with those values we can say that the max theoretical fillrate of VDP1 is 26-28 Million pixels per second depending on what resolution mode the Saturn is in and if you&#039;re drawing all untextured pixels. This is probably how the theoretical value listed earlier was determined. For Textured and Gouraud shaded pixels it&#039;s about 13-14 Million pixels per second. For half transparent pixels, it&#039;s about 4-5 Million pixels per second. <br><br>That&#039;s still a pretty significance performance hit for half transparencies. Throw in that they don&#039;t work correctly all the time and it&#039;s easy to see why most devs went with meshes. <br><br>That all said, if you&#039;re not doing half transparencies VDP1&#039;s fillrate is still more than enough for most games. At 320x240 resolution at 30fps you have enough fillrate to draw the entire frame buffer about 6 times per frame. So if you&#039;re sorting and culling polygons properly and not trying to draw everything as half transparent, you really shouldn&#039;t be hitting the fillrate limit.", "time": 1672264899, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9525165, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523969</a><br>Held back only by the small cartridge space.

I feel like the XBLA port was one of the best versions (It is also on PSN?, but I have never played that one)<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGH<wbr>JHq0oHw8<br>This one has the arcade visuals, but runs at a higher resolution than the arcade game, and also 60fps. <br><br>The arcade model 2 board does not run at 60fps due to some sort of limitations of the board. It&#039;s really 57fps, but when used with the right type of CRT display, you don&#039;t really notice. But 57fps would look janky on LED&#039;s, so many of the later VF2 home ports are set to 60 for consistencies sake.", "time": 1672310406, "resto": 9525881}, {"no": 9526842, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:54:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9526825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9526825</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(It is also on PSN?, but I have never played that one)</span><br>Yes, along with Fighting Vipers and Sonic the Fighters.", "time": 1672311242, "resto": 9525881}, {"no": 9526843, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:55:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9526796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9526796</a><br>32x VF1 was based and great value if you already had Genesis.

The characters are tempered (somewhat), but there are still these game like elements. Like Sarah being the blonde brainwashed assassin trope. battle Arena did kind of the same thing with Sonya. Nina is the blonde brainwashed assassin type in Tekken. Why was that a thing in 3D fighters? Akira kinda being the series Ryu, though even more boring. Jackie looks like a Ken clone, but is more like Sarah. Jeffrey is oddly more original characters. Pai is teen idol trope. Lau Chan is/ was an antagonist to Akira. Maru is mysterious ninja trope. Shun Di = drunken old man (best character), Taka =- we added a Sumo wrestler. yeah, the characters are the most basic versions of tropes.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

The schizodemonic mask salesman and his scene&#039;s odd Battlefield Earth (2000) fuckery. Three days huh? <br><br>I step out into The oddly claustrophobic town with guards at every exit and holy moley the MOON wtf. Three days! Around this time my head is hurting sweetly. How do I escape this and see the new Hyrule Field? Ho, this gang of kids will help after a game of hide &amp; se- YOU FUCKERS DO YOU NOT SEE THE MOON. They scatter, I search, the clock ticks, my hands begin to sweat. If I were really Link there&#039;d be some casualties by now that Nintendo did not intend. <br><br>I find the last kid. I go down their clubhouse and meet a new dancing scarecrow. It is speaking gibberish even though I do not think that&#039;s what the developers intend.

I look into his telescope and I see... that the clock is still ticking. Even while I peer through the scope the clock ticks. I don&#039;t know why I expected some moment of reprieve but I did, and it wasn&#039;t there. My mouth is dry and my bowels feel all twisted up. I run outside the observatory and see that I am trapped in a yard. I double check hurriedly as the clock ticks. <br><br>I break. I drop the controller, excuse myself, and go to vomit in my friend&#039;s bathroom- crying, snotting out, heaving, head splitting. Eventually I face my friend&#039;s mom to ask to use the phone to go home... She says NO! She tells me to go to bed.

Every &quot;port&quot; of Zork will have the same Z-code file.<br>There&#039;s no real reason to use the original Z-code interpreters from Infocom, as the format has been completely reverse-engineered. There are modern interpreters for Z-code for whatever platform you want - Windows, Mac, Linux, Android.<br>Also get the PDFs of the original documentation. There&#039;s a manual, a &quot;history&quot; explaining the background of the game, and a few other things.", "time": 1672470039, "resto": 9531560}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9520160, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)19:25:32", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Interactive Fiction -- anyone still play these?", "com": "I have never gotten around playing A Mind Forever Voyaging, and the premise looks interesting.

Play if you like quirky games like Wario Ware and rhythm games.<br>3. Advance Wars\u2014personally not a fan, but those who liked it spent hundreds of hours in it. Very addictive strategy game.<br>4. WarioWare\u2014quirky and addictive, one of the more original games for GBA. If you&#039;ve never tried it, do. If you did, still fun to see where it all started from.<br>5. Metroid Fusion\u2014it&#039;s 2D Metroid, enough said. It&#039;s great despite some say it&#039;s not Super Metroid.<br>6. Mother 3\u2014not a perfect RPG, but one many people want to play now. Play if you like Earthbound or want an RPG with plot.<br>7. Wario Land 4\u2014some praise this is as pinnacle of GBA or even best platformer ever, others will write it off as good but ultimately weaker than the GBC ones. Regardless, well worth a try.<br>8. Mario &amp; Luigi\u2014actually very good RPG, only brought down by bing bang wahoo style and kinda whatever graphics.<br>9. Kirbies in general\u2014always fun and worth a play. Play if you like Kirby, don&#039;t play if you&#039;re sick of platformers.<br>10. Mega Man Zero 3 &amp; 4\u2014decent games, but got pretty overrated recently as some &quot;official canon classics&quot;. I beat them all, they&#039;re fun and good but not really masterpieces. Play if you like Mega Man X series and / or have played the other 9 games already.<br>Not on the list:<br>SNES ports, especially Mario ports\u2014kind of obsolete in current day and age, maybe save for SMW as you can collect dragon coins in it, but that&#039;s it.<br>Pokemons\u2014you either love them or hate them. If you love them, you probably know which ones to play anyway, and may prefer remakes. <br>Zelda: Minish Cap\u2014it&#039;s more Zelda. Play it or skip it, it&#039;s alright if you want more ALTTP but thats about it.<br>Treasure games\u2014no comment.<br>Mega Man Battle Network\u2014one of those monster / card collect series that just goes on and on.", "time": 1672043990, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518704, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:53:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518654</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his list is baaad, look at my list look at my list! </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the same but has one-dollar-store Symphony of the Night with ladyboy characters!</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9518683</span><br><a href=\"#p9518687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518687</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;then takes it so seriously he deletes his post over a typo and uses alt codes</span><br>I hope you are a janny because otherwise you need to touch snail shells right now", "time": 1672044817, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518708, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:59:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518704</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look at my list look at my list</span><br>I never posted a list.

And by 95-96, most people had at least a 4x CD-ROM drive. CD&#039;s as a medium took off because of music CD&#039;s.

Computers were already headed that way since 1.44MB floppy disks were turning game/program installs into 10-20 disk ordeals. That&#039;s what drove the adoption of the CD format.

This standardization also carried on throughout other RPGs where the more distinct and out there Toad designs have been dropped, although NPC variety tends to be a slightly better due to using mooks/Yoshis as well as Toads.<br>Basically, all of this cemented Miyamoto as a control-freak mad man hellbent on removing the &quot;soul&quot; from the series.

But only in BL I can beat form, best playable.<br>BL - 10/10<br>SCIV - 8/10<br>RoB - 9.5/10<br>Starting Dracula X snes remake.
