Not to mention his fake-outs are indecipherable from his attacks until the very last second, which combined with the massive hitbox and the fact that he oftentimes sways above/below you right before going in, you oftentimes will physically not have enough time to react, as you have to scale literally half the wall in a fraction of a second. <br><br>As someone who has played and mastered a lot of games, I could instantly tell within about a minute or two (after determining that there is no memo and it&#039;s all pure RNG bullshit) that this was a poorly designed shit boss from an incompetent hack; and usually Konami are pretty good, so I am very disappointed.

You can&#039;t let go too late or you will get hit. You literally have to treat every charge past a certain point as an attack.

It&#039;s actually really annoying because you need to hold up and no other direction to jump up, and then to jump down, you must either press down or no direction at all, and then press right into the wall at the precise time. If you mess up your inputs at all or jump without the proper direction pressed, you&#039;re basically fucked. <br><br>The other thing is that you have to be *extremely* close to the top and bottom. There&#039;s some kind of logic where it seems to like to hit you in a spot where you have an extremely small margin of error to dodge; there&#039;s many charges where you have to be within pixels of the top/bottom to avoid the second bounce.

Here is how it came about:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Atari sued Activision they laid claim to certain \u2018proprietary\u2019 techniques. One technique for which they claimed ownership was first used by Bob Whitehead in the display code of the Atari Chess cartridge. This method moved the display objects back and forth every scan line to allow the game to display more objects. On the chess pieces, for example, Bob showed the odd pixel row of the odd numbered columns of pieces and the even pixel row of the even numbered columns. We called this the Venetian Blind technique since it made the pieces look like they were being viewed through a venetian blind.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One day in the lab at Activision while the lawsuit was in full swing, Bob and I collaborated on a practical joke. We made a display showing an architecturally accurate window with a view of a grassy hill at sunset. We covered it with a venetian blind effect that animated up and down (complete with the stacking up of the slats as they were gathered up by the blind mechanism). We took it to CES and showed it to a few people who were privy to the lawsuit, asking \u2018Is this what Atari means by the Venetian Blind Technique?\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The joke was on us in one respect, when we realized that we had made public our latest innovation (the background sunset) when we showed it to our competitors. (Several games in the lab were using this new idea, but they had not yet been published.) As it turned out, nobody picked up on our slip and nobody beat us to market with the sunset.\u201d ~ David Crane</span>", "time": 1672589122, "resto": 9523001}, {"no": 9536297, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)19:53:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523274</a><br><br>This guy is the most stupid-looking Pok\u00e9mon character I have seen so far.", "time": 1672620828, "resto": 9523001}, {"no": 9537420, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)07:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523389</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As you can probably tell, we&#039;re very excited</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an unparalleled achievement in storytelling, presentation and game design</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s one of those rare &quot;event&quot; games that are not to be missed</span><br><br>Normally I&#039;d expect this level of gushing to be reserved for a new Zelda game.

Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

Retro fags like us who recognize the aesthetic appeal of that time are appreciating all these things in a completely different context. So when modern indie devs go for that look, they can usually recreate the technical limitations and specifics, but lack the top-of-the-line skill and the time-specific mindsets of those eras. An overblown example for comparison would be a modern archeologist trying to recreate ancient egyptian sculpture. He could get the tech down through research, but there&#039;s no way to recreate the mindset and education of those ancient artists. <br><br><a href=\"#p9537435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9537435</a><br>The hell are you talking about?

While I love Space Harrier to a huge degree, I also like Ecco. They are very different, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. I hate this comparison being thrown around, but in many ways Ecco is like Demon&#039;s Souls was compared to other contemporary games. <br><br>From an objective standpoint there are many harder retro games, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania 3, Super Ghouls n Ghosts, Battletoads, 1ccing Gradius etc (all of which get regular threads here by people declaring that the difficulty is overstated) are all much harder than anything Ecco throws at you, even the last levels. Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed. You can call it tedious, but it was never meant to be a bing bing wahoo rush to the finish type game. Unreliable just makes no sense, if you want to permakill an enemy, you can. It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere. Along with that love is the understanding it doesn&#039;t appeal to everyone, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing.

I don&#039;t know if power is completely cut to the cartridge memory when the &quot;Reset&quot; button on the console is used, but using that instead of On/Off still led to memory being erased.<br>From further reading, the only two things I&#039;ve discovered are:<br>1) multiple people in similar situations who said they had broken pin/trace connections to the chips, so they soldered wires directly from whichever pin(s) were disconnected to the appropriate chip. I&#039;d have to spend a lot of time continuity testing and then finding a wire to put on there, which is more work than I&#039;m willing to do, or;<br>2) I also saw a post from a guy saying that he owns two N64s, and one of them wipes the game data from cartridges he uses with it. If my problem is with the N64, that&#039;s possibly another can of worms, and would very likely be the same approach/solution as above. The only other game I have to test with is Mario Kart 64, which holds its data no problem. I don&#039;t think it utilizes the same CR2032 battery-based save system / PCB model, so I&#039;m not sure if an N64-based fault would necessarily lead to data wiping on it anyway.", "time": 1672427710, "resto": 9517990}, {"no": 9530506, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)14:17:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Finished up my x station install, about to do a triple bypass on my genesis.

If anything, the pressure intensified, even though we had a 2,300 sqft house with absolutely fuck all in it. Divorce was painful but worth it in the end. My current house is a little over half the size of the one we had together, but I actually have control over it, and don&#039;t just live in it like some kind of pet while my wife makes all the decisions and lords over me.

I wasted a total of 4 years with my ex wife, then I had to recover from the divorce, then get out dating again. Even if my gf and I got married and had a kid by this time next year (unlikely), there would still be a significant age gap (5+ years) between my kid and most of my friends&#039; kids. A lot of parents, most of my friends included, keep in touch by organizing &quot;play dates&quot; with kids of similar age, but my kids wouldn&#039;t really be able to play with the others because they would be at different development stages.

And games THRIVE based on the casual player. <br><br>From a casual player&#039;s perspective:<br><br>You are getting by enemies from above AND below (no room to breathe). Your area of movement is limited to a narrow section of water (assuming the stage isn&#039;t in the way). The stage constantly shifts and shoots out random rocks or coral reef to block or kill you. And worst of all the game treats your submarine&#039;s main weapon, the TORPEDO, like a normal bullet. It doesn&#039;t feel satisfying to hit an enemy with a big torpedo only for them to shrug it off. Then you gotta fire 5 or 10 more torpedos just to kill them. That&#039;s not how submarine warfare should be or feel. The whole thing feels stiff. <br><br>If I saw this in 1993 at the arcades (I might have), I wouldn&#039;t play it more than a handful of times and never try it again. And based on what I saw, In the Hunt wasn&#039;t that popular at arcades. Not like later games of the 90s.<br><br><br>Like other anon said, the submarine levels in Metal Slug were much more well done, and approachable. It embraced the wackiness of the level without going overboard. You could hop in and out of a submarine as a diver and still shoot enemies. You could shoot bullets from your submarine (yes I know it&#039;s not possible in real subs, but I accept that for fun gameplay). You could move around in a larger area. And lastly your torpedoes actually matter. They have big power behind them. Metal Slug just got everything just right in gameplay and design. <br><br>In the Hunt feels like an earlier version of Metal Slug&#039;s submarine levels. An early version where things aren&#039;t properly fine tuned or correctly balanced. Like an early draft. But it has great artwork and sprites though.<br><br>I can see why hardcore schmup fans like In the Hunt, but I don&#039;t enjoy it as a casual player.

There are tons of times where you peek out, pop a depth charge or missile and then slink away, it&#039;s pretty great. For damage output though, generally you want to pointblank with your depth charges or balloons. <br><br>The main issue is just the rank system. The game is much more fun and more manageable at lower ranks, but casual players are just going to pick up every powerup. I do also think it could benefit from a slightly faster movement speed. I think slower movement speed is great for the type of gameplay it rewards, but it could be just like 10-20% faster. <br><br>Metal Slug&#039;s submarine stages are just way too basic in comparison.

The PS1 was sold at a similar loss to the Saturn when it launched in 1994 in Japan. This has been revealed by recent interviews from employees involved in both companies. PS1 cost about 50,000 Yen per unit to produce, Saturn cost about 54,800 Yen. Yes Saturn is more, but it&#039;s not $100 more. Both systems were sold at a $100 loss as well. The biggest cost issue in both systems wasn&#039;t the number of chips, it was the RAM. RAM prices were stupid high during this time and fell dramatically in the next 3 years. What was over $200 worth of RAM in both systems dropped to under $5 worth of RAM in the span of 2-3 years.<br><br>People love to point to $399 vs $299 but forget to look at the difference in launch dates. By the time the PS1 launched at $299 Sega had already dropped the Saturn to $349 due to the new VA1 revision and falling RAM prices with it still coming with a game. If you bought a game with your PS1 at launch, you&#039;d be paying the same amount. 2-3 weeks after the PS1 launched Sega released a Saturn that didn&#039;t come with a game for $299. By late Spring of 1996 both systems dropped to $199 due to RAM prices continuing to fall dramatically, and in Sega&#039;s case more cost reductions with the Model 2 Saturn.<br><br>The price wasn&#039;t the issue, it was the horrible launch line up in the US.", "time": 1672255312, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9524826, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:22:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9524640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9524640</a><br>The Saturn&#039;s VDP2 was effectively an entirely separate GPU with dedicated VRAM so a game could offload environments to it and not have to compete with other things for resources in the way the PS1 does.<br><br>Something similar happens with visual effects like the water and heat ripples in Mega Man 8 and Mega Man X4.

Gouraud Shading doesn&#039;t really have much of a performance hit on VDP1. If you want to know how that figure is actually determined it basically boils down to this. <br><br>- A non textured pixel takes about 1 clock cycle to draw. <br>- A textured pixel takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A textured and gouraud shaded pixel still takes about 2 cycles to draw. <br>- A half transparent pixel takes about 6 cycles to draw. <br><br>So compared to untextured pixels it&#039;s 6 times longer to draw, compared to textured it&#039;s 3 times longer to draw. So this is where your up to 6 times longer comes from. So with those values we can say that the max theoretical fillrate of VDP1 is 26-28 Million pixels per second depending on what resolution mode the Saturn is in and if you&#039;re drawing all untextured pixels. This is probably how the theoretical value listed earlier was determined. For Textured and Gouraud shaded pixels it&#039;s about 13-14 Million pixels per second. For half transparent pixels, it&#039;s about 4-5 Million pixels per second. <br><br>That&#039;s still a pretty significance performance hit for half transparencies. Throw in that they don&#039;t work correctly all the time and it&#039;s easy to see why most devs went with meshes. <br><br>That all said, if you&#039;re not doing half transparencies VDP1&#039;s fillrate is still more than enough for most games. At 320x240 resolution at 30fps you have enough fillrate to draw the entire frame buffer about 6 times per frame. So if you&#039;re sorting and culling polygons properly and not trying to draw everything as half transparent, you really shouldn&#039;t be hitting the fillrate limit.", "time": 1672264899, "resto": 9523960}, {"no": 9525165, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523969</a><br>Held back only by the small cartridge space.

The reason is because there&#039;s a series of spike floors and ceilings that you have to carefully navigate through. In PlayStation version, this section is easier to navigate since the visibility is perfectly clear. In Saturn version, because the long spikes are affected by the new water effect, it&#039;s inadvertently harder to determine the spike tips and platform edges, making it easier to instantly lose a life. I can attest to game-overing here on Saturn while it was a breeze on PlayStation. There are more spikes in an optional area in the second half of the level, but they&#039;re shorter, the tunnel is a lot less narrow, and there&#039;s much less going on visually, so it shouldn&#039;t be a problem there.

I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too.

Most casuals don&#039;t want to have the headaches of worrying about things like accuracy or input timing and are quick to dismiss any discrepancies they think are irrelevant, they just need the game to run and that&#039;s it. Software emulation and MiSTer may be visually difficult to distinguish under several circumstances to the average person such as color output or ability to render the game in sync with everything else. The line can be tough to draw for most on which is better because the FPGA-based emulators have quickly caught up and even exceeded it&#039;s cycle accurate software counterparts in many technical areas. For any applicable cores, MiSTer has more accurate sound (certified against MDfourier). Most importantly, no core has input delay that isn&#039;t native to the original game or hardware, something all software emulators still haven&#039;t nailed down without the use of run-ahead (banned on speedrun).

A lot of people are understandably skeptical, others have already settled for other solutions [besides hardware] and prefer to not research yet another way to play due to caution of finding out it&#039;s not worth it afterall.

Each character looks appropriate to their fighting styles. Shenmue was originally conceived to be a Virtua Fighter RPG for Akira.

A flamethrower would also be nice for damage over time, a nice contrast to the BFG where you have to be looking at the enemy to damage them.
