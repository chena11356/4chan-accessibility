undeserved positive reputation on the Internet due to being the only American Nintendo magazine. I can understand the nostalgia for the early &quot;artwork and walkthroughs&quot;-heavy issues from the 80s, but after video game journalism started EXISTING period, it&#039;s just an embarrassment really. It&#039;s bad for a video game magazine, it&#039;s bad for a Nintendo-only magazine, it&#039;s bad for an English video game magazine and it&#039;s bad for an English Nintendo-only magazine.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit. But this profit never came from me because I owned a pirated bootleg and I have nothing to complain<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MK is &quot;fair&quot; because everyone has the same punches and attacks lmao</span><br>&lt;SF2 is &quot;fair&quot; because let you stun and have a biting fatality at the middle of the match lmao<br>If you want to use different attacks in MK try special attacks with different commands that are meant for it. MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

Compared to DC, GCN doubles the number of dungeuns, adds new character classes, completely overhauls and rebalances the classes for the better, adds an absolute fuckton of new rare weapons to find (the main reason to play the game long-term) and makes their droprates almost reasonable compared to the absurdly low droprates on DC. The Spread Needle is no longer so OP as to completely dominate online play to the point where you won&#039;t get a single hit in if a teammate is using one. It fixes the glitch that allowed players to teamkill. It fixes the glitch that allowed players to go through locked doors. You no longer drop your money and equipped weapon when you die, to be ganked by other players. It adds a quick item select like the one in Monster Hunter that makes it MUCH easier to use items and spells that aren&#039;t assigned to your main 6 buttons. (On DC, you&#039;re stuck with JUST those 6 actions, at least two of which will be your basic attacks. Have fun juggling all those spells if you&#039;re a spellcaster) Spells now go up to Lv 30 instead of capping at Lv 15, and only Spellcasters can go above level 20, giving you an actual reason to use a spellcaster. GCN also adds splitscreen multiplayer, which is the best reason to play it. You can play online on private servers, either through a Gamecube with a broadband adapter, or a Wii with a lan adapter, but be warned; you have to take alot of precautions playing any console version online. Any rando in your lobby or your game can potentially freeze your game with a cheat device, causing you to lose all unequipped items on your character.

One character class (Onion Knight), which kinda sucked anyway and was a major pain in the ass to master.<br>3. The updated translation, it sticks to the straight to the point, no bullshit script of the PSX release as opposed to going all Shakespearean on your ass. Some people will love it, others will hate it - there&#039;s two crowds of FFT fans, plenty of arguments have been made for both translations over the years.<br><br>So that&#039;s what you&#039;d miss out on.

The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin (MD) to me is the 1st real example of the character&#039;s powers and moveset being adapted well into a video game, to the point where you do actually feel like him, and it&#039;s quite satisfying, especially the webslinging, they nailed it, and this installment is still one of the best in the whole series to me, I recommend it.<br><br>Of course there are tons more, some respectable efforts on Nintendo&#039;s and SEGA&#039;s 8bit consoles and handhelds, especially the GBC&#039;s duology, and of course the GBA installments, there are quite a few of those. I believe most will have memories from the SNES and Mega Drive installments though, there were a lot in that generation, some good, some bad, and some more mixed among fans, either way I believe having a thread to discuss there memories, and new discoveries, could be fun, as Spider-Man&#039;s 2D career seems finished, especially after Insomniac&#039;s titles, so I figured there was no better time to discuss them, as what we have is probably all that there&#039;ll be.", "filename": "11012410_10205975305996182_9020790287426082429_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 960, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673322608082335, "time": 1673322608, "md5": "hClQFzKTFlxoMre8oFbdoQ==", "fsize": 100364, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "2d-spiderman", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 1, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 9558360, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)04:22:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9557860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9557860</a><br>Well, I suppose I could try kicking discussions off with something that has been on my mind for a while. I talked about The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin (MD) in the OP, and I&#039;ve always wondered about a couple of things regarding it, the 1st is... what&#039;s the overall consensus for it? I often see many hold it in high regard, but at the same time I often see it get a lot of harsh criticism, so it&#039;s hard to determine wheter it&#039;s mostly beloved or simply mixed in its reception. Now, for the 2nd thing I wonder about it, it&#039;s regarding its other versions, not so much the 8bit ones, since those, while respectable for the hardware they were made for, can be annoying due to only having a single life and no continues, it doesn&#039;t play as well as the original either... no, the main port that strikes my curiosity is the SEGA CD one, I&#039;ve played it recently after hearing many talk about how it was the definitive version, and while I see how it improves on a few things, it&#039;s overall not as fun as the original to me... which version do you consider to be superior, anons?", "filename": "c53ca19fba451ef8825d6beaf2890885", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 580, "h": 799, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673342522484112, "time": 1673342522, "md5": "k8JQUb48AR28m5kZV9kDRA==", "fsize": 115138, "resto": 9557860}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9558132, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:30:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What am I in for?

You have to roll to wide jump, which is less visceral and chancier in tight spots than Mario&#039;s quick duck, while it&#039;s too easy to accidentally roll when you actually want to crouch for a high jump because the stick has to be 100% neutral, which doesn&#039;t have a good flow, and it generally lacks Mario&#039;s rhythm and risk and reward. Of course you can&#039;t copy Mario 1:1, but devs always fail to copy and likely even understand the thing that makes 3D Marios fun (and the only 3D platformer that still matters today), which is exactly rhythm and risk and reward. Even the easiest platorms in Mario can be a challenge if you want to do things like backflips instead of standard jumps, but it always feels rewarding. You can constantly challenge yourself with timing triple jumps and dives to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and pits while still having to factor those into your timing if you want to go fast while also having the advantage of higher/longer jumps. The closest to that Jak has is spamming rolls and wide jumps, which is more like the rolling in Zelda, doesn&#039;t really give you an advantage outside of going faster and doesn&#039;t require any skill or timing, besides being impossible or needlessly risky to use in tight spots due to its clunkiness.<br><br>There are some interesting moves and occasional fun platforming, but it&#039;s few and far between and it (but especially its sequels) bogs itself down with boring vehicle segments or extremely shallow combat, like already in the first few minutes of 3 where you have to kill 20 goons with the simplest combo string to be allowed to progress", "filename": "Owless", "ext": ".gif", "w": 320, "h": 180, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673233732759643, "time": 1673233732, "md5": "FZeWte8HwEq/eDg75zJbiQ==", "fsize": 3156953, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9554872, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:17:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9554850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9554850</a><br>autism", "time": 1673234234, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9554974, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:50:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9553591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553591</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;widely seen as an equal or better than the first</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;widely seen</span><br>The only people I&#039;ve ever heard say any game other than the first one is the best were contrarians on here.<br><a href=\"#p9553623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553623</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;copied Mario&#039;s moveset but somehow made it clunkier</span><br>To me it felt more like Crash but in an actual 3D game.", "time": 1673236210, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9554995, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:58:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9553591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553591</a><br>the only good parts are the levels outside the open world, the rest is dog shit, this happens way too often in open world games.", "time": 1673236717, "resto": 9553591}, {"no": 9555001, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:59:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9553603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9553603</a><br>No one thought that about the gameplay when it came out.

The difficulty is unforgiving as they basically never give you HP in the last half of the game and expect you to simply die and try again. The ammo not refilling on death is annoying. The final boss is very disappointing. The plot is fun but even as a kid I felt like the ending just comes out of nowhere and all of a sudden the game is over. Ultimately my favorite thing about this game is the characters and the cutscenes - the way it feels like a PG13 pixar. I expected to like this more than I did, and that is a let down.

Imagine playing RE in 1996 and having fun exploring the mansion. It&#039;s a bit creepy and fairly slow paced. Fast forward to 1998 and you watch the opening fmv of zombies over running the city and start the actual gameplay with Jill getting thrown from an exploding building. There are way more zombies and they are a lot faster. However you can dodge and you get a lot more weapons and ammo. You&#039;re no longer plodding about looking for a way out of the big puzzle house. The city is fucked and you will be too if you don&#039;t get out of there fast. If the zombies don&#039;t get you the nuke will. You have to explore the ravaged streets and buildings of a once peaceful town to make your final escape. The sheer amount of escalation would have been intense. RE2 definitely had some escalation but RE3 really cranked it up.

It was developed and planned for a 1975 launch date but a change in RCA management during this time pushed it back to an early 1977 release. The Studio II&#039;s black and white graphics looked inferior to the Fairchild Channel F which displayed in color, and the Atari VCS&#039;s launch later in the year made it look even cruder. It was discontinued in early 1978 and an estimated between 57,000 and 64,000 units sold. This would make it the smallest-selling game console ever sold in North America. The decision to pull the plug came after the Studio II failed to sell much over the 1977 holiday season and the realization that it had no hope to compete with the VCS. The Charlotte, North Carolina plant where the Studio II was manufactured was closed and 120 workers laid off.<br><br>The Studio II used RCA&#039;s 1802, the first microprocessor fabricated in CMOS, and a custom graphics chip known as &quot;Pixie&quot; which displayed 64x32 block graphics.

Much like many other remasters, old and new, it messes with the visuals far too much. The colors are washed out, the contrast and saturation aren&#039;t right, and it&#039;s lacking the chunky pixel goodness. Plus, the last update released doesn&#039;t mix well with some systems and may cause the game to be inherently laggy, and there&#039;s no fix to it except for rolling back to the previous version, which is only possible on GOG.

Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed.

It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere.

Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

Because the Oracle games have key details that don&#039;t line up with other games like how the Master Sword is found, it was believed to take place at the very end of the timeline. By finally destroying Twinrova in a linked game, the cycle is severed.

I had a good enough time, though I found it pretty easy once you got Second Chance. Then I played KH2 which I had never played. I dropped 2. I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too. I ended up dropping 2 because the combat just wasn&#039;t very interesting to me and the amount of cutscenes was just frustrating with how often it took control away from you.
