Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

It turned into a janky mess once most people moved on to Battlefield 2 or Battlefield Vietnam. All the players left behind figured out the most efficient way to play was to either bomb people from so far up they can&#039;t be hit by AA fire, to nail people with tank fire like an artillery cannon, or to dump grenades near them. Since then, every map with planes will be the players who reached the aircraft first dominating everyone on the ground, all maps with tanks are determined by which side has more tank spawns, and maps without vehicles or jeep-only are grenade and explosive pack battles. If you find that fun, the game is still playable, otherwise it&#039;s been dead for a really long time.<br>I played the shit out of the game when it first came out, and I&#039;ve played it a bit off and on the last couple of years.

If I can&#039;t have fun and get involved in crazy battles and jeep races, then I might as well just play against the AI. The AI is far from a great experience, and certainly nowhere near as dynamic as the servers used to be, but at least it doesn&#039;t insta-kill you from outside of your visible range.

That is usually the case for any product oriented company with a fairly successful early stage growth rate.<br><br>My personal approach is to determine in a franchise, when and where the cracking points for passion and quality starts to substantially influence and negatively impact the end products.

Basically, the joke of the day back in 1989 was that the Leisure Suit Larry series was finished. At the end of LSL3, he gets a job literally working for Sierra and lives in a log cabin with his wife. The end. Then there were some firings at Sierra that year of a couple notable individuals (who will not be mentioned, for fear of internet-sleuths finding me out), who were caught having a seance in the backrooms of the offices at 3:33 AM. Al Lowe, who was a practicing Methodist at the time, demanded they be fired. Shortly after, Sierra wanted a sequel to Leisure Suit Larry 3, which Al Lowe refused to do. Until a series of unfortunate misshaps occurred. According to sources, Al Low slept in one day an hour later than usual. When he tried to get ready to go to work and hurried out the door, he saw a piano had fallen on his car. The next week, on a busride back from the office, a man held the driver of the bus at knife point and almost stabbed Lowe, until a plain-clothes policeman arrested the would-be attacker. Bad shit continued to happen, and eventually Al Lowe decided he was getting someone upstairs angry for not using his talents, so began work on LSL4.<br><br>That&#039;s where the fun stuff begins. Almost immediately following the development of the coding for the game, it repeatedly had to be redone, as the code constantly got corrupted over and over again. Art assets would unknowingly disappear. Apparently late one night, Al Lowe stated he heard faint whisperings in the office and was so skeeved out he refused to work late nights anymore. He also heard tell of a man in black who would arrive in the office lobby, before anyone was at the office, when the doors were locked, at 5 AM on the dot for 2 weeks straight.

These days the idea that reviewers and players alike were seeking a challenge is such an alien concept, so hard to fathom, that people like to &#039;blame&#039; difficulty of older games onto &quot;rentals&quot;, as a way to say &quot;it was intended bad design to fuck with the player&quot;, just so they can feel better about sucking or using cheats. <br>Yet, there are countless proofs that this mentality was real in the west, pic related being one (longetivity score, and thus the game&#039;s overall score being tied to challenge), or Japanese devs interviews explaining that very difference in mentality.<br>In Europe rentals weren&#039;t nearly as developed as in the US, it even quickly became banned in some countries. Yet, they still got the more difficult version of games in many cases; even when that version was a unique version (for instance Castlevania 3 which has 3 different difficulty, Europe difficulty being harder than Japanese). There is also the case of Battletoads, an European game made easier for the Japanese market.<br>As I was saying, rentals are one factor but do not cover it all.", "filename": "N-Force_No_6_1992-12_Europress_Impact_GB_0012", "ext": ".png", "w": 1100, "h": 1435, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673560596128055, "time": 1673560596, "md5": "dw8NI1u5pOCyHH242yb65A==", "fsize": 2398682, "resto": 9563625}, {"no": 9565287, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:11:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9564916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9564916</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s not the intended way though.

Consoles and arcades were in a decline starting in 1980. Computer gaming was on the rise during the same period. All thanks to the new cheap micro-computers like the Apple II, Atari ST, C64, etc. Computer gaming hit a slump in 1985 until 1988-89 when VGA started getting widespread and not just cutting edge. Consoles hit a slump themselves in 1993 and didn&#039;t recover until 1996, and arcades were going down in profits during the same time. Never hear anyone talk about the computer videogames crash of 1985-1988 or the videogames crash of 1993-1996.<br>The only difference is there was a major recession in the early 1980&#039;s.

Compare this with CPS2 games that have more big and unique, sometimes animates objects in their backgrounds.<br>Next, the chatacters animations. MK Trilogy sprites are very thin and don&#039;t have much unique animations. SF Alpha games are kind of simple too but Darkstalkers and Marvel vs games have more elaborate attack animations that take a large chunk of screen (and VRAM). MK Trilogy being this lightweight on animations is pretty much confirmed by the PS1 version: it easily holds 4 unique characters for 2 on 2 combat in PS1 RAM - when one character is defeated the game doesn&#039;t stop to load the second one from the disc. No Capcom game manages to have four complete and unique characters in a single fight on PS1 because they take much more memory than Mortal Kombat ones.<br>N64 has more RAM and doesn&#039;t have to deal with loading from the disk at all, so it allows SIX unique characters in 3 on 3 combat. Great, right? But here&#039;s the deal: the animation quality is worse than in PS1 version. So while there are six characters in N64 RAM, even having only two of them on screen, N64 can&#039;t animate them as fast as PS1 version. This is barely a cart size issue - adding a couple of frames to each character standing idle animation would make them look a whole lot smoother and this takes a very little space of ROM. MKT ROM has a enough of padding (aka unused space) for this. Even without using the unused space they could just remove that fancy MK logo in flames title screen and shitty looking MK1 stages and add better animation instead. But they didn&#039;t because N64 can&#039;t run it as smooth anyway.", "time": 1673501177, "resto": 9561618}, {"no": 9563216, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:33:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9562805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9562805</a><br>There are certainly no 1800 sprites in Mario Kart.

The sprites themselves are very nicely and smoothly animated but they are very small in size. And finally, the game doesn&#039;t run at 60 fps.

Last one of these new games I tried was Ikaraga... Sorry! but I learned to play color-matching games when I was two, don&#039;t need to do it anymore! Deleted THAT computer application from my Dell desktop after about 20 minutes.<br><br>R-Type, Gradius, Darius... those classics are a little more up MY alley. No TINY hitboxes to make the game look harder than it is, no half-naked japanimation cartoon girls, no gimmicky scoring to cover up the total lack of any real substance... just a little thing called good old-fashioned GAMEPLAY that seems to be forgotten nowadays... yep, I love all the super-duper powerups, and checkpoints.. yes recovery is HARD but not IMPOSSIBLE. You actually have to put in a little elbow grease to get your strength back! Something the little ones today could stand to learn from, if you ask me! They seem to want games where you can kill everything on the screen with one button press, right after inserting a coin! Instant gratification with no challenge. And personally, I usually prefer a &quot;side-view&quot; kind of shooter compared to a &quot;bird&#039;s eye view&quot; one, all those obstacles give levels a lot more personality, not such a common thing when every me-too game wants to look and play the same.<br><br>Me, I&#039;ve been playing a lot of R-Type part two lately. I can only clear a couple of boards on my first man right now. I may wear out my joystick before I can manage my one quarter win! But I don&#039;t quit!

I did have a Game Boy, however, and when the 16-bit consoles came around I opted for a SNES, perhaps because I always, even at a very early age, had a powerful instinctive aversion to Sonic and his gay little universe.", "time": 1673433661, "resto": 9560705}, {"no": 9561003, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)06:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9560724</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sorry for breaking the illusion</span><br><br>I consider this plot to be a part of the series", "filename": "Land_of_Illusion_starring_Mickey_Mouse_Coverart", "ext": ".png", "w": 252, "h": 357, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673435587070133, "time": 1673435587, "md5": "BtJ5m+V+pWxyF7UWUJpxNQ==", "fsize": 199749, "resto": 9560705}, {"no": 9561205, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)09:36:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9560705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9560705</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;was it ever a competitor to the nes</span>", "filename": "UK Sales Chart May 1992", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 762, "h": 820, "tn_w": 116, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673447779124007, "time": 1673447779, "md5": "5uQ3CfvDBGcdrtYhtGPrxw==", "fsize": 290786, "resto": 9560705}, {"no": 9561212, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)09:40:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9560724</span><br>not really surprising.
