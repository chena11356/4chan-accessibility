And some of those boards were also brittle or poorly made. Sega Model 3 and Hikaru boards were notorious for having so many problems. Hikaru boards especially were bad because they were known for breaking because of bad solder joints. Capacitors would literally break off the board when arcade businesses tried to move the machine to another part of the building in a normal move. It was so bad that Sega discontinued them only after a few games were made with them, and arcade owners complained to Sega about poor quality. <br><br>Those boards use proprietary parts.

We could have almost had a &quot;Namco-Sega&quot; or Namga.", "time": 1671747314, "resto": 9505495}, {"no": 9511513, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)18:34:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9511381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9511381</a><br>What if Sega-Sammy merged with Bandai-Namco", "time": 1671752062, "resto": 9505495}, {"no": 9511650, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:06:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9505495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9505495</a><br>SEGA", "time": 1671757602, "resto": 9505495}, {"no": 9511898, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)22:55:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9510557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9510557</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sega of course. Why is that even a question? Namco was LITERALLY know as the company that made clones of whatever Sega did at the time.</span><br><br>To be fair, Sega was chasing Namco a lot too... <br>Namco - Rolling Thunder (1986): <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADE<wbr>F8Uue7_0<br>Sega - Shinobi (1987): <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqS<wbr>cgMHVe3c<br><br>In many ways Rolling Thunder started this genre. But even Rolling Thunder took inspiration from Elevator Action. The original arcade Shinobi was Sega&#039;s version of Rolling Thunder. <br><br>Namco - Mappy (1983): <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X08<wbr>oIPJPFX8<br>Sega - Flicky (1984): <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0D<wbr>actXaCHM<br>Mappy was a big hit for Namco. Flicky was clearly Sega&#039;s version. Flicky is a lot less well known, but the character was merged into the Sonic universe. <br><br>Namco- Winning Run (1988) <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ox<wbr>vAoZmPdw<br>Sega - Virtua Racing (1992): <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssP<wbr>fEPaTaGo<br>Now Sega&#039;s Virtua Racing came out a few years after Winning Run. But Virtua Racing would not exist if Namco didn&#039;t do it first. I think it took a while for Sega to develop their own 3D hardware to do it. Before Virtua Racing, almost all of Sega&#039;s &#039;3D&#039; games were super scaler games. <br><br>On the Sega side, Tekken was developed by a former Sega employee who worked on the original Virtua Fighter. Time Crisis was a response to Virtua Cop, but at the same time, it was also originally meant to be another game in the Rolling Thunder series. The cover mechanic was inspired by Rolling Thunder.

You start with FE3 (Mystery of the Emblem), where the first half of the game is a full remake of FE1, and then you just play through the rest of the series in order until FE10. Fire Emblem is also quite flawed but I feel the amazing scale of the journey from FE3-10 somewhat helps make up for the (numerous and varied) issues.", "time": 1671758786, "resto": 9508196}, {"no": 9511724, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:01:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9508196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9508196</a><br>the only non childish rpgs on snes I know are<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Uncharted waters games</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7th saga</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brandish</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadowrun</span>", "time": 1671760868, "resto": 9508196}, {"no": 9511732, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:08:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9508196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9508196</a><br>Final Fantasy III/6. /thread", "time": 1671761333, "resto": 9508196}, {"no": 9511735, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:10:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9508227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9508227</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying SMRPG has better gameplay than Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger</span><br>Justify this.<br><br>At least you shouted out FF5, which never gets enough love.", "time": 1671761439, "resto": 9508196}, {"no": 9511738, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9511724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9511724</a><br>7th Saga and Brandish are not great games though, and Shadowrun while enjoyable doesn&#039;t have terribly broad appeal.", "time": 1671761587, "resto": 9508196}, {"no": 9511741, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:14:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Go with Super Robot Wars 3 or Shin Megami Tensei, they are both stone cold classics", "time": 1671761669, "resto": 9508196}, {"no": 9512486, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)05:26:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9508196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9508196</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It looks a bit childish for my liking</span><br><br>Good luck finding a JRPG that isn&#039;t childish.

The reason why players like Gunstar Heroes is the same reason they like garbage like Vampire Survivors or Blazing Lazers, and also why like 99% of Gunstar Heroes never bothered with Expert. They just run through the game on normal facetanking a ton of damage and using the trace laser (which is dogshit on Expert btw, for some reason each difficulty manually rebalances the weapons, unlike other games where you organically figure out why a certain weapon is better or worse with experience). People just really love when the game plays itself and has a bunch of explosions and shit to make them feel like they are some badass doing all that.<br><br>Gunstar Heroes could actually be halfway competent if there was a stationary aim button, as well as the ability to choose your loadout instead of relying on two separate instances of RNG. Also I don&#039;t know why they give the bosses such stupidly absurd health pools but then just such simple, repetitive patterns (almost as if no one even tested Expert lol).

Even though Mario 2 was a bit weird and different, it was kinda the norm for Nintendo sequels to be a bit different. Also, the dream sequence helps it. Nintendo actually made a lot of merch for Mario Bros. 2, I remeber a kid in my school wearing a Super Mario Bros. 2 t-shirt, with Mario in the &#039;super jump&#039; position. You know, when you crouch long enough and the character starts glowing. Also, the first DiC Mario Cartoon (Super Mario Bros. Super Show) was basically a combination of Mario 1 and Mario 2: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkW<wbr>YP95WbbY<br><br>The first Mario game was already kinda dream-like and weird. So the weirdness of this game went by barely noticed. But for me, I thought Mario 2 was an improvement over Mario 1 in so many ways. Better looking graphics, bigger maps, you could move in all directions, the pick up and throw mechanic was neat, I liked the 4 character option. Going from Mario 2 to 3 was a bit jarring, as Mario 3 is the actual evolution of Mario 1 and 2 (JP), and Mario 3 did incorporate some of the grab and throw mechanics, but was also a step back for me as a kid. Like why did it go back to just Mario and no 4 character option? Mario couldn&#039;t pick up and throw anything like he could in Mario 2. i think by the time Mario World came out, I remember reading about Mario 2 being Doki Doki Panic in Japan.

The game looked good for a NES game in 1988, sprites looked more cartoony. I think the game being a bit easier made it preferred over Mario 1.

Meanwhile, SFC had about 16 mln by 1995, and PCE had ~8 mln (of which 6 were PCE and 1.9 mln of Turbo Duo, also add 0.9 mln of CD-ROM2).<br>Basically, that means that MD was at most just 15% of the market, and SFC was like 60%, rest was PCE. So it was like the situation with Saturn vs PSX and N64 in the West. Few big companies wanted to make original games for it, because there was no reason to.<br>Small install base, tiny game sales in the order of ~200k for big hits (see <a href=\"/vr/thread/9495731#p9495731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495731</a> ). All this meant it was unfeasible to make an RPG for MD alone, unless we&#039;re talking ports.<br>2. The console was just the worst fit for RPGs out of the 3. SFC was the obvious most popular choice (biggest brand, Square &amp; Enix, fitting hardware). PCE came out earlier, already had a more popular CD add-on, meaning that it would attract most of the RPG devs that weren&#039;t satisfied with Nintendo for some reason, and/or wanted the benefits of the CD. <br>MD was made for fast-paced arcades. It had no real advantage over competition when it came to RPGs. Also, no one mentioned this yet, but there&#039;s this weird thing that few games on MD had saves to begin with. <br>Maybe that&#039;s why most 3rd party devs like Treasure were making fast arcade action games for the platform.<br>^With all that said, RPGs still dominated the sales of MD games (see <a href=\"/vr/thread/9495731#p9495731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495731</a><br>and <a href=\"/vr/thread/9495731#p9495735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495735</a> ), which is kind of ironic.

This is an interesting thread to see how history gets confusing and subjective in such a short time. <br>But anyway, here&#039;s my anecdotal account that will be objectively wrong:<br> I&#039;m pushing 40 so I was a kid and just didn&#039;t know or care about Sega or even SNES RPGs. Despite the satanic panic stuff, I managed to get Pen &amp; Paper RPGs. And I was aware of King&#039;s Quest and Ultima and later Legends of Valour and so on. <br><br>Point is I thought RPG games were tabletop or PC and whatever was on consoles was not interesting or worth the weirdly higher price vs some other games. I never used my precious rental option on an RPG. I don&#039;t remember any glossy magazine feature selling me on them. I was a Sega kid, but I watched a friend play Chrono Trigger and Earthbound (yes he&#039;s a rich pretentious prick) on the SNES and my takeaway was... <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK? When do you get to make creative or interesting decisions in action or dialogue? </span><br><br>So word of mouth didn&#039;t work on me. Eventually after the Genesis was basically dead we got a decent PC and I played stuff like Daggerfall, and Fallout. <br>So I was convinced console RPGs were baby games in their own weird category I wouldn&#039;t like. Until, I got a Dreamcast and Played Skies of Arcadia. Anyway I&#039;m sure I&#039;m a poor pleb with shit taste but the point of my blog is I don&#039;t think Sega focused their marketing energy hard enough on explaining the genre or value to kids.

I remember being a kid and playing Saphire version and enjoying the gameplay well enough but just thinking &quot;oh, so that&#039;s it....we&#039;re in a new region and there&#039;s a new narrative with new creatures, that really doesn&#039;t elaborate on or build off the last and creates its own new semi self contained story/mythology&quot; and it was then I knew that&#039;s how Pokemon was going to work as a franchise, and it worked for them, keeping things fairly new each time is part of why it&#039;s so successful and easily adopted by each new era of kids, but it still disappointed a lot of us.

Would have been sweet to see it introduced with R/S/E instead. Was probably the most logical change to ever come to this franchise but by the time it showed up I was already done with Pokemon so I never played past the third gen of games. It was also nice to see those secret bases be a thing even if there was only a few limited locations for it. Was nice you could link up with friends, even have your friends character persist in your world. The fashion shows were also a fun divergence from the main game. Something this series desperately needed instead of just constant battling. Also made lesser mons and attacks not always completely worthless. Just too bad it was never expanded on really to my knowledge. Pokemon should have went out its way to vastly expand on concepts outside the catching and battling but I guess that leaves no room for milking so of course it wasn&#039;t happening.<br><br>Now as for the GB/GBC era, I actually prefer this era.

It wasn\u2019t an exorcism at all! It was simply a baptism! It was Judgment Day in that church, and I was the Angel of Death! The truth had been delivered indeed. But not by God, but by Calypso. He was right. I was, as they say, insane. My whole life, I\u2019ve been trying to silence that voice! I even performed rituals to show my loyalty to God in hopes that he would save me!

The scope, atmosphere, vehicles, and the fact that you could see for miles within the game was very new. Before Halo you had... Shadows of the Empire, where you could use a jetpack intermittently or ride a motorbike during a level or two, but in Halo you could turn a level into a ghostbike/plane/sniper/sword level. So it combined genres like racing, shooting, and close-quarter platforming. Halo had a verticality that was stunning and it felt more like a strategy game where timing, coordination and close perception of the AI&#039;s movements all became decisive elements. One player would notice the AI doing one thing and the other player would see it doing something else and gradually its defensive wall would be pared back. Unlike the AI in &#039;Doom&#039; or &#039;Shadows...&#039;, the AI in Halo seemed particularly animated, ingenious and funny. The atmospheric effects and textures brought everything much closer, the level design was repetitious but convincingly exotic. Also the sense of collaboration between immediate and later online friends was new. Booting up worms on the dc in 2001 was nothing like the hype surrounding halo 2 by Christmas 2004.

Of course there were more sequels and spinoffs. It got a remaster and so did Halo 2. Also Halo set the standard for FPS games on consoles there were countless games made that tried to take Halo&#039;s throne and failed.

I don&#039;t think any emulator will work with .mp3 so get the wav version. You will need a core to emulate the TurboGrafx-16, also known as the PC Engine. Download any of the NEC - PC Engine cores (Beetle PCE, Beetle PCE FAST, or Beetle SuperGrafx, any of them should work) through retroarch. You then load the content by choosing the Akumajou Dracula X - Chi no Rondo (J).cue file and picking whichever core you chose. Chances are if you follow these directions as I&#039;ve written them, retroarch will immediately crash right after you choose the core to run the cue file with. This is because those emulators don&#039;t work without a BIOS. Use google and find a bios pack. Searching &quot;retroarch complete bios pack&quot; should get you something. You want the loose files directly in the &quot;system&quot; directory of your retroarch install. Should be some 256KB files names syscard**.pce, one called gecard.pce and another called gexpress.pce. You can get a BIOS pack at https://github.com/Abdess/retroarch<wbr>_system/releases/download/v20220308<wbr>/libretro_31-01-22.zip (which I found from https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/<wbr>index.php/Emulator_files) but bear in mind the BIOS files are neatly organized by category, which of course doesn&#039;t work because why would anything work in a way that&#039;s neat and organized? I have some other pack that extracts to a nice flat mess just how retroarch likes it. Anyway, just copy everything in the NEC - PC Engine - TurboGrafx 16 - SuperGrafx folder and paste it into the &quot;[Folder where retroarch.exe is]/system&quot; folder and you should be good to go.

It&#039;s been known since forever ago that Woolsey didn&#039;t deliver the most faithful translation, not to mention all the censorship, which is why we got that old Sky Render fan translation over twenty years ago (that we now know to be amateurish as fuck). Then the GBA game came out, and its translation was recognized to be much more accurate, but it had two problems: first, by that point, Woolsey&#039;s script had obtained meme status, and while the GBA script kept some of his lines, it changed or tossed enough of them out to piss a vocal part of the fanbase off. Second, the GBA version had problems of its own, namely shit music, slowdown and lower resolution, among others. So now you have a bunch of Woolsey fanboys who like the idea of a more accurate script while still staying true to the Woolsey &quot;flavor&quot;, all on the mostly superior SNES version, and before long, we got the Ted Woolsey Uncensored hack. Problem is, its creator didn&#039;t know a lick of moon, so all he did was mix and match bits and pieces of the Woolsey, GBA and Sky Render scripts as he pleased, and to top it off, he decided to also make it an overarching &quot;game improvement&quot; hack that fixed a gorillion longstanding bugs and added QoL changes. This effectively set the mold for all like-minded hacks that followed, all of which were made by people with no nip-speaking credentials, and all of which were convinced they could do it better than the last, especially given they&#039;re not constrained to just script changes, but outright game changes as well, so every new release is just feature creep.

According to a youtube reviewer who covers late 90s/early 2000s electronics, there were several neat easter eggs built into their design\u2014not only were there the obligatory cashgrab interconnectivity gimmicks where you could connect devices to have one girl visit another\u2019s house or go into a car/mall/whatever, but even just with one the little light in the upstairs window turns on a few seconds after she ascends the stairs to go to bed.

Going from being the King&#039;s Field and AC devs to then hitting there stride with the Souls formula and getting themselves out of that perception of being a lower tier company. I guess filling in that mecha niche helped them to be carried as you put it. Just think of all those other companies that were in their shoes at one point. Most didn&#039;t make it to today. They either got bought out and completely gutted until they were a soulless in name only company or they just were outright made defunct. Lets take EA for example, you got Bioware which was actually honestly at the time of EA&#039;s acqusition a much bigger and more known company than From. People loved Bioware even prior to EA.

You&#039;re playing a stealth game, so the inability to kill guards is important to make sure you stay undetected and be more careful instead of: &quot;Oh well, I was careless and got caught, time for a sword fight!&quot; Having to get in a sword fight (or run away on difficulties that prevent killing) works, because Thief (or more accurately Thief 1) is meant to evoke tension and fear of getting caught and to stray you away from confrontation. The blackjack (note: there is no specific spot you have to hit guards with it, you can do it from any direction, even the front, provided they aren&#039;t in combat) works as a mechanic, because the choice to use it or not use it changes the way the game it played, if you knock guards out you get the burden of hiding their bodies, so other AI don&#039;t see them. And if you choose to not use the blackjack, then the only suitable playstyle is ghosting (not alerting anyone to the point where they start to search for you) which makes the game even more difficult to those who desire while also changing the way you play.<br>The beauty of Thief comes down to letting the player form a playstyle without having them pick a class or such, but from the game&#039;s mechanics, Thief gives you so much freedom of approach while only making restrictions when necessary.", "time": 1671217327, "resto": 9495480}, {"no": 9495943, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:28:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9495909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9495909</a><br>Okay I mixed up the small of the back thing with Deus Ex.

Part of it I think is the hardware and the audience; Scrolling was a challenge on computers for years and years (while NES/etc. had dedicated hardware for it) and adults were more likely to own computers (in the US at least; Europe was more slanted toward all ages of course). At least for US output, however, that meant that you were more likely to get slower, thought-provoking games, rather than faster, dexterity-challenging games.
