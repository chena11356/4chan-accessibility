My current gf is also way more laid back, way less controlling, and just a generally all around better person than my ex. <br><br><a href=\"#p9531119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9531119</a><br>When my friend had his first kid, I told him &quot;congratulations&quot;, and he responded &quot;thanks buddy... guess I&#039;ll see you in 10 years&quot;. Since his kid was born 3 years ago, I can count the number of times I&#039;ve seen him on one hand. What&#039;s really sad is that it&#039;s unlikely to get better. I wasted a total of 4 years with my ex wife, then I had to recover from the divorce, then get out dating again. Even if my gf and I got married and had a kid by this time next year (unlikely), there would still be a significant age gap (5+ years) between my kid and most of my friends&#039; kids. A lot of parents, most of my friends included, keep in touch by organizing &quot;play dates&quot; with kids of similar age, but my kids wouldn&#039;t really be able to play with the others because they would be at different development stages. So I feel increasingly shut-out of this once-close circle of friends.

Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

I wish there were a few more bullets at the start since shooting the elevated skeletons at the start feels drawn out with the shotgun. I really dislike that some of the rock/sand piles around the start have impassible lines for no reason since it can block your dodging without any telegraph. This is especially annoying since not all of them are like this. Like the other post said already, many descended midtextures are visibly clipping through the floor with software rendering (you can fix this by varying the brightness value or flat between the surrounding sectors). The ambush before the rocket launcher is a blatant example of hitscanners without cover, the computer in the center isn&#039;t tall enough to protect you. I wish there were some consistency about which doors are intractable since inert/onesided doors look the same as normal ones. Using spectres as soon as you enter a dark room twice in the same map feels kind of lazy. Both archviles feel poorly used since the first one is trivial since he can never get behind you and the other is just a test of patience since it can never get down the lift. I didn&#039;t realize there was a lift at first since there&#039;s no indication it&#039;s intractable and it looks the same as the surrounding walls. I feel like the revenant/imp ambush by the computer switches would work a lot better if the wall above you were shorter so the enemies could shoot down at you when they get caught against the wall. I have no idea what the switch before the blue key lift is for since it seems like you can and should safely ignore it. The lost souls in the end room feel completely pointless since you can just kill them before you hit the switch, I&#039;d honestly just remove them since the fight&#039;s hard enough anyway. You can also softlock yourself if you ride the perpetual lifts in that room up and jump over the wall.

The visuals in the map are unpolished, I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d use a high quality texture pack like Otex if you aren&#039;t even going to align your textures (not just aligning your similar textures to each other but also aligning seams of the textures with the edges of geometry. Otex was designed from the ground up for this, I&#039;m not sure why so many people don&#039;t bother). Using a combination of stock and Otex also tends to look incongruous, you can sometimes get away with it but it shouldn&#039;t really be necessary given the latter&#039;s comprehensiveness.<br>This probably comes off as a scathing review but I&#039;d like to stress that none of these things ruin the map, and I liked many of the ideas present even if the execution was flawed.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

So help me out here.<br><br>Do you people push CRTs because you think they are superior to LCDs, and refuse to change? <br><br>Or<br><br>Do you people push CRTs because you have old equipment that simply isn&#039;t compatible with new LCDs TVs (like an old NES or SNES) without an adapter?<br><br>I work for a fairly busy independently owned arcade/family fun bar and we have a mix of CRT arcade games and newer LCD arcade games.<br><br>We do repairs on the older arcade CRT games, but parts are getting harder to acquire. I would like to preserve the original design of these machines as they were made from the arcade factory. I want people to experience what it was like when these machines came out in the 80s and 90s.<br><br>However....for some broken machines we can&#039;t find the original arcade monitors anymore. Or some of the machines just can&#039;t quite stand up to the heavy usage they once did back in the 90s and constantly go down for maintenance. Usually the issues revolve around the CRT monitors. <br><br>We are thinking about adapting old CRT TVs as replacement arcade monitors. But based on what we&#039;re reading some people expressed that this isn&#039;t the way to go. That it&#039;s a janky way of doing it, and not reliable. <br><br>A new debate has started between the the arcade techs, owners, etc. Basically if we are going to all this trouble of Trying to adapt CRT TVs for arcade use, then maybe we should just use replacement LCD panels instead and maybe find a way to use a scanline filter to try to get close to the CRT look.<br><br>The argument is that &quot;Its better to have people play these games even with an LCD compared to constantly having games go down due to CRT issues. Thar LCDs would solve 90% of the problems.&quot;<br><br>Others have said it&#039;s better to preserve the original condition from the factory or try to. Use CRTs.<br><br>I can see both arguments.

If you truly can&#039;t find parts in your country, then do what you need to do. That&#039;s all that matters. I&#039;ve traveled around the world and played on old arcade machines in small remote villages. One place in Brazil had a building with a bunch of older machines. All of them were using LCDs because that&#039;s the only thing the villagers could get to repair their arcade games. That means DDR and Neo Geo with LCD screens. And you know what? People enjoyed it. <br><br>I&#039;m in this thread because I enjoy looking at CRT photos and talking CRT tech. I&#039;m definitely flexible. But not everyone here is. Many are elitists who think this is still the 1990s and nothing else but CRTs will do. Don&#039;t seek advice from them or listen to negative words. Do what you need to do to keep your machines and arcade alive. Being able to play the games comes first. What type of screen you use is secondary. Keep your arcade alive. <br><br><br><a href=\"#p9544480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9544480</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Without a CRT you might as well just throw the whole cabinet in a wood chipper.

But I would never hold it against a professional business if they couldn&#039;t maintain CRTs anymore in 2023. This isn&#039;t the 1990s anymore. This shit is getting hard to find....even in America. And no I don&#039;t mean an old TV you found at garage sale. Arcade quality monitors are a different beast. <br><br>Anon said he doesn&#039;t even live in America. Which makes it MUCH harder to find arcade parts and probably super expensive to ship any parts he does find. These arcade machines are antiques. You are taking care of antiques.

The people who were producing basically any kind of visuals that are now considered the peak of &quot;soulful&quot; and &quot;retro&quot; graphics, were just extremely talented and disciplined people working within the limitations of older software/hardware. Retro fags like us who recognize the aesthetic appeal of that time are appreciating all these things in a completely different context. So when modern indie devs go for that look, they can usually recreate the technical limitations and specifics, but lack the top-of-the-line skill and the time-specific mindsets of those eras. An overblown example for comparison would be a modern archeologist trying to recreate ancient egyptian sculpture. He could get the tech down through research, but there&#039;s no way to recreate the mindset and education of those ancient artists. <br><br><a href=\"#p9537435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9537435</a><br>The hell are you talking about? Sounds like you&#039;re confusing NURBS with a combination of subdivision modeling and path tracing. NURBS are mostly used for static models in industrial/design settings. All of the 90&#039;s/80&#039;s CGI videos (such as those posted by the OP) were done with graphics that used normal polygon meshes (usually subdivided), textured and prerendered with pathtracing. You cannot rig and animate an organic, strechable object like a horse or a humanoid with NURBS. You also cannot texture it with much freedom.", "time": 1672667941, "resto": 9537414}, {"no": 9537509, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)08:59:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I think we eventually will but it won&#039;t come from any big industry, probably will spring from a savant or team of savants that have to develop their own engine etc. To make it work.

Made by Japanese devs it was released in the US in 91. Then, it was finally released in Japan in 92, 14 months later.<br> What&#039;s even more interesting is that the internal dates in the game are 90 (US) and 91 (JPN), suggesting a long or troubled release schedule.<br><br>The Japanese version has an added intro as well as some balance and palette changes.<br><br>Despite this some people argue that the Japanese version was made first and that content was &quot;removed&quot; in the US version, &quot;removed&quot; in a version that came out more than a year before. The &quot;proof&quot; of this being an unused tileset in the JPN version showing &quot;1990&quot;, despite the &quot;1991&quot; tiles also existing and being used.<br><br>The idea that this intro was &quot;removed&quot; seems really silly, especially considering it wasn&#039;t just dummied out (as if they failed to bother to translate it), entire graphics are missing (as if they weren&#039;t even made yet). <br>However, there are indeed other clues supporting the theory, for instance the JPN version has some extra cheat passwords, which while they don&#039;t exist in the US version, their effect are still in the code, dummied out.<br><br>I have come to the conclusion that we will never really know and that this entire way of thinking may be biaised to begin with. When a game has several versions, people often make a lot of assumptions on &quot;which was version was made first&quot; with little to base themselves on (for instance it used to be very common to have PAL versions released last, yet being based on an earlier build, due to the time window from Gold to Release being longer). I also found that in many cases, games weren&#039;t developped in a linear way like this kind of assumption thinks, but instead several versions/branches of the same game could be dev&#039;d at the same time.<br><br>RetroBit released a third version of the game in 2019 which is an English translation of the JPN version.", "filename": "Metal Storm (2019) MMC3_000", "ext": ".png", "w": 256, "h": 240, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1672908100673381, "time": 1672908100, "md5": "7Zvu+E2z1qPieMbLQTeXAg==", "fsize": 8071, "resto": 9544286}, {"no": 9544773, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)04:04:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9544286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9544286</a><br>The gravity switching here feels so good, a masterfully executed game.

The reason is because there&#039;s a series of spike floors and ceilings that you have to carefully navigate through. In PlayStation version, this section is easier to navigate since the visibility is perfectly clear. In Saturn version, because the long spikes are affected by the new water effect, it&#039;s inadvertently harder to determine the spike tips and platform edges, making it easier to instantly lose a life. I can attest to game-overing here on Saturn while it was a breeze on PlayStation. There are more spikes in an optional area in the second half of the level, but they&#039;re shorter, the tunnel is a lot less narrow, and there&#039;s much less going on visually, so it shouldn&#039;t be a problem there.

Due to how the exp/lvl system works it is way too easy to gain a couple of levels and find yourself untouchable just because you walked a few steps into the other direction.

Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed.

It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere.

I remember playing Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six as a kid, it was my first ever experience with a video game based on my favorite super hero, and it was quite good, nothing superb, but it doesn&#039;t deserve the poor reception it usually gets, it plays fine enough and has some good level design.<br><br>What I really remember from my childhood however, is the PS1 duology of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro. I couldn&#039;t believe how accurate these were, you really felt like you were Spider-Man, and the jump to 3D helped with that quite a lot. I recall growing up and hoping that there&#039;d be a 3rd installment, but there wasn&#039;t, the Sam Raimi films came out and, while I loved those, and both Spider-Man (PS2) and Spider-Man 2 (PSP) played like the PS1 duology, it wasn&#039;t set in the same universe... lately I discovered something though, the PS1 original was ported to GBC, which got a sequel... and a 3rd installment, Mysterio&#039;s Menace.<br><br>When I finally looked at Mysterio&#039;s Menace it really took me by surprise, the graphics, UI, power ups... everything seemed like the PS1 duology, and that&#039;s because, from what I&#039;ve read, this is a sequel to that, and not the GBC timeline, regardless if that&#039;s the case or not, it sure feels like it. I&#039;ve just finished a playthrough on Easy and, while nowhere near the experience I got from the PS1 duology, it feels quite good, and it&#039;s worthy of the classics I grew up with, the 3rd installment I always wanted.

Anyway, I did just finish a playthrough on Normal difficulty, so Super Hero is all that remains, besides doing it 100% of course, though I won&#039;t be too harsh on myself if I don&#039;t pull it off, there are a few Spider-Man video games where I wanted 100% completion and gave up, like Spider-Man on PS1 due to the Quick-Change suit being impossible to get, and 8bit Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin for having 1 life.<br><br>I still have a smile on my face, as this feels like the 3rd installment to the PS1 duology that I&#039;ve wanted through out my entire childhood, the graphics and UI are clearly based on it, it can&#039;t be a coincidence. Vicarious Visions did a good job here, just like they did in Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro, though neither is as good as Neversoft&#039;s original, and from the trilogy I&#039;d say this is the worst one... I think Spider-Man can work well in 2D, but this feels like the 3D PS1 duology, just with a dimension less, so it&#039;s simply lesser by default, still good, but not as good. I do feel that this is a worthy ending to the series I loved on the PS1 though.<br><br>Of course there are things that bother me, Spider-Man really needed more invincibility frames after getting hit, and enemies can have life bars that are too large at times, or just have a very cheap placement overall, especially on the edge of platforms you have to jump on... either way, level design is still good and varied for the most part, interesting to navigate in and explore, I also love the controls, it doesn&#039;t feel as good as 16bit Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin to me, but it does feel good overall, and it&#039;s a good translation of the PS1 control scheme.

All of the home ports of Virtua Fighter 1 are locked down to 30fps. The 32x game retains 30fps for the majority of the game, but has some slowdown during the win/ lose cutscenes.

Each character looks appropriate to their fighting styles. Shenmue was originally conceived to be a Virtua Fighter RPG for Akira.

If we go for the latter, the main difference between them is difficulty, if you want something smooth, go for Sacred Cards, if you want to tear your hair out, go for Reshef of Destruction, either way both of them have an open map you can explore, kind of like Pok\u00e9mon, but on a smaller scale. Now, for the installments that follow the rules, if you want an open map like in the installments I&#039;ve mentioned, go for WC2005:7 Trials of Glory, but if you want a bunch of duels one after another without much in between, go for EDS, WC2004 or WC2006, SDD has an attempt at making the Battle City story, and GX Duel Academy is more open, but navigation is through menus.

Wily betrays Right due to greed and tries to take over the world with robots built on stolen tech from Right. Right sends Blues to stop him, but Blues being his first ever warrior creation, a prototype, has a fatal flaw and will blow the fuck up if he overexcerts himself, so he can&#039;t do it alone. Right then modifies Rock to Rockman (Megaman) to fight evil and Rockman beats his robots and sends his ass to jail, being a perfectly balanced version of Blues.<br><br>3. Wily escapes and tries again, but Rockman jails him again, and this happens again and again... but with each cycle Wily builds scarier robots and starts dabbling with ever more dangerous ideas and technologies.

When Shoichiro Irimajiri took over as CEO of Sega of America after Kalinske he quickly realized how mismananged the US branch was and how much the financials were being misrepresented.

Even SML1 was better than all of those I swear. I also believe that S3&amp;K should be pitched against Yoshi&#039;s Island, not SMW and in this case, maybe they are equal.

Here is how it came about:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Atari sued Activision they laid claim to certain \u2018proprietary\u2019 techniques. One technique for which they claimed ownership was first used by Bob Whitehead in the display code of the Atari Chess cartridge. This method moved the display objects back and forth every scan line to allow the game to display more objects. On the chess pieces, for example, Bob showed the odd pixel row of the odd numbered columns of pieces and the even pixel row of the even numbered columns. We called this the Venetian Blind technique since it made the pieces look like they were being viewed through a venetian blind.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One day in the lab at Activision while the lawsuit was in full swing, Bob and I collaborated on a practical joke. We made a display showing an architecturally accurate window with a view of a grassy hill at sunset. We covered it with a venetian blind effect that animated up and down (complete with the stacking up of the slats as they were gathered up by the blind mechanism). We took it to CES and showed it to a few people who were privy to the lawsuit, asking \u2018Is this what Atari means by the Venetian Blind Technique?\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The joke was on us in one respect, when we realized that we had made public our latest innovation (the background sunset) when we showed it to our competitors. (Several games in the lab were using this new idea, but they had not yet been published.) As it turned out, nobody picked up on our slip and nobody beat us to market with the sunset.\u201d ~ David Crane</span>", "time": 1672589122, "resto": 9523001}, {"no": 9536297, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)19:53:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523274</a><br><br>This guy is the most stupid-looking Pok\u00e9mon character I have seen so far.", "time": 1672620828, "resto": 9523001}, {"no": 9537420, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)07:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9523389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9523389</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As you can probably tell, we&#039;re very excited</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an unparalleled achievement in storytelling, presentation and game design</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s one of those rare &quot;event&quot; games that are not to be missed</span><br><br>Normally I&#039;d expect this level of gushing to be reserved for a new Zelda game.

I had a good enough time, though I found it pretty easy once you got Second Chance. Then I played KH2 which I had never played. I dropped 2. I think a little bit of the jank worked for the first game, prevented you from being too much of a god and gave you reason to use your other abilities. I&#039;ve seen people insist 2 isn&#039;t just mash X to win and your magic is good, but it felt like they streamlined melee attacks but not magic so you either mash X and do a ton of damage or you entirely break your flow to cast a couple spells that do next to nothing. It didn&#039;t help that it felt like 2 was dripfeeding you spells, too. I ended up dropping 2 because the combat just wasn&#039;t very interesting to me and the amount of cutscenes was just frustrating with how often it took control away from you. And that Roxas intro was so dull.<br><br>Overall, I think KH1 was the better game, even though it had its annoyances; I found that I probably didn&#039;t finish the game as a retarded child because I kept thinking &quot;where the fuck do I go&quot; and it&#039;d be things like climbable vines that didn&#039;t stand out well enough against a tree and things like that.", "time": 1672255749, "resto": 9524382}, {"no": 9524851, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:35:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9524836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9524836</a><br>It&#039;s because KH1 at least somewhat feels like an action RPG.

You can&#039;t let go too late or you will get hit. You literally have to treat every charge past a certain point as an attack.

It&#039;s actually really annoying because you need to hold up and no other direction to jump up, and then to jump down, you must either press down or no direction at all, and then press right into the wall at the precise time. If you mess up your inputs at all or jump without the proper direction pressed, you&#039;re basically fucked. <br><br>The other thing is that you have to be *extremely* close to the top and bottom. There&#039;s some kind of logic where it seems to like to hit you in a spot where you have an extremely small margin of error to dodge; there&#039;s many charges where you have to be within pixels of the top/bottom to avoid the second bounce.

That&#039;s a common thing light gun arcade games have that basically translates what the light gun sees into coordinates that the main board can use.
