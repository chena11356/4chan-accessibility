I just finished this mediocre test of patience, and I have some thoughts about it that are probably gonna piss the fanboys off. <br><br>Yeah I know this is a beloved game and all, but I\u2019m here to tell you that title has not been earned.<br><br>First off, I have to talk about the idea of difficulty for the sake of difficulty. This is objectively bad game design, as it doesn\u2019t allow the player to meaningfully overcome challenges in a controlled manner. The difficulty of this game spikes incredibly after the first world when all of a sudden they throw this fucking mine cart mechanic at you, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to control.<br><br>Second, there\u2019s literally no reason for any of the levels. There\u2019s nothing to be gained from any of them, no sub plots, no actual point to donkey Kong and diddy infiltrating factories or driving a mine cart down the rails of an abandoned mine. What\u2019s my motivation for the levels?<br><br>Third, bonuslevels? I don\u2019t get anything for completing them? Not like a new weapon or ability or anything? What\u2019s the point? To watch the completion percentage number go up. Okay???<br><br>Fourth, speaking of, donkey and diddy don\u2019t learn anything from their adventures. No new abilities, no character development, no extra knowledge that unlocks paths in the levels, they just stay the same the whole time. <br><br>Fifth, I can only get hit once!?!! I\u2019m a giant gorilla, the king of the jungle, and I get taken out by TOUCHING A BEAVER??? Makes no fucking sense. They could have at least included a health bar. The one hit shit is nonsensical and only exists to add artificial difficulty. <br><br>Sixth. Running and jumping in every level. I can roll too. No actual attacks though. Again, king of the jungle, I should be able to rip a man in half with my bare hands, but I\u2019m stuck doing gymnastics. <br><br>Seven, funky kong could have dropped me off at k rool right from the start. Making all of the levels pointless.

Derp.</span><br>Let me rephrase it, for anons with poor reading comprehension.<br>Any consoles released after 1st January 2000 aren&#039;t retro. Games for these consoles released after this date would still be retro.<br>Final Fantasy 9 would still be a retro game since it was developed for and released for the PS1, a console that was first released in late 1994, despite the game itself being released in mid-2000.<br>So would Digimon World 3, despite being released in 2003.<br>For PC games the cut-off would be 31st December 2004, with some exceptions. Half-Life 2 can&#039;t really be considered retro, while Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines could, since it inherits so much from 2000&#039;s Deus Ex.", "time": 1670845193, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485279, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:43:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ITT", "filename": "proxy-image", "ext": ".png", "w": 865, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670845425056418, "time": 1670845425, "md5": "YHUOB1zfGFVwmEFgLY1AXQ==", "fsize": 791422, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485289, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:51:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9484880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9484880</a><br>But the Japanese have notoriously bad taste, so this is not a good argument.", "time": 1670845874, "resto": 9483448}, {"no": 9485306, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)07:00:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9483448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483448</a>", "filename": "mpv-shot0567", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 959, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670846420040463, "time": 1670846420, "md5": "ocrkW2W0jb9vApN5Cnv3bA==", "fsize": 174444, "resto": 9483448}], "last_modified": 1670846420}, {"no": 9473140, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)06:30:11", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Immersive Sims", "com": "Anything good besides the popular ones (System Shock, Thief, Deus Ex, etc.)?", "filename": "SystenShock", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670412611469782, "time": 1670412611, "md5": "uO3NjpyRF2DS2pFkyE+VHg==", "fsize": 202662, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "immersive-sims", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 52, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 47, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 9482830, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9473140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9473140</a><br>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines", "filename": "Santa Monica Pier", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670746200556133, "time": 1670746200, "md5": "46Wolhjbla+ZbO4h++dMGw==", "fsize": 3010907, "resto": 9473140}, {"no": 9483275, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)09:27:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9473140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9473140</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;System Shock</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;popular</span><br>I fucking wish.

NEC was targeting a Christmas 88 release but the sentiment that <a href=\"#p9483082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483082</a> America needs a bigger device pushed them redesign the console, they took 7 months to design, prototype, produce and ship the new console, by the time they arrived for sale in summer of 89 the folks at Sega had already launched their Genesis system in America 2 weeks in advance and planned an aggressive ad campaign to claiming the TG16 was weak in comparison to the Genesis. Since PCe was already big in Japan and beating Sega there they pre-assumed victory and skimped on heavy marketing of the TG16 in favor of over production to meet a non-existent demand. That meant shelves full of unsold TG16&#039;s and people asking when the new Sega would be in stock... if they had the most powerful system on the market for 7 months, getting in peoples homes, spreading via word of mouth well, maybe the big rivalry of the 90&#039;s would be Nintendo vs NEC and not Sega.", "filename": "TurboGrafx16-Genesis", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 445, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1670809805769799, "time": 1670809805, "md5": "Pw7uUsVpUxi6fyfOKPQfVA==", "fsize": 67870, "resto": 9481442}, {"no": 9485202, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)05:42:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9483205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483205</a><br>Cool", "time": 1670841761, "resto": 9481442}, {"no": 9485212, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)05:48:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9481442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9481442</a><br>That weird Sony/Nintendo prototype console was being entirely designed around running FF7", "time": 1670842090, "resto": 9481442}], "last_modified": 1670842090}, {"no": 9480774, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)10:48:13", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mega Man", "com": "Be honest /vr/, did it filter you?", "filename": "MV5BZWMyYzFjYTYtNTRjYi00OGExLWE2YzgtOGRmYjAxZTU3NzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ0MzA0NTM@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670687293256473, "time": 1670687293, "md5": "L6TmKjgYDUj+NUsdPRaMhw==", "fsize": 265425, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "mega-man", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 46, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 41, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 9484391, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)20:22:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9480774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9480774</a><br>no i beat it as bass in middle school", "time": 1670808125, "resto": 9480774}, {"no": 9484626, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)22:49:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sex with Bass", "time": 1670816958, "resto": 9480774}, {"no": 9485147, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)04:39:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9481274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9481274</a><br>MM2 is unironically kusoge.
