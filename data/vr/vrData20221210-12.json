The success of these two 1996 zombie games inspired a wave of Asian zombie films, such as Bio Zombie (1998) and Versus (2000), for example.[18] The zombie revival which began in the Far East eventually went global following the worldwide success of Japanese zombie games such as Resident Evil and The House of the Dead. Their success led to a wave of Western zombie films during the 2000s, such as 28 Days Later (2002) and Shaun of the Dead (2004), for example.[18] In 2013, George Romero said it was the video games Resident Evil and House of the Dead &quot;more than anything else&quot; that popularised his zombie concept in mainstream popular culture.[19][20]<br><br>The House of the Dead has also been credited with introducing a new type of zombie distinct from Romero&#039;s classic slow zombie: the fast running zombie. After first appearing in The House of the Dead, they became popular in zombie films and video games during the 2000s, including the Resident Evil games and films, The House of the Dead film adaptation, and the films 28 Days Later (2002) and Dawn of the Dead (2004).[21]", "time": 1670599030, "resto": 9471906}, {"no": 9478426, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)10:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471906</a><br>Probably Sakura Wars in Japan", "time": 1670599161, "resto": 9471906}, {"no": 9478514, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)11:21:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9478251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9478251</a><br>Just because you&#039;re a neurotic coping redditot it does make me kek.
