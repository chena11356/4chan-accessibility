There are a number of reasons for me.<br><br>1. First off, I don\u2019t pay hundreds of dollars for anything emulatable. The only game I\u2019ve ever spent over $100 on is a PS3 game that emulates like absolute shit. I might buy Steel Battalion someday. I VERY rarely spend more than $30 even. I just have a lot of old stuff and hunt for deals, which is part of the fun for me<br><br>2. I like to browse. Buying physical games from my local shop keeps them in business so I can browse. This is actually helped by the prices of sought-after games shooting up\u2014since those are unavailable I look over the shelf for something affordable that seems interesting. It pushes me to explore the console\u2019s library more and I\u2019ve found some of my favorite games of all time this way.<br><br>3. While I don\u2019t intentionally buy games as an investment, the value of my collection is at this point far beyond what I paid for it. If I managed to sell my collection off at going rate (unlikely without years of work, I know) I could pay the down payment on a house at this point<br><br>4. If I have a big rom list I just don\u2019t play anything. Having physical games in my shelf encourages me to play through them, and browsing what I have can remind me to start or finish a game. It creates a contact point that just doesn\u2019t exist for a rom list.<br><br>5. Maybe the most schizo point, but I don\u2019t trust that piracy will remain as easy at it is now forever. Just because the internet has stayed relatively unregulated for this long doesn\u2019t mean it will be that way forever. I could write a manifesto about this but won\u2019t here and now.<br><br>6. They\u2019re neato and old hardware is cool. Fixing consoles and such taught me soldering skills that I\u2019ve used to make money as a side hustle. I like being the guy with shelves of old games. My friends think its cool I have certain rare games.

The Xbox games you can play on Series X are a subset of the ones emulated on Xbone which were a subset of the ones emulated on 360, minus the ones that have had digital distribution licensing completely expire in the meantime. Anything disk only on 360, MS published with licensed cars, otherwise in the 50% of original Xbox games they didn&#039;t care enough to let you play on 360, etc. you can permanently go fuck yourself. Games like DOAX, PGR1-2, and MechAssault 1 you will never ever be able to play on anything but an original Xbox, Chromehounds, DoA4, PGR3-4 and Otomedius Excellent will forever be stuck on 360, etc.<br><br>The Xbone versions of these games are all a separate download from the originals so the 360 downloads can be (and are) delisted separately. Many games are just going to be impossible to buy for the Xbox family of consoles entirely now like Daytona USA.

I\u2019m always confused when people act like 3&amp;K is the best of the genesis games. Its not a terrible game but I prefer 1, 2 or CD. Sonic 1 and 2 are great for reasons you mentioned. Linear, fast and fun almost arcade style games. Race through the level and beat the boss quickly, stopping only to get the chaos emeralds. Multiple paths but the best is always fast and gives lots of rings. Metropolis Zone in Sonic 2 feels like a preview of Sonic 3. Its long and gets old. The added content in 3 seems to just slow everything down. It felt like it was competing with something slower and more methodical like DKC of Yoshi Island rather than trying to be fast, arcadey sonic. All the different powerups and different kinds of bonus zones complicated things in the wrong way. <br><br>Of course levels like labyrinth Zone and Marble Garden Zone in Sonic 1 slow things down too. I love these levels. The difference is they are simpler in design and not as long and just don\u2019t feel as padded out. Most levels in Sonic 3 wear out their welcome by the first zone in my opinion. Those slower levels in Sonic 1 remind me of 80\u2019s platforming games. Alex Kidd, SMB, etc. The long ones in 3&amp;K feel like Metropolis Zone times 3<br><br>Sonic CD is more about exploration and collection so the levels are more open. You can breeze through levels like in previous sonic games or you can try to find the collectables. Its a different game and I would say its a great twist. Rather tham just being longer and having more cinematic showpieces like 3, theres a real purpose and you\u2019re actively looking for something.<br><br>I don\u2019t mean to be too hard on 3&amp;K. Saving makes up for my complaints and moves it from an arcade platformer and turns it into a longer experience like DKC, Super Metroid or Castlevanias. Instead of playing the whole game, the player is meant to play a level or two per sitting, keeping things fresh.

Sonic CD was great too as a one-off experimental title, but it wasn\u2019t the direction I would have taken the series. They went in one of the only directions they could have gone in by making longer levels, saving and more powerups and collectables.

Therefore, instead of a machine with a plain port on top, it has this mildly convoluted tilting carrier which you slide the cartridge into, then press down onto a springloaded catch.<br><br>This works, but it&#039;s also the kind of thing which is more delicate, it&#039;s very easy for a kid to put lateral leverage onto the connecting pins on the console and the cartridge by not being gentle enough, both when inserting and removing, and that kind of stress can add up to damage with time, leading to unreliable and inconsistent connection. It&#039;s just one of the facts with the NES, there&#039;s a reason the later 90s revision model of the NES, and the SNES and N64, were instead conventional toploaders with springloaded dustcovers, it&#039;s just cheaper and better.<br>I recall a few years back that someone had developed a retrofit kit for the NES, which replaced this whole tilting carrier setup with a rigid one where you only slide it in forward, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve been produced for a while.<br><br>If you have an NES which seems to have damaged pins, or a cartridge which does (both can be damaged), then you can usually fix the problems by very carefully tweaking the pins to get them back into shape. <br>Optionally, you can replace the entire connector pin set, and replacement sets are still available for sale online in 2023, they&#039;re not that expensive, but quality can also vary a lot, many are pretty chintzy.

You can explore towns, talk to people, shop, etc However the combat is tactical grid based. Unlike in FE or Famicom Wars, an attacked unit will not retaliate on the turn it is attacked. Gameplay is based around generals, the player has up to 4 teams each with 1 general and 5 units composed of fighters, archers, and mages (offensive or defensive). Units belonging to a general can not leave the current screen the general is on, so it is him that gives the overall movement of the team.<br>Nice graphics and musics. Difficulty a bit on the easy side. You can replay battles to grind for exp/gold and the game seems to expect you to do that at least if you want to buy an acceptable amount of gear in shops.<br>What&#039;s impressive about it is the amount of characters the game can have on the screen at once. The game uses background graphics for the characters, unless it is currently the unit in play in which case it will turn into sprites for the time being. Smart.<br>On the bad side, the game rarely goes beyond the battle-&gt;town-&gt;repeat routine. Most of the game has the same two musics on loop (battle and town), despite the musics being of quality. A waste on that side as well as with graphics, a mangaka was hired for monster designs but you only see enemy designs in small windows when you select them (there are no battle anims).<br>Also, the game insists on using the same few palettes for the majority of towns, even when it really doesn&#039;t fit. All of this makes the game very monotonous.<br><br>All in all the game feels like a wasted opportunity: published by Enix, allegedly took 3 years to dev and hired famous mangaka and composer, and all that for what?

Characters/enemies move around the screen to attack.

And if that wasn&#039;t enough, most items from chests in dungeons respawn so it is easy to farm them (MP refills or sell for money etc) <br><br>Some interesting mechanics, the main one being that you can have up to 3 parties you can switch to in combat. The first party is your main characters, hero+warrior+mage. The second party is made of &quot;Idols&quot;, godly creatures that you find along the way and which mostly just use spells and are AI controlled. The third party consists of soldiers you can hire, you must pay for them and their gear so I never bothered with them. Only the party active at the end of a battle recieves exp. Idols may be fused together to create new idols, however they&#039;ll start over from lvl1, though usually know better spells so it is worth it.<br>Also you can pawn items instead of selling them.<br><br>The game is huge and there are a lot of dungeons, some of which can get a bit mazey, but the dungeons look great and most of them have dedicated art and palettes.<br>The overworld is huge also and once you get the boat, it&#039;s like looking for a needle in a haystack, again and again...

Everything is made to make you realize they were going through their own adventures of their own while you were. This gives them weight and personality and puts everyone on the same level. How many RPGs have each character put on the same level of importance like that? Certainly not DQ3.<br>- The way towns work like hubs. You usually use the same town in between several small quests; either that or there is a good reason to come back to the town later on. This makes the world feel organic, real; vs the tired routine &quot;each area is composed of one town, one dungeon, clear that, reach next area, repeat&quot; which DQ3 started.<br>- The adventure elements, namely the treasure hunting; DQ2 probably started the &quot;you must find X number of magical key items as a goal&quot; trope for jRPGs (unless you count Zelda as an RPG), but unlike later/other use of that trope in which the key item is merely a meaningless token for denoting that you beat a dungeon; here you must go through adventure game mechanics to acquire them, acquire clues, solve puzzle, beat dungeons too sure but not only, and almost each one is acquired differently.

Graphics are good enough but nothing extraordinary, some of the enemies don&#039;t look very good; but they are very varied with lot&#039;s of different locations.<br>Some interesting mechanics: there is a party chat you can use to remember what to do next and there is a seperate bag for inventory items (which can contain up to 100 items!), two things the DQ series would only introduce later on. Money is used to buy items (but not equipment, which is only found) but it is also used to cast spells and you only earn money from fights once you get back to a town.<br>Spells are treated like inventory items, so you can assign them to whomever, with the added downside of clogging the inventories quickly.

When a character dies, he&#039;s back to 1HP once the fight is over. If the entire party dies, you&#039;re back to the last save location (in a town) but you lose neither progress nor money. So the game is very lenient and just wants you to have a good time; but you still don&#039;t want to die in combat (no reviving) and enemies remain strong, so despite being a leniant game with no grinding, combat still manages to remain engaging.<br>On the downside, only a few defensive spells work at all during boss fights, few combat items did too; so it&#039;s all just the attack command against them. Also enemies in random encounters get quickly repetitive as you fight the same 3 enemies over and over in each area; although most areas are short enough it doesn&#039;t become too much a burden. You also get a Repel spell that actually works if you&#039;re tired of it.

Besides that, why would you want to skip cutscenes in a story-driven RPG?<br>I don&#039;t mind it as a QoL improvement though, especially if it comes with a pause function. Some games just slap skip on the start button without telling you so, when it acts as pause everywhere else in the game and that&#039;s stupid and counter-intuitive. A perfect way to do this is to have the start button pause the cutscene and then offer you an option to skip or resume it, like in MGS4 or the Yakuza series, for example. That should really be a standard for all games.

I can&#039;t bear the English dub in this game, it ruins it for me. The original voices are MUCH better. Again, I wish the remaster let you change the language without resorting to mods and file-swapping (which makes it exclusive to the PC version, too).<br>In general, FF dubs had a rough start in English, but every installment starting from XII onwards had a great dub. Sure, there are a few exceptions like Vanille sounding outright retarded in XIII, but for most of the time they&#039;re pretty good, even if I prefer Japanese voices overall (save for XII, the EN dub is phenomenal and I prefer it over JP).<br>On that note, which dub is supposed to be the main one for XVI?

But there&#039;s a magic to playing the games in order of release and seeing the evolution there. Otherwise you would have to play half of a SNES game, go back to play Fire Emblem Gaiden on the NES, then go back for the other half of the SNES game to play in order of &quot;1, 2, 3&quot; for the games.<br>The inventory system might of the original Shadow Dragon might be frustrating to deal with, though. Even when the game wasn&#039;t even a year old yet there was an interview with the series creator on Famitsu and he talked about how people complained about that inventory system. So in the SNES remake he listened to the criticism and he overhauled it to be more easy to use and far less clunky.", "time": 1676261578, "resto": 9638146}, {"no": 9657349, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:36:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9656826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9656826</a><br>He was asking about Ogre Battle, not Tactics Ogre.<br><a href=\"#p9656954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9656954</a><br>Ogre Battle 64 is a separate game.", "time": 1676262980, "resto": 9638146}, {"no": 9657562, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)02:02:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9648847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9648847</a><br>Brigandine is one of my favorite games and my main comfy fallback for when I need to retreat into my nostalgia dome and ignore the world for a weekend(rare that I get that much free time to myself anymore). <br>I learned to play the Japanese only(at the time, pretty sure there is a translation patch now) Grand Edition through trial and error then muscle memory. <br>Objectively it&#039;s probably only a 7/10, (the ai is stupid and once you learn how to play correctly, the game is never really difficult), but I still love the shit out of it.

The Switch Brigandine game is fun, too, if you like the original. Not much it terms of changes, so it&#039;s just more of the same rather than changing or trying to revamp the system. I prefer the story and characters of the original probably just because of the nostalgia/familiarity but there&#039;s an obvious difference in the design with the new game having the giant anime tits that you&#039;d expect out of any modern offering.

Growing up without really using the internet I didn\u2019t even know there was a console war. I played gameboy and NES and later on N64 and Gameboy Color and then GameCube and Gameboy Advance then Wii and DS and I just never ran out of things to play. I also wasn\u2019t exactly rich so I hardly even came close to playing everything. Looking back at PS1 and 2s vast library I nor any of my friends, even my well off ones, had even half the games on those lists and knew of maybe only a couple of the larger ones like Metal Gear Solid they never got. Comparing something retroactively to its potential versus its actuality is a bit foolish. Games were expensive when you were a kid, piracy hardly golden. Hell, one of my friends wanted to borrow a game to pirate a copy for himself and he ended up destroying my disk, so I was very piracy averse after that experience for years. If you want to compare and argue about it now potential matters, but I don\u2019t think it matters when you actually talk about the reality of the situation. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had Symphony of the Night growing up, nowadays it\u2019s my second favorite Castlevania behind Rondo of Blood and only slightly beating out Castlevania 3. But I didn\u2019t play any of these games before I was an adult, what I played growing up was was Castlevania 1 and 2 on my dads NES, and I didn\u2019t play any of the ones on my N64 because. Well I never actually saw any at GameStop or at a yard sale. I played rogue squadron and army men and Mario and Zelda. My pals with their PlayStations played Spyro and Crash and a lot of shitty shovelware I don\u2019t really remember (like army men Kek)<br><br>And we all played on our game boys and gameboy advances because that\u2019s just what you did.

Plus we would skirmish and no one ever unlocked everything (except me I eventually finished everything in AW2 years after they had all moved on lmao) so some games you just had to get for yourself so you\u2019d wait for your birthday or do yard work and mow grass to get it. But seriously even my pal who\u2019s dad was a doctor who would continually buy and update his computer to play the newest games on PC, and then would give his son his hand me downs, didn\u2019t get every game. I mean they had an Xbox even? And he had a lot of games for it but not everything that would show up on a top 10 best Xbox games list. Even if they could technically have afforded them all he had neither infinite time nor infinite knowledge and my friend was playing on his gameboy as much as his fancy Alienware computer or fancy new Xbox none of us had. We\u2019d all go over to his house to play halo or some of his exclusive four player party games, because that\u2019s just what you did. You played games and shared with your friends.

All others seem to just attempt to &quot;recreate&quot; it for some reason, with varying degrees of horribly misguided obtuseness. Regarding the good ones:<br><br>PC Engine and Sega CD (developed by the same Japanese studio) have some glitches and aren&#039;t visually great, but gameplay and layouts-wise are the closest to the original. Plus, you can actually set different playing speeds -slower or faster- for regular platforming and combat independently, which is neat for both novice and expert players. The developers included a very silly mistake though: the &quot;hidden&quot; floor switches lack the visual hint that should let you spot them easily. This is not critical and will never get you killed, but it&#039;s a weird slip given how accurate everything else is.<br><br>SNES (also Japanese-developed) is one of the most popular versions, but it&#039;s HEAVILY reinvented\u2014 except for the gameplay, which is almost perfectly accurate to the original. There&#039;s now roughly twice the levels, small changes in the original layouts, doubled time limit to compensate for the new scope, and brand new hazards and boss enemies. The bad side is that the latter boss fights clash a little with the constraints natural to the gameplay, and two or so of the original levels are missing due to the system&#039;s limitations regarding active elements per screen (slowdown is common as well when anything beyond one enemy is present in the screen).

What you&#039;re left with is a powerpoint slide of dopamine shots that only serve as escapism. The element of &#039;play&#039; almost completely disappears.

Shinra&#039;s end goal was to create Neo Midgar by finding The Promised Land, a place with allegedly infinite Mako, and putting a reactor on top of it. And their goal with Jenova&#039;s corpse was to take cells from it and artificially create a human with the abilities of the Cetra. So the hybrid could speak to the Planet, point the way to The Promised Land, and Shinra could print infinite money. Which is just deranged. Imagine reading the Bible and getting to the scripture that speaks of Heaven having streets of gold. And rather than seeing that as God&#039;s promises to encourage you to get closer to God and reach a spiritual enlightenment, instead you decide to take the information you can find and make a lab baby that can possibly infiltrate heaven. So you can send your armies there to harvest the gold.<br><br>Either way it wasn&#039;t until Dr Gast found Ifalna who clarified that Jenova was not a Cetra but rather a shape shifting alien who destroyed the Cetra. And that Jenova was the enemy of the Planet. Hojo didn&#039;t give a fuck though. Even after finding Hojo and Ifalna he forged ahead with his experiments out of curiosity of what Jenova would do. And since no one updated Gast&#039;s notes from when they were still working in the Mansion, Sephiroth got the wrong idea after reading them. Believing that Jenova was a Cetra that was done dirty by humans and the world belonged to her. Just like his father though, Sephiroth didn&#039;t care and forged ahead after finding out the truth and went with his own insane Meteor plan.

Shit is like a one to many situation all of the time simply because Japanese doesn&#039;t have a lot of ways to skin a cat (especially when compared to the nightmare gobblrfuck that is English) and so you could probably take a script in Japanese, give it to 5 different translators, and get 5 different translations, depending on all manner of things.

It&#039;s like when gunpei yokoi defended using a black and white screen on the game boy. He said that if you draw two circles on top of each other on a whiteboard and say &quot;it&#039;s a snowman&quot; then people will fill the gaps in their mind of what the snowman looks like. Ask one artist to draw a detailed snowman to be &quot;the&quot; snowman in this, and someone observing it will say that it&#039;s not what they had imagined. <br><br>This is why movie adaptations of books can often seem off vs .the originals, because you read them and have an idea of what the characters look and sound like, all for it to be torn up when you see the Hollywood version where one team of (hopefully) interested people decided what every character and element would look like and would sound like and forced it upon everyone else.<br> It&#039;s also why Bill Watterson fought tooth and nail against merchandise for Calvin and Hobbes; He never wanted to get to the point of making a movie or tv show and having to decide what Hobbes&#039; voice sounded like.

I can offer some of their thoughts. <br><br>Some arcade machines kept track of how much they earned in the hidden operator test settings. Data would display on how much money/quarters that players put inside the machine on each difficulty. You could track the data. <br><br>If you made the difficulty too high, then casual players would give up and stop playing because it was too hard.<br><br>If you made it too easy, then the game wouldn&#039;t be seen as a challenge and your casual players would easily beat the on less quarters. Which means you earn less money.<br><br>The idea was to find the perfect middle ground. You could adjust default CPU difficulty on a scale from level 1 to level 10 in many games.<br><br>If your arcade was in an area with mostly casual players and children, then you kept the difficulty on moderate. You go easy on the kids to lure more quarters out of them. Give them just enough hope and they will give you more quarters. <br><br>For an arcade that had a lot of &quot;pro players&quot;, operators kept the difficulty on high because they would be more of a challenge to pro players. <br><br>For some games like Fighting games, you could even adjust the default damage level.<br><br>For example, in the Philippines the the damage level was actually kept on 50% instead of the normal 100%. Kids didn&#039;t have a lot of money, so arcade owners would lower the damage so the players that visited often would be able to &quot;feel&quot; like they got their money&#039;s worth. Matches would be extra long due to lower damage. But this kept visitors coming to arcades. This happened in many countries in Asia, South America, and the Pacific Islands where kids had less money. <br><br>In America and Europe the damage was set to 100%<br><br>This led to an interesting scenario in &quot;Marvel VS Capcom 2&quot; when they were trying to host worldwide tournaments.
