Nintendo pushed pretty hard for devs to make use out of the touch screen feature for the lower screen, and this led to quite a lot of square pegs jammed into round holes out of obligation, ergo needless and obnoxious gimmicks foisted on the player. Dawn Of Sorrow comes to mind, the stylus adds exceptionally little to the gameplay, and it actually flows a lot better if you use a romhack which removes the mandatory stylus poking.<br><br>Eventually this would be more relaxed, and thus for a lot of games, the second screen didn&#039;t serve much more of a purpose other than being something like a map screen, inventory screen, or status screen, which you could manipulate with your stylus if you for whatever reason wanted to take your hands off of the controls. <br>Those could be pretty convenient and handy in some games, but they also wouldn&#039;t have suffered if they only had one screen to work with. Some games were made with the touch screen in mind, such as some drawing games, or Trauma Center, where its application is actually pretty cool and thematically well placed, but most videogames aren&#039;t the kind where using a stylus on a screen is a critical or badly needed feature.<br><br>So, a gimmick which kind of could be cool for the right kind of games, but which was widely unnecessary. I want to liken it to if the Virtualboy could have been hooked up to a TV to play the games in regular 2D, and then only early games were made with the 3D in mind while most devs just put token efforts in for the 3D and expected you to play it on your TV.<br><br>To make this post more retro, the original DS had a slot for GBA slots, of course, so beyond the thing playing DS games, you could play all your favorite GBA games, or pick up later ones for cheaper as the market was moving away from it.

On top of the AAAs which usually was a shitty port of a console game, there was shelves of smaller never heard of games that many times were experimental. The 90s was also the time of gross-out humor and Nickelodeon&#039;s peak so many devs were going all over the place in their game design. Even many of the &quot;educational&quot; games had fun aspects to them.<br><br>DOS based games could be a mess to get working, especially later ones that used mouse, sound, cds, or even 3D acceleration. They were a lot easier to use if they had a native Windows version.<br><br>It usually sucked to get a PC port of a console game, if it even was a real attempt at a port and not a horrible re-creation it was usually a poorer experience compared to the console, just listen to the music of the PC version of Megaman X. In Windows 95 a BSOD didn&#039;t even mean you had to reboot, many of them were recoverable since it would BSOD on the slightest thing, even trying to eject a CD while it had &quot;pending locks&quot; (e.g. the software saying &quot;Wait! Don&#039;t let the user eject it!&quot;) would cause it.<br><br>The 00s was far more focus on 3D, but the early 00s was a mess of 3D hardware becoming standard in PCs and drivers being a mess with a system loaded with all sorts of expansion cards. A lot of the games were ports, and very hit-or-miss. Many other more original 3D PC games could be anywhere from great, to interesting yet repetitive or hard to control, to just plain boring with 3D utterly booming but many standards of how to design a 3D game not in place yet.", "filename": "Myst", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674022916374433, "time": 1674022916, "md5": "GSEzyeakF2PemSYED2grJw==", "fsize": 91521, "resto": 9581124}, {"no": 9581252, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)01:22:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9581241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9581241</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think back then, games were more often made for PC first, and then ported to consoles.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It should&#039;ve stayed that way.</span><br><br>Aren&#039;t consoles nowadays built with x86 or off the shelf CPUs unlike before when they were made specifically for the console and with their own architecture?", "time": 1674022920, "resto": 9581124}, {"no": 9581262, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)01:31:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9581252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9581252</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aren&#039;t consoles nowadays built with x86 or off the shelf CPUs unlike before when they were made specifically for the console and with their own architecture?</span><br><br>The original Xbox, Xbox One, Xbox Series, PS4, and PS5 are all x86 based, yes.

I know it&#039;s a matter of taste, and if you don&#039;t enjoy something I do then that&#039;s fine really, but I can&#039;t help but feel that a lot of people don&#039;t give Sonic a fair enough shot and end up missing out on experiences they might&#039;ve loved otherwise. When it comes to Sonic, the reason you run into things and get hit is because, well, you&#039;re going fast and, depending on how quick your reflexes are, you might not be able to react to things in time, it&#039;s something that varies from player to player and that&#039;s fine, but I can see why some would go through this and assume that it&#039;s all memorization...<br><br>Still, all video games require us to memorize sections we&#039;re having trouble with, and we&#039;re not supposed to be good at a video game as soon as we pick it up, it&#039;d be shallow otherwise, if you could just run and win, then no one would&#039;ve cared about Sonic, it&#039;s a franchise that rewards you for sticking around. One more thing that can help, is that Sonic&#039;s vulnerable when he&#039;s just running, but not when he&#039;s jumping... or rolling into a ball, always make sure to press down in slopes, not only do you gain speed, but you also protect yourself. Also, if you prefer something like Mario, then I can&#039;t recommend Sonic&#039;s 8bit library enough, they&#039;re a lot more Mario like than the original Genesis installments, Sonic 1 is excellent on both Game Gear and Master System, if you go for Sonic 2 then always pick the Master System version, otherwise it&#039;s too punishing, but if you go for Sonic Chaos then go for Game Gear, otherwise it&#039;s too simple. I hope you can give Sonic another fair shot, but if you prefer not to then that&#039;s your choice, but trust me, they&#039;re excellent video games.", "filename": "1656183688449", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2419, "h": 1171, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1674472582803650, "time": 1674472582, "md5": "UgJgu6Yjv2a1TYRi6mfaAg==", "fsize": 1802199, "resto": 9594740}, {"no": 9595434, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)07:28:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9594740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9594740</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog (plus 8-bit)</span><br>Love both.

The first and most primary reason is probably just the fact that Japanese people don&#039;t usually invite others over to their house. Instead if you&#039;re going to hang out with your friends then it&#039;s more likely that you go out and do so. So for gamers, that means meeting at the arcade.<br><br>Also arcades in Japan did start to die out around the same time as the west, so what they did was shift their business model from games that will be ported to home consoles in 6 months to instead focus on games that you can&#039;t experience in your home. Or in the rare case of something that can be ported to home consoles, it can only be done as an inferior experience. Some examples of this would be something like the music game MaiMai which would be impossible to play outside of an arcade. Or Taiko no Tatsujin which can be released for home consoles but will always be inferior to the arcade version which uses a real drum. Arcades in Japan focus on 4 or 5 types of games that are all known money makers. There is also a big following of highly skilled players who are hooked on this games and will hang out at the arcade for hours every day after work. They cater to these players with constant updates and features like allowing your to record yourself and directly upload it to Nico Nico (I used to do this with MaiMai when I frequented arcades often). A lot of arcades also have one of a few floors dedicated to UFO catchers. The prizes inside are shit that people actually want and they introduce new prizes all the time. The machines don&#039;t cheat either, there is an actual strategy to winning so people feel motivated to actually play them unlike the shitty claw machines in America.<br><br>As for retro arcades, I can&#039;t speak for all of them but my favorite is a place called Mikado and while they do have a fantastic collection of games they also constantly have events going on and as a result of that they have a dedicated community.", "time": 1674395047, "resto": 9592520}, {"no": 9592718, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)08:45:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592682</a><br>Trinket games are games in the corners of grocery stores and are made for kids.

All the FX2 did was support larger ROMs than the FX1, the FX1 otherwise performs the same as the FX2. Many people assumed the FX1 runs slower from trying to use Star Fox 1 as the doner cart, but the chip used in Star Fox 1 was slower variant called the Mario Chip. The ROM of Star Fox 2 is small enough to be fully addressable with the FX1. The most likely reason that Star Fox 2 was going to use a FX2 chip is that they were probably not producing the FX1 anymore, not that it needed it. Even if the FX2 cost more to make, having production of both FX1 and FX2 going on at the same time when any FX1 game would run the same on a FX2 would have cost more.<br><br>There are far less games that had a FX2 in them, and even less that had battery SRAM. About your only option outside of Tealand is Doom and Yoshi&#039;s Island, both rare and expensive.<br><br>Meanwhile the Dirt Trax FX and Stunt Race FX games can be had for $10-15 at times and there were tons of those. Yeah, it does suck to have to cannabalize older SNES games to make one of these, but there is no real way to create your own from scratch due to it being an FX game. No homebrew way to create your own FX chip. I mean, it can probably be implemented with a FPGA but I have zero clue how powerful (and thus expensive) an FPGA one would need. I tried to lookup the hardware in the FXPak but all I could find was that a prototype from 2011 used a Spartan 3 FPGA, no idea if the current carts also use that. Depending on the version they go from $18 to $120, most seem to be $18-40.<br><br>As for making it, many have made such a repro in the past. Most of them back then were made with the beta ROM that was floating around for years before the SNES Classic.

I think 1) people simply had enough of the platformer mania of the 90s, 2) games moved in the &quot;mature&quot; direction, and the defining games of the era were no longer Sonic &amp; Mario, but GTA3 and Halo.

Make no mistake: there ARE plenty of platforming challenges in the game. Fans may not consider it a &quot;platformer&quot;, and there may be more puzzles/minigames than there is actual platforming, but you still DO platform a lot in the game, and it never feels right.

It&#039;s not as compact and dense with things to find as Mario 64, nor is it filled with just as many collectibles and challenges as a normal level would have as the Spyro games do. 90% of the time spent in Grunty&#039;s Lair is just walking back and forth across empty areas that you&#039;ve already seen before. Is it just &quot;immersive&quot;? Maybe if you&#039;re a child.

Love this game. Beat it on my dad&#039;s NES last summer. Have a notebook full of passwords to prove it. Didn&#039;t use any guides, either.<br>Took about a week to finish. The main thing that gets people hung up about this game, I think, is all the similar-looking sections. Those can be confusing, but that&#039;s kinda the point. It&#039;s an adventure game, so the path of advancement isn&#039;t going to be straightforward. I enjoyed the feeling of being all alone and hopelessly lost in this scary hellish maze. Eventually, you&#039;ll notice that something&#039;s amiss about a particular location, and things will start to fall into place, and there&#039;s a great satisfaction that comes with that. My favorite part of the game was the hectic trip up the vertical shaft after defeating Mother Brain, with the countdown. So good. The first half of the song that plays during this part is dark and dramatic and oppressive, almost making you feel like you&#039;re not gonna make it\u2014but then wait! The second half of the song starts playing, and suddenly, it&#039;s triumphant and encouraging, as if the game&#039;s telling the player not to give up hope just yet. As long as you keep pushing, there&#039;s still a chance that you&#039;ll succeed\u2014and I did, and it was glorious. https://youtu.be/V2k01qmi99k<br>And of course, the revelation that Samus is a woman at the end was sadly something that I missed out on, since I took too long. That&#039;s okay, though\u2014everyone knows Samus is a girl, and the whole point of the twist is that it never mattered that she was a woman in the first place.<br>A regret I have is never having found all the power-ups. A guide would&#039;ve helped out with this, but I was committed to finishing the game without one. As a result, I never wound up finding the Screw Attack, one of Samus&#039;s more iconic weapons.

The game opens with her being refused a bus ride, that bus is bombed by terrorists and everyone is dead, the terrorists are gunned by an airplane and everyone is dead, and the girl inspects the bus and goes &quot;It can&#039;t be helped&quot;. Then she has to avoid dying by starvation, getting hugged to death by a pedophile cop, getting killed in the crossfire of other terrorists in a public park where a schizophrenic woman thinks the heroine is daughter, and then an alien locale that defies description.

They feature weaknesses that are hard to guess and hard to tell when you\u2019re doing it right versus wrong. For instance, phantoon does his special attack when you super missile him. A new player unfamiliar with his patterns will have a tough time linking that attack to a super missile hitting him and as such will probably stumble through the fight. The worst offender is draygon with the grapple zapple. If you don\u2019t use the grapple against it the fight is really really hard for a new player. Finally, Ridley is practically immune to missiles, taking 180 to die from them as opposed to 20 charge shots, making him not only wall players using regular boss strategies (use missiles and supers) but also doesn\u2019t give any indication that charge shots are doing more (other than noticing the faster color change on him). These bosses seem like an area where the game fails to communicate to the player, unlike the entire rest of the game, which is filled with thoughtful touches. <br><br>Thoughts?", "time": 1674452578, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9594943, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)00:57:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9594635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9594635</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;samefagging 47 minutes later</span><br>lol sure<br>perhaps...your opinion isn&#039;t very popular", "time": 1674453438, "resto": 9592516}, {"no": 9595360, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)06:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9592516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9592516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;underrated</span><br>what the fuck is wrong with you<br>what do you think that word means?<br><br>seriously what the fuck do you think it means<br>&quot;underrated&quot;<br>jesus christ", "time": 1674473606, "resto": 9592516}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9588713, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:07:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is THAT supposed to HURT?", "filename": "insufferable brat", "ext": ".png", "w": 920, "h": 1209, "tn_w": 190, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674259672878475, "time": 1674259672, "md5": "rd650FrPusEPGfDuZROiew==", "fsize": 576837, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-that-supposed-to-hurt", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 25, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 9588714, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:08:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "She&#039;s very flexible.", "time": 1674259703, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9588716, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:09:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588714</a><br>for you", "time": 1674259759, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9588717, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:10:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;giving a redesign thigh-highs to make it Worse</span><br>wow, nomura was giving us the signs years and years before ff7r", "time": 1674259805, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9588728, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:16:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588717</a><br>Her Remake design is pretty much a 1:1 though", "filename": "yuffremake", "ext": ".png", "w": 237, "h": 499, "tn_w": 59, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674260183177412, "time": 1674260183, "md5": "Box6fm5VgU3k/s/uzGiBaw==", "fsize": 147230, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9588769, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:48:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588728</a><br>I was thinking of remake Tifa", "time": 1674262086, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9588775, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:51:08", "name": "Chud Anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588713</a><br>Idk what version of Yuffie this is, but it looks like SHIT<br><br><a href=\"#p9588717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588717</a><br>Nomura is the biggest hack in videogames, worse than Kojima", "time": 1674262268, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9588925, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)21:07:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588775</a><br>That&#039;s her Kingdom Hearts design.", "time": 1674266832, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9589592, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)03:14:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588713</a><br>sexo<br><br><a href=\"#p9588717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588717</a><br><a href=\"#p9588775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588775</a><br>bad taste", "time": 1674288892, "resto": 9588713}, {"no": 9591294, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:22:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9588713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9588713</a><br>This is one of my favorite boss fights in any video game.<br>Every Square Enix game should have a boss fight against a protagonist of a previous game.

Talking to your dad was good the first time when you left off for your adventure, but halfway through the game it is ridiculous to hear him spout off the same bit of dialogue.

Basically every other 3D Zelda sets you free far sooner than what I&#039;m currently experiencing with TP, and while the thematics and dungeon narratives are cool, the two dungeons I&#039;ve been to don&#039;t really match up to the ones in OoT, MM, or even some of SS&#039;s. Things like the magnetic platforms in the Goron dungeon are cool but they&#039;re not really used for any truly interesting puzzles or traversal challenges.

FF1 is easy. It&#039;s a JRPG, so it&#039;s easy. Also, it&#039;s a JRPG so its biggest problems by far are those inherent in the definition of the genre. The bugs are a problem, but they&#039;re tiny in comparison to the basic flaws of the genre. Don&#039;t worry about the bugs. Play a version with them fixed or play an original version, and you&#039;ll have about the same experience. People can&#039;t shut up about them because only nerds care about old games like these and nerds can&#039;t stop their stupid brains from fixating on objectively quantifiable technical details, or from driving them to tell everybody else over and over about the special non-obvious knowledge they know so they can feel as if they&#039;ve solved the problem of others&#039; ignorance. Ignore that kind of nerd and forget about the stupid FF1 bugs. The only &quot;difficulty&quot; in these games is that they may require of you much patience.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

The GBA version might be best overall, but it feels like Square was being vindictive at times about their official PSX versions of 4&amp;5 being outshined at the time by unofficial SFC translation hacks, so they overlocalized it to the point a few key scenes almost feel like parody.

The base fan translation is showing its age, but you could try checking out Spooniest&#039;s &quot;Legend of the Crystals&quot; addendum instead.

I am here to tell you that emulation and the secondhand market are both very wrong. Please delete your unauthorized reproductions and used copies within 24 hours. The only ethical way to consume video games is to buy a rendition that is currently sold through physical or digital retailers. For FINAL FANTASY, the Pixel Remaster series is an excellent choice. It is the latest incarnation of the classic FINAL FANTASY series, remastered for modern audiences with &quot;retro&quot; sensibilities. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is currently available on PC via Steam, Android via Google Play Store, and iOS via App Store. The FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is also coming soon to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4, where they were available physically. For FINAL FANTASY III or FINAL FANTASY IV, you may alternatively or additionally purchase our 3D remakes, which are still available on digital markets. The 3D remakes offer an experience similar but alternative to the 2D originals, making them worthwhile playthroughs. Remember, by purchasing only these versions of the FINAL FANTASY series, you are supporting the company that brought you the definitive editions of these legendary video games. As much as I too have a certain fondness for these classic role-playing video games as they appeared on Game Boy Advance and Sony PlayStation Portable, Square Enix will no longer receive the desirable monetary compensation through these obsoleted platforms, so it is therefore not recommended that you seek those ancient versions of these video games. If the FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series is your first exposure to the FINAL FANTASY series, you will have no frame of reference with what came before, which in our studies can enhance consumer experience even further.

What I mean by that is enemies placed so that if you jump forward instead of walking forward, you&#039;ll fall right into them. The bridge in level 2 is the best example of this, where your walk speed is too slow to walk the whole way meaning you have to jump, but you can only jump at certain SPECIFIC times or else you jump into one of the fish men, get knocked back, and die. The first and last sections of 5&#039; are also ambush gauntlets where you just have to memorize where the fish men pop up. Wouldn&#039;t be so much of a problem if X had normal movement speed because then you wouldn&#039;t feel constantly incentivized to jump, but Richter inherited Christopher&#039;s limp for X and only for X. That alone makes it different from 1/3. <br><br>To be fair to the 1/3 comparison, 6-2 in 3&#039;s Syfa Route does play exactly like how I described (if you jump you&#039;re probably going to jump into a fish man) as does 9-4, but those both at least telegraph the location of the fish men. And of course there&#039;s Stage 10 in 1, so it&#039;s true to say that these kinds of things appear in 1/3, but either less frequently or with better conveyance of information.<br><br>To keep with enemy placement specifically, I cannot for the life of me think of any enemy placement in any Castlevania game as unfair and irritating as the second spear knight in the first clock tower room in level 7 of DX. I think you probably know what I&#039;m talking about. That same room also has bat spawns that can synch up with the elevator platforms being low, meaning that by the time you kill the bat to access the platform, it&#039;s gone back up again. All you did &quot;wrong&quot; was enter the area that triggers them to start spawning while a platform you couldn&#039;t see ahead of time happened to be in a certain position.

Nudging is not something the general public does to machines. It&#039;s someone only very specific players do. And Nudging, shifting, or moving the machine *will* cause issues over time. They loosen screws, bolts, and wear out the machine connections at joints. It&#039;s a physical movement of the machine afterall. Maybe not cause issues right away, but it will over time. <br><br>I&#039;ve even seen instances where a player nudges too hard and can cause cracks in the glass. Do these people take responsibility? Nope. They just quietly walk away and leave the arcade without saying anything. Now the arcade owner has to pay to replace the glass. And the pinball is now out of service for days or weeks depending on how quickly they replace the glass. <br><br>Nudging (or any other &quot;pro&quot; pinball techniques) causes problems over time when a single player does it. Now imagine a pinball machine in a public arcade. It gets played dozens of times a day by many different players. More if it&#039;s popular location. It wears out the machine faster. Pins are just pieces of wood and metal after all. It&#039;s gonna break eventually if you keep stressing the connection points with movement. <br><br>You might be able to get away with it with newer machines but These older pinball machines aren&#039;t made anymore and sourcing replacement parts are difficult if something serious breaks. They should be respected and treated with an extra level of care from players if it&#039;s an older machine. This isn&#039;t the 1980s or 1990s anymore. These machines are old now. <br><br><br>Personally, I&#039;d much rather focus on flipper control than worry about nudging and shifting a machine.

The game&#039;s object is generally to score as many points as possible by hitting these targets and making various shots with flippers before the ball is lost.
