Thankfully the spikes deal very little damage so failure isn&#039;t so bad.<br>(2-2): There&#039;s a long jump to pass over insta-kill spikes. Requires a jump similar to 1-1 to make, that is jumping off at the edge + delaying your double jump. Easier to make than 1-1<br>(3-2): There&#039;s an enemy here, the blue maggots, that defy the combat of the game. They charge at you and do not freeze when you hit them. Also gluttony is really hard without magic.<br>(4-1): There&#039;s a part where you have to jump over fire that deals 8hp with goblins blocking your jumps. I just try to get lucky here with spamming attacks and it usually works. Also the platforms are hard to jump on for some reason, you have to land in the middle.<br>(4-2): Random boulders knocking you into pits.
