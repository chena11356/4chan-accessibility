Dario and Milo had constant communication by comparison.<br><br>Long story short, TeamTNT made extra sure that TNT would be safe and inclusive, and in my theory, perhaps to differentiate itself from Plutonia&#039;s unrelenting difficulty which may have been frowned upon.

There are a fair few problems too but most of them are technical. I&#039;ll try to cover them in order of appearance.<br><s>There are two switches buried in the floor that can be hit preemptively since Doom doesn&#039;t perform any vertical checks when the player uses things. This means you can skip several fights just by knowing where the lines are. Here&#039;s a pacifist run abusing these triggers just to show them off. If you want to prevent the player from hitting something you&#039;ll need a solid wall in front of it even if they can&#039;t see it. You can softlock yourself with the door at the start if you run back fast enough. In general doors closing behind the player are subject to these kinds of failures unless they&#039;re really far away so it can often be a better idea to just make a ledge that&#039;s too high to climb back up if you want a locked arena. If you&#039;re careful you can pick up the rocket launcher before you trigger the nearby door and make that fight slightly easier. The sky wall on the south side of the map creates a hall of mirrors if you use a software renderer since it&#039;s just an untextured, one sided wall rather than a descended ceiling. The lift for the plasmagun doesn&#039;t really read as something to interact with, It&#039;d be more clear if you had only one switch that was more visually distinct.You can jump over the ledge protecting the secret area without shooting the switch by running off the nearby staircase, I actually thought this was the intended way to get it at first. </s>The bfg kind of trivializes the end fight. I think it&#039;d be cool to remedy this by putting a trigger in the secret area that adds more enemies to the end fight if you go there. The switch for the crusher at the end doesn&#039;t animate since the upper texture is also a switch (idk why it works like that). <br>cont.", "filename": "Garmonbozia_Pacifist", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673852186435700, "time": 1673852186, "md5": "8EZpPoDEG5KBicxjQamugA==", "fsize": 3093666, "resto": 9566227}, {"no": 9575573, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)01:58:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9575568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9575568</a><br>(Messed up the spoilers, remember not to read that.)<br><s>This isn&#039;t really a problem but I noticed you used tubes to propagate sound to teleport closets. It might be more convenient to use joined, discontinuous sectors instead (you can join sectors with shift+J in UDB). Difficulties and a new midi would obviously also be nice but I assume it&#039;s still a WIP.</s><br>For the record I played the map in gzdoom since that&#039;s what you listed as using in the readme but since you also said it was boom format I checked it out in some other ports out of curiosity.

A lot of the time there aren&#039;t really many obstacles to overcome, you just need to figure out where to go which is incredibly obvious, and Zelda and 3D Metroid are the same way.<br><br>But strangely I think any RPGs they have a hand in tend to turn out great, perhaps because they&#039;re usually at least a little unconventional. Granted these aren&#039;t usually first-party, but still, the first two Paper Mario games I remember having a cooler combat system than most other JRPGs, I really like how the stats work in Fire Emblem (speed is maybe too important, but then I like how they&#039;re not all equally important but even some of the less powerful ones it&#039;s still important to have a bit of), and even though you obviously CAN play single-player Pok\u00e9mon in a very braindead way and win, in my experience it&#039;s easier to find a way to play it that does produce tense and challenging situations than it is in most JRPGs, which I wouldn&#039;t really know how to make challenging without resorting to romhacks.<br><br>The single-combat format is unique as well, and a lot of the moves are also pretty creative in their functionality and I like that it actually tells you each move&#039;s accuracy and doesn&#039;t pull that BS where major enemies are immune to status moves.

Their early arcadey stuff like Balloon Fight and Wrecking Crew is still good though. Don&#039;t get me wrong, Sega still made some good big games like the MegaDrive/Dreamcast Sonic games or Shenmue, they are just not as good as stuff like Mario and Zelda", "time": 1673781145, "resto": 9572387}, {"no": 9573014, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)06:15:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9572972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9572972</a><br>Metroid and Zelda get constant praise and both are just crummier versions of Wonderboy 3.

The things we can measure objectively all tilt in favor of Nintendo&#039;s quality, be it Mario&#039;s snappy controls that respond near perfectly (talking about Odyssey, but obviously 64 was insane for its time where other games had tank controls--something I assume you just ignore), Mario having a lot of moves you can string together with relatively small time windows and rhythms that are literally methodologically and scientifically validated to be experienced as enjoyable by people, how well everything flows into one with just the right animations and weight to Mario. It&#039;s hard to tell how good something is when viewing it in isolation, though, so let&#039;s just look at the much lauded Jak games: You have to roll to long-jump, which is less visceral and chancier in tight spots than Mario&#039;s quick duck, while it&#039;s too easy to accidentally roll when you actually want to crouch for a high jump because the stick has to be 100% neutral, which doesn&#039;t have a good flow. It lacks Mario&#039;s rhythm and risk and reward (even the easiest platorms in Mario can be a challenge if you want to do things like backflips instead of standard jumps, but it always feels rewarding). You can constantly challenge yourself with timing triple jumps and dives to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and pits while still having to factor those into your timing if you want to go fast while also having the advantage of higher/longer jumps.

Basically, the joke of the day back in 1989 was that the Leisure Suit Larry series was finished. At the end of LSL3, he gets a job literally working for Sierra and lives in a log cabin with his wife. The end. Then there were some firings at Sierra that year of a couple notable individuals (who will not be mentioned, for fear of internet-sleuths finding me out), who were caught having a seance in the backrooms of the offices at 3:33 AM. Al Lowe, who was a practicing Methodist at the time, demanded they be fired. Shortly after, Sierra wanted a sequel to Leisure Suit Larry 3, which Al Lowe refused to do. Until a series of unfortunate misshaps occurred. According to sources, Al Low slept in one day an hour later than usual. When he tried to get ready to go to work and hurried out the door, he saw a piano had fallen on his car. The next week, on a busride back from the office, a man held the driver of the bus at knife point and almost stabbed Lowe, until a plain-clothes policeman arrested the would-be attacker. Bad shit continued to happen, and eventually Al Lowe decided he was getting someone upstairs angry for not using his talents, so began work on LSL4.<br><br>That&#039;s where the fun stuff begins. Almost immediately following the development of the coding for the game, it repeatedly had to be redone, as the code constantly got corrupted over and over again. Art assets would unknowingly disappear. Apparently late one night, Al Lowe stated he heard faint whisperings in the office and was so skeeved out he refused to work late nights anymore.

People can&#039;t shut up about them because only nerds care about old games like these and nerds can&#039;t stop their stupid brains from fixating on objectively quantifiable technical details, or from driving them to tell everybody else over and over about the special non-obvious knowledge they know so they can feel as if they&#039;ve solved the problem of others&#039; ignorance. Ignore that kind of nerd and forget about the stupid FF1 bugs. The only &quot;difficulty&quot; in these games is that they may require of you much patience. You have to trade time for progress, regardless of your skill level; that&#039;s part of the genre. You like it, or you don&#039;t, or you&#039;re somewhere in between. It&#039;s up to you. Don&#039;t worry about other factors because that&#039;s the only thing that might get in your way. And don&#039;t think new JRPGs or remakes of old ones are any different in this regard. &quot;Time for progress&quot; is just part of the genre.", "time": 1673731609, "resto": 9570560}, {"no": 9571272, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)16:27:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570560</a><br>Just play FF7, FF9 or FF10 like a normal person", "time": 1673731646, "resto": 9570560}, {"no": 9571276, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)16:28:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9571174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9571174</a><br>After Elfland, equipment just isn&#039;t really sold in stores any more.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

But Ultima Underworld really marked the beginning of the genre, and RPGs in general, transitioning into 3D. It&#039;s worth noting Underworld was heavily influenced by Dungeon Master and its UI and interface makes a lot more sense if you&#039;ve played DM or Eye of the Beholder. Thing is that once they&#039;d made a 3D dungeon it made way more sense for it to be a single character game with you swinging your sword around and jumping and swimming in real time rather than a first person view of an entire party of characters doing these things. Obviously there were a few attempts to merge the new fully-3D first person RPGs with party mechanics like Might and Magic 6-9 and Wizardry 8 but they were few and far between and in the end single character games won out for 3D RPGs in general.<br><br>Here&#039;s a quote from an interview with Doug Church, the lead programmer behind Underworld 1 and 2 , System Shock and Thief 1, about this. It&#039;s from an interview from December 1992 about Ultima Underworld 2:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Q: GB: Will the game be single person still, or will a party join you in the dungeons? If no party, why not?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doug: Still a single player game. The action/motion nature of UW makes a party very hard to deal with. Say there was a chasm of lava, and you want to jump it, so you run and jump and make it. Your companion who you make carry all the food jumps as well, but is carrying so much that their top speed is too low to make the jump, and they fall in the chasm. Lots of problems like this crop up, along with the interface issues of real time control of the first person characters. Basically, we think that restricting the game enough to make it a party game would ruin a lot of the things it does well.</span><br><br>https://web.archive.org/web/2004050<wbr>2002424/http://www.uo.com/archive/f<wbr>tp/text/intrview/lglass.txt", "filename": "ultimaunderworld", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673922282079770, "time": 1673922282, "md5": "AvjfW/z6hRGBK9sdNkGyfA==", "fsize": 413357, "resto": 9576089}, {"no": 9578489, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:14:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576089</a><br><br>Not sure what you&#039;re talking about Etrian Odyssey is fairly recent", "time": 1673943283, "resto": 9576089}, {"no": 9578620, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)05:04:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576089</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and what would be the best starter game for it from your personal experience?</span><br>Lands of Lore is babies first blobber.

My own pet theory is that it was heavily inspired by Hamlet, a PC-98 game from 1994 that got remade as Space Griffon VF-9 on PS1 and again on Dreamcast. It&#039;s a first person survival horror game where you pilot a mech. <br>The story is even very similar to RE. Your special forces group gets dispatched to the moon base Hamlet, owned by the company that employs you, after they lost contact with it.

The market is ridiculous now, and everything is overpriced to hell and back.

Truth be told, I wasn&#039;t mad at the games themselves, but I did have an actual need for capital and those one-day convention sales kept me going and hooked some fans up with games at a fair price. Nowadays there are plenty of ROM hacks to restore cut content so it works out with flash carts and a tighter collection. No judgment to anyone holding on to bigger collections.

I think games like Mania make a different mistake, being that instead of trying to evolve 2D Sonic even further and use pinball physics as a starting point, Mania just copies what already exists. Say, has anyone actually found the bosses in games like S3&amp;K fun? Most of them are either laughably easy or really tedious. On the other hand, say what you want about Dimps games, their bosses were almost always fun in one way or another. Advance 2 and 3 in particular had some amazing fights that are really fun to master. Instead of trying to learn from that to make even better bosses, Mania just outright copies a lot of the classic bosses (which were not fun) and then makes some of them even more tedious, such as the new second phase for Red Eye or the Mean Bean Machine.

Compare this with CPS2 games that have more big and unique, sometimes animates objects in their backgrounds.<br>Next, the chatacters animations. MK Trilogy sprites are very thin and don&#039;t have much unique animations. SF Alpha games are kind of simple too but Darkstalkers and Marvel vs games have more elaborate attack animations that take a large chunk of screen (and VRAM). MK Trilogy being this lightweight on animations is pretty much confirmed by the PS1 version: it easily holds 4 unique characters for 2 on 2 combat in PS1 RAM - when one character is defeated the game doesn&#039;t stop to load the second one from the disc. No Capcom game manages to have four complete and unique characters in a single fight on PS1 because they take much more memory than Mortal Kombat ones.<br>N64 has more RAM and doesn&#039;t have to deal with loading from the disk at all, so it allows SIX unique characters in 3 on 3 combat. Great, right? But here&#039;s the deal: the animation quality is worse than in PS1 version. So while there are six characters in N64 RAM, even having only two of them on screen, N64 can&#039;t animate them as fast as PS1 version. This is barely a cart size issue - adding a couple of frames to each character standing idle animation would make them look a whole lot smoother and this takes a very little space of ROM. MKT ROM has a enough of padding (aka unused space) for this. Even without using the unused space they could just remove that fancy MK logo in flames title screen and shitty looking MK1 stages and add better animation instead.

The sprites themselves are very nicely and smoothly animated but they are very small in size. And finally, the game doesn&#039;t run at 60 fps.

Another thing that this did, that the previous Spider-Man adaptations didn&#039;t, was having an actual story that develops as it goes along, instead of some text in the manual or an opening cutscene to set the plot, you have cutscenes between all levels that show Spider-Man&#039;s thought process as to where he should go next to find the keys to disarm Kingpin&#039;s bomb and it&#039;s great to see, it&#039;s immersive and captures the feeling of reading a comic book more than anything that came before it.

I came prepared: I had the cheat codes, which I copied from a video games magazine earlier at my local library, so my 1st time beating Doom was actually with cheats enabled.

Yeah, the game can be a little janky at times, but it&#039;s a 3D game from the 90s, every 3D game from that period was janky in one way or another, but many of them are fondly remembered, yet for some reason, this game is the exception. It&#039;s a shame too, because I kinda stayed away from this game for awhile because almost everyone here treats this game like it&#039;s the spawn of Satan for reason. I finally caved and tried it out for myself time and I honestly don&#039;t understand where all the hate comes from. The story is pretty decent, the music is great, I loved the hub world designs, and almost all the stages are really fun. The only negative things I can say about this game, really, is <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that the other playable characters who aren&#039;t Sonic, Tails and Knuckles feel like they over-stay their welcome a bit. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I could do without Big&#039;s portion of the game</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I love that the game doesn&#039;t really hold your hand that much and you just have to figure out what to do and where to go next on your own, but I think there were some times where I felt like a clue would be in order. Like in Amy&#039;s part of the story, for the finale, you have to go to the crash site of the Egg Carrier. The thing is, I had no idea where the site was and the only hint the game tells you is &quot;Go to crash site&quot;.

Namco is actually well known for being financially responsible. It would not surprise me if 100 or 200 were made.

You could have gotten it for cheap if you had a few thousand dollars back then. I&#039;m guessing a few places picked up a Full Scale for cheap and got a couple more years of use out of it until the machine broke down and was scrapped.

For those games, there is some extra data in there for it, so it could convert these four shades to colours. This is just like extra palette data and the palettes are predetermined from the SNES master palette, so you&#039;re just saying use palette 3 (which had four colours), rather than entirely custom palettes.<br><br>The game also included coloured sprites to fill up the rest of the screen (again using the palettes) like background decoration. These are still just regular game boy games because at the time there was no gameboy colour. When the gameboy colour did come out, it had a neat little trick where on startup, you could set the game to use one particular palette as the main palette for everything. And the gameboy colour also knew how to interpret the coloured palettes (if you left it on the default main one), so even in the original pokemon games, they switched to shades of blue or green for different areas, and switch to a palette with green for the health bars and so on.<br><br>I think the reason why Yellow&#039;s palette is different is because they weren&#039;t limited to the predefined ones in the super gameboy, so they could pick from a wider range of colours for the four different ones, and they went for more vibrant ones. One thing I never tried, but would be curious to, is if you played yellow on a super gameboy, would it &#039;fall back&#039; to the same palettes as red and blue?", "time": 1673882064, "resto": 9572509}, {"no": 9576421, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)11:06:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9576115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9576115</a><br>No they didn&#039;t?
