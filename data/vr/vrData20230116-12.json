It&#039;s a very comfy adventure where literally nothing happens until a big cliffhanger at the end. Feels like you&#039;re a tourist visiting a country, solving small incidents from time to time, but the stakes are really low overall. Some may consider it a slog but I personally like it for that very reason, it&#039;s refreshing after all those &quot;chosen one&quot; JRPGs. However, you&#039;ll have to play the sequel (SC) because of the cliffhanger at the end, so that&#039;s a time commitment. Said sequel is weird, you&#039;d expect it to start strongly but the first half is extremely slow, so be warned.<br>No grinding required, and you can&#039;t grind anyway because of how XP works (the higher your level, the less XP you&#039;ll get, and this decreases a lot, so you&#039;re encouraged to move forward with the plot). Just play normal mode, the higher difficulties are a little unbalanced and can become tedious. You don&#039;t play this game for gameplay anyway.<br>If the idea of a slow game where you&#039;re casually walking around a country doing nothing but sidequests where you have to help citizens for trivial stuff doesn&#039;t repulse you, then go ahead.

At most I could maybe $8K and the owner wouldn&#039;t come down in price.<br><br>It was 10 years old and the machine kinda worn, but it still worked. The interior needed to be redone.

Namco is actually well known for being financially responsible. It would not surprise me if 100 or 200 were made.

You could have gotten it for cheap if you had a few thousand dollars back then.

The classic Final Fantasies were always a little buggy, but typically you&#039;d have to really go out of your way to notice - the first Final Fantasy is obviously roughest since it was Nasir&#039;s first attempt. Elemental weapons don&#039;t work as they should, a good fourth or third of the spells weren&#039;t playtested, stat bugs, etc. The game got more or less fully bugfixed in the WonderSwan Color remake and its PlayStation port. Rereleases from GBA onward go further and are based on the latter&#039;s easy mode, changing up a lot of the game mechanics to make it even easier. They don&#039;t really represent the original experience too well.<br>As far as the second game goes, reception is generally the opposite. A lot of people didn&#039;t care in retrospect about the experimental gameplay, so you see more people vouching for GBA-onward rereleases of II. GBA also adds a postgame, but like almost all the rerelease-padded content, it&#039;s not very good, in this case being a remix of the final dungeons. You might want to try GBA or PR if original just doesn&#039;t click with you.<br>Beyond that, III is more enjoyable in either 2D form for myriad reasons, and nearly any version of IV is decent (except WSC/GBA, &amp; 3D TAY is horrible).

You only have to do this once. One note I should make is that this only improves performance for people with ping under 200-300 (I honestly doubt anyone has ping over this). The server is located in Texas so keep that in mind.

There are a fair few problems too but most of them are technical. I&#039;ll try to cover them in order of appearance.<br><s>There are two switches buried in the floor that can be hit preemptively since Doom doesn&#039;t perform any vertical checks when the player uses things. This means you can skip several fights just by knowing where the lines are. Here&#039;s a pacifist run abusing these triggers just to show them off. If you want to prevent the player from hitting something you&#039;ll need a solid wall in front of it even if they can&#039;t see it. You can softlock yourself with the door at the start if you run back fast enough. In general doors closing behind the player are subject to these kinds of failures unless they&#039;re really far away so it can often be a better idea to just make a ledge that&#039;s too high to climb back up if you want a locked arena. If you&#039;re careful you can pick up the rocket launcher before you trigger the nearby door and make that fight slightly easier. The sky wall on the south side of the map creates a hall of mirrors if you use a software renderer since it&#039;s just an untextured, one sided wall rather than a descended ceiling. The lift for the plasmagun doesn&#039;t really read as something to interact with, It&#039;d be more clear if you had only one switch that was more visually distinct.You can jump over the ledge protecting the secret area without shooting the switch by running off the nearby staircase, I actually thought this was the intended way to get it at first. </s>The bfg kind of trivializes the end fight. I think it&#039;d be cool to remedy this by putting a trigger in the secret area that adds more enemies to the end fight if you go there. The switch for the crusher at the end doesn&#039;t animate since the upper texture is also a switch (idk why it works like that). <br>cont.", "filename": "Garmonbozia_Pacifist", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673852186435700, "time": 1673852186, "md5": "8EZpPoDEG5KBicxjQamugA==", "fsize": 3093666, "resto": 9566227}, {"no": 9575573, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)01:58:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9575568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9575568</a><br>(Messed up the spoilers, remember not to read that.)<br><s>This isn&#039;t really a problem but I noticed you used tubes to propagate sound to teleport closets. It might be more convenient to use joined, discontinuous sectors instead (you can join sectors with shift+J in UDB). Difficulties and a new midi would obviously also be nice but I assume it&#039;s still a WIP.</s><br>For the record I played the map in gzdoom since that&#039;s what you listed as using in the readme but since you also said it was boom format I checked it out in some other ports out of curiosity.

You could also try any Final Fantasy game, they&#039;re all great. <br>Also, Gears is honestly very light in the RPG department, the combat is pretty braindead and there&#039;s not much to customize. At least the animations are pretty which helps.", "filename": "016", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1260, "h": 1803, "tn_w": 87, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673818584472691, "time": 1673818584, "md5": "AVUVcIxj6ISVAndPWia3RQ==", "fsize": 239781, "resto": 9574175}, {"no": 9574648, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:22:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9574201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9574201</a><br>Seconding this, Xenoblade started development as &quot;Chrono Trigger 2&quot; and has more team members than Chrono Trigger&#039;s actual sequel.", "filename": "Lucca3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 210, "h": 530, "tn_w": 49, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673824961354116, "time": 1673824961, "md5": "TV30qz2vBpSh1fJLPVrXyA==", "fsize": 44622, "resto": 9574175}, {"no": 9574651, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:23:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9574648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9574648</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and has more team members</span><br>*in common", "time": 1673825027, "resto": 9574175}, {"no": 9574721, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:47:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9574180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9574180</a><br>Kek", "time": 1673826460, "resto": 9574175}, {"no": 9574728, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:50:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9574175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9574175</a><br>Haha, enjoy disc 2, cockface.", "time": 1673826616, "resto": 9574175}, {"no": 9574738, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:53:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9574728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9574728</a><br>Disc 2 is better though", "time": 1673826800, "resto": 9574175}, {"no": 9574745, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)18:56:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9574738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9574738</a><br>Than your average graphic novel.

Apparently 2/3 of Genesis owners had this at some point, it was a system seller for SOA, following their strategy of acquiring popular IPs to rival what Nintendo had to offer, before Sonic came along at least. I think this was the 1st time where Peter Parker was somewhat incorporated into the mechanics, with the photographs that make you money so you can affort to make your web fluid, it adds depth in both the lore and gameplay, so it&#039;s really a quite welcome feature. Another thing that this did, that the previous Spider-Man adaptations didn&#039;t, was having an actual story that develops as it goes along, instead of some text in the manual or an opening cutscene to set the plot, you have cutscenes between all levels that show Spider-Man&#039;s thought process as to where he should go next to find the keys to disarm Kingpin&#039;s bomb and it&#039;s great to see, it&#039;s immersive and captures the feeling of reading a comic book more than anything that came before it. One more thing I love, that few Spider-Man video games did as well as this one, was the atmosphere, it feels dark, not too dark or edgy, nothing like that, but serious and grim, you feel the stakes through the music and graphics.", "filename": "spider-man-vs-kingpin-sega-genesis", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 710, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673870660444939, "time": 1673870660, "md5": "FexLbzE32pgiRcvoJGzlrQ==", "fsize": 112138, "resto": 9575513}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 9570031, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)07:25:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This thing is the ultimate fucking emulation machine for a handheld.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;use emudeck</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;change PS2 launch to Swanstation</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything just werks</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can even custom control so you can play shit like Goldeneye and Perfect Dark with dual analog + gyro controls</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;use Retroachievements for some extra fun on old games</span><br><br>Gen 4-6 are the best gens and this can play everything up to it near flawlessly.<br><br>What are you guys emulating today?", "filename": "qL5wsYpdBwfDusadE3Rp4L", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 2268, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673699141636329, "time": 1673699141, "md5": "LvqLyStw9w0bR03hUPJUfg==", "fsize": 1495838, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "this-thing-is-the-ultimate-fucking-emulation", "custom_spoiler": 2, "replies": 65, "images": 8, "unique_ips": 37}, {"no": 9570049, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)07:46:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570031</a><br>i rarely emulate<br>i do think the steamdeck is neat though<br><br>this week:<br>neogeo mvs-1b motherboards and testing some new carts i got in the mail<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;andro dunos, last resort, pulstar, ironclad, twinkle star sprites</span><br>got a saturn with fenrir up and running<br>having some issues with the ram expansion carts, the ones i got over the mail arrived thrashed and crash 4mb games. <br>on saturn i have been spamming<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pretty fighter, sailor moon, marvel/xmen/sf ports and comparing them to my 1up pcbs i poached </span><br><br>i think the saturn is underrated<br><br>i got about 70 n64 carts from japan in a fat lot purchase, so ive been having some fun dicking around testing those<br><br>ill let my 7yr old nephew take them all if hes still into it, he loved smash bros last year so time will tell...", "filename": "B0142B63-D821-4C7D-8D9E-F82D489F4BBC", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 876, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673700394309441, "time": 1673700394, "md5": "pbCGp3uNhvjjOswLqODr+w==", "fsize": 225459, "resto": 9570031}, {"no": 9570110, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:26:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570031</a><br>yeah but can it do saturn", "time": 1673702774, "resto": 9570031}, {"no": 9570126, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:34:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570110</a><br>my i910900k &amp; 3080 cant do saturn so probably not <br><br>saturn emulation is a fickle beast, some popular titles run decent - some deepcuts that have seemingly less going on graphically have issues still", "time": 1673703276, "resto": 9570031}, {"no": 9570140, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570031</a><br>what happens in 6 months or a year when the buttons get sticky and the dpad and joysticks lose accuracy? <br>handhelds are silly, just use laptop + gamepad", "time": 1673703634, "resto": 9570031}, {"no": 9570143, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:43:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570031</a><br>I bet using a Steam Deck to emulate Game Gear games is probably really exciting because it&#039;s absurdly massive and has a shit battery life just like a real Game Gear.", "time": 1673703798, "resto": 9570031}, {"no": 9570160, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:47:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570140</a><br>You can just replace any part you want retard.", "time": 1673704024, "resto": 9570031}, {"no": 9570203, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)09:06:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570110</a><br><a href=\"#p9570126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570126</a><br>I was able to play Saturn games on my Intel i3 shitty computer.

Thats means again, more zombies variety the better.<br><br>- In the &quot;mercenaries&quot; mode you can play as a traitor who looks and sounds like he is already in his early 40s(yet he is the &quot;experts&quot; option only).<br><br>- There are many oil barrels and dynamite around, so you can lure the enemies to them, shot at them, and when the enemies explode you can tell them &quot;happy new year!&quot;.<br><br>- You can explore more the city than in resident evil 2.<br><br>- You can hear a music box in a puzzle.<br><br>-You can see some rain in some rooms(in resident evil 1 and 2 there are not rain at all).<br><br>The only bad thing about resident evil 3 is that it feels too short(wich is obvious because Capcom<br>rushed in finishing it).<br><br>But still, a better game than resident evil 1 and 2.", "filename": "female zombies", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673855547126711, "time": 1673855547, "md5": "Rsay7GnYsvHZhdibPM+tIg==", "fsize": 109457, "resto": 9575624}, {"no": 9575665, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:54:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9575661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9575661</a><br>Shame that &quot;higher number, therefore better!&quot; isn&#039;t how game design works. 2 is easily the more flawless and more wholistic game", "time": 1673855679, "resto": 9575624}, {"no": 9575667, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:55:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9575624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9575624</a><br>They are all logical continuations of each other, they are different enough that it&#039;s unfair to grade them under the same standards.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1</span><br>Tough but fair adventure game.

Like it sounds like the devs wanted more characters a hardcore gamer would have recognized associated with playstation systems, but most people buying those consoles, were never doing so for Sony ips. So them you are trying to sell this crossover celebration to a audience who only buys your systems for call of duty or madden, then getting upset you aren&#039;t reaching those sales, while at the same time not giving the money or support to the devs to make something that will atleast please hardcore gamer nerd/Sony heads.

A lot of the time there aren&#039;t really many obstacles to overcome, you just need to figure out where to go which is incredibly obvious, and Zelda and 3D Metroid are the same way.<br><br>But strangely I think any RPGs they have a hand in tend to turn out great, perhaps because they&#039;re usually at least a little unconventional. Granted these aren&#039;t usually first-party, but still, the first two Paper Mario games I remember having a cooler combat system than most other JRPGs, I really like how the stats work in Fire Emblem (speed is maybe too important, but then I like how they&#039;re not all equally important but even some of the less powerful ones it&#039;s still important to have a bit of), and even though you obviously CAN play single-player Pok\u00e9mon in a very braindead way and win, in my experience it&#039;s easier to find a way to play it that does produce tense and challenging situations than it is in most JRPGs, which I wouldn&#039;t really know how to make challenging without resorting to romhacks.<br><br>The single-combat format is unique as well, and a lot of the moves are also pretty creative in their functionality and I like that it actually tells you each move&#039;s accuracy and doesn&#039;t pull that BS where major enemies are immune to status moves.

The things we can measure objectively all tilt in favor of Nintendo&#039;s quality, be it Mario&#039;s snappy controls that respond near perfectly (talking about Odyssey, but obviously 64 was insane for its time where other games had tank controls--something I assume you just ignore), Mario having a lot of moves you can string together with relatively small time windows and rhythms that are literally methodologically and scientifically validated to be experienced as enjoyable by people, how well everything flows into one with just the right animations and weight to Mario. It&#039;s hard to tell how good something is when viewing it in isolation, though, so let&#039;s just look at the much lauded Jak games: You have to roll to long-jump, which is less visceral and chancier in tight spots than Mario&#039;s quick duck, while it&#039;s too easy to accidentally roll when you actually want to crouch for a high jump because the stick has to be 100% neutral, which doesn&#039;t have a good flow. It lacks Mario&#039;s rhythm and risk and reward (even the easiest platorms in Mario can be a challenge if you want to do things like backflips instead of standard jumps, but it always feels rewarding). You can constantly challenge yourself with timing triple jumps and dives to fill the space that doesn&#039;t have enemies and pits while still having to factor those into your timing if you want to go fast while also having the advantage of higher/longer jumps. The closest to that Jak has is spamming rolls and wide jumps, which is more like the rolling in Zelda, doesn&#039;t really give you an advantage outside of going faster and doesn&#039;t require any skill or timing, besides being impossible or needlessly risky to use in tight spots due to its clunkiness", "time": 1673792353, "resto": 9572387}, {"no": 9573313, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)09:23:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9573297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9573297</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since 99% of people disagree with you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The intended means of getting that star are in the filename, you&#039;re meant to awkwardly measure a fall from a terrible perspective while an owl carries you.

And when your place of work doesn&#039;t provide you with all these nice things people would get twenty years ago, of course people would prioritize their life over their work.", "time": 1673640199, "resto": 9563186}, {"no": 9568238, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)15:19:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9568198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9568198</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;saved up money for years because tired of minimum wage jobs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;went to college to get a IT degree finally because I wasn&#039;t having much luck with &quot;I can do that and prove it if you let me&quot; on my resume</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;talk to college job resources to try to get in workforce as soon as possible</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they say &quot;hey, you need to do a internship somewhere for your degree, if you work at the tech department here you might be able to turn it into a job&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do so</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get hired on by the college shortly after graduation since the tech team liked my work</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get laid off after a few months because college board decided to cut tech team budget to save money for the football team and I was the most recent hire with the least experience</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t get a job anywhere else doing the same thing since everyone looks at that short work history and thinks &quot;Gee, they must have dropped him quickly for a reason&quot;, even though I have recommendations from the entire fucking tech team attached to my resume</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;back to working minimum wage again, only now I have to hide my degree when looking for jobs or I get filtered out for being overqualified</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tech skills now so out of date that it&#039;s almost like I never went to college in the first place, or wasted years getting a degree that means piss-all</span><br>I must disagree with your &quot;use the college&#039;s resources&quot; advice.

I came prepared: I had the cheat codes, which I copied from a video games magazine earlier at my local library, so my 1st time beating Doom was actually with cheats enabled.

Basically, the joke of the day back in 1989 was that the Leisure Suit Larry series was finished. At the end of LSL3, he gets a job literally working for Sierra and lives in a log cabin with his wife. The end. Then there were some firings at Sierra that year of a couple notable individuals (who will not be mentioned, for fear of internet-sleuths finding me out), who were caught having a seance in the backrooms of the offices at 3:33 AM. Al Lowe, who was a practicing Methodist at the time, demanded they be fired. Shortly after, Sierra wanted a sequel to Leisure Suit Larry 3, which Al Lowe refused to do. Until a series of unfortunate misshaps occurred. According to sources, Al Low slept in one day an hour later than usual. When he tried to get ready to go to work and hurried out the door, he saw a piano had fallen on his car. The next week, on a busride back from the office, a man held the driver of the bus at knife point and almost stabbed Lowe, until a plain-clothes policeman arrested the would-be attacker. Bad shit continued to happen, and eventually Al Lowe decided he was getting someone upstairs angry for not using his talents, so began work on LSL4.<br><br>That&#039;s where the fun stuff begins. Almost immediately following the development of the coding for the game, it repeatedly had to be redone, as the code constantly got corrupted over and over again. Art assets would unknowingly disappear. Apparently late one night, Al Lowe stated he heard faint whisperings in the office and was so skeeved out he refused to work late nights anymore. He also heard tell of a man in black who would arrive in the office lobby, before anyone was at the office, when the doors were locked, at 5 AM on the dot for 2 weeks straight.

Compare this with CPS2 games that have more big and unique, sometimes animates objects in their backgrounds.<br>Next, the chatacters animations. MK Trilogy sprites are very thin and don&#039;t have much unique animations. SF Alpha games are kind of simple too but Darkstalkers and Marvel vs games have more elaborate attack animations that take a large chunk of screen (and VRAM). MK Trilogy being this lightweight on animations is pretty much confirmed by the PS1 version: it easily holds 4 unique characters for 2 on 2 combat in PS1 RAM - when one character is defeated the game doesn&#039;t stop to load the second one from the disc. No Capcom game manages to have four complete and unique characters in a single fight on PS1 because they take much more memory than Mortal Kombat ones.<br>N64 has more RAM and doesn&#039;t have to deal with loading from the disk at all, so it allows SIX unique characters in 3 on 3 combat. Great, right? But here&#039;s the deal: the animation quality is worse than in PS1 version. So while there are six characters in N64 RAM, even having only two of them on screen, N64 can&#039;t animate them as fast as PS1 version. This is barely a cart size issue - adding a couple of frames to each character standing idle animation would make them look a whole lot smoother and this takes a very little space of ROM. MKT ROM has a enough of padding (aka unused space) for this. Even without using the unused space they could just remove that fancy MK logo in flames title screen and shitty looking MK1 stages and add better animation instead.

The sprites themselves are very nicely and smoothly animated but they are very small in size. And finally, the game doesn&#039;t run at 60 fps.

Cable, as we know it today, didn&#039;t really exist until the 80s. So suddenly there were LOADS of new channels that all needed content. The majority got a foothold by mostly using whatever old shows they could get access to. <br><br>The second was something called syndication. The short version of that is that local affiliates have some degree of control over what they air. That&#039;s why your local CBS channel is a bit different than CBS when you go out of state. Syndicated TV shows were shows that any local channel who felt like paying a small license fee could air. Older shows were cheaper, so they&#039;d often be used to fill in dead air time.<br><br>The reason that both have become far less common really just boils down to the pool of available media being MUCH larger.

The rocket launcher is great for bulky enemies and the best for huge waves. The Plasma gun is your strongest weapon and is a good all arounder but also scarce. The BFG is your reward for a secret or hard challenge and is the defacto trump gun. Each enemy and level is designed around these inherent weakness and strengths, its why pistol starting is fun. Blood doesn&#039;t have this design and most weapons are decent all arounders, the enemies and levels aren&#039;t designed around this either. There are few enemies that require you to utilize specific quirks of weapons like the afterburn and most will go down to anything. The levels give you every type of weapon without much thought, like a playground of stuff to mess around with which maybe is fun for a bit but is a weaker experience to DOOM&#039;s and Quake&#039;s design where the player is not given all the tools at once and needs to be crafty.", "time": 1673714668, "resto": 9570521}, {"no": 9570595, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)11:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9570521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9570521</a><br>blood is cringe lord bullshit.
