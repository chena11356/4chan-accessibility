Basically the analog stick started dropping inputs, so for example if you were running forward as Link in OoT he would stop and start - essentially unusable. Both had the exact same problem. <br>Unfortunately they both had fallen just outside the warranty window, and their support didn&#039;t even reply when I sent them like a &quot;Hey, anything I can try to do to fix these?&quot; <br>About a year later someone on twitter was asking about them, and I outlined that whole chain of events to them and said that I don&#039;t recommend them at all. From that tweet, their PR/customer support team reached out to me and ultimately actually shipped me two of the newer wireless versions by way of apology. And the wireless one has held up a lot better than the originals. At least, so far. <br>So maybe the takeaway is, they used to be utter crap, and now are (hopefully) a lot better. The analog stick on all of these these is just kind of weird though. <br><br>In the interim I used the wired Retro-Bit Tribute64 (which is modeled after the famous Hori N64 controller) and I actually liked this a lot better than any of the Brawler64s. The only problem with these is that the connector has an absolute death grip on the controller port, which is why I switched back to the wireless Brawler64 for right now - since I didn&#039;t want to be unplugging and replugging that controller all the time, and wireless controllers just keep things a bit more tidy. You know how it is. <br><br>There is an N64 controller purist on this board who will tell you that the analog stick sensitivity and deadzones of any of these 3rd party controllers is crap compared to the original - he&#039;s got charts and whatnot to back it up. He&#039;s probably right, but it&#039;s never really bothered me and or caused any real problems.<br><br>Of these I&#039;d recommend the Tribute64 first.", "time": 1670950508, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488501, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:34:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>i would FUCK lenore<br><a href=\"#p9487536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487536</a><br>yes", "time": 1670952875, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488537, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487523</a><br>What the fuck is that worm-like thing on top of the TV?", "time": 1670954061, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488540, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_2933", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3120, "h": 2080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1670954081568968, "time": 1670954081, "md5": "MQ5LotAcZ3SlN+b/piGZ6Q==", "fsize": 965843, "resto": 9486945}, {"no": 9488542, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488456</a><br>Thats a bit annoying i hate wireless stuff but if those are better maybe they made changes in the wired also?

Many weapons in HL2 feel off and sloppy (the pistol that goes &quot;paff paff paff&quot;, the smg that just spits out bullets in a weird spray without any real recoil in between bullets but just a random cone of dispersion, etc). The characters and story feel forced, HL did not have a linear story you had to follow, the story was just a backdrop to the action.

By the time thedid rapidly expand, it was younger people making the stories, who had a different perception of WWII and Japan as a whole. since the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s Japan has just very heavily leaned into using young people in media. <br><br>On the contrast to what the west was doing. The growth of hollywood never stopped during the war, only shifted. And the stream of stories was always on the middle aged. It wasn&#039;t till the 50&#039;s that the west also started incorporating young people into their stories. <br><br>I think FFX suffers from some slight issues, as far as intent and facts though. Auron is supposed to old at age 35 and even refers to himself as young 10 years ago, when he was 25. Yet we have a maester who has served for some 70 years. I think what happens is characters get designed and created and then put into a story and not organically written. So it&#039;s part of the overall media franchise machine.", "time": 1670852896, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485524, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:21:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9469583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9469583</a><br>I have caused multiple hookups to lactate by sucking on their tits long enough", "time": 1670854905, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485536, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)09:36:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9483121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483121</a><br>IIRC, doesn&#039;t Kimahri just carry her during that sequence?", "time": 1670855801, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485890, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)12:23:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9469583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9469583</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><s>You realize milk only comes after childbirth right</s><br>You do realise that men can also lactate without having given birth?", "time": 1670865797, "resto": 9469567}, {"no": 9485970, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)12:59:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9484332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9484332</a><br>So I&#039;m replaying X-2 and it just dawned on me, does the HD version of X-2 still use Wakka&#039;s old model when X doesn&#039;t?

Going from being the King&#039;s Field and AC devs to then hitting there stride with the Souls formula and getting themselves out of that perception of being a lower tier company. I guess filling in that mecha niche helped them to be carried as you put it. Just think of all those other companies that were in their shoes at one point. Most didn&#039;t make it to today. They either got bought out and completely gutted until they were a soulless in name only company or they just were outright made defunct. Lets take EA for example, you got Bioware which was actually honestly at the time of EA&#039;s acqusition a much bigger and more known company than From. People loved Bioware even prior to EA.

The devs designed Star Fox around its awful framerate. In order to make Star Fox look right at 60fps, the game would have to be modified to match the timing of the new framerate.

The mugger in the street and the thug in the alley are possible soft-locks. If you&#039;ve already hit the mugger a few times, the next hit results in death.

Because there is a random soft-lock in the sewers after you get rid of the murder weapon. I had it happen to me. After throwing away the gun, you can encounter the Alligator in the sewers.

No new gun = stuck in the sewers with no way out other than death.<br>I actually recommend headed to the police station prior to going to the sewers just to encounter Sugar Shack, knock her out, and take her money to get yourself the new gun before going into the sewers, so you still have a $20 for the mugger, then staying out of the alley where the thug is.

Story is weird, there&#039;s a beaucoup of stuff that&#039;s left unexplained. Presentation wise: Well the music is amazing and among my top three favorite Final Fantasy OSTs. The graphics, well, the polygons don&#039;t know what the hell they wanted to be at times, but the pre-drawn backgrounds are top tier. Really makes the world feel unique. Other things like the menus and stuff were properly navigable, and all the little chimes and bleeps are different enough to be very distinctive. The quality of the dialogue translation ranges from good to adequate to downright stilted. Overall I give it the presentation a 7/10. When compared to other 3D games it&#039;s nothing special, but in my opinion the 3D Final Fantasys only looked good in FMVs until X, and I&#039;m saying that from the perspective of someone who doesn&#039;t love X like a child.

The logical conclusion is to get the correct controller for each of the consoles you plan to emulate. Because of the gulf in quality between first party controllers and third party USB clones, you&#039;re going to want first party original controllers and of course because there is no way to connect them to a PC, high quality adapters for them so for every emulator you&#039;ll have to drop around $25-50 + $25-45 for controllers and adapters. Before you know it you&#039;ll be knee deep in a bin full of controllers with different dongles. Hope you got high quality ones, chink ones don&#039;t even last 5 cycles.<br><br>So the cost of free emulation after a $1000 + PC is pretty high. That&#039;s about $80 for each console you want to emulate. Now you just have to spend time configuring every game for every emulator, setting up hacks so they actually run, pining for fixes in nightly releases and tweaking CRT shaders.<br><br>Will it be worth it?", "time": 1671074102, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490758</a><br>dogshit dpad", "time": 1671075021, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492228, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9491105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9491105</a><br>have sex, touch grass, and take meds, freak", "time": 1671076393, "resto": 9490375}, {"no": 9492292, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:35:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9490375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9490375</a><br>Why didn&#039;t they go all out and give it triggers?

It&#039;s objectively the PS3 controller and I&#039;ll tell you why. Xbox controllers don&#039;t have the gyroscope or whatever it&#039;s called (six axis motion?) and the PS4 controller comes close, but it doesn&#039;t have pressure sensitive face buttons. Most controllers have pressure sensitive triggers, but that&#039;s it. Basically, this is the only controller that allows you to lightly press any button and also registers tilt. Why does this matter you ask? Because there are a few games where this is absolutely needed. If I remember correctly, the Metal Gear solid games from the ps2 needed this and when they were ported to xbox they needed to redo these mechanics. Also you can emulate the ps3 nowdays so there&#039;s Heavely Sword, etc. The only downside is that it doesn&#039;t use a micro usb like the PS4 controller, it uses a mini usb.

Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist.

It&#039;s a weird game in the series, it acts as a continuation of SH1&#039;s plot while telling a more personal narrative about Heather like SH2, making it feel &quot;redundant&quot; in ways. SH3 both tries to tell a deeper narrative happening around the protagonist and those around her but also have her experience her own personal journey, it&#039;s a very ambitious narrative that, overall, I would say works out well but doesn&#039;t feel quite as cohesive as the prior two entries. Generally I think people see SH3 as having &quot;less meaning&quot; in what the game, and this is true in a few regards but still pretty inaccurate to the overall. Honestly I think the symbolism and themes go over people&#039;s heads because they&#039;re so heavily based in the feminine experience. If you&#039;re a guy I feel like it&#039;s likely you just kind of don&#039;t think about things like the game&#039;s various menstrual imagery, though some things like the hole leading to the final boss are hard to miss.<br><br>I always have a hard time deciding between SH1 and SH3 as my personal favorite. SH3 has a lot going for it with the most refined gameplay and graphics of the series, but it&#039;s also the most obviously compromised of the first three games. The game has essentially no exploration outside of the dungeons and a handful of &quot;grab thing, walk a room over, use thing&quot; moments. It&#039;s a great game on its own merits, but how it compares to prior entries and their strengths gives a lot of differing thoughts. I would say that, as simply a &quot;video game&quot;, that SH3 is the best, as to be expected being the newest, but it&#039;s clear pure gameplay is not why people love horror games.", "filename": "Ffn6nbWVQAAigcN", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670955746219477, "time": 1670955746, "md5": "PMYuoi9u29tzPP5ZgPM7Cg==", "fsize": 63545, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488604, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Allow me to put this retarded discussion to rest.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 wikipedia is wrong </span><br>Okay school teacher.", "filename": "1649719663676", "ext": ".png", "w": 552, "h": 32, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 7, "tim": 1670955848062248, "time": 1670955848, "md5": "SWb5cKYBsciKWJJ4uj/yWQ==", "fsize": 5896, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488609, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9488604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9488604</a><br>I know you must be genuinely retarded but yes, that is why wikipedia is generally agreed to be a fucking non source for anything unless wikipedia directly links to the actual source, literally fucking anyone can write in it and unless someone decides that what was written was wrong (and the cucks in charge agree with the changes) then that is the information present <br><br>fuck off literal NPC", "time": 1670956080, "resto": 9475249}, {"no": 9488610, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9487940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9487940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the *actual*, real thing that separates a &quot;survival horror&quot; game from something else is the true permanence of consequence</span><br>That has literally nothing to do with survival horror.

What does moving the items around do fundamentally to the gameplay? You aren&#039;t prevented from continuing the game if you don&#039;t move them around.

And I realized...<br>I truly love this game. The story and pacing is the perfect kind of jank that can fuel hours of silly stupid headcanons. I have nothing but fun with the gunplay and the ridiculousness of a military or alien force being mowed down by a four foot edgie hedgie with a twenty-foot long gatling gun screams COOL, RIDICULOUS, and BADASS all at the same time. Shooting down giant flying craft by just endlessly spamming dakka while rushing to find more ammo fires off the synapses in my brain that give me joy. And it&#039;s so buttery slick to control, but doesn&#039;t suffer the same SA1 problem where you can set yourself back 20-30 seconds five times over because the speed overwhelms the controls, it&#039;s just death or a light punishment for being a retard. And the meters letting you spam extra dakka, or just randomly delete entire sections of the level with some well placed jumps? Wonderful<br>And oh the set pieces! It&#039;s so awesome to revisit the corridors of the ARK and even see entirely new sections from the far past, I love the grim-derp take on the Sonic highway gimmick, the gaudy colors of the light rail sections. Do you want some moderately-difficult platforming? We got that. You want some piss-easy platforming? We got that. You want no platforming and just want to blow up bombs or mow down enemies? We got that also! And above all, it&#039;s not trying to be a Sonic game, it commits to being it&#039;s own thing.<br><br>I don&#039;t care if everyone else hates it for a thousand reasons. This game brings me childlike joy even in my late twenties. The *only* thing I don&#039;t like is the opening level, the first 30 seconds are fantastic for setpiecing but you spend the rest of it going down a dull single street for a silly enemy hunt, could have at least split the path at least once like what Air Fleet did.", "filename": "image_2022-12-15_001642254", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 1294, "tn_w": 115, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671088626802970, "time": 1671088626, "md5": "GeZoIzHGonOK5ecFG/nuBg==", "fsize": 534829, "resto": 9483251}, {"no": 9492516, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)02:29:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9492507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9492507</a><br>I love this game bros", "filename": "chadow the edgehog", "ext": ".png", "w": 789, "h": 798, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671089384257901, "time": 1671089384, "md5": "2d7kkosYBmikZ18fDW9JAg==", "fsize": 1577642, "resto": 9483251}, {"no": 9492521, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)02:37:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9483262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9483262</a><br>If you ask people to explain why they think Shadow&#039;s character was ruined they always give a generic response.

MiSTer is a project that is taking advantage of a cheap FPGA that people can buy, called the DE-10 Nano. The DE-10 Nano is cheap because it is made for college students, and is subsidized by Intel. The DE-10 Nano has an FGPA on board, as well as an ARM chip. It has various connectors on the board for expandability. MiSTer has a bunch of FPGA cores (much like the cores you would see on one of the Analog systems) for consoles, handhelds, arcade boards and computers. Developers are constantly adding more cores and improving on existing cores. A hobbiest community has popped up around this project, which has led to a lot of hardware addons that can be installed onto the DE-10 Nano, such as extra RAM, a digital or analog I/O board, USB hub (these things make up the most common MiSTer setup that you have likely seen, which is a sandwich of three boards with the DE-10 Nano in the middle)... etc. There are people who have made specialized expansion boards like the MiSTercade, which allows it to be used in a typical JAMMA arcade cabinet. At a base level, you really just need the DE-10 Nano, and preferably a RAM stick, the rest is optional.<br><br>MiSTer can be appealing to enthusiasts because it offers better accuracy/latency compared to software emulation. It&#039;s also very easy to set up and use in a variety of scenarios, without having to invest in a bunch of extra shit like flash carts, upscalers, custom cables... etc. It is an all-in-one solution for many of the systems that a retro gamer would be interested in. By its nature, it is also very customizable. <br><br>I still think that software emulation is a good option, especially on a budget since you can probably do it on hardware that you already own, however I do like my MiSTer quite a bit and I find that I am playing more /vr/ games than ever since getting it.", "filename": "mister-sandwich", "ext": ".png", "w": 611, "h": 856, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670246300392107, "time": 1670246300, "md5": "fcC4uIUOYU6IZ0kAMoy3Dw==", "fsize": 945737, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468185, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)11:56:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467832</a><br>I was just fishing for (you)s and shitposts but this high effort response doesn&#039;t deserve it", "time": 1670259366, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468240, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)12:25:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9467669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9467669</a><br>Cope comes for free with being a poorfag as well kiddo", "time": 1670261105, "resto": 9464069}, {"no": 9468353, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)13:15:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9465495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9465495</a><br>Yes.

Battling itself actually helps remove monsters stress. As you accumulate larger amounts of cash, it&#039;s definitely good to prioritize buying all the more expensive stress relieving, fatigue relieving, and sleep helping items you&#039;ll see in the shop like the cups and gems, as can afford them of course, don&#039;t skip out on them, they&#039;ll make it easier for new monsters. Also don&#039;t let your monster get fat or malnourished, fat monsters get fatigued more and underweight monsters get stressed more.<br><br>Also take it easy on baby monsters, just do the most basic training until its more mature aka when Holly tells gives you that cue that it&#039;s an &quot;important time&quot; or whatever she says, that&#039;s when you start the coach routines<br><br>Always focus on like 3, maybe 4 main stats to train your monster in. Having a balanced monster doesn&#039;t really work because there&#039;s only so much time you can put into training during its lifespan, you want your monster to excel hard in specific areas, not be average in many areas, so take that into consideration when deciding what monster you wanna raise and how you want it to grow/what moves you want it to learn<br><br>When you&#039;re stronger and start doing sparring with the intention of learning new moves specifically, it&#039;s not really worth it unless you&#039;re gonna learn a new move, so don&#039;t bother wasting the money and time unless it says there&#039;s a chance your monster will learn a new move, and honestly I say theres no shame in saving before and restarting until you learn the move", "time": 1670371774, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9471981, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Jell<br>but the one I used to win with was Hare", "time": 1670372119, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472112, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:14:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471460</a><br><a href=\"#p9471549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471549</a><br>What are you doing, dude?", "filename": "1308028510381", "ext": ".png", "w": 496, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1670375679755307, "time": 1670375679, "md5": "vQBz/xGhIxFw/6o0Q324aA==", "fsize": 134450, "resto": 9471326}, {"no": 9472651, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)00:50:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9471326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9471326</a><br>Kato, named him Risk and built him pure agi and int?/tech?(the one that increases the damage of the green skills) and spammed the twister/tornado claw.

I remember one was based on the Namco theme park Namja Town, another was an RPG that featured all of Namco\u2019s lead characters, the third was Splatterhouse and the last one was Pac-man Ghost Zone.

In PSO though, you can play with one group of friends one day, and then take your memory card and use the same character with a completely different group of friends the next day. 4 players can play together with 4 different characters on 4 different memory cards, even though the gamecube only has 2 memory card ports.<br><br>One caveat though; the camera sucks in split screen.

He would connect Diablo to the network and play until morning, wake up to work, and then play again. Some of us weren\u2019t going home much at the time. Some people would go home just to bathe, sleep a few hours, come back into the office to work, and then play Diablo at the office. It was mostly in the name of research, though. There are a number of games that we used as inspiration. Diablo was obviously one of them. I had heard that Dragon Quest was inspired by remaking Ultima with a Japanese audience in mind. So our concept was, \u201cLet\u2019s make a Diablo game that would appeal to the Japanese audience.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: With good results. Even though Diablo is a distinctly American game, PSO feels like a very distinctly Japanese game. And yet, it\u2019s not just palatable to Japanese gamers but to everyone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think Diablo is an amazing game, but it\u2019s not a game that appeals to Japanese players. Our suspicion was that Japanese gamers would prefer to cooperate and work together to defeat something more than to compete and fight against other players. That\u2019s why we created PSO to be a cooperative role-playing game. Diablo has cooperative elements but it also has PK and an element of killing other player characters. We eliminated those elements and focused on how we could make a fun, cooperative RPG experience. I think that\u2019s the biggest difference between PSO and Diablo.</span>", "time": 1670435127, "resto": 9471103}, {"no": 9473789, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)12:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I remember there was an MMO called Lineage which looked like Diablo.

But overall anime and Japanese media has become big and ingrained enough that the Working Designs/4Kids/Saban levels of translating something is more met with derision than &quot;oh boy anime&quot;. Even when Nintendo tossed memes into localized scripts of their games, people are more likely to groan and wish they weren&#039;t there now.<br><br>I think part of it too is that Working Designs translated Magic Knights Rayearth, which has the honor of being the last western Sega Saturn game. If it were anything else, sure, but Rayearth was an established franchise and WD putting on their trademark brand of humor soured a lot to them: even back when the game was new, people felt it was an awkward and out of place translation for the game because the anime was available and already had fans. So you have a game that hits a lot of &quot;oh should I check this out&quot; flags (last console release in the west, based on a beloved series, etc) and get hit with &quot;eh, they made it worse&quot; is sort of an &quot;the Emperor isn&#039;t wearing any clothes&quot; moment for them.<br><br>Also they put an ammo system into Silhouette Mirage and that personally rankled me because it meant you never wanted to experiment with different weapons due to the cost to use them, then they added grinding for money on top of it.

Let&#039;s read what other people have to say, shall we?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I prefer the PS1 version in my opinion. It has better controls, the PS1 graphics look great, it has an awesome soundtrack, and I heard it&#039;s superior version of the game. It&#039;s a really fun Toy Story game it&#039;s actually my first PS1 game.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have now started playing it on Dreamcast and I am a bit shocked by the analog controls. Basically, the controls work like dpad controls and the analog stick is mapped to the eight directions of a d-pad. This is not too unusual for games originating on PS1 back then, but what is unusual, and also insane, is the fact that the mapping seems to work like this: pick a very small epsilon and then determine for each of the four base directions, if they are pressed like this: if stickdirectionX &gt; epsilon then right = true; if stickdirectionY &gt; epsilon then forward = true (and similar for the opposite directions). As a consequence, if you only slightly deviate from the four base directions, you end up with a diagonal direction. This makes the game near unplayable with the analogstick and everytime I need even a bit of precision, I need to resort to the dpad.</span><br><br>Stop talking out your ass and actually fucking play the game.

I&#039;m too lazy to type something new, though...so copy paste it is. Again. Playing Toy Story 2 on the Dreamcast. I&#039;m wishing I had bought Space Channel 5 instead... Right from the bat, something is wrong. When using the control stick, Buzz refused to walk in a straight line. At first, I thought something was wrong with my controller, but some replies and research says that no, this is not an isolated incident. It&#039;s a problem with the game itself. Fortunately, the D-Pad is more precise, but it&#039;s uncomfortable. You can adapt to it, though, which I did. However, in the Alley level, I&#039;m bumping into glitches. First, Buzz refused to move at all. I paused the game, not a problem with the controller, so I quit the level as started again. Then, the music started glitching up, and the game froze up. Is this a problem with the Dreamcast? Or can this one be pinned on the game? I&#039;m hearing the PS1 release has no such issues. It&#039;s the only Dreamcast game I have, so I&#039;m trying to make the best of it, but yeesh...I hope my Dreamcast isn&#039;t broken. There&#039;s some game I want to play, especially Puyo Puyo~n.
