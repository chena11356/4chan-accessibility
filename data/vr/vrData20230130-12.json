Also, the GameBoy game has a smaller version of the VR Missions, which adds more to the game. I was surprised at how they shoehorned the gameplay of the PS1 game into a GBC version.

The NES game sold like as million units, and Snakes Revenge was a NES exclusive sequel made by one of the Konami console teams. So, when Metal Gear Solid was announced, a lot of the western hype came from people familiar with the NES Metal Gear games. Metal Gear Solid does have a recap for the first and second MSX games, and most people probably thought Metal Gear 2 was referring to the NES game; Snakes Revenge. You can buy the MSX games now on GOG and steam and other digital services. But back in the day, they were obscure outside of Japan.

Only times it got talked about before was when collector hoarders accidentally leaked a private mega folder with tons of games including this previously lost game.<br>Company did 3 games like these and folded shortly after. Supposedly uses a Macromedia type thing.<br><br>Some copyright troll trademarked a bunch of stuff including the logo for the game and took down most of the media about it online, and it looks more like erasing the game from existence than a prospective new release. Nearly nothing is left online.<br><br>The game is about a 5 year old American girl identifying as a bear (and portrayed as such) going to dangerous locations after hearing voices in her head. The game opens with her being refused a bus ride, that bus is bombed by terrorists and everyone is dead, the terrorists are gunned by an airplane and everyone is dead, and the girl inspects the bus and goes &quot;It can&#039;t be helped&quot;. Then she has to avoid dying by starvation, getting hugged to death by a pedophile cop, getting killed in the crossfire of other terrorists in a public park where a schizophrenic woman thinks the heroine is daughter, and then an alien locale that defies description. I&#039;m saddened the walkthrough was taken offline. I really want to see how this goes now that I learned more Japanese.

OoT was a very good start on 3D combat but right now I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry and <s>Dark Souls not retro though</s>.<br><br>The prior focuses on giving the player as many combat options as possible and makes that the fun of the game. Launchers, flying attacks, guns, ways to combo enemies, parries, everything you could want to do. These games are more about being stylish than just outright winning the fight. However this limits the enemy design as these games can quickly become unfun if there&#039;s too many enemies you can&#039;t combo effectively, or if the bosses act in a way that&#039;s too limiting to your arsenal.<br><br>While the latter is the exact opposite, you have an extremely narrow set of options in combat. Block, dodge, light swing, heavy swing, shoot projectile and maybe a few more options. While this seems limiting it allows the developers to focus much more heavily on challenging enemy design based on how enemies respond and require you to use the few options in your arsenal. People generally love boss fights in these kind of games for this exact reason, every single boss is like learning a song in a rhythm game since its mostly been simplified to &quot;when do I dodge and when do I hit?&quot;.<br><br>OoT has a lot of options that lack purpose. Yes you can angle your swipes, horizontally or vertically, but what value does that have over just hitting the B button? The answer is none because enemies don&#039;t respond to things in ways that warrant you to change that. Would crouch stabbing have any value if it wasn&#039;t just objectively the best DPS in the game? I don&#039;t think so, because no enemies have a mechanic where you need to crouch to evade their attacks. Dodge mechanics are hardly even necessary because only a tiny few enemies can threaten your shield, I can&#039;t even think of any other than Darknuts.<br><br>So I think that answers your question, quality &gt; quantity.", "filename": "20245725_1390952080994962_7348464048814365511_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 658, "h": 370, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674842161091574, "time": 1674842161, "md5": "zWcQa8zfOLvO/HZ8GMt9rQ==", "fsize": 25081, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607775, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would say there are two game series that influence 3D action games the most: Devil May Cry</span><br>you are wrong<br>it&#039;s <s>the batman arkham games</s>", "time": 1674842493, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9607783, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)13:04:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607775</a><br>i really only see other superhero games copying that but yeah that one is influential unfortunately, I don&#039;t think its as much as the 2 I said though.", "time": 1674842640, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9608043, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:54:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607519</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;second song</span><br>good job proving my point with one of the most grating instruments used.", "time": 1674849272, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609634, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br>They should increase the quality instead of reducing the quantity", "time": 1674905120, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609819, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you want peak sword combat, check out Jedi Outcast", "time": 1674913481, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9609823, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>the harmonica? not my fault you got shit taste", "time": 1674913581, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610042, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9608043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9608043</a><br>This might be the wrong board for you if you need the clearest music possible and can&#039;t appreciate retro music by merit of memorable melodies <br><br>Kakariko is THE comfy-village music", "time": 1674920798, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610047, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:47:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9609819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9609819</a><br>This game is the definition of janky", "time": 1674920873, "resto": 9594662}, {"no": 9610052, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:49:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9607762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9607762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dark Souls not retro though.</span><br>But that&#039;s influenced by Zelda in the first place and extremely basic.

rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved. In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.<br><br>And you OP, you just do not understand how easy it is to &quot;accidentally&quot; copy rock music as it is all the same.

Manufacturing cost was expensive compared to their competitors, so most of the British wealthy chose to invest in the service sector.

Thus, Thatcher was elected, and she deregulated the market while pursuing a monetarist policy that hurt British exports.

This leads to a lot of tearing and distortion of tissue, larger wound channels, and the projectile is likely to fragment or deform, particularly if it hits bone, itself which will shatter, thus these kinds of wounds are quite intense and gruesome.<br>The world largely transitioned to this style of bullet for rifles right around WW1, but Italy did not, they stuck to an older style for 6.5mm Carcano, a cylindrical, roundnosed projectile of much greater weight.

Split, Merged, and Un-Merged.<br>Split is every unique group of roms in it&#039;s own .zip file, meaning all games using the QSound HLE will just be looking for a qsound_hle.zip in your /roms directory. You&#039;ll need the Parent ROM, and whatever Clone ROM you want for that specific region/revision of the game. Merged is the BIOS files, parent, and all clones in the same .zip file, meaning all needed files to make the Parent work are present, and with some work you can get the Clones to work as well. Which is good if you aren&#039;t picky about the region/revision. Un-Merged is the parent and clones having their own .zip files that contain ALL needed files to work. There&#039;s a great deal of duplication because of this, but every single .zip file is stand-alone and you can be certain that one .zip will have everything you need.<br>Split is for people who want to be efficient and have everything, Merged is for people who want to have everything but have a cleaner directory with less .zip&#039;s.

Connect your controller of choice.<br>2. Go to Control Panel &gt; Device Manager &gt; Human Interface Devices &gt; HID Conform Game Controller &gt; Your Controller &gt; Properties &gt; Details &gt; pick Hardware IDs from the drop down menu and note it down.<br>3. Write a text document like pic related to permanently map your buttons to player 1 using your controller&#039;s hardware ID*** (see 2nd post).

They then built a wall out of Battletoads and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine.

Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of Battletoads into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth&#039;s orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a Battletoads made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at Battletoads into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.

I think this game was excellent when it came to the music (that main menu theme!) and the overall plot and presentation was great. Lara never looked better imo. The gameplay is what kills it. The last levels from Strahov onward are simply unfinished and cut extremely short. I would have loved to see more of that world and the stuff they would have us raid from tombs. Each classic tomb raider game really did something completely different from the last one. Collecting an Atlantean artifact from lost civilisations that developed from a cataclysm, destroying an Italian cult focussed around a Chinese dagger that turns you into a dragon hunting through sunken ships (interesting choice of tomb), Collecting meteorite splinters from all over the world for a weird social darwinist gone power-mad only to then kill him, and then a game focussed around the apocalypse being started by a haughty Lara picking up the amulet of Seth (1999 had many apocalypse plots, even V:tM Redemption), Chronicles was all over the place, and finally this weird cinematic plot of a serial killer and Icons that you need to collect and periapt shards you need to defeat the weird half-angel Nephilim race. <br><br>Tomb Raider was a wild ride. It really pisses me off that the gameplay for the final game was so piss-poor. There is lots of potential in that game and afaik they wanted to do so much more.

Most FF fans are completely artistically illiterate and can&#039;t see any nuance. Sephiroth is shown to be cold and ruthless even when he was a &quot;hero.&quot; He was raised to be a killing machine, held up as a figurehead for Shinra&#039;s propaganda, showered with praise for slaughtering any perceived enemy, and we learn from Lucretia that he was never even held by his mother as a baby; he was whisked off by scientists to be a research specimen the moment he was born. You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see how fucked up someone would be from living a life like that. Even before the Nibelheim incident, he was, at best, a functional sociopath with a massive superiority complex, but most players completely miss all of that and take the claim that he&#039;s a hero at face value. <br><br>I&#039;d also argue that he doesn&#039;t actually give a shit about Jenova or the Ancients. Those are just post-hoc rationalizations he uses to justify his desires. When he reads in Gast&#039;s research notes that Jenova is an Ancient, he claims that entitles him to take the planet back from the humans who betrayed the Ancients. Later, when he travels through the Lifestream and learns the truth about Jenova (that she was actually just a monster that wiped out the Ancients), he twists it around and says that he&#039;s entitled to rule the planet because Jenova was even greater than the Ancients were. In other words, all he really wants is to satisfy his own ego by elevating himself up to godhood compared to the rest of the world, and he&#039;ll use whatever excuse he can come up with to justify it.", "time": 1674613383, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600384, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka is\u2026 Sephiroth</span><br>this nigga doesn\u2019t understand how numbers work", "time": 1674614692, "resto": 9598739}, {"no": 9600392, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)21:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9599487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9599487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kefka\u2026 gets his plans foiled</span><br>You didn\u2019t even play the game.

Curtains Down from Blood Money is a lot more satisfying when you understand the context of the scene the target is playing out, for instance.<br><br>The opera is called Tosca, and thats the ending scene. There&#039;s at least a dozen Kojima-tier absurd plot twists that precede it, but basically the character being executed believes that its a mock execution, because the chief of police pardoned him but had to keep up appearances because he&#039;s known for being tough on crime. Usually on stage, that character acts like a chad with no fear of death, and his girlfriend is singing these joking lyrics about what a good actor he is while the music itself is really tense and clues you in that he&#039;s actually fucked and the police chief didn&#039;t actually give the order to pardon. He gets shot and dies with a look of shock on his face, and his girlfriend jumps off a cliff to avoid arrest, then curtains the end.<br><br>So in a meta sense, the two targets are actually playing the roles of the two opera characters, and 47 is actually playing the role of the executioner.

NES games run great, you can move with the joystick.<br><br>Ocarina of Time and Master Quest run very well, with the later adding some very challenging content. You can set the C buttons either to X, Y, and Z or use the directions on the C stick. I ended up using the C stick since it was easier to visualize. It was a little weird at first, but after a few hours I was a pro at flinging the stick to use items. Z targeting becomes L targeting which is just as effective. I really enjoyed playing these with the GC controller. As for the content, it has dome minor changes like the fire temple music, mirror shield, etc.<br><br>Unfortunately, what people are saying about Majora\u2019s Mask emulation is true.

Since you meantioned the system clock not working it&#039;s pretty much guaranteed that it leaked and ceased to function.

To repair this is beyond my knowledge or capabilities. I can&#039;t even tell you whether it&#039;s a feasible option or not. This is why every single Xbox out there that&#039;s below hardware v1.6 needs to be openend and have it&#039;s clock cap removed or better yet, replaced - the system can run without it, as you have seen since yours is dead.

other CVs<br>music is nice too except the fucking intro of luminous cave is the most dogshit annoying shit i&#039;ve heard, but shit like offense and defense, name entry 2k2 and chapel of dissonance is VERY nice.<br>great combat as well. it has a lot of frame precision for cancelling. and the damage stack glitch gives it more depth than just whip whip magic. all of it combined makes for a very point precision positioning with very tightly timed inputs gameplay.<br>there&#039;s crazy coyote(maintaining jump after walking of a ledge) in this game, probably the longest lasting in the series, 1 frame door glitches and the 7 frame (6 for maxim) ledge speed boost, giving it a lot of variety in routing and tech requirements. it&#039;s surprisingly input heavy and precise for a seemingly shit af

the game like the other games, so you can regularly spam this, and keep your progress in case you die.<br>doing so and resetting the game loads you in the last used save room, instead of the room you used the Menu &quot;save room&quot;, so if you know what you are doing, you can alleviate a LOT of backtracking, like immediately returning to castle a entrance after getting double jump, and abusing how powerful the coyote is to get the big teleport gate for later. doing so gives you the strongest whip upgrade and also sets up fast return for floodgate key. there&#039;s a lot of other things you can do with this, but generally it can make traveling between castles more seamless. and while you keep your progress, risking dying while doing this means you get sent back a crazy amount of distance.<br>given how risky it can be to go for damage stacks at times, playing like this makes for a very high risk high reward type of gameplay that challenges you to play this game very accurately

through most of bone cave, getting the double jump, and having to backtrack through luminous cave again to progress because the game lacks clear sense of direction and the map is confusing, well
