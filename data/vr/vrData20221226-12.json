Your comment about sandbox games is true like how grinding was true for RPGs, sometimes people&#039;s win condition in regards to delayed gratification doesn&#039;t have to be due to challenge specifically. My point was that challenge is how it is accomplished with as little fluff as possible, and there is the difference between originating in skill/strategy/tactics/etc and just time investment.

Play if you like quirky games like Wario Ware and rhythm games.<br>3. Advance Wars\u2014personally not a fan, but those who liked it spent hundreds of hours in it. Very addictive strategy game.<br>4. WarioWare\u2014quirky and addictive, one of the more original games for GBA. If you&#039;ve never tried it, do. If you did, still fun to see where it all started from.<br>5. Metroid Fusion\u2014it&#039;s 2D Metroid, enough said. It&#039;s great despite some say it&#039;s not Super Metroid.<br>6. Mother 3\u2014not a perfect RPG, but one many people want to play now. Play if you like Earthbound or want an RPG with plot.<br>7. Wario Land 4\u2014some praise this is as pinnacle of GBA or even best platformer ever, others will write it off as good but ultimately weaker than the GBC ones. Regardless, well worth a try.<br>8. Mario &amp; Luigi\u2014actually very good RPG, only brought down by bing bang wahoo style and kinda whatever graphics.<br>9. Kirbies in general\u2014always fun and worth a play. Play if you like Kirby, don&#039;t play if you&#039;re sick of platformers.<br>10. Mega Man Zero 3 &amp; 4\u2014decent games, but got pretty overrated recently as some &quot;official canon classics&quot;. I beat them all, they&#039;re fun and good but not really masterpieces. Play if you like Mega Man X series and / or have played the other 9 games already.<br>Not on the list:<br>SNES ports, especially Mario ports\u2014kind of obsolete in current day and age, maybe save for SMW as you can collect dragon coins in it, but that&#039;s it.<br>Pokemons\u2014you either love them or hate them. If you love them, you probably know which ones to play anyway, and may prefer remakes. <br>Zelda: Minish Cap\u2014it&#039;s more Zelda. Play it or skip it, it&#039;s alright if you want more ALTTP but thats about it.<br>Treasure games\u2014no comment.<br>Mega Man Battle Network\u2014one of those monster / card collect series that just goes on and on.", "time": 1672043990, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518704, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:53:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518654</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his list is baaad, look at my list look at my list! </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the same but has one-dollar-store Symphony of the Night with ladyboy characters!</span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9518683</span><br><a href=\"#p9518687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518687</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;then takes it so seriously he deletes his post over a typo and uses alt codes</span><br>I hope you are a janny because otherwise you need to touch snail shells right now", "time": 1672044817, "resto": 9518587}, {"no": 9518708, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:59:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9518704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9518704</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look at my list look at my list</span><br>I never posted a list.

They tried to make it work with the jungle/natural areas, but it doesn&#039;t even come close to 2&#039;s areas. Best areas in mgs3 are, Rassvet, Bolshaya Base, Graniny Gorki and Groznyj Grad, here you can experiment and fuck around with the guards so much, but it&#039;s only 4 areas compare to mgs2&#039;s sea of repayable areas.<br>Also the menu stuff kills the pacing, granted most mgs player don&#039;t really bother with the camo stuff if they sneak properly with a well-around camo, but the backpack stuff and healing just kills the pacing, and if you put a bunch of stuff on snake, he&#039;ll lose his stamina faster.<br>I understand they wanted to add more depth but I don&#039;t think this gen was not the right time to do it...that is if loading limitations was the reason they went in this direction.<br>Either that or devs were still figuring out stuff that&#039;s standard now, or didn&#039;t play games that had some quality of life features that might&#039;ve made things smoother. Like the dpad could&#039;ve been used to access camos and backpack items faster by holding a dpad button and have a ratchet style weapon wheel pop up, but for backpack items and camo for quick switching. They could&#039;ve even used the left shoulder button item selection have 1 slot dedicated to camo only for faster switching, like Raiden&#039;s costume slot in 2 but you can toggle different outfits on the fly, like you would with the suppressor on a gun in 3, or ammo types in 4. Here you would&#039;ve equipped 4 camos to switch on the fly, you can even make the switch subtle by having Snake quickly change clothes inside a cbox like in 5, it would increase the pacing a lot, even with that short cbox animation.<br>Easy Stalking could&#039;ve been assigned to a different button that you can just hold, it didn&#039;t need to use 4 buttons, the game didn&#039;t even need it in the 1st place when stalking is possible with the left stick.", "time": 1671982949, "resto": 9516951}, {"no": 9517153, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)10:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9517145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9517145</a><br>No offense anon but for a moment I thought it was pasta<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;for me MGS excels when it&#039;s set indoors and close quarters</span><br>You must be that one anon who always says this when explaining why you prefer MGS2 to 3", "time": 1671983326, "resto": 9516951}, {"no": 9517162, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)10:55:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9517153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9517153</a><br>I don&#039;t come to /vr/ as often as I used to but it probably is, though I don&#039;t remember saying it as much.", "time": 1671983701, "resto": 9516951}, {"no": 9517196, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)11:18:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9517145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9517145</a><br>I love MGS3 but your quality of life issues are spot on.

I think the original games had better music and a handful of better lines of dialogue, but FRLG was pretty great otherwise. I like held items, natures and all the other gen 3 junk and honestly like being able to play Red or Green with that stuff thrown in. I liked the way the Pokedex was presented and how the game gives you a little recap of what you last did whenever you load a save.

It did a lot of cool things and to me really freshened up the series up to that point. The only thing it missed was doing the physical/special split for attacks. That came a gen later. Would have been sweet to see it introduced with R/S/E instead. Was probably the most logical change to ever come to this franchise but by the time it showed up I was already done with Pokemon so I never played past the third gen of games. It was also nice to see those secret bases be a thing even if there was only a few limited locations for it. Was nice you could link up with friends, even have your friends character persist in your world. The fashion shows were also a fun divergence from the main game. Something this series desperately needed instead of just constant battling. Also made lesser mons and attacks not always completely worthless. Just too bad it was never expanded on really to my knowledge. Pokemon should have went out its way to vastly expand on concepts outside the catching and battling but I guess that leaves no room for milking so of course it wasn&#039;t happening.<br><br>Now as for the GB/GBC era, I actually prefer this era. Especially R/B/Y games. Its just preference and nostalgia admittedly. I also though prefer the look of this era to the later gens.

Shadows of the Empire, where you could use a jetpack intermittently or ride a motorbike during a level or two, but in Halo you could turn a level into a ghostbike/plane/sniper/sword level. So it combined genres like racing, shooting, and close-quarter platforming. Halo had a verticality that was stunning and it felt more like a strategy game where timing, coordination and close perception of the AI&#039;s movements all became decisive elements. One player would notice the AI doing one thing and the other player would see it doing something else and gradually its defensive wall would be pared back. Unlike the AI in &#039;Doom&#039; or &#039;Shadows...&#039;, the AI in Halo seemed particularly animated, ingenious and funny. The atmospheric effects and textures brought everything much closer, the level design was repetitious but convincingly exotic. Also the sense of collaboration between immediate and later online friends was new. Booting up worms on the dc in 2001 was nothing like the hype surrounding halo 2 by Christmas 2004. In hindsight it&#039;s unfortunate that worms 3d wasn&#039;t postponed till 2005.", "time": 1671691494, "resto": 9507662}, {"no": 9509939, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)01:52:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9509927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9509927</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not the sequels which were ads for the war on terror</span><br>You are a fucking retard.", "time": 1671691953, "resto": 9507662}, {"no": 9509951, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9509939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9509939</a><br>stick your menstrual pad in your mouth", "time": 1671692426, "resto": 9507662}, {"no": 9509978, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:17:05", "name": "kenpark69", "com": "so based like gamecub had so many more known and beloved titles and honestly halo was only for the fps audience imo so poop", "time": 1671693425, "resto": 9507662}, {"no": 9509984, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:20:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9507662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9507662</a><br>Built in hard drive, online gaming, Halo.
