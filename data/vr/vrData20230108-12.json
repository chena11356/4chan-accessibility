It was developed and planned for a 1975 launch date but a change in RCA management during this time pushed it back to an early 1977 release. The Studio II&#039;s black and white graphics looked inferior to the Fairchild Channel F which displayed in color, and the Atari VCS&#039;s launch later in the year made it look even cruder. It was discontinued in early 1978 and an estimated between 57,000 and 64,000 units sold. This would make it the smallest-selling game console ever sold in North America. The decision to pull the plug came after the Studio II failed to sell much over the 1977 holiday season and the realization that it had no hope to compete with the VCS. The Charlotte, North Carolina plant where the Studio II was manufactured was closed and 120 workers laid off.<br><br>The Studio II used RCA&#039;s 1802, the first microprocessor fabricated in CMOS, and a custom graphics chip known as &quot;Pixie&quot; which displayed 64x32 block graphics.

Thoughts so far:<br><br>- Battery reading is pretty inaccurate. Sometimes you turn it off, turn it on and the next time the percentage is a 1% higher<br><br>- Battery + built in wifi = bad: If you are going to download thumbnails / boxart or update cores / assets, do it while connected to the DC and disable wifi immediately after. It sucked a 30% just doing that.<br><br>- Gaming experience: Surprised to see it can do CPS3 with not a lot of hiccups. GBA paired with the LCD3X shader mitigates well enough the scaling artifacts when not using integer scaling. 240p PSX games like Klonoa are the ones that benefit the most from the small screen. Snes and Nes are as annoying as ever with the non square pixels if you have bad OCPD about stretching artifacts, as usual.<br><br>- Comfort: The d-pad is placed higher than on the og gameboy, so the corner gets into the soft of the hand and hurts a bit until you learn to adapt the posture. The analog stick placement justifies why I did not want the model with two of them. For Ridge Racer Type 4 I just place the left hand lower to not feel it too much. If I really wanted to play an analog only game, I would end using the Gamesir X2 instead.<br><br>- Commuting and travelling: Beats lugging around a Nintendo Switch for a quickie in the train. Easier to store. Loses points for not having bluetooth. I can do without wifi, but headphone cables are always a risk<br><br>- Did I really need this: Sure, it&#039;s cool to be able to play MVS Meta Slug X on the go, but then I ask myself why would I want to play on a &quot;tiny screen&quot; when I can do it on a 40&quot; tv and see all the details.

The PS1 and Saturn are somewhat closer to the CPS2 in architecture compared to the N64.<br>2. The disc format made it possible to make the games cheaper at retail. <br>3.

Maybe Capcom wasn&#039;t really too hot on the notion of near-arcade perfect ports of their arcade games in 1996-98. They were still in the arcade business and arcade operators would be pretty annoyed by Capcom releasing something that would take away from their earnings. The ports of SFZ3 and XMVSF require an expensive RAM cart and were probably considered halo products and gifts for long time fans as the CPS2 was nearing the end of its lifespan.

While I love Space Harrier to a huge degree, I also like Ecco. They are very different, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. I hate this comparison being thrown around, but in many ways Ecco is like Demon&#039;s Souls was compared to other contemporary games. <br><br>From an objective standpoint there are many harder retro games, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania 3, Super Ghouls n Ghosts, Battletoads, 1ccing Gradius etc (all of which get regular threads here by people declaring that the difficulty is overstated) are all much harder than anything Ecco throws at you, even the last levels. Most games, especially platformers have similar enough controls that you tangentially get good at others while playing it. With Ecco, nothing else plays like it so you&#039;re also learning a whole new control scheme.<br><br>However, all those games have a similar flow which is much more action focused. Ecco is all about being careful, scoping out the environment with your sonar and clearing an area of enemies so when you have to rush through you can. It&#039;s very different from many other console games of the era, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing. <br><br><a href=\"#p9536263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9536263</a><br>It&#039;s really not a handwave, it&#039;s how the game is designed. You can call it tedious, but it was never meant to be a bing bing wahoo rush to the finish type game. Unreliable just makes no sense, if you want to permakill an enemy, you can. It&#039;s about making the decision you want to. <br><br>Again as I always say in these threads, since first playing Ecco has always been in my top selection of games and I almost always have a playthrough on the go somewhere. Along with that love is the understanding it doesn&#039;t appeal to everyone, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing.

One character class (Onion Knight), which kinda sucked anyway and was a major pain in the ass to master.<br>3.

Recreating his father\u2019s commercial venture under the name Koey in July 1978, the Erikawa struggled in a context where more and more textile was being produced and imported from outside of Japan. In October 1980, Keiko gifted Yoichi a MZ-80C computer, an expensive present. The computer fascinated Yoichi, who immediately learned BASIC and Assembler, and then wrote software : a first one to help him manage the business\u2019 inventory, another for their finances. In truth, the limited complexity of their operations did not require any computer but eh \u2013 it was fun to code. Still, the software attracted some interest from larger companies, and soon Koey was selling business software. Seeing the potential of the booming personal computer market, Yoichi also started a computer shop in addition to his initial venture as a chemical wholesaler. With the little personal time he had left, Yoichi Erikawa started \u2013 as a hobby really \u2013 to code a small wargame on his computer, something simple given the limitation of the MZ-80C and of his own skill as a coder : Kawanakajima no Kassen, Keiko handling the art on the box and in the manual. On the 26th of October 1981, Erikawa put the first ads in magazines \u2013 the first Japanese computer wargame was released.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yoichi Erikawa expected to sell a few dozens of copies, one-hundred at best, but he sold 10 000 copies, generating more than the annual revenue of his struggling dye &amp; chemicals business.

After a couple of erotic games the Erikawa don\u2019t like to talk about and don\u2019t usually mention in their interviews, Koei released its first RPG : the Dragon &amp; Princess, and finally in 1983 the first iteration of its iconic Nobunaga\u2019s Ambition.</span>", "time": 1673116946, "resto": 9550549}, {"no": 9550971, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)13:45:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9550965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9550965</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After a couple of erotic games the Erikawa don\u2019t like to talk about and don\u2019t usually mention in their interviews</span><br>But do continue.

That port is still considered the best for MK2 that even surpasses the arcade in gameplay. In these console ports you can choose between 5 difficulty levels. So AI cheating may only happen if you choose so. And I believe AI cheating should come as an option. The SF2 and other ports also allow that option and I used to rent SF2, Samurai Showdown and many others and bought the original copy of Killer Instinct just because it came with a music CD.<br><br>I tried arcade games before but unlike retards who wasted their money and come here whining, I simply stopped playing arcades to save money to buy a console to play an affordable and playable version from these games, since I realized arcades were all meant to be hard and cheating in order to drain your money. SF2 was one of the first fighting arcades to do that. Since then gaming companies like Midway and Acclaim have been forcing developers like Ed Boon and others to use that same SF2 formula with cheating mechanics to get the most profit.

MK let different characters only share their most simplest attacks but with slightly differences allowing for more balanced matches. There are plenty attacks to choose, adding the uppercut and spinning kick to every fighter would be a nice thing in SF2 too.

Then Donkey Kong 64 came out and there were tons of collectathons so when Banjo Tooie came out people were tired of collectathons not to mention in the holiday christmas season of 2000 the N64 was now considered old, the PS2 had come out and took all the thunder away. Banjo Tooie was never as popular as the first game which in gaming it&#039;s a bad sign. They could&#039;ve turned it around with a great third Banjo game on Gamecube and establish Banjo as a franchise but Rare was sold and didn&#039;t get a new game until the IP was dead.<br>Microsoft didn&#039;t want to lose the work that had already been done so they released the GBA Banjo game. But by the time the game came out many Nintendo fans had moved on from Rare, not to mention it didn&#039;t get much advertisement from THQ who published the game and of course Nintendo weren&#039;t going to do their own marketing for a competitors mascot and use their Game Boy to promote the Xbox. The spin-off sounding game doesn&#039;t help it either. The game is actually really good, as good as a Banjo game could&#039;ve been on GBA doomed by its circumstances.<br>Had Nintendo never sold Rare it would&#039;ve gotten the marketing it deserved and the hype for Banjo Threeie would&#039;ve helped Banjo become an actual franchise and the GBA game would&#039;ve sold well and be remembered.<br><br>Banjo Pilot failed because as I mentioned above Banjo never became an established IP. When you took Donkey Kong out of the game it was just another generic kart racing game on the GBA which already had plenty of and everyone had already gotten their fix with Konami Krazy Racers for a mario kart clone until Mario Kart came out. When Banjo came out it was just a generic clone without anything special and an IP that had died. Even if Rare had not been sold or if it had kept the Donkey Kong License, the Banjo/DK Pilot game would&#039;ve failed.", "time": 1673024262, "resto": 9540607}, {"no": 9548634, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:16:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p9548210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;9548210</a><br>Pilot would have been major for the Banjo ip even with the DK license since it was going to have DK, Mario and Banjo characters all playable in it. Had it released unchanged, it would have cemented Banjo as being a &quot;Mario universe&quot; extended spinoff character like Yoshi and Wario as it seems Rare was always hoping to make him. Hell, i think Conker was also planned to be in it, but maybe im miss remembering that part. It is still pretty scummy on Nintendos part they didn&#039;t atleast buy the Banjo ip from Rare when they got bought up, considering how prominent they were used right alongside mario, pikachu and link in the late 90s Nintendo marketing material and even showed up alongside those same ips in the one mario art studio software.

If I try an Xbox series controller and then a PS1 DualShock in GT2 in Retroarch or in MHW they&#039;re about as similar as two physically different controllers produced over two decades apart can be and not so far off of real hardware as Duckstation&#039;s default settings, if I crank the rumble strength up in DS4Windows on my DS4 it not only feels pretty similar there&#039;s actually something in MHW that it picks up the Xbox controller doesn&#039;t.<br><br>Also what confuses things even more is that even just how the controller is getting power over USB can affect how strong the rumble is.

Acclaim created this off company called Flying Edge, which was a publisher for Sega (Genesis/ MD/ GG/ SMS) games, as Nintendo had some contract shit going on. Acclaim made it pretty clear that they owned Flying Edge. They ported Bart vs The Space Mutants to the Genesis/ MD, and did give the game a 16bit update. It does look better, but still not amazing.

The actual Arwing stages are lame and poorly paced, with the ugliest ship design in the series and terrible sound effects (the laser shots sound like splashing water). The worst part of the game for me however was the writting. SF64 is as well known for its corney dialog as its balls to the wall action. There is a fine line between corney (but fun) and cringey and this game crossed it.

I am STILL stuck on smb2 nes after playing it casually for a year and I save state every world.

I wish there were a few more bullets at the start since shooting the elevated skeletons at the start feels drawn out with the shotgun. I really dislike that some of the rock/sand piles around the start have impassible lines for no reason since it can block your dodging without any telegraph. This is especially annoying since not all of them are like this. Like the other post said already, many descended midtextures are visibly clipping through the floor with software rendering (you can fix this by varying the brightness value or flat between the surrounding sectors). The ambush before the rocket launcher is a blatant example of hitscanners without cover, the computer in the center isn&#039;t tall enough to protect you. I wish there were some consistency about which doors are intractable since inert/onesided doors look the same as normal ones. Using spectres as soon as you enter a dark room twice in the same map feels kind of lazy. Both archviles feel poorly used since the first one is trivial since he can never get behind you and the other is just a test of patience since it can never get down the lift. I didn&#039;t realize there was a lift at first since there&#039;s no indication it&#039;s intractable and it looks the same as the surrounding walls. I feel like the revenant/imp ambush by the computer switches would work a lot better if the wall above you were shorter so the enemies could shoot down at you when they get caught against the wall. I have no idea what the switch before the blue key lift is for since it seems like you can and should safely ignore it. The lost souls in the end room feel completely pointless since you can just kill them before you hit the switch, I&#039;d honestly just remove them since the fight&#039;s hard enough anyway. You can also softlock yourself if you ride the perpetual lifts in that room up and jump over the wall.

The visuals in the map are unpolished, I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d use a high quality texture pack like Otex if you aren&#039;t even going to align your textures (not just aligning your similar textures to each other but also aligning seams of the textures with the edges of geometry. Otex was designed from the ground up for this, I&#039;m not sure why so many people don&#039;t bother). Using a combination of stock and Otex also tends to look incongruous, you can sometimes get away with it but it shouldn&#039;t really be necessary given the latter&#039;s comprehensiveness.<br>This probably comes off as a scathing review but I&#039;d like to stress that none of these things ruin the map, and I liked many of the ideas present even if the execution was flawed.

Even if you can infer something about the level design from looks it will always be liable to misunderstanding.

But as RAM prices fell and the hardware was more consolidated it got a lot cheaper to produce.

When Shoichiro Irimajiri took over as CEO of Sega of America after Kalinske he quickly realized how mismananged the US branch was and how much the financials were being misrepresented.
