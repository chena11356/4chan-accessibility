It seems to be able to play back audio samples. The weird midi-music system it has seems to be horrible. Games run at 5-10FPS. Most of the games for this system look partially broken or completely broken. It is still an evolution over the tiger electronic games.

Personally, I feel that the only games that have ever tried to imitate Resident Evil are its own series, and Dino Crisis 1. This is even debatable, as truthfully the only REAL survival horror games, as in games that both combine survival AND horror, without going down the more action heavy route, are RE1, REmake, and Dino Crisis.<br><br>Back to the subject though, you&#039;ll notice all of REs knock-offs barely ever tried to imitate its style. Even Silent Hill, its greatest rip-off, is absolutely nothing like Resident Evil. It has virtually no item management, and ammo is not scarce at all. Most of the games just try to rip off its camera angle and let you shoot monsters. But how many tried to copy the Mansion, or added in interesting, well-thought backtracking? How many are actually scarce on ammunition, or force you to really strategize how you go through each room? It just doesn&#039;t exist. I&#039;m not sure if Resident Evil was just that good, or the developers were just flat out lazy and all of the clones were cash grabs.

Most games can be shrunk to fit on a &quot;standard&quot; capacity CD without removing anything but unused space. Most of what can&#039;t will fit on a larger capacity CD, which are easily obtainable by any adult with an IQ&gt;70. There are not so shitty scene releases that compress content using more efficnet systems than the original and have negligible loss in quality. Some discs contain content that&#039;s not part of the game, not used by the game, and can be removed/moved to another disc without affecting the game in any way. In reality there are only a handfull of games where this is a real problem.<br>Using an ODE should be less complicated than burning discs, and not much more expensive if at all.

They would let people try the game out if you asked. I would rent the game, but never owned it. I owned SMB1, SMB3, and SMW, but never SMB2. Super Mario Bros. 2 did stand out as being a little different from the other games in the series. As a kid, I thought SMB3 was a step backwards from SMB2 in many ways. Ni selectable characters, no being able to pick up anything and throw it. Though the game did add the ability to pick up some objects. But at the same time, I never really suspected that it was a different game. because Zelda II on the NES was different from the first Zelda as well. Plus Nintendo did a good job adapting the characters from SMB2 into the Mario cannon.

Doki Doki Panic did look better overall, and wasn&#039;t geared towards a hard mode. Localising it was the best thing to do. It was a game made by EAD. Also, because Doki Doki Panic was part of a special event in Japan, Nintendo did not own the characters. They did re-release Doki Doki Panic in Japan as Super Mario Bros. USA on cartridge.

I just finished this mediocre test of patience, and I have some thoughts about it that are probably gonna piss the fanboys off. <br><br>Yeah I know this is a beloved game and all, but I\u2019m here to tell you that title has not been earned.<br><br>First off, I have to talk about the idea of difficulty for the sake of difficulty. This is objectively bad game design, as it doesn\u2019t allow the player to meaningfully overcome challenges in a controlled manner. The difficulty of this game spikes incredibly after the first world when all of a sudden they throw this fucking mine cart mechanic at you, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to control.<br><br>Second, there\u2019s literally no reason for any of the levels. There\u2019s nothing to be gained from any of them, no sub plots, no actual point to donkey Kong and diddy infiltrating factories or driving a mine cart down the rails of an abandoned mine. What\u2019s my motivation for the levels?<br><br>Third, bonuslevels? I don\u2019t get anything for completing them? Not like a new weapon or ability or anything? What\u2019s the point? To watch the completion percentage number go up. Okay???<br><br>Fourth, speaking of, donkey and diddy don\u2019t learn anything from their adventures. No new abilities, no character development, no extra knowledge that unlocks paths in the levels, they just stay the same the whole time. <br><br>Fifth, I can only get hit once!?!! I\u2019m a giant gorilla, the king of the jungle, and I get taken out by TOUCHING A BEAVER??? Makes no fucking sense. They could have at least included a health bar. The one hit shit is nonsensical and only exists to add artificial difficulty. <br><br>Sixth. Running and jumping in every level. I can roll too. No actual attacks though. Again, king of the jungle, I should be able to rip a man in half with my bare hands, but I\u2019m stuck doing gymnastics. <br><br>Seven, funky kong could have dropped me off at k rool right from the start. Making all of the levels pointless.
