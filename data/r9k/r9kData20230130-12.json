If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

He relented and backtracked a bit when I got upset when he said my IQ was probably in the 90s, saying it could be in the 100s instead and that IQ doesn&#039;t measure every facet of intelligence anyway. He said that he had faith Centaur would do a push-up after fighting with him for days. He defended me in September. He never seemed to hold very long grudges even after I was horrible to him in arguments, despite the fact that he would have been justified to do so. I liked when he told off that one anon for making fun of someone&#039;s speech skills. The fact that he suppresses his sadistic tendencies is a good thing in itself, but I gained a greater appreciation for that when he said that he doesn&#039;t really enjoy much of anything. Stopping yourself from being mean is one thing, but to stop yourself from doing basically the only thing in the world that brings you happiness... yeah, that&#039;s pretty noble.

For one, I know that I have a lot of expectations placed upon me to be perfect. This can feel very overwhelming at times and make me feel like I&#039;m not good enough. I also feel pressured by society to be a certain type of person. This can be very stressful for me as I often feel like I&#039;m not living up to what people expect from me.

I think the most important thing is to remember that I can only do my best and that it&#039;s okay to make mistakes. When I feel like I&#039;m under too much pressure, I usually try to take a step back and focus on what&#039;s important to me. I also try to let myself feel whatever I&#039;m feeling and not push it away. Sometimes it helps to talk to someone about what I&#039;m going through, or just to take some time for myself. Sometimes I like to take a bath or go for a walk or spend time with a friend who makes me feel calm.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your favorite candle scent</span><br>I love the scent of flowers.

Pena-Marin and Bhargave make heavy use of a research method known as &quot;meta-analysis&quot;, that is, examination of data from multiple independent studies of relevance. The citation of priorly published research supports the thesis of Pena-Marin and Bhargave without the need to entirely conduct their own research from the ground up. The implications of the studies used by Pena-Marin and Bhargave tend to point towards a general idea that the symbolic association of a &quot;rounded&quot; number (such as 20, instead of 19.79) causes a viewer to store an association with such a number in their semantical memory. The implication here is that aesthetic appearances, even those of numbers, have an effect on the mind of the consumer. </span><br>What one can draw from these conclusions, in a business/marketing setting, is the pricing of items, along with nutritional content, volume, etc. can be subtly and deliberately labeled in such a way to entice consumers into purchasing it. For example, &quot;Monster Energy Zero&quot; energy drinks are labeled as having &quot;zero sugar&quot;. The name, &quot;Zero&quot; also seems definite in its statement that it is null of any &quot;unhealthy&quot; ingredients. Of course, the fine print is that a can of Monster Energy Zero is in fact, 10 calories. Continuing with the theme of caffeine (and the research paper), many caffeinated energy drinks use rounded numbers to list the milligrams of caffeine per can: 130mg, 150mg, 200mg, etc. A rounded number, such as one ending in zero, has some evidence to show influence on how long the effects of the caffeine will last", "filename": "1635874045837", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674882911258492, "time": 1674882911, "md5": "CacvPyo3ivDpQdYMGgcZLQ==", "fsize": 62421, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 71996298, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:39:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71996115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71996115</a><br>Enjoy your sendoff<br>remember it&#039;s not being disappointed by your new city you&#039;re just coming down off the drugs <br>But whatever if you want to interpret that as being homesick it&#039;s your body", "time": 1674884342, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 71996360, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:46:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71996053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71996053</a><br>According to studies, up to once a month if you do everything perfectly, that includes doses and not overheating, and you&#039;re probably not doing everything perfectly.<br><br>So once every two months sounds better.<br><br>Reminder that if you have a comedown, this means you fucked up and possibly harmed your brain.

MDA is a full blown psychedelic unlike MDMA, albeit the headspace is incredibly light comparatively to something like LSD or mushrooms. its obviously much more like MDMA than either of those drugs, but it is also dose dependent for how trippy it gets, in my personal experience anything above 150mg of MDA would be a little too psychedelic to be in public on, but something like 80-120mg would be good for clubbing. the only stipulation is if you don&#039;t know how sensitive you are going to be to MDA, i would try it first in a controlled setting to gauge how much you want to take. you might need much more than me, i&#039;m pretty sensitive to psychs. also my experience with dose is skewed though, cause i&#039;ve only ever taken MDA while also smoking stupid amounts of weed so keep that in mind if you are or aren&#039;t smoking any weed. another note about dose, i was taking MDA made from sassafras, not any pure chemical acetone washed clear crystals or whatever. drink a small amount of alcohol to kill the psychedelia while keeping the empathogenic effects works good for me, keep it in mind if you are open to drinking while on it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it like MDMA but longer?</span><br>it didn&#039;t last any longer than regular MDMA for me, might have been shorter even. <br><br>taking MDA there sounds fun. go for it imo", "time": 1674933028, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72002367, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)14:10:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72002347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72002347</a><br>I live in a third world country that also happens to be in Western Europe", "time": 1674933033, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72002384, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)14:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72002367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72002367</a><br>oh i see that sucks. the usa is basically all legal now probably will take forever over there.", "time": 1674933200, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72002412, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)14:16:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71999147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71999147</a><br>MDA is very euphoric and hallucinogenic. 6-APB or its analogs are also an option<br>if you would like to be euphoric and hallucinate, i recommend just mixing two different drugs that specialize in those. like cathinones + dissos or psychs.", "time": 1674933390, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72002441, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)14:18:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "anyone that knows about shrooms:<br>whats the best tek for a beginner? is pf-tek still the go to?

I&#039;m in college and adderall has been my vice. I tried convincing myself originally that I only am using it as a study-aid but after experimentation with masturbating everytime I take adderall I can&#039;t help but have an 8+ hour masturbation session. It is not mentally enjoyable, and hardly physically enjoyable either, but it&#039;s almost impossible to stop. Even when I had deadlines, important calls, or even plans with friends I&#039;ve had to cancel, or reschedule because I was stuck masturbating on adderall. The orgasm is incredible though it&#039;s like nothing I&#039;ve ever experienced before. The sheer amount of cum that shoots out of your penis is overwhelming itself. The orgasm in my opinion is what a female orgasm must feel like: the slow rise and constant up and down sensation of arousal, until you reach the point where you feel the bottom of your penis start to fill up like a syringe, and then ejaculation sends a shiver down your entire body for a good 30 seconds, or until you&#039;ve finished cumming. Like I&#039;ve said I&#039;ve had 8+ hour sessions of just masturbating on adderall instead of studying and the next day my dick is bruised and swelled. It&#039;s not something you want to do, but you just can&#039;t stop. I&#039;ve literally held in my shit and piss because I was masturbating for hours causing a immense pain during and after masturbating, but there&#039;s just no escaping the jack it&#039;s honestly horrifying and soul crushing realizing you&#039;ve passed your deadline for turning in an assignment you haven&#039;t worked on because you just couldn&#039;t stop masturbating.", "time": 1674963262, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008438, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:35:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hopefully bought some 4f mph from an ad from a post here almost 2 weeks ago and it is not fucking here yet. dropped 300 on it, where the fuck is it? all I have is gay ass kratom and I cant play videogames on that.<br>literally fucked up my entire weekend, fuck you.<br><br>I have a little stockpile of something a lot stronger too but I cant do that anymore I dont know why im keeping it should probably throw it out. fuck you for making me stare temptation in the face. fucking send the shit.", "time": 1674963337, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008511, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:42:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72008438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72008438</a><br>What kind of ad lol<br>I bought $300 of it but it turned out shit waste of money, nothing but anxiety", "time": 1674963775, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008542, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;shrooms last too short</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;acid lasts too long</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2ci is impossible to find</span>", "time": 1674963981, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008579, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:51:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71997115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71997115</a><br>i cant look at spindly naked tree branches without thinking about heroin <br><br>hhwereewwwww<br>wwrrrRRrr<br>HHHgghRRREEWWWwh <br><br>biyyyYeewww..... shhhrrooooosh", "time": 1674964285, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008648, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:59:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995197</a><br>I did 30mg Adderall and 3.5g of I think golden teacher, and the 2 definitely synergize. I was planning on studying for my Networking class taking the adderall first, but I usually get sick after taking adderall, so I thought taking the mushrooms would ease my nerves and let me drink water because not drinking enough water is usually what gets me sick. As soon as the mushrooms kicked in I was not in the same space it&#039;s almost as if my entire room turned into a painting things were much thicker and they were running like a river, I felt as though my skin itself were cold and thick just like I paint and looking in the mirror felt as I had been framed like a painting. I have done acid plenty of time, but mushrooms have this completely different trip. I don&#039;t know if it was due to the adderall, but my mushroom trip was very relaxing I felt as though I was in control the entire time where as with acid it feels like an overwhelming roller coaster ride that never ends and you&#039;re at the mercy of. There is also an intense body element to the trip I felt very warm inside my body almost as if I was fire it was very strange, but strangely nostalgic and comforting. I just had an overwhelming sense of euphoria, but not artificial like MDMA where you know it&#039;s going to end when the drug ends, but truly I felt at peace on this trip. My most intense part of the trip was when I was just laying in my bed and I closed my eyes and I began to feel as if I was a log cabin, or all things in my mind I can associate with a log cabin where felt in my body. I felt like I was the fire in the fireplace, the wood of the structure, the smoke stack coming from the chimney. <br><br>This combination is top tier definitely need to try again, and I just want to wish you well on your trip as well. <br><br>P.S.

ODSMT is a stimulating opiod, even at higher doses. Tolerance/dose plays no role, it&#039;s the inherent nature of the drug. Keep your doses below 100 mg, that were problems start to happen. Don&#039;t use daily (obviously) if you want to avoid addiction (odsmt has supprisngly nasty withdrawals for such a mild opiod)l, and don&#039;t snort or smoke your odsmt, it&#039;s a waste.

Apply small amount of lube. Lay on your side, insert 1.5 cm deep (not deep at all, using a shower head to clean your asshole feels more violating, trust me). You actually dont want to go too deep and pass the internal sphincter, its a waste of product, you want it just deep enough wear it doesn&#039;t leak out. <br> Slowly depress the plunger leave the syringe in for a few seconds, and wait a minute or two to get up. The difference between this and oral dosing is astounding, but you have to have clean bowels so do it after sometime after taking a shit. This method is also completely safe as long as your taking a safe dose (50 mg is fine, but you should try 30 your first time to gauge potency).<br><br>Also, I have a feeling I spoke to you on Protonmail a week or two ago?, don&#039;t answer if that was you or not, but if it is your welcome.", "time": 1675034542, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72019612, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:23:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s going on with Kilos", "time": 1675034597, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72019623, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:24:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72019590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72019590</a><br>Avoid doing heroin altogether, retard.", "time": 1675034650, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72019626, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:24:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72019597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72019597</a><br>Forgot pic of 1ml oral syringe", "filename": "1mlsyringe-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3844, "h": 1468, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 47, "tim": 1675034665905309, "time": 1675034665, "md5": "B7jFPfuX1aPCER6prpWZIA==", "fsize": 1664115, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72019650, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:26:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72014159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72014159</a><br>Please someone tell me.

You have baby making sex, fuck her, breed her, cum ballsdeep inside your own mother and basically recreate the moment of your own creation. This thought alone already fucks me up because it&#039;s just way too crazy and what&#039;s even crazier is that this is actually possible. Your sperm can actually meet her egg and fertilize it, one of the eggs that gave life to you, you&#039;re impregnating your own mother. If you were normal, this seed would one day create her grandchild, but instead you&#039;re giving her a new child herself. How the fuck would this make a man feel?<br>And then you have a child, part you, part your mother. Like, does it call you dad and her mom? Does your mom call you honey?

Sure, there&#039;s looks and height and whatever, but the most powerful of those heuristics is the pair-bonding that comes with a man taking her virginity. Men experience pair-bonding as well, but that is channeled into their drive to protect and provide for the woman he is banging, not to &quot;stay loyal to her&quot;. The woman knows that if she sleeps around, she risks getting pregnant by sperm that may be inferior to her husbands, or even if the other man is superior, she knows she will be abandoned by her husband and likely the other man as well. I abhor casual sex as well, but the ideal system is one man with multiple wives. For the majority of men, they will have to be saddled with monogamy, but for the men who have achieved far beyond the others, their efforts should be rewarded. A man&#039;s value has nearly infinite potential, and so there is a neat threshold that once crossed, no woman could ever provide &quot;equal value&quot; by simply being a woman, so it follows that for the man&#039;s value to match up to his mate, he should have multiple mates.", "filename": "naturalistic fallacy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 556, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1675048516273938, "time": 1675048516, "md5": "1kXgyQvMYMpfrLSNU5W1pQ==", "fsize": 58697, "resto": 72018436}, {"no": 72022681, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)23:04:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I could try and justify it more, but the fact is the thought of dating a non virgin is revolting, so I won&#039;t do it.

Being able to talk about your worries, bad thoughts and feelings is important - for both parties. And being able to listen to them and reassure them is also important for both parties. Beyond that as someone else said morals are partly relevant, she obviously can&#039;t think sleeping with a dozen people is fine because that&#039;s just not going to work. She has to be able to listen to and accept opinions on most normal things even if she doesn&#039;t agree with them and not throw tantrums or decide to not want to be together, which is something all people need to be able to do. Obviously opinions on each others behaviour do not have to be accepted if its like &quot;its my opinion i should be able to spend all our money and fuck 30 people&quot; or whatever, but on politics, world issues, entertainment, racial issues, idk whatever ordinary shit that doesn&#039;t actually matter to the relationship.<br>And the last is probably expectations and goals in life.

Still have toum, an arab mayonnaise using garlic and lemon instead of eggs. And hummus leftover from the other night but most people know what that is, one bean dip made of garbanzo beans, garlic, lemon, and sesame seed paste. Pita was bought from a med bakery that gets bread shipped in from a state 10 hours away. <br>Maybe I&#039;m thinking mexican because of all the cumin but it would be better spicy. I added cayenne to the marinade and again on the skewers just before grilling this try but there was still no heat. Probably have to coat it in the stuff since I killed my capsaicin receptors somehow. Or maybe use something spicy in the marinade but cayenne is all I can usually find. The hummus was under salted somehow despite nervously following the recipe. Experience suggests most recipes either over salt or don&#039;t tell the brand of salt or use volumetric measurements of ultra light feather salt. Garlic could stand to be a little more prominent too, but I&#039;m quite pleased with the first try of making hummus. It made a lot and the texture is better than the store bought stuff, price is actually a bit cheaper than buying store bought too. <br>As a general rule I triple garlic when looking at recipes but seeing as the toum called for a heaping cup of peeled garlic to three cups of oil I thought I&#039;d try it mostly as written. For the first time ever it was something that actually tasted like garlic using just the suggested amounts, so I don&#039;t plan to alter it further. Only change I made was not adding the water because that sounded fucking dumb. <br>https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/s<wbr>hish-tawook/<br>https://www.seriouseats.com/traditi<wbr>onal-toum<br>https://www.seriouseats.com/israeli<wbr>-style-extra-smooth-hummus-recipe<br>Picrel is the pita I bought.

Just to clarify it has become a shell of its former self because the transition to HD combined with even just voice acting in combat has forced them to gut playable unit rosters and move lists, and the animation quality can be really inconsistent.", "time": 1674905962, "resto": 71996250}, {"no": 71998481, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:40:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71998468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71998468</a><br>Have you heard of Chess?

Last year I was getting my internet upgraded so I ended up not having any for two weeks. Installed a bunch of modern games that I happened to have amassed over the years and never played. Most were utter dogshit. I liked Bioshock 1 and 2 okay as shooters with slight rpg elements. Played them years ago. But Infinite was genuinely terrible. I don&#039;t know how anybody who isn&#039;t mentally retarded can consider this GOTY material, or even passable. Every single thing about it is just executed horribly. Thankfully I also had a couple decent indie shooters installed. Project Warlock was a lot of fun and I ended up playing through it a few times over those weeks with different builds. Outside of the occasional collection of an old series I liked and indie stuff, I don&#039;t really even care about most games anymore. I don&#039;t seek out news from them or anything. 95% of it is going to be complete dogshit, and then a lot of that remaining 5% is going to be stuff that just isn&#039;t for me but is still decently made. There&#039;s just so little depth in the new stuff. The money goes into graphics and celebrity voice actors and figuring out how to make the gameplay as inoffensive as possible to as many people as possible. There&#039;s no creative vision to most of it anymore, not to mention the monetization issues. Just imagine if Chrono Trigger or Viewtiful Joe or .hack or anything like those tried to come out today.

Basically, if Grindr was more degenerate. It markets itself as a cruising app, rather than a hook up app and like Grindr where it shows you location based profiles this time instead of being a random grid of photos with vague distances (ft, miles) it&#039;s a live map feed! So when you make an account you get to see everyone nearby and they get to see you! If you&#039;re at your house it&#039;s not very difficult to guess which one you&#039;re at through the map since it&#039;ll ping you relatively close to your live location. Very neat stuff.
