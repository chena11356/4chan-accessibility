If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7.

If you trace emotions and feelings back to the time where they were first felt, often the more coarse ones are from when you were younger. A place to start may be with an anhedonia test (tons of freebie ones online) and with start placing your emotions and feelings on emotion wheels while you diary to help clarify what you are feeling and fill in the narratives. Errikson and Paiget place some degree of emotional development in their models so combining those with an emotion wheel is helpful. In most childhood developmental models, guilt\\shame comes before boundaries, so people who don&#039;t understand boundaries didn&#039;t make it past that stage.<br><br>One quick thing to consider is asyncrhonousness. My IQ is ~150, by the time I was 5 I had the cognitive development of a 9 year old and by 9 I was into my 20&#039;s. E.g. Little sheldon except instead of exceptionalism I got a horrorshow and got to play detective. Before working on my c-ptsd I was unable to differentiate between what guilt and shame, or understand the concept of boundaries because _severe_ abuse (like my dad throwing tantrums and breaking shit as a grown man infront of a baby due to me crying or not taking the bottle).

At some point they realize the world goes on and on ad seeminglg infinitum. In the same way, one day your ability to remember stuff switches on. You stop reacting to things like an animal through your amydala, and start using your hippocampus to remember and respond to stuff through narratives. Instead of crying when you call and there&#039;s a bit of pain, you analyze for a split second what just happened and if you are OK, comparing it to the past, do a self-diagnostic, then either get back up or cry depending on if you&#039;ve gashed yourself good or not. <br><br>One of the things that happens is when toddlers begin to socialize, everyone to them is their parent. Children first develop a sense of self (where do you start and end, and what do all of those sensations mean), then a sense of identity (e.g. the game mineral, animal, vegitable, when you learn identity you objectify things into an object then apply classifications to the object), with these identities applying to both themselves and everything around them. As identity becomes robust and a child is socialized they begin to apply boundaires to the identities to both identify opportunities and to maintain safety.

His muscles were growing at a healthy rate, albeit a very fantastical one.

Defined pectorals, a shredded six pack, and and a penis that could split even a Twi&#039;lek in two.

Once inserted, they both roared in pleasure and began rhythmically pumping. Within 30 seconds, both lycan mutants roared in orgasm.

Want to tell us your story? Here some tips to survive the wasteland, add your own if you want. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.<br><br>XOXO", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1671087978417136, "time": 1671087978, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ze-keikaku", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 8, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 71405180, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)02:08:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/r9k/thread/71392554#p71392554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71392554</a><br>STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river<br><br>XAXAXA", "time": 1671088111, "resto": 71405163}, {"no": 71405252, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)02:20:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71405163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71405163</a><br>Holy fuck kill yourself<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 any of your forced &quot;how is your days&quot;</span><br>I hope you die", "time": 1671088818, "resto": 71405163}, {"no": 71405955, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:01:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71405252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71405252</a><br>Projecting much?<br>I know you do not care about how someones day was or about your fellow man in general, which is, together with you inability to accept someones enjoyment of something you do not enjoy, one of the major reasons you are here and your life is miserable, but there are people who genuinely care, if only because they derive nourishment by sucking someones blood. <br>As such I remind myself to ask everyone who comes here how their day was.

Indoors, there is a drain in the floor. Most showers have temperature, spray pressure and adjustable showerhead nozzle. The simplest showers have a swivelling nozzle aiming down on the user, while more complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket. This allows the showerer to hold the showerhead by hand to spray the water onto different parts of their body. A shower can be installed in a small shower stall or bathtub with a plastic shower curtain or door. Showering is common in Western culture due to the efficiency of using it compared with a bathtub.

Before that, she told us that she had a memory of a specific street in Paris and she knew exactly what it looked like, with painters often painting away on the sidewalk and colourful houses or something like that (don&#039;t remember the details, but they were more precise than the idyllic description I&#039;m giving). She had never been to France though. I just assumed she saw it on TV and it stuck with her involuntarily, in her unconscious. I did not go with my parents as I hate travelling, but when they got back from Paris my mom insisted that she found that exact street easily as if living there all her life and that it looked exactly like in her memory.
