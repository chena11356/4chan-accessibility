If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the \neyes of the robot.<br>\n5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

Rest and tell us you atory. Need some advise or a shoulder to cry on, this is the place for you. Below some tips that may help you.<br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander<br><br>XOXO", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1671529454390388, "time": 1671529454, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ze-keikaku", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 71473112, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:45:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>XO", "time": 1671529552, "resto": 71473100}, {"no": 71473164, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I dont like socialising though.

Most other online political figures encapsulate themselves in echo chambers whereas Destiny is willing to have conversations with liberals, conservatives, fascists, communists, etc. and isn&#039;t afraid to speak about the tougher or more controversial issues that other people would typically sidestep. <br>2. I believe he&#039;s a pretty intelligent person (particularly for a Youtuber) who comes to his views in a relatively rational manner and not through some partisan ideological lens. Even if you disagree with a lot of his views, you can understand why he came to said conclusion. <br>3. He gets into A LOT of drama which makes for entertaining content.

For example, Fembot enthusiastically consents to sex with Chad, and then Chad pumps and dumps her so hard that she&#039;s traumatised by it. What would you think if Fembot could just call the cops on him, and tell them he pumped and dumped her and she no longer consented and for them to arrest him for rape? And if it ever seemed like Chad was going to leave you, you&#039;d have this card to pull to threaten him with rape charges.<br><br>I can&#039;t stand sluts, so I&#039;m not suggesting this out of sympathy, but I&#039;d just like to see Chad get fucked over. You&#039;d be protected for the most part from getting pumped and dumped so it&#039;s in your interest. And it&#039;s in my interest because the legions of women that are alpha widows would evaporate, and Chad or any other guy would be pretty much forced to commit to you.<br><br>I&#039;m not going to fuck you sluts anyway so there would be no risk in it for me. And the relationship environment is already completely fucked anyway beyond salvage. It may as well go full tilt at this point skewed even more in the favor of women. I really think women should be able to retroactively revoke consent. So how about it fembots?
