Wax strips are not good for that area anyway. Soft wax is only for arms, legs, and chest. Hard wax is what you want for groin and armpits, maybe cleaning up any small spots missed by strips.<br>It takes a little getting used to but for strips I use roll on wax warmer and cartridges. Starpil is the brand I use, not sure if there are any others that make roll on. It&#039;s much faster than using the popsicle sticks to spatula it on and you just pop the cartridge in the roller then swap cartridge out once it&#039;s empty. Just put the wax on and then put the strip on, leaving a little tail of the strip overhanging the wax so you have something to grab. Pull back in one sharp motion against the growth of hair. Legs and arms you don&#039;t feel, chest you very much feel. Legs and arms it mostly comes out easy. Chest takes a bit of muscle behind it and you&#039;ll have to go back over it again because it will probably let go of about half. They&#039;re way thicker and more firmly rooted. Self Brazilian is just plain hard and takes a little flexibility, you just get in various positions and go at it with hard wax. Hard wax you spatula on, twisting it around before applying until it&#039;s cool enough so it doesn&#039;t burn. You wait briefly and tap it every couple seconds. Once it feels and sounds right you flick the edge up, it&#039;s trial and error but once you get the, sense of it it&#039;s pretty easy, you do have some leeway in time. Opt for too soon over too late. Too soon just stretches and doesn&#039;t pull hair. Too late and it just breaks off in a bunch of tiny pieces, hurts, and takes longer while not removing hairs well. Otherwise it&#039;s exactly the same direction and motion as strip wax. <br>Strip wax is easier I&#039;d start there and do your legs. If you struggle with that practice more or maybe be willing to accept a less than perfect Brazilian. Legs are much much easier than Brazilian so if you struggle there it could be rough going.", "filename": "1649898960604", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 837, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1669426898434951, "time": 1669426898, "md5": "G10tDc3WeLVAdwul91iowg==", "fsize": 76065, "resto": 71131542}, {"no": 71132826, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)21:06:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;7113154</span><br>get your shit together and use wax nigger", "time": 1669428400, "resto": 71131542}], "last_modified": 1669428400}, {"no": 71131130, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)18:36:20", "name": "Chili", "sub": "oh my God", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;My dad and sister are arguing about politics</span><br><br>the vaccine is brought up<br> * my sister is very pro democrat<br> * my dad is rock hard republican<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He talks about how vaccines are really bad for you and mentions how his news source is Fox News</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she starts arguing about how the fox news channel is the most biast source ever</span><br><br>MFW shes vaccinated and got sick recently from a friend who had COVID<br>MFW listening to all of this in my room", "filename": "0d1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 502, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 184, "tim": 1669419380121302, "time": 1669419380, "md5": "rvHMKasqsMLyT4PGsCzy1Q==", "fsize": 52813, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "oh-my-god", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 35, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 30, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 71131931, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)19:48:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71131674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71131674</a><br>Anon, I didn&#039;t get the vaccine because I was wary of the production time, I never leave my house, and I wasn&#039;t in the highest risk group.

And I imagine I&#039;d peaches and nectarines side by side. And let&#039;s say peaches were more expensive (I don&#039;t know if they are, but I might notice). And I&#039;d think &#039;&#039;well that&#039;s a bargain for me. I suppose because many more people buy peaches instead. So it&#039;s their unwitting sacrifice that allows me to get some of them nectarines. Okej, I don&#039;t actually know if less demand would make them cheaper in this case. I think it is not so in most cases. But let&#039;s say they don&#039;t sell well and got discounted. Maybe that is true when they expect more demand than is met? No idea. Okej, so the point here is you need to say all this out loud to the person you&#039;re with or even a random person next to you or else they will think you&#039;re weird and unlikeable. But you will now think &#039;&#039;but I hate when people blather about nonsense!&#039;&#039; That&#039;s a fine point, but consider:<br>1. You&#039;re likely a bit asocial, so your opinion doesn&#039;t matter.<br>2. The damage for not doing this is far greater because people who don&#039;t talk obviously hate you and that&#039;s a pretty hateable trait. They&#039;re probably entitled and incompetent as well (at least I wish they were).", "filename": "059", "ext": ".png", "w": 1160, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 232, "tim": 1669405524498041, "time": 1669405524, "md5": "WjAFuPgi4edCo8Afv2IQhQ==", "fsize": 952099, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gotta-uhgot-to-start-making-random-observations", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 31, "images": 25, "omitted_posts": 26, "omitted_images": 20, "last_replies": [{"no": 71132306, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:18:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Miku is the worst quint, yes, thats right, I said it, hated her since day 1", "filename": "Kumagawa Screws", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 845, "h": 945, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669425501615830, "time": 1669425501, "md5": "KzMdEbLesRLfQy9EheJ+yw==", "fsize": 156411, "resto": 71128517}, {"no": 71132329, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71132306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71132306</a><br>Go hate the current thing somewhere else.", "filename": "ja53j6idxgv91", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2373, "h": 3451, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669425642126333, "time": 1669425642, "md5": "9SMDGrEUrQ1ovjkBwtIskA==", "fsize": 1514613, "resto": 71128517}, {"no": 71132353, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:22:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71132329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71132329</a><br>Nino is based, but you know me, I always had a sweet spot for violent tsunderes", "filename": "Tsundere", "ext": ".png", "w": 563, "h": 472, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1669425770769017, "time": 1669425770, "md5": "JZg5QmxZ3vwJgWJsMISthA==", "fsize": 237908, "resto": 71128517}, {"no": 71132379, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:24:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71132353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71132353</a><br>Are we just moving from &#039;&#039;the quiet shy girl secretly likes me&#039;&#039; to &#039;&#039;the outgoing popular girl secretly likes me&#039;&#039;?", "filename": "trfpfxgcqbv91", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 338, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1669425897038798, "time": 1669425897, "md5": "DKWKv3bwSobBYkHkTZhN0g==", "fsize": 43066, "resto": 71128517}, {"no": 71132435, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:30:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71132379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71132379</a><br>her popularity has nothing to do with it, she seems like a challenging and active woman, someone who would break the monotony of life, while a shy nerd would only annoy and bore the hell out of me", "filename": "Kumagawa D", "ext": ".png", "w": 595, "h": 497, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1669426237178575, "time": 1669426237, "md5": "kVKCLzX3kaW7+Hb4TzJvvA==", "fsize": 335282, "resto": 71128517}], "last_modified": 1669426237}, {"no": 71131597, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)19:19:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;reply to a thread</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no one else posts in the thread again and it archives</span><br>Just like real life.", "filename": "frog", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 976, "h": 850, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 217, "tim": 1669421998156360, "time": 1669421998, "md5": "VgMPmyFjYP3CAS23DKn8eQ==", "fsize": 59301, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "reply-to-a-thread", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 9, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 4, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 71132224, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:12:25", "name": "vamp ^.^", "com": "<a href=\"#p71132168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71132168</a><br>There are many threads that are interesing to post on but die pretty fast. <br>Anyone venting. 2 replies.
