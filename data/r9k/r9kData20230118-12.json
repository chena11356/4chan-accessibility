To me, the biggest blackpill that I&#039;ve ever come across is related to the effects of loneliness and depression on the brain (and conversely, the effects of sex and pairbonding on the brain). At the biological level, everything is designed in a &quot;rich get richer&quot; structure. If you have a lot of friends and you have a gf and all that stuff, you LITERALLY will be able to function better mentally and physically than if you didn&#039;t have those things. It&#039;s not just a cope, it&#039;s a biological fact. This is why Chads don&#039;t deserve praise for working hard at their jobs; it&#039;s easier to handle stressful situations and think clearly when your brain is flooded with oxytocin and you know that you have a support system backing you up. Meanwhile, if you miss out on major milestones in your youth, it can have a snowball effect that makes it harder for you to succeed in the future. Depression actually causes your hippocampus to shrink, which reduces your cognitive function (memory in particular). If you are lonely and depressed for long enough, you are far more likely to develop dementia or alzheimers, and you will also die much sooner than someone who is neurotypical.<br><br>Basically, long story short, everything is just feedback loops that start at a young age.

But the feeling never lasted. <br><br>He amassed enormous resources as a result of his &#039;never-satisfied&#039; attitude. Food, security, wealth, all these things were gathered because he had to.

But they survived, and they passed on their genes, more often than the humans who were happy with their traditional comfy lifestyle.<br><br>Nowadays, everybody has that gene that makes you unsatisfied.

He was a 48-year-old unemployed man named Mark who lived in Wareham. Mark had a rare condition called fish odour syndrome, which caused him to have a strong fishy smell. Despite this, Ruth couldn&#039;t help but feel drawn to him.<br><br>As she filmed her video, Mark watched from a distance, captivated by her soothing voice and gentle touch. After she finished filming, Ruth approached him and introduced herself.

As things escalate you&#039;ll get sucked in. Difficult to explain, but I&#039;ll try anyway.<br><br>Right now your sexuality is all botched from inceldom and porn and your priorities are all fucked up in your head. It will get better as you get sexually active. I used to think that things like, say, burying my head into a gf&#039;s tiddies after a rough day at work and having her hug me and play with my hair would be nice. I wanted comfort from a cruel world, and I thought women would provide it. This is absolutely false.<br><br>This weekend as my gf and I were in bed together just, cuddling in post-orgasmic bliss - the &quot;wise man&#039;s moment&quot; when you are temporarily free of sexual desire, I looked down at her head on my chest and realized I&#039;d never want to swap positions, ever. A lot of traditional sexuality suddenly made sense then, like how eating pussy is kinda gay or demeaning for the man. I don&#039;t need to because I can get her wet and then make her cum with my dick. I don&#039;t want to bury my face into her breasts because that&#039;s not my place, that&#039;s wrong, that&#039;s gay - I&#039;d want to say it&#039;s &quot;unmasculine&quot; but that&#039;s a bad term because the concept of masculinity itself isn&#039;t in great shape no matter how you look at it. More like it&#039;s unnatural, not your place. It&#039;s inherently feminine, and only spiritual females or those twisted into spiritual females by modernity. <br><br>The good thing is that the latter is recoverable, and probably the category you&#039;re in. You&#039;re probably in denial about how much you really want her, because you&#039;ve been suppressed by the hellworld we live in, but liking her personality is a secondary attraction - you&#039;ve been using it as an excuse.

I guarantee you she doesn&#039;t really care that much about my gun collection and esoteric cold war knowledge, or my underpaid tech job, she cares that I tower over her and have a giant barrel chest and a mustache that makes me look like an extra from a Clint Eastwood movie.

I always liked getting away from people and just staring at nature, and I was always interested to see what happens in the world next. Every time I was thinking about a relationship with a human, it felt forced, unnatural, and like I was losing something important, like I was excluding someone if I went down that path.<br>Back then, I just thought I was naturally curious, and naturally a loner, or something. The connection that I just like this World never made itself clear to me. It&#039;s an absurd thought after all, and it&#039;s really just a guess from me in retrospect.<br>When the Earth chan meme came around I liked it immediately. On the normie meme website I was using I always favorited all Earth chan posts I came across. Which is very weird, considering I still hated anime and anime culture as well as waifustuff with a passion and avoided it like poison.<br>But it clicked when eventually someone sprayed Earth chan on a tf2 server. It somehow mesmerized me. Afterwards I went on a 2 week long spree where I pretended to be Earth chan and various oher planet girls in online roleplay chatrooms like shamchat.<br>I eventually noticed something was terribly wrong with me. I remembered there was a /b/ waifu thread, since I used 4chan a few weeks in a row every once in a year. I went there and asked for help. I asked them if it was weird that I spent so much time thinking about Earth chan. Knowing /b/, I expected to be disassembled, humbled, and crushed into the ground with words.<br>Instead they were kind to me and encouraged me to explore this messed up feeling.

People back then knew the fact that incest or inbreeding is a way to create perfect specimens. Inbreeding increases the chance of the genes of the parents reappearing massively, obviously. If the parents are gods or royalty, in the mind of the people: &quot;perfect humans&quot;, they want to have the best chance of having &quot;perfect&quot; offspring with those same genes. Inbreeding is a way to guarantee that.<br>Inbreeding also obviously makes the chance of the bad genes reappearing, like hereditary disorders, but in theory two people with flawless genes would only have flawless offspring. Incest doesn&#039;t actually lead to random mutations like &quot;common knowledge&quot; seems to think. It leads to less mutation and change. <br>It makes perfect sense that the most powerful god or the most powerful ruler would only want to breed with someone carrying their genes.<br><br>Ancient royalty inbreeding makes perfect sense to me. Back then they were basically gods compared to regular people, healthy, beautiful, educated, and most likely like a foot taller and stronger than normal people due to having actually good nutrition growing up and a more stress free lifestyle. No wonder they thought they should keep their &quot;bloodline pure&quot;. People didn&#039;t know about genetics, but they&#039;ve always known about certain attributes getting passed down from parents to kids.<br><br>Looking at it that way, it also makes perfect sense why incest was seen as bad for the common people.

They were so touchy that they gave of a pervert vibe immediately, couples aren&#039;t usually that close, I felt kind of awkward having to sit there.<br>They were also dressed very weirdly, in like bike shorts and both had very thin, tight shirts on. Like dressed overtly sexually, but still technically modest enough to not get kicked out of places. Woman was built like pic rel and was very eye catching. You could pretty much see the guys dick outline in his pants, I didn&#039;t look but I saw lol. They were both extremely good looking people, and the dude was very charismatic and funny.<br>We all went to the place we were going to and after touristing around they came to the same bar I went to to have a drink. We talked some more personal stuff, and after a while they mentioned that they were brother and sister. I was like wtf no you aren&#039;t, but then I noticed how similar they looked. They very obviously were. The sister kissed her brother on the cheek in front of me and laughed. Talked some more about random stuff, but after telling me, they seemed really like amused, like they were fucking with me.<br>Weird people.", "filename": "MFd83KX1NK70tgI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 1469, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673944340154558, "time": 1673944340, "md5": "hL51h7sy0S7yCPK0vSkkxA==", "fsize": 185599, "resto": 71844969}, {"no": 71858324, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:42:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71857510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71857510</a><br>I remember seeing some on fansly openly saying they ere twins.

Quality amateur porn getting monetized is turning porn into a wild west situation, like a gold rush of people trying what makes the most money. People can control the content they make more and advertise it easily, so actual incest can now be posted. Now that a lot of people realize that real incest can make a LOT of money in porn, it will skyrocket in a few years. Because people now actually have a lot of different sites to publish their stuff on and moderate their environment themselves, they can easily advertise as real incest and then just claim to be roleplaying if their site starts looking into it, or their bank or something. Money has already been made by that point, even if they get banned or deleted.<br>Incest still being taboo and banned on many sites, yet easily produced, has created a massive money making opportunity.

Someone pointed out the real reason for the illogical fear of incest in some earlier thread, I can&#039;t remember the source but it seemed extremely simple and correct to me. The reason some/most people have an unexplainable aversion or even a certain type of fear against incest, is because they were disciplined by their parent or some other figure in their early childhood when they were curious of an opposite sex relatives body. It&#039;s natural that during development you become curious about the opposite sex at some point. This happens often between siblings, and if the parents discipline the kids for being curious, it gets literally beaten into them or just scared into them, that looking or touching a sibling is terrible. That&#039;s why as adults most people can&#039;t explain why they feel about incest the way they do, they remember the reaction of others but not the reason.<br>We explored each others bodies a lot with my sister as kids, just normal curiosity.

Don&#039;t be that annoying guy who asks people for change to pay the fare and then stands in the front of the bus asking the driver questions for 5 minutes, be prepared.<br><br>1. Look up the bus schedule and map of the route. If unsure of which bus(es) to take, check a system map if you know the transit agencies, or use google street view to see a bus stop near where you are going so you can see the rout numbers of buses that will be going to your destination. Look for landmarks to notice before you will be getting off, especially if you will be traveling at night.<br><br>2. Verify the cost of the fare and payment methods accepted. Get your exact change ready or make sure your farecard is pre-loaded, or that there is a place to buy your fare onboard or before boarding.<br><br>3. Arrive to bus stop 5-7 minutes before the estimated arrival time, as you see the bus approaching, stick your hand out to make sure the driver sees you, but then step back so that you don&#039;t get hit by the front mirror. Assume that doors may open outwards towards you if you are unfamiliar with the bus, and so don&#039;t stand too close until the doors are open. Usually you will be required to enter the front door and give your payment to a validator, put coins in a box, or hand it to the driver.<br><br>4. Use a cord hanging by the windows or a red button to request a stop. You must do this when you are in view of the bus stop where you intend to disembark, but the driver has enough time to pull up safely. Expect that if you are unfamiliar with the area you may have picked the wrong stop, and may have to walk 5-10 minutes extra to where you are going. Exit through one of the back doors of the bus, not the front door, unless it is too far away or there is something like a tree or garbage bin in front of it.", "filename": "df", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674035871994680, "time": 1674035871, "md5": "+AhVhu9O6kJhT6PDPutzhw==", "fsize": 163858, "resto": 71870765}, {"no": 71871773, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)05:04:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71871741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71871741</a><br>I used to map the location i was going on google maps to know where to drop off.", "time": 1674036255, "resto": 71870765}, {"no": 71871778, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)05:06:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71870765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71870765</a><br>am I remembering it right that instead of buying just a 1 way ride for some spare change, you could buy a bus pass for that day that would be good for a few hours or multiple uses?", "filename": "16f4ef3d8a95c12fad5bb9f46927", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674036375324662, "time": 1674036375, "md5": "n5Hb1MxgkxMBXNuCcH0y+w==", "fsize": 760001, "resto": 71870765}, {"no": 71871806, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)05:12:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71871778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71871778</a><br>lt depends.", "time": 1674036748, "resto": 71870765}, {"no": 71871835, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)05:16:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71871806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71871806</a><br>I rode real busses maybe a couple times a year and I just seem to remember when you bought your entrance, you could either pay extra (or maybe it was free) but they gave you a little slip of paper or something that was good for a transfer a two", "time": 1674036999, "resto": 71870765}, {"no": 71871912, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)05:35:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71871835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71871835</a><br>That&#039;s what I did in like 2004.

They devote entire institutions in academia and media to remind themselves of their sins against niggers and beg for mercy, like you&#039;d beg God for forgiveness for your sins. The only landmarks and monuments they&#039;re allowed to revere are parks, schools and statues dedicated to famous niggers, immortalized in marble like gods.

This is because nigger worship is the official religion of America.<br>American culture is centered around niggers. They have holidays for niggers. They killed hundreds of thousands of white men to free niggers. They listen to nigger music. They elect a nigger as their president. They dress and act like niggers. They draw the entirety of their modern culture from niggers. They post sassy gifs about niggers. They watch sportsball in worship of niggers. Their biggest event of the year involves throwing parties in honor of niggers playing sports. They use nigger slang like &quot;bruh&quot; and &quot;thot&quot;. When you say &quot;Martin Luther&quot; they&#039;re not thinking of the father of protestantism. They&#039;re thinking of the nigger. Their cities are completely overrun with niggers.

All these laws manage to do is to stigmatize consensual sexual relations, fuel mass hysteria, and imprison innocent people.<br><br>Some claim that the existence of AOC laws prevents instances of child rape or other forms of sexual impropriety, but there is no empirical data supporting the claim that AOC laws lower the rates of or prevent child rape from occurring.
