I have noticed that things that generally glow in response to emotions are the eyes, belly button, nipples and vagina, and then things like whole body, hands, feet and so on glow just to glow most of the times<br><br>And as an example this picture, the mushroom loli is glowing very brightly, but not portraying any specific emotion while doing it, or in any kind of a state of alarm or arousal, telling us that in the case of this picture, the extreme glow is done just to make the place light up and provide light for seeing.", "filename": "blob https __waifus.nemusona.com_2b22a039-b141-4754-86b9-4d9c9a08e00d", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675508395556742, "time": 1675508395, "md5": "kXOAGIIrJgpQksRXMdwdjQ==", "fsize": 413472, "resto": 72089424}, {"no": 72091261, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:02:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve been pleasantly surprised with SEXO<br>cake love", "filename": "blob_https___waifus.nemusona.com_fda3d174-4fd7-427f-a387-9871f14bd447", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675508565664746, "time": 1675508565, "md5": "GLEObkwF/Eva7yqS+VouJA==", "fsize": 300274, "resto": 72089424}, {"no": 72091296, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72091261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72091261</a><br>Cakes are good, ol&#039;s too", "time": 1675508886, "resto": 72089424}, {"no": 72091301, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:08:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72091238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72091238</a><br>So sometimes its an indicator, other times its just a handy flashlight lol.<br>It makes sense, sometimes humans cry when they arent sad or even when theyre happy, so the colors they glow can also have nuisance like that too.

These advertisements where in popular media homosexuals are treated as normal, where it is a &quot;good&quot; thing to be homosexual, and a &quot;bad&quot; thing to be homophobic is a common occurrence, we will start to treat it as normal, and slowly it will make its way into your brain. I would like to refer to these advertisements as &quot;parasitical thoughts&quot;, which is a thought which eats away at your beliefs, it dulls your rationality, and it makes you question your personality. This can cause the victim to rapidly change personalities, oftentimes they will seem like a different person after affected by a parasitical thought, they will cut off relation with people who do not actively express approval of their new personality, and celebrate their &quot;coming out&quot; however, oftentimes they are not actually &quot;coming out&quot; but instead they are shutting away their real personality, their real feelings to replace them with something in which their new thought process will tolerate.<br><br>Homosexuality is unnatural as it defies the laws of nature. All living organisms are biologically programs to reproduce to continue their species, but homosexuality is a death-knell that condemns a species to entropy. Homosexuality is the single largest vector of disease among human behaviors. Homosexuals use drugs in record numbers and engage in unprotected promiscuity in record numbers. Both of these things result in exponential transmission of HIV/Hep C. Homosexuals paved the way for trannies, which are paving the way for pedos.

why are people so unquestioning when it comes to the things they love? people have become more and more like robotic automatons while the machines only become more human. im not sure if humanity will ever recover from this state of stupidity. it seems like were being programmed to be replaced as the only thing that makes us stand out from other life forms is being eroded, our abilities to change, adapt and specialize. most notably i would attribute this change to the production and consumption of short form content. something that doesn&#039;t allow people enough time to form an opinion after viewing. in a way, people are being conditioned to not form opinions of things that happen, an absence of mental autonomy that gives rise to NPCs.", "filename": "1460749188397", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 412, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 206, "tim": 1675513260779971, "time": 1675513260, "md5": "gjX/T4aWcb8zjRQechsMSg==", "fsize": 114175, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-people-living-in-the-world-everyone-seems-to", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 72091677, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:01:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;sluuuuuuurp glug glug&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;MHHHHH OH Chad!&quot;</span><br>*panting*<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Gettting you&#039;re dick all wet-*gags* and hard!!&quot;</span><br>*sluuuurrrp*<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;yeah, you ready too MHHHHHHH stick you&#039;re big dick in my tight little clit!&quot;</span><br>*shhhrrrraaaaaap*<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Oh Chad please fuck me!&quot;</span><br>That is the dialogue the woman you love is having with an aIpha male RIGHT NOW.<br>Thoughts?", "filename": "two-girls-two-balls-rg3fCP", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675512116359066, "time": 1675512116, "md5": "uTbfCpHqJNEm91DcP/ZOeA==", "fsize": 24338, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sluuuuuuurp-glug-glug", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 8, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 72091689, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:03:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72091677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72091677</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re </span><br>Ruined, I can no longer get off to this", "time": 1675512207, "resto": 72091677}, {"no": 72091691, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:03:36", "name": "Chud", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;love women</span><br>this is an incel faggot board my guy", "time": 1675512216, "resto": 72091677}, {"no": 72091697, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:04:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "stick you&#039;re big dick in my tight little clit", "filename": "1657128559521", "ext": ".gif", "w": 499, "h": 499, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675512289897610, "time": 1675512289, "md5": "iWBj0SrrPijzAmjqjR7S9A==", "fsize": 20317, "resto": 72091677}, {"no": 72091708, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:06:03", "name": "Chud", "com": "<a href=\"#p72091697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72091697</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;.gif</span><br><br>YSSM2", "filename": "apu (7)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1170, "h": 889, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1675512363060455, "time": 1675512363, "md5": "oLfaaDuYtVsdz6C8w/sxDw==", "fsize": 107949, "resto": 72091677}, {"no": 72091710, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:06:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72091677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72091677</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thoughts?</span><br>I think this was written by someone who has never, and will never, have sex.", "time": 1675512366, "resto": 72091677}, {"no": 72091712, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:06:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72091697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72091697</a><br>myspace rp kinda beat", "time": 1675512375, "resto": 72091677}, {"no": 72091781, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:17:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72091677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72091677</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re dick</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stick you&#039;re big dick </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in my tight little clit!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thoughts?</span><br>I think you&#039;re not only completely illiterate, but also completely clueless about female anatomy.<br>Given most of us are KHHV, I can kinda understand the latter, but being illiterate is a choice.", "time": 1675513078, "resto": 72091677}, {"no": 72091800, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)07:20:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I always love when someone says you&#039;re instead of your, it reads so cute and satisfying for some reason.

One I know it has to tie in with an odd thing I have going on where I&#039;ve always wanted to be an older woman. Like, even as far back as when I was a kid I remember wanting to be an older lady, and when I was a preteen/teen and first started masturbating (and ever since to this day) in my fantasies I am always like in my mid-30s. I don&#039;t know why. I just have always imagined myself as being that age, it turns me on more than imagining myself at the age I was/am. I really like young men like senior in high school/college age boys too.<br>I like the intimacy of it I guess, it always seemed so sweet to me. Mother and son already feels like one of the closest possible relationships two human beings can ever possibly have. There&#039;s a sense of security and tenderness I suppose. There&#039;s already no one on earth you could love more than your own child. Making a regular male partner happy is nice, sure, but in my observation, mothers just light up to see their boys happy. I imagine it as like a whole new level of fulfillment and warmth knowing you can be the one that makes him happy.<br>Power reversal is also kind of hot. Saying &quot;humiliation&quot; sounds almost wrong but that&#039;s the best word I can think of. Like, you do truly love him and all, but going from a position of authority to one day getting your insides wrecked by the same person you&#039;re supposed to have authority over I imagine is degrading and a bit embarrassing - but loving and comforting at the same time. I also like similar dynamics like older boss office lady getting bent by the young college intern boy, female teacher/boy student etc, but the mom/son dynamic is special because unlike those there&#039;s a really strong emotional element there.", "filename": "20230203_Camera_Gallery", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2912, "h": 1762, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 75, "tim": 1675439925563160, "time": 1675439925, "md5": "1hF+RfV+a1ANKmbLR+0e8w==", "fsize": 700811, "resto": 72078715}, {"no": 72079499, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)10:59:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72079478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72079478</a><br>pity sex for not being Chad", "time": 1675439942, "resto": 72078715}, {"no": 72079524, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:01:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72079430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72079430</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most of you have average to below average moms</span><br>that is true, so we just experience it vicariously thru anons that have hot moms and try to seduce them with various degrees of succes. retard.", "time": 1675440082, "resto": 72078715}, {"no": 72079529, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:01:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72079494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72079494</a><br>Just exclusively date younger guys.

I think sons are obligated to doggy style their moms in addition to mating press, you have to try and breed her from all angles.

I just don&#039;t umderstand how someone could be over 15 and still act like this. You didn&#039;t come here for advice, you just need some attention, which is fine, we all need it. But you have to work for it. Don&#039;t take the fucking pinkpill as you call it. 99% you&#039;re just gay. Accept yourself and embrace the man within you. You are lucky you were born a man. There are many kind, loving gay men who are looking for a healthy relationship. My guess is you never actually experienced love, and my advice for most people like you is that they need to experience a healthy relationship. If you ever do get in one, don&#039;t be a pussy prick like you are here, you have to respect eachother&#039;s opinions, and bring out the best in eachother. My guess is you lacked friends your whole life, because the more people you interact with, the more normal you are. I would suggest you start listening to some music, try something older, since the messeges were clearer and you can hear the manliness. Start exercising and living a healthier lifestyle. I know you don&#039;t want to, i didn&#039;t want to either, but you will feel much better, and after many sessions you&#039;ll come to enjoy it. I see you&#039;re skinny, it will be easy to build an aestethic body, you just need some sun along with the exercise. The hair is aight, but i&#039;d go for something shorter. Not the classic guy short, but something that is considered long, but it shows off your face, looks better and is easier to maintain.
