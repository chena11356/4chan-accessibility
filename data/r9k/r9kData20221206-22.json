If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3.

I&#039;ll withhold any sort of moral evaluation here as it is not my place.<br>I think you acted with the intent to help someone you love. I&#039;m sure it must have been, and still is, painful to think about this. I suspect you will have the foresight not to do this anyway, but I would highly advise against ever sharing the details of this with him under any circumstances regardless of guilt. I say this not necessarily because it will preserve your relationship, though it will, but because this knowledge could be legitimately traumatizing for him. It would not be for you or I, but for him it could very likely be, especially because you made this decision for him. I trust that you saw no other options and did this to prevent serious harm.<br>Again I cannot say this was the right thing to do, but in your situation and without any alternative but to let him starve, I would hope that I could find the strength to save the person I love. Be careful with how easily you pass this judgement, but I&#039;m fully willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that the situation was turning dire and were out of choices. I&#039;m sure that doing this hurt you even though you were glad that he wouldn&#039;t starve. I am sorry that you had to make this decision, I truthfully don&#039;t know if it was yours to make, but I believe you did so out of compassion. I hope that you will not have to make it again, but I understand that to allow his death or irreversible harm when it could be prevented is unthinkable. I could not choose that option, ever.
