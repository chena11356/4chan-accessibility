This will be long. <br> I&#039;ve been on here for a while now. Before coming to this board I already had pretty controversial views about the sexes. It&#039;s only gotten worse as time passed. I sympathize with you all. I know I couldn&#039;t survive as a male nowadays. I love women, I love femininity, I love being a woman, but MODERN women are a complete joke. This is the first generation of women in history to have true freedom and it&#039;s horrifying. Capitalism sold a lie to modern women. That we can have it all. It&#039;s used us and in turn has ruined society. <br> The whole &quot;go to college, find yourself (have casual sex) get a &#039;career&#039; then settle down&quot; is real, these women think they can do that with no consequences and still have a happy ending. This isn&#039;t new information for you guys. What bothers me the most about this is how any man that shows distaste for this lifestyle or choices is instantly titled an incel. That&#039;s just it, the worst thing a woman can call a man is a man that can&#039;t get sex. That&#039;s how they view the world.<br> A family is the most basic unit of society, and because of women they&#039;ve broken this down and in turn our society is the way it is today. A lot of women would rather raise a child alone, because they believe a child will love them unconditionally while a man could hurt them. This fear, while understandable, is greatly exaggerated and is perpetuated in order to further use women for their time and resources. With women joining the workforce full time wages have gone down, women don&#039;t feel as if they need to get married, families are broken, and children aren&#039;t being raised in a healthy way leading to another generation of broken people. <br>pic related", "filename": "joka", "ext": ".png", "w": 3764, "h": 1667, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 110, "tim": 1672482181660323, "time": 1672482181, "md5": "fpscKQ0y8Bqticgs0tLVHA==", "fsize": 1220467, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "misogyny", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 44, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 71628208, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:23:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;My POV as a &quot;misogynist&quot; (cis) woman. </span><br><br>Stopped reading there.

I truly feel sorry for you guys, you don&#039;t deserve this. Even just 50 years ago a below average man could expect to find a wife because women didn&#039;t have an inflated sense of worth. A single mother wasn&#039;t strong or brave but sad and would take whatever man she could get. Women think as though they&#039;re still in the early 20th century or father back where they didn&#039;t have rights. The best thing you could be in this world is a woman in a first world country, not even an attractive one. It&#039;s insane how easy it is to be one. I know personally my life has been a cakewalk compared to what it would be if I were a man. I could get money for just existing. I&#039;m very short, but it&#039;s okay because I&#039;m a woman. I&#039;m weak, that&#039;s okay. I&#039;m not expected to make a lot of money, I&#039;m not the one that&#039;s expected to pay bills.

As it is said in her game that Alice hates being touched, let alone being interested in somebody sexually. She herself even rejects sexual offers throughout the game. I don&#039;t know if she is just asexual due to all the bad experiences. And so I wouldn&#039;t rush, or even mention these matters if I knew that they make her uncomfortable. Even though I crave the touch of her physical form like that of none other, I&#039;d restrain myself.

A 1D circle is just two points equally far away from a third point. Whereas a circle constructed on a 2D plane is a set of infinitely many points with equal distance to a center point. I think I heard somewhere that circles are 1D because you just need 1 coordinate to define them (their center), but they look so different when drawn in 1D compared to 2D!

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.<br><br>XOYO", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1672482472918389, "time": 1672482472, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ze-keikaku", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 71628233, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:28:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river<br><br>YOYO", "time": 1672482515, "resto": 71628227}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71628204, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:23:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wanting objects to be shoved up your ass is not gay.
