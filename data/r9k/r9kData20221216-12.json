My experience is during the initial Beanie Babies, Pokemon, and I forget what other craze at the time. I also experienced malls before then slightly, but the earliest I remember is arcades, random toys, music stores, etc. Well, on a Friday they used to always be packed with people, the same goes for Saturday or Sunday. The last few times I have been in one that I have also went to as a kid they were completely dead. I can still see so many rows of tables and people trying to sell Pokemon cards, etc. Hear all of the sounds, remember the stores, etc. It&#039;s strange how with time things go away, due to something else appearing and devouring everything.", "time": 1671193438, "resto": 71412888}, {"no": 71420234, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)07:28:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71418955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71418955</a><br><a href=\"#p71419089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71419089</a><br><a href=\"#p71420213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71420213</a><br>The weirdest thing to me nowadays (from around 2012 to now, because before then in my area it wasn&#039;t as bad with it) is how when you go anywhere in general all you always see is a bunch of people glued to a phone and none of them are enjoying the other activity they&#039;re doing.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go outside</span><br>On a phone<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At a grocery store</span><br>On a phone<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At another store</span><br>On a phone<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Going for a walk in nature or in general</span><br>On a phone<br><br>The list can go on.

Obviously white men would be expected to excell in relationships but since youre probably a shitskin you probably can&#039;t understand any concepts like per capita. Furthermore, humans and especially women are subject to conformity (whiteness is the dominant aspect so if one wants to be successsful they should be as close to whtie as possible) The same exact phenomena plays out in other non white countries. Saudis like Saudis in Saudia Arabia, Han Chinese like Han Chinese in Han China, Mongolians like Mongol Chinese in Inner Mongolian China. Of course an Indian is going to have a problem seducing his idealized white women fetish object in western europe or the US. White men are the majority so most women will skew towards white men. If you have a problem with this theres nothing you can do about it except move to an area favoring your ethnicity.

The only time I feel better about that event is when I remind myself that I live hundreds of miles away from my hometown in a big city, and there are hundreds and hundreds of cultures out there, not just the culture of my past and of the despicably evil girl who led me on when I was a young teen. NOW: with that being said, I have never been outside of the country. I am basing this off of just my experiences with women from other countries.

But at the same time, if too many people want to get in on shorting gamestop, it will at some point become profitable to bet the other way, on the off chance gamestop turns things around.

That said.<br><br>I think you&#039;re angry because you&#039;ve been a victim of the delusion that schools and families and the system in general maintains - that money is made through hard work. It isn&#039;t. Money, huge amounts, can be made and lost in split-second decisions, and in thousands of ways, quite apart from working for a salary that yields money far, far less of what your time is actually worth. The reason is: money is a fugazi. Always has been. It is artificial, has no substance, and is only symbolic of power at most. Anyone who keeps &#039;employees&#039; that they pay for working for them, is really a slave owner, because a slave today is someone deluded into this idea that money is &#039;real&#039;, and that work &gt; money. Therefore they work hard for their slave-drivers, I mean employers, kept in this delusion about the reality of money.<br><br>Does work make anything? Yes, but not money. It creates whatever goods and services are yielded by it. So you work in a car factory, let&#039;s say, you aren&#039;t making money, you are making cars or car parts or whatever. That is the actual and genuine fruit of your labour. The money is completely separated from your work and the only reason why you are paid $25, $50, $600 or $20000 an hour is... NOTHING. IT IS A COMPLETELY ARBITRARY DECISION MADE BY THE SYSTEM TO PAY YOU THAT MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND LABOUR IN YOUR SECTOR. There is nothing measurable we can actually look at and say, ah yes, this car factory worker&#039;s labour is worth, in his sector, rank, and country, x amount per hour. It&#039;s influenced by a lot of other factors, but taken together they are all constructed through people&#039;s minds.

The end of their shipping business, once they finish burning through the labor pool, will be an epic conflaguration of data being fed to the execs about how staff are making billions of dollars of product disappear, same as happened to wal-mart when they tried to go all part-time back in 08 and didn&#039;t realize 4x as many hands on goods and trying to subsidize your business on the backs of asset stripping labor meant 10x as much theft.

Non incels on this board are far more likely to hate women, due to actually having bad relationships, which is by definition something an incel has never had.<br><br>Women here are treated badly because, a lot of the things they post are frankly retarded. A substantial amount of the &quot;women&quot; posts here are not made by women at all, but trolls. Other posts are made with no consideration at all for the audience, an example: &quot;Why is my boyfriend....&quot; or &quot;I can NEVER get a boyfriend...&quot; and then proceeds to ignore the 50 men that ask for her contact info. Imagine if I went around asking in the Mumbai slums &quot;Hey, can someone tell me if I should invest more in blue chip stocks? I have $40,000 and...&quot; It takes a special kind of arrogance to ask such a thing, an arrogance that rightfully angers people. Other times women here purposefully antagonize the men that post here, making vituperative misandrist remarks on par with a typical incel rant. Yes, there are girls that are nice, but the truth is that even they are often just parasitically using the men here to feed their egos. Once they&#039;ve had their fill they leave them out to dry. People constantly complain about getting ghosted or dropped at a hat by the girls that post here for no reason at all. I myself have only added a single girl and have been ghosted by her with no fanfare.

I won&#039;t bother speaking on behalf of anyone else, they can do that themselves, so anything said as &quot;we&quot; is mostly speculation based on my own personal thoughts and experiences.<br>I think a decent amount of woman hate stems from the fact that we like women too much. You&#039;ll never find a more scathing critic of something than someone who ultimately likes that thing. Go on /k/ and you&#039;ll find every manner of trash talk about brands of guns for being wrong, same with video games on /v/. They like these things, and they ultimately like them enough that they see all the flaws with them and abhor them for not being perfect as they should be. So in short, I think it&#039;s partly disillusionment, the idea that we expected women to be different or better than what we see now I guess.<br>Of course, part of it also stems from how we were treated by them. Women really haven&#039;t been kind to me overall, and I&#039;m sure most here have experienced the same. Some have been nicer to me more recently, and I&#039;ve been reevaluating my beliefs on the matter.<br>I do think some elements of woman hate are justified still, mainly being critical of glaring flaws in the modern female and trying to correct them where possible, but I&#039;ve begun to see the rest as just useless or even counterproductive. For example, one thing I don&#039;t like about modern women is that many seem to have a sexual attraction to being hurt or raped. As such, posts about beating, raping, or killing them are just feeding this bad behavior, in fact I suspect a decent amount of woman hate threads are started by women with these dark fetishes. The only way to fix it is to ignore them and not play their game, people that utterly broken can&#039;t normally be dealt with without it being a net loss for you.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t get why there&#039;s so much hate occurring on /r9k/ alone.</span><br>Crab bucket<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dm me on discord</span><br>No, picrel", "filename": "1661959184311727", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 522, "h": 478, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1671183709089879, "time": 1671183709, "md5": "eqEwzhAN9+6vS4kz79YUCg==", "fsize": 69765, "resto": 71417755}, {"no": 71419315, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:41:52", "name": "Arc", "com": "<a href=\"#p71419258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71419258</a><br>The men that post here all harbor a desire, whether stated or not, to find a girlfriend on this board.
