If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the \neyes of the robot.<br>\n5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

I was tired so I articulated myself poorly, and I didn&#039;t distinguish Jung&#039;s view from my own. <br>Jung is in the tradition of those who view History as a planned whole. With Jung legacy is obviously important, but it is a spiritual rather than individual or material legacy. This is why integrating inferior functions helps achieve individuation, it&#039;s a way of getting out of confining structures of mind. Before you were countless generations whose lives have preformed the structure of your psyche, in the same way evolution has shaped your body. So, individuation is like living out what has already been prefigured to happen in mythical patterns of the unconscious, as a conscious individual, at the same time part of the collective. <br><br>There is a different view from this that I&#039;m partial to, that the past and future aren&#039;t really &quot;real.&quot; Meaning the past can&#039;t &quot;act&quot; upon the present at a distance as people like Jung assume, it can only be constructed in the present by the subject. Nor can the future be preconfigured from the present. It is pointless trying to preserve a legacy as a specific abstract thing, which is really a way of serving the identity. Rather, you should live your life as you would wish to live it an infinite number of times over.<br>Nothing is preserved, but everything returns, through the pure repetition of difference. Nietzsche describes the punishment for those who don&#039;t &quot;believe&quot; in this eternal return; they will only have an ephemeral life.

People were everywhere, unsure what to do. Others were trying to run away. Pure chaos, the scenery filled with screams and anxiety. I spotted a girl about 7-8 years old trying to get away from them at the castle. I barely managed to grab her in time.They followed us. I thought the greenhouse complex would be the best bet. At this point they started to spread out all over the place. I realized I needed to get a head start to keep distance and broke down a glass window to jump down a floor, skipping a lot of distance and encumbered space to travel through. Unfortunately it was already too late for my plan to work out and the zombies had already intruded the whole building, multiple were few feet behind us. Soon I realized the greenhouse complex was more of a mazey graveyard instead of the solution I hoped it would be, we would need to travel all the way back to open space and somehow manage to get in safety. The girl was exhausted and couldnt run anymore so I started carrying her in my arms. A lot of close calls later with zombies just a couple of feet right next to us over about the whole duration I finally managed to make it out of the complex, the chaos was immense, the zombies seemingly multiplied in minutes, and then I saw two walk right towards us with no chance of avoiding them because of all the people around us. Thats also when I spotted him, Darryl Dixon signaling for us to run towards him. But I had no other choice but to fight the two zombies in front of us, and all I had was a mere fork. I stuck it into the eye of one, desperately trying to wrestle it into the other one, I could barely muster up my strength anymore and thats when I blurred out. Some minutes later I regained consciousness, being in safety on Darryls bike with the girl on it too.

She is married now, and we still talk from time to time, but she is loyal to her husband and would never be with me again unless he died o natural causes or some shit; literally no hope for me, and I still love her. Worst part is I know she still has feelings for me (we&#039;ve talked about it) but she will never act on them again. Don&#039;t let your fear control your actions, but subsequently don&#039;t let your passion make you look like a retard.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I light-heartedly asked her last time (three weks ago) if she was &quot;up for a secret summer romance&quot; and she said no.</span><br>You can&#039;t ask her shit like that, you have to make it so she asks you to meet up at this point. If you continue to overstep like that it will push her away. I&#039;d continue talking to her normally, about anything other than your relationship, and hopefully she misses you enough to want to see you again at least once. If she does you make a move and pray that it is well received. If she still has feelings for you and you can make her cum, there is a good chance she will stay, especially if the career she is so desperately pursuing gives her complete independence from her parents. The second she doesn&#039;t need them for money anymore there is a good chance that you and her can be together imo. If it doesn&#039;t work out then you&#039;re back to square one and have lost nothing. The regret is worse than the rejection.

I think it was the pork because I&#039;m the only one who ate it. 2 days later we went to the Alton Towers on our last day in town. I was in a wheelchair (I was too weak after days of violent vomiting and diarrhea). The trip was ruined, and my lack of mobility meant we only made it to three rides. <br><br>Alton Towers ailed to return my calls and left me on hold for hours at a time when I tried to get my original 3-day tickets refunded. I never received a formal apology- I never received any communication to check on how I was. The people I did speak to challenged the validity of my story and were deeply insensitive. I&#039;m heartbroken that our beloved Alton Towers is gone and the new one is far from guest-focused. I feel so sad about this experience because for our family this was more than a bad experience it was the loss of a special place we cherished to visit every chance we had. We each independently decided we didn&#039;t want to go back and that our Alton Towers and Toby Carvery tradition had come to an end.

For every person you talk to, that&#039;s someone else you&#039;re not available to talk to, it ties you up. More importantly you are transforming the internet, whose primary benefit is the selection effects it creates, into the real world (online dating) which is by many objective standards the worst way to meet anyone. Every single person between the ages of 16-35 who speaks English is on the internet, somewhere. If you are in the same place it is not a coincidence. Why actively seek out people at random? It is a quantity over quality approach. My ethos in life has always been the opposite. I value excellence.

A better way of thinking about BPD and schizotypy is to think of two dimensions: Emotional disturbances, Sensorium disturbances. Bipolarity is the emotional side of things, but you can also have stuff like psychotic depression.

This is a no-brainer. Her esper power is a life hack. The power to alter, create, and erase memories. The ability to alter one&#039;s perception of something, brainwashing, the ability to speak through another person. Telepathy. Writing into someone&#039;s brain. The possibilities would be near endless for what I could do in this life if I had Mental Out. Of course, I&#039;d do my best not to abuse it. Ha.

A lot of her storyline is somewhat tragic. From the sudden death of her first real friend, as her Mental Out alienated her from other kids when she was in school. The IDEAL fiasco, the depression that followed, her unintentional erasing of memories from the boy she likes, rendering him unable to not only remember her, but also unable to form new memories of her. But she still marches on, hoping for her miracle. Protecting the people and things she cherishes, so I suppose that&#039;s my favorite part.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If there was one thing you could say to waifu, what would it be?</span><br>&quot;Fun, Misaki.
