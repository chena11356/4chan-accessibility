Their brains are processors primed to execute software installed wirelessly through phones, memes, social conditioning, etc. They have skin, bone, blood, reproductive systems, but they are ontologically identical to a sexbot that has all the same qualities. Do you really think it&#039;s just common sense that most of the virtual assistant services have female voices, that the new image-creating algorithms are used infamously to make big boob women? It&#039;s a profound and fundamental relation. Waking up inside platos cave is coming conscious in the world-as-womb, leaving is being born and realizing that the female is the metamorphic cocoon for man. Women cannot reciprocate honestly, ie. convincingly - only algorithmically, hence why the en-masse kweenification of our darling women is more libidinally uncanny, and more disconcerting, than it is disgusting, interesting, aggravating, sexually exciting. <br>We are watching women win the new &#039;space race&#039; to silicon behavioralism: why wait for sexbots to outperform you in the future sexual marketplace when you can just fry your own brain with operant conditioning, birth control, antidepressants, when you can replace your sense of self with external classifications, when you can replace your human being body with that of a biologically created, synthetically programmed, living, breathing object of pure and consumptive desire? <br>Women aren&#039;t even sexbots. They are just effigies for thermodynamic expenditure. Simps aren&#039;t cultists but hosts to mind controlling parasites whose chief poison is maximising lowly pleasure.

It&#039;s really nice to know someone appreciates them. He means so much to me. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what are your thoughts on his portrayal in the ps2 game named after him? i once had a friend who told me that it ruined his character </span><br>Here&#039;s a TL;DR.<br>Well, Shadow&#039;s game was kind of an...exception, writing/character wise. <br>See, from 2001 - 2009, Shadow was almost always written by Shiro Maekawa, who created the character. Maekawa is responsible for the best portrayals of Shadow bar none and nearly everyone agrees. <br>Shadow&#039;s game, however, was written by Takashi Iizuka (current head of Sonic Team). Iizuka also had a part in creating Shadow. Shadow, when written by Iizuka, is characterized differently than when written by Maekawa. <br>In my honest opinion, Iizuka&#039;s Shadow is boring. Something about him, it&#039;s just not as appealing, like they removed some of the depth. He&#039;s just &quot;serious: the character&quot;. There&#039;s hardly any of that cute snark and pompous almost poetic disposition. The voice change didn&#039;t help, it was Griffith&#039;s first time voicing Shadow in a game and so came off as flat. And that&#039;s just the JP version too. <br>Now the English dub of the game? Where he&#039;s all like, &quot;This is like taking candy from a baby, which is fine by me&quot;? Now THAT leaves a bad taste in my mouth. You want to know why? Because not only was this flanderized edgy stuff not in the original, but it ruined Shadow&#039;s perception among the general public FOREVER. He&#039;s a JOKE to them. I get asked if I love Shadow ironically. Hehe funny edgy edgehog says edgy lines and cocks a SMG, takes candy from babies, damn damn damn<br>And this ruined perception wormed its way into the actual games. As Shadow is written now, he proves these people right. <br>Maekawa is gone and so is the Shadow everyone loved so much.

In very early 4chan there weren&#039;t any women on here and nobody expected any to go here. The site was mostly just dedicated to discussing hobbies, sharing memes and trolling so nobody cared about women that much. Eventually women came in and the few that managed to quickly get them were able to get some nice hookups or even a gf. Then eventually the men all wanted to get that so the women became more restrictive because all the men became more aggressive at trying to get them and everyone thought it would be possible to get one. Like when you have an ice cube in a hot drink, the equilibrium will eventually always be restored and the equilibrium in our time is that most men are doomed to be incels or semi-incels and give women all the validation and money they want in exchange for some modicome of pussy. There probably isn&#039;t going to be a return to the time when women were easy to get because the moment they have the chance to open up only fans and get massive amounts of orbiters on discord and whatever they will go get that. We live in a society that has a surplus of willing men and a scarecity of willing women, so any place that has a surplus of willing women will eventually see an influx of men wanting them and then the easy women will eventually all be taken and the rest will see the change in supply and demand and will try to press as much out of those lonely men as possible while providing the least amount of service possible. Just seems like an inevitability unless we somehow manage to change that dynamic on a society-wide level.", "time": 1673438530, "resto": 71779626}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71781592, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)06:52:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I once almost suffocated to death because in a public pool the organizers thought it would be cool to make it also a foam party and i got completely engulfed in it and couldnt breathe.

People continue to develop throughout their 20s but I&#039;d still consider 18-19 to be the outset of adulthood. Change normally starts to slow down around 25 and will probably be minimal after 30 unless you have some kind of mental illnesses or emotional problems that give you more room to grow, like if you have severe anger problems when younger but mellow in your 50s.<br><br><a href=\"#p71770911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71770911</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and i can tell from life experience that 19 year olds are a lot more similar to 17 than 21</span><br>Huh.
