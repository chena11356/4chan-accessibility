If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

Taken as a whole, men&#039;s and women&#039;s lives are about equal, but if you look at individual populations the view shifts drastically. Take this place, for example, which is filled with a large number of low-rung people in society. There are fewer women here because they don&#039;t tend to fall this far while men do, but if you look at the top-rung the same is true. This is also where a lot of women&#039;s perceived gender inequality comes from. They tend to only look up in society never down because who wants to look at those below them? When they see these successful men and few successful women they think it&#039;s unfair because they don&#039;t see the men below them and then claim that they have it worse than men, which then causes the low-rung men to get mad at these girls because they see the reality of the situation as they look up at everyone else.", "time": 1671426094, "resto": 71453708}, {"no": 71456410, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:02:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71453898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71453898</a><br>They are lying.

Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use?

Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>Kekeke", "time": 1671436600, "resto": 71457996}, {"no": 71458019, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)02:58:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Last thread:<br>71443415<br><br>Origi29302", "time": 1671436694, "resto": 71457996}, {"no": 71458043, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:00:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/r9k/thread/71443415#p71443415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71443415</a><br>Orig83ut", "filename": "full-retard", "ext": ".gif", "w": 332, "h": 329, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1671436843017020, "time": 1671436843, "md5": "3Lg1ZqlEqJOekCf/eGGVJw==", "fsize": 927147, "resto": 71457996}, {"no": 71459034, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:08:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump i`ll post later", "time": 1671444537, "resto": 71457996}, {"no": 71459749, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:51:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71459034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71459034</a><br><a href=\"#p71457996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71457996</a><br>Ukranon here.

They are considered trickster spirits like a demon of some sort, yet they&#039;re said to be able to convert to Islam. Wacky shit. In a similar vein, there is an Islamic ban on forms of entertainment that &quot;indoctrinate the youth&quot; with what they consider to be lies and evil magics. The latter they consider real, things like wizards, fairies, and all that crap that Christianity asserts is not real to begin with. Among the lies they list basic science such as space travel and the idea of aliens existing, whom they assert are just demons tricking people with the lie of space. While we&#039;re at it, this entertainment ban is also sometimes applied to music, so listening to a song can get you killed since the only place you&#039;re allowed to sing or hear music is in a mosque according to certain Islamic scholars.<br>With the schizo nature of what Islam is, it&#039;s probably little wonder than Christians commonly believed them to be some kind of pagans up until the Renaissance or after, and commonly called them such whenever they wrote about them, simply calling them pagans.
