The war has been going on for a lot longer than you may think. Think about it, the bigger the government is, the more control it has over its own people. The regular pleebs of a nation have been more and more coddled by the government, less control over our own destinies. &quot;Oh no what if you do this, what if you do that, bad things can happen if you try new things so lets just keep running society as we see fit.&quot; This vertical thinking of complete control, and the unwillingness to embrace new ideas is at the heart of autistic thought. <br><br>On the other side of history, we have the schitzos. They always want something new, jumping between ideas, but never committing fully to one idea. Its like a new city. The schitzos are the crazed madmen who travel the world to try new ideas in new places. An area is soon established where they can attempt new ideas. This is the start of many cities and newly formed societies. Then the autists come in and they take the blueprints the schitzos placed down and hone in on how to make the society run &quot;better and more efficiently&quot;. The problem is that as a society becomes more and more efficient, the schitzos find it suffocating, and want to expand horizontally again.<br><br>As such, the schitzos leave and create a new society. We currently live in an age of hyper autism, where only the sociopaths at the top of society can live a comfortable life, and all new ideologies are put down by their new forms of technology.<br><br>TLDR: I AM NOT TAKING MY MEDS THE VOICES TELL ME I&#039;M A GOOD BOY", "filename": "gayniggers from outer space", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 283, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 147, "tim": 1672722595240066, "time": 1672722595, "md5": "L6FQQlQAWIQwUIhpSVULWA==", "fsize": 34564, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "autists-vs-schitzos", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 12, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 71670787, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)01:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sort of, you should be aiming for both to be a master of the universe.", "time": 1672728506, "resto": 71670035}, {"no": 71670816, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)01:54:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71670787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71670787</a><br>Autist, you&#039;re born with it.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use?

Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;.

You should be using a toothbrush with soft bristles, and brushing your teeth with a gentle, circular motion. Think of it like massaging your teeth with your toothbrush.

They go to the shitty popular ones and are of a type one may call vapid attention-seeking bitch.<br><br>Considering all of that, do real sports. Swimming for cardio and lots of eyecandy running around. And, if you look good and arent a social retard, you can try your luck.<br>Bouldering/climbing. I swear to god, you&#039;ve never seen finer women than in that sport. Most of them do yoga and are super fit. It is probably THE best sport to train every inch of your body with functional muscle.

I see someone sad and I try relate it to my own experiences - that&#039;s how I show that I care about the person because I want them to feel not alone. In reality, it doesn&#039;t always come off as empathy, especially when the problem is &quot;I&#039;m a lonely man&quot; and you&#039;re a woman trying to show you understand what male loneliness is like (you don&#039;t, our lonelinesses are entirely different). Lonely women (under 30) can easily find companionship (albeit short-lived); it&#039;s much harder for men. I remember when I was desperate I was trying to get any girl, even an older woman, but that desperate attitude only made me more undesirable; no one wanted to even give me a chance, I couldn&#039;t even get rejected because girls wouldn&#039;t give me the chance to be rejected. On the contrary, when women are desperate it triggers something that makes men want to care for you.

They&#039;re not going to really find what they want here, really it&#039;s just venting (the feeling they want is for a woman to truly love them). And it&#039;s fair enough to vent and be frustrated; if you&#039;re a guy doing all you can to get out there, and you still get kicked down, it starts to take its toll. It did for me, and being able to mope and cry and seethe and cope, even if it&#039;s just r9k, made me feel a little better. You can&#039;t just cry though, you have to go back out there, make a fool of yourself, and eventually delude yourself into thinking you&#039;re better than all the women rejecting you.

Just a dull longing in my heart whenever I think of him. Sometimes before I go to sleep there&#039;s a passing thought that I won&#039;t wake up in his arms. And sometimes when I think of how long I&#039;ve loved him I idly think how, in all likelihood, I&#039;ll have some amount of feelings for him until the day I die. I can&#039;t tell the future, of course, so it&#039;d be a bit presumptuous to say I&#039;ll never fall out of love. But I think, 9 years now, it&#039;s withstood the test of time. Decade old feelings don&#039;t just go away, do they?<br>Maybe I&#039;m coping or whatever. That&#039;s alright. The thought of my arm lightly draped over his small but strong frame fills me with a sense of contentment, not unlike the feeling of a blanket draped over me. And sometimes it fills me with an excitement of sorts. I need to stop thinking about him so hard, because I realize my heart is pounding and I can&#039;t relax to sleep. <br>It&#039;s become second nature to me to pick apart things with autistic precision to get a little crumb of information about his life. Sometimes I feel like my brain is a living archive of information about him, there&#039;s nobody I know of who is aware of him like I am, or so I tell myself. Everything he&#039;s ever said, done, all dissected by me in every way possible. Everything committed to memory so I can pull it out like a file in a file cabinet at a moment&#039;s notice. <br>Maybe he&#039;d find that creepy. Maybe he&#039;d wonder what I find in him. It&#039;s hard to put into words at times but once I get going I can&#039;t stop, I can&#039;t stop rambling on and on about this rat that&#039;s affected my heart in the very deepest way he possibly could&#039;ve. <br>I imagine his smell, the thought of that musky lavender clouding my brain like brown noise. Even his imagined scent activates something primal in the very deepest parts of my brain I can&#039;t control. I can&#039;t control myself when I think of him.

I felt a bit of anxiety as the drugs took hold and I realized, and they lightly grabbed my leg and said &quot;are you ok?&quot; and smiled and I felt an overwhelming wave of love rush over me, I then looked around the room and just processed everything in the lens of love. It was pretty tight. The second time was in a movie theater that my friend worked at with planet earth playing on the theater screen muted with jazz music through the speakers. I got super high and watched animals on the screen and thought all kinds of stuff about life and death and my friends were just fucking around drinking in the theater, and then eventually I had come down enough that I said &quot;a bat!&quot; when a bat flew by on the screen, and all my friends turned and looked at me startled.
