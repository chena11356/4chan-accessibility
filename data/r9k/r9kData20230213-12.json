some retard emotional and philosophical revelations i had about my problems, and that i was going to manage them with stimulant use.<br><br>some wise anon who seemed to have had a terrible history with stimulant or other hard drug abuse dug into me and did all of the correct things in order to scare me whilst in my altered state and warn me about the danger of addiction i was diving into head-first into. he refused to engage with my silly delusions or my fake, stimulant-induced good faith responses (i guess since its fake good i should say bad), and scared me enough to dump out all of the benzedrex i had left even though i had planned on not using again after that (because i thought i would have a steady supply of adderall instead, which is less harmful than propylhexedrine).<br><br>anyway, for reasons that would take awhile to explain, that event not too many days ago led me to find out that i have OCD, specifically a subtype Existential OCD which includes obsessions over existential/philosophical topics along with the absolute inability to tolerate uncertainty that characterizes OCD. i thought that my dysfunctional pacing around and &#039;thinking&#039; about the meaning of life for, at worst up to 6 hours but usually 1-2hrs a day was just my neurotic personality, but it turns out that its a neurotic pathology. go figure.<br><br>as can probably be figured from my writing, i am still taking stimulants and i must disappoint the anon that tried to get me to hard stop. i am not yet dependent, but that day will probably come soon-- thank you for trying to warn me, and i echo the warning to all others even though i have not fallen apart yet. i know now that my behavior and desire to use is an addiction, and for what it&#039;s worth i no longer deny that. im sorry to that anon, who probably remembers me if you&#039;re here.", "time": 1676289740, "resto": 72200880}, {"no": 72209386, "now":

mental problems prevent me from being productive. the OCD compulsions prevent me from enjoying things even when i am not compulsively performing them, since i am still obsessing about them.<br><br>i can&#039;t say it is only the OCD, because i have other problems too. the fact is that i have tried over the past few years very strongly to get my life together, but it continues to stay broken because i simply am not strong enough to do the right thing. this is not a justification for my use, this is an admission of weakness. an admission i probably would not be able to make if, as the previously mentioned anon had pointed out to me last time i stimposted, i wasn&#039;t extremely high on a drug that directly fires up my reward system.<br><br>my stimulant use has thus far made me able to be productive for time periods, certainly, however i recognize now that the main draw is of course how it just makes me feel good. one of the chilling things this anon said to me was something along the lines of &quot;with a high enough dose, you could receive news that would kill you with despair if you were sober, but still smile because your brain is all lit up from the drug&quot;. that was a truth i felt then enough to scare me to flush all of my retard-drug last time, and it is something i feel now. the OCD is still there while I am on stimulants, but it no longer inspires terrible agony inside of me. the drug cuts off the pain before it gets too deep and disables me, and it replaces it with that electric dopaminergic warmth. that is what i am addicted to, i suppose.<br><br>so, to anybody wondering about trying strong stimulants, i recommend you don&#039;t if you have bad mental problems (everybody on /r9k/) that you would like to be able to be free of. i liked what louis ck

but from what i gather there is addiction and there is hopeless addiction.<br><br>the first category seems to be filled with people who stay strongly in denial about their addiction but eventually come to terms with their behavior and understand that they are addicted, and try to beat the addiction. it seems that in many cases this takes time, and perhaps many fail, but they want to be helped and do stuff like go to rehab and try to be sober and whatnot<br><br>the second category seems to be filled with the people who, whether they are in denial or not, simply don&#039;t want to stop. they have no desire to stop-- i think these people often tend to be the ones to have nothing left to go back to when sober. they are the ones that don&#039;t want to be helped<br><br>i think i fall into this latter category. no doubt heartache and tears awaits me down this dark road i am staring down, but i think the fact is that i have nothing that makes me want to quit. if i stop doing stimulants i go back to the same life where most days i can&#039;t even get out of bed, where any productivity comes with the immense toll of fighting off my compulsions and ruminations, with the same pains over my own past events. even on stimulants, i still perform compulsions, but i am able to get some things done. i wrote about 4,000 words today. i have been studying mathematics again. but, again, mostly, the stimulants reduce the mental suffering that paralyzes me on most days sober. i don&#039;t choose addiction, even if i made the choices that lead to it. i just don&#039;t want to quit and i don&#039;t regret my use right now-- and there&#039;s where the addiction lies. i&#039;m not in control. sorry to disappoint you, whoever that anon that tried to help me was. stimpost over.", "time":

class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72181376</a> <br><br>Hello, Anon, need some help? A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>KLKLK", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676290707535335, "time": 1676290707, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "72181376", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 72209440, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:19:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what a shit thread and god who knows how many years it will stay", "time": 1676290772, "resto": 72209434}, {"no": 72209442, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:19:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/r9k/thread/72195870#p72195870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72195870</a><br><br>STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>LKLKL", "time": 1676290791, "resto": 72209434}, {"no": 72209454, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:20:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72209440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72209440</a><br>But enough about britfeel", "time": 1676290849, "resto": 72209434}, {"no": 72209462, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:22:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72209454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72209454</a><br>no neither rgay or waifu thread", "time": 1676290950, "resto": 72209434}, {"no": 72209466, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:22:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72209440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72209440</a><br>Thx for you continued support, Anon.<br>Thx to the efforts of gracious supporters, such as yourself, this thread will continue to bring joy to this place for a long time to come.", "time": 1676290962, "resto": 72209434}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 72209461, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:22:29", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Jerking your chicken", "com": "I don&#039;t have a reason to jerk off anymore.<br>I used to jerk off a lot due to stress but now that I&#039;ve become a NEET I don&#039;t have any stress so no reason to jerk off, I don&#039;t even find it enjoyable to coom.<br>So far I&#039;ve gone 2 weeks without jerking off and I feel fine, I don&#039;t miss it.<br>How long have you been without jerking off?", "filename": "f46a24aca9a17b657a33fcab030348d", "ext": ".png", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676290949825156, "time": 1676290949, "md5": "AFyZdabEb1hqaz+Kf7rrwQ==", "fsize": 637944, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "jerking-your-chicken", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 72209475, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:24:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72209461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72209461</a><br>*How long have you gone without jerking off", "time": 1676291050, "resto": 72209461}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 72209121, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)06:26:50", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "She fucking cheated on me, boys.", "com": "She blocked me on everything one day and I called her with my friends phone, I heard a man say &quot;who&#039;s calling you&quot; and she said &quot;stop Jason&quot;.

It&#039;s for that reason, mainly, that her love is unconditional. In terms of other people, though, the main thing she considers unforgivable is if someone tries to knowingly cause direct harm towards either of us.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How affectionate is she? How often does she say &quot;I love you&quot;?</span><br>Very much so, but mostly physically. She doesn&#039;t say the words themselves very often, she saves them for special moments.

Thanks for picking up the phone when I was saying goodbye as I was sure I was about to die even though I didnt tell you. You betrayed me though. You didnt realize how amazing I am and how I did everything in the world for you. I pushed myself past the breaking point and I never gave up. I was always there for you and always believed in you. Even when you betrayed me and lied to me I still believed in you. Too bad you didnt realize how strong I am. I endured everything even losing you which is the hardest thing that will ever happen to me. I was even biochemically tortured and I still stood back up. I used to think that you made me strong, but it was really me. I&#039;m the great thing, not you. I always hoped you would be and I did it all to lift you up to my level but you gave up on yourself and our future. I forgive you and accept that youre gone and you won&#039;t ever be good enough for me and who I&#039;ve become. You didnt deserve me then and you definitely don&#039;t now. Letting who you could have been and who that was to me go was nearly impossible, but I did it. All that was left was the reality of who you really were and that empty shell of who you really are means nothing to me. Im disappointed in how abusive and unloving you were. I&#039;ll always love that ghost of you that I never got to meet. I feel bad for you because you might one day realize all this and it will destroy you because it destroyed me and im infinitely stronger than you are and unlike my story there&#039;s no happy ending in yours so you have my pity.

In Pakistan, people follow their own traditions, wear their traditional clothes and eat their traditional food. It&#039;s culturally vivid.&quot;<br><br>She was also aware of Pakistan&#039;s image in popular culture, with news of security concerns, and being listed among the world&#039;s most unsafe countries. But Arpi, with an Instagram following of more than 23,000 and a prolific travel blog, saw a chance to go &quot;off the beaten path&quot; - mostly solo, and in areas foreigners can&#039;t easily access. She also followed Western female influencers, who posted about travelling in Pakistan with comfort, safety and privileged access. This is despite a 2021 survey showing that 80 percent of Pakistanis think women aren&#039;t safe in their own country.<br><br>On July 17, while visiting the city of Dera Ghazi Khan in Pakistan&#039;s Punjab province, Arpi said she was threatened, extorted and then &quot;brutally&quot; gang raped by two men she had befriended during her previous travels, one of whom filmed the act and threatened to leak it. A case of rape and filming obscene acts was registered by the Border Military Police on July 19. Arpi also said she was misled to believe she had permission to stay in the city, which has a history of militancy and usually isn&#039;t included in the cities tourists can visit with their visas.
