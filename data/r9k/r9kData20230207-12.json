If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the \neyes of the robot.<br>\n5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>QTQTQT", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675764044989385, "time": 1675764044, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 17, "images": 7, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 72131023, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)05:01:28", "name": "ENTJ", "com": "<a href=\"#p72131018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72131018</a><br>WHY WON&quot;T ANYBODY STICK MY DOG KNOT DILDO UP MY ASS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH", "time": 1675764088, "resto": 72131018, "trip": "!DAHVOQpHAM"}, {"no": 72131024, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)05:01:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>QTQTQT", "time": 1675764090, "resto": 72131018}, {"no": 72131032, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)05:02:20", "name": "Ukranon", "com": "<a href=\"#p72131018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72131018</a><br>First in nhk thread, still procrastinating", "filename": "welcome to Misaki", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1412, "h": 2126, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675764140649359, "time": 1675764140, "md5": "Oozt0ogfBjREFP8zZYWhpg==", "fsize": 826545, "resto": 72131018}, {"no": 72131038, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)05:03:13", "name": "ENTJ", "com": "<a href=\"#p72131023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72131023</a><br>Youve been filtered by basically the entire board, nobody even knows that youre still posting lmao", "time": 1675764193, "resto": 72131018, "trip": "!!tX49rKltSif"}, {"no": 72131040, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)05:03:49", "name": "Ukranon", "com": "<a href=\"#p72131032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72131032</a><br>I fucked up.

Because he trusts me, and I won&#039;t hurt him.<br>It&#039;s a morbid thought, and pure headcanon admittedly, but I&#039;ve always wondered if he was treated badly or insensitively by the scientists about space colony ARK because they viewed him not as a person but as another creature to be experimented on, like the Biolizard or the Artificial Chaos. He wouldn&#039;t have a single objection to that either, because in his mind it&#039;s all okay and he can endure it because it&#039;s for Maria. So if he&#039;s injected with various illnesses or regeneration is tested it&#039;s all worth it. A line from Sonic X pops into my mind a lot, that she was &quot;his only friend&quot;. He really had nobody but her, a 12 year old girl who herself was extremely sheltered, so it&#039;s no wonder he&#039;s so socially maladjusted. <br>It makes me feel for him. I know he wouldn&#039;t want my pity, but I guess I can&#039;t help it. Nobody deserves to go through the things that he has. I just want to be there and let him know it&#039;s okay. I can&#039;t keep the fantasies of doting on him away, doing a bunch of sappy stuff like flower fields and coffee shops to see a little spark of happiness in his eyes.

It is much closer to methamphetamine than regular amphetamine is (chemically, propylhexedrine, like meth, has that N-methyl group that accounts for greater activity in various phenethylamines). It is my understanding that methamphetamine is much more euphoric and addictive because, beyond involving the big dopamine release, it also has strong serotonergic properties as well.

Upon realizing this, I was able to feel something genuine for the first time in a long time.<br><br>Though, before in all my emptiness and languor, I did find one thing that could make me feel: great beauty. In all things, but it is mostly forms of serious art that does it for me.

My lower jaw is completely gone. She pulls back, drenched in my blood, and giggles. Her smile is wider than her face and her teeth are like a shark&#039;s. I try to speak but my mouth is mostly gone so I just splurt blood on her stomach and chest. She licks it off with an impossibly long tongue. She tells me she loves me and starts eating my arm. I try to get away but she&#039;s too strong. As the world goes black, she tells me that we&#039;ll be together.

Older robots mostly never identified as incels, and the word only became popular here after leddit shutdown some place on their site. &quot;Incels&quot; are a bunch of sex obsessed degenerate faggot coomer orbiters. We are first and foremost robots, something I class as a distinct identity, removed from the identity of incel. You may now probably be asking yourself what a robot is then, if not an incel? Well the definitions and differences between the two identities is explained thus:<br>Robots are male outcasts that are virgin, with EMPHASIS on one&#039;s nature as an outcast, although virginity and being male are still mandatory parts of robotdom.<br><br>Incels are involuntary celibates, basically an identity that is &quot;I want sex, I can&#039;t have sex&quot;. Because of this, inceldom is inherently an identity tied to lack of sex. Tying the definition to a dichotomy(incel/volcel) allows the definition to be attacked very easily. A normalfag can say &quot;You can&#039;t be an incel, unless someone is physically restraining you from having sex, simply because your beliefs or self/looks repulse people does not mean you don&#039;t have the ability to either change your beliefs or rape someone&quot;. Mind you, identifying as someone whose identity is tied to lack of sex is pathetic. Robots are outcasts, outsiders.<br><br>Robotdom does not have this flaw because it doesnt attach much of it&#039;s meaning to that dichotomy of voluntary/involuntary, but rather to it&#039;s outcast status. Robots instead claim that, their status as outcasts is coercive. Robots are in essence saying, &quot;Yes, I&#039;m choosing to suck your dick, but you&#039;re coercing me into that choice by pointing a gun at my head and telling me you are gonna shoot me if I don&#039;t&quot;.

I begin to really hate myself when I start thinking about what a bad person I am and how I can never truly be a good person. But instead of accepting that, I start to think what IF I can be a good person after all? Maybe I should try a little harder, be a little better. Even though I have been told that I&#039;m a nice person and I know for sure I put a conscious effort into being one, my brain says that it simply is not enough. There has to be more I can do, there just has to. And it isn&#039;t always about actions I do but thoughts I have. If I think negatively about someone even briefly, I will feel guilt almost immediately and hyper-focus on it. If I read manga where the main character dies and I enjoyed the story, I will mistake that as me enjoying his demise, thus making me a horrible person.
