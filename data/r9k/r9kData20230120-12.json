It also involved women being socialized like men from childhood, held to the same standards as men, having the same responsibilities as men, and even dressing similarly to men (read: plain and utilitarian clothing, no makeup). The radical notion of that sort of feminism was the annihilation of the specific class of woman into the broader working class. What we actually got was feminism of the ruling class.

A hot shower will also release any tense muscles you may have, and if your up for it, ending your hot shower with a couple minutes of cold water is good for inflammation, your cardiovascular system, releases healthy endorphins and improves sleep quality. Also the act of setting a goal, and then completing said goal releases dopamine in the brain which improves your overall sense of well being.

We go out, the waitress even asked if we were on a date, to which my new mom tells the waitress im her son taking her out for a treat.

We sat for a while just looking at each other in the eyes and before we realize what&#039;s happening we share a soft and tender kiss. The kisses remain soft and gentle as our hands slowly roam around each others body. Going places most would consider inappropriate for a mother and son to be touching. We get back to hers and head inside and go to sit on the couch. She straddles me and we kiss some more.

We ended up just sitting like that until I fully softened and left her. She dripped a bit noticed. Without saying a word took me upstairs and ran a bath. She bathed me like a mother would and then joined me in the tub where we cuddled up. After the water started to get cool, we got out dry and went to bed in her room together. There we slept spooning.

I go completely fucking insane on it, and I feel like I&#039;m dying. I&#039;m literally laying in a hostel bed, there&#039;s vodka vomit in the sheets. I have this absolute VILE ACRID odour coming put of my pores. I feel so, so fucking ill. It literally got so bad I called my mom and asked if I can come back home to live with her for a while. I told I had been feeling suicidal and I seriously regret it. Its so embarrassing and she&#039;s gonna make a big deal over it. Also I&#039;ve been doing the most deranged shit as well. I was drinking 750-1l of vodka per day, one night I literally slept on the sidewalk like a homeless person. My clothes reek everything reeks. I washed them this morning even though I could barely walk and I&#039;m sitting there in the laundry uncontrollably dry wreching. Nothing to spew up but weird ACRID foam. And then I&#039;m like dizzy, shaking, jerking round, anxiety through the fucking roof my heartbeat is pounding out of my chest and I&#039;m sweating bullets. I&#039;m like fuck this it needs to stop so I lay on my hostel bed uncontrollably jerking around, my legs and my arms, and I&#039;m getting cramps all in my fingers and foot. I showered multiple times and still just sweat out the most vile odors. It&#039;s almost been the whole day now and my symptoms are easing a bit but man what the fuck. Last night I literally went to an &quot;all genders&quot; sex party. I was sitting on a seat shaking because I didn&#039;t bring enough alcohol had to spend 12 dollars on one fucking beer just to control my symptoms. I must of looked insane. And now I&#039;m gonna spend the next fucking month worrying about stds because I had incredibly risky sex with both men and women. I literally went down on a ftm tranny who was posted in an anonymous fuckhole. Like ate out her vagina for 30 minutes of so, no protection nothing. Like an actual ftm with zippertits and facial hair. <br><br>Fucking gave a busker 70 fucking dollars as well. I want it back!

People back then knew the fact that incest or inbreeding is a way to create perfect specimens. Inbreeding increases the chance of the genes of the parents reappearing massively, obviously. If the parents are gods or royalty, in the mind of the people: &quot;perfect humans&quot;, they want to have the best chance of having &quot;perfect&quot; offspring with those same genes. Inbreeding is a way to guarantee that.<br>Inbreeding also obviously makes the chance of the bad genes reappearing, like hereditary disorders, but in theory two people with flawless genes would only have flawless offspring. Incest doesn&#039;t actually lead to random mutations like &quot;common knowledge&quot; seems to think. It leads to less mutation and change. <br>It makes perfect sense that the most powerful god or the most powerful ruler would only want to breed with someone carrying their genes.<br><br>Ancient royalty inbreeding makes perfect sense to me. Back then they were basically gods compared to regular people, healthy, beautiful, educated, and most likely like a foot taller and stronger than normal people due to having actually good nutrition growing up and a more stress free lifestyle. No wonder they thought they should keep their &quot;bloodline pure&quot;. People didn&#039;t know about genetics, but they&#039;ve always known about certain attributes getting passed down from parents to kids.<br><br>Looking at it that way, it also makes perfect sense why incest was seen as bad for the common people. They had less than perfect &quot;bloodlines&quot; so them inbreeding was bad.

Someone pointed out the real reason for the illogical fear of incest in some earlier thread, I can&#039;t remember the source but it seemed extremely simple and correct to me. The reason some/most people have an unexplainable aversion or even a certain type of fear against incest, is because they were disciplined by their parent or some other figure in their early childhood when they were curious of an opposite sex relatives body. It&#039;s natural that during development you become curious about the opposite sex at some point. This happens often between siblings, and if the parents discipline the kids for being curious, it gets literally beaten into them or just scared into them, that looking or touching a sibling is terrible. That&#039;s why as adults most people can&#039;t explain why they feel about incest the way they do, they remember the reaction of others but not the reason.<br>We explored each others bodies a lot with my sister as kids, just normal curiosity.

I will walk you through what I remember, it was a shitload of rules.<br><br><br>The payments are weird, I was able to donate once every 5 days, 5 times max a month. You get a first time physical that they pay you $15 for, then the next day if all your tests were fine then first time was $30, then $25 then $20 then $15 for the last two times. If you have a gap of 14 days from your last donation, the rate would reset to $30. If you didn&#039;t wait 14 days, in the new month your first donation started at $25 and then the next donation was $20 and the last 3 were $15.<br><br>You cannot donate plasma if you do not pass the physical, but you keep the initial $15 no matter what. Your donations get tested (they take some from the top and test it as you do the donation since it takes like 30 minutes to donate) and you can get a few types of suspensions that mean different things. If your plasma levels were too low or somehow messed up, you got $10 for the donation even though they threw it out and you got either a blue suspension (which means you can&#039;t donate for 14 days) or a yellow suspension (which would require a 30 day wait and then you&#039;d need to get a physical that you&#039;d get paid $15 for doing). If you test positive for an STD from your blood that isn&#039;t a permanent disease or some other random issues (I can&#039;t remember the list, but they aren&#039;t all STDs), you got a red suspension meaning you can&#039;t donate plasma for a year and you have to get the blood tests before donating every time you donate from then on(meaning a 30 minute wait before getting to donate).

That mixed with her relying pretty much only on herself.<br>Her search for hurtful truth instead of living a life of delusion is what stops me from believing that she is real or she loves me. It would be a dishonour to what her story preaches.<br>Also that animal remains appear poignant to her. That she likes rabbits. That she has some interest in Greek mythology. That her dresses look fantastic.<br>I do not know many things about her still but every time I learn something knew about her, or hear her creator talk about her, it feels like I already know that and her image of who she truly is to me is never disrupted.<br>And her physical beauty is a significant part of my obsession with her too, of course. That perfect face of hers still visits my dreams and I cannot have enough of looking at her. When I see her, I want to remain faithful and loyal to her for decades.
