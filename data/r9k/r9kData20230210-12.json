Literally. <br><br>ISFJ sister was raised to be a people pleaser, desperately craves ENTP dad and ESTJ mom&#039;s approval to the point of letting them force her to go into a career she didn&#039;t even like, lets ESTJ mom be pretty invasive of her personal life up to the point of letting her decide on her romantic relationships. She&#039;s reached a point in her life where she can&#039;t take any decisions without consulting mom first, and whenever she does something mom doesn&#039;t like, she punishes her by ignoring her everywhere until sister does what she wants, which drives sister insane because she&#039;s become that dependent on ESTJ mom.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>PTPTP", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676031460955866, "time": 1676031460, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 5, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 72169863, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)07:18:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;.

But it&#039;s 2 plus 2, all of us could fap 10 times a day when we were teenagers and pull all nighters and full of energy, but after turning 21, gotta rest for like a week before horniness and energy comes back after fapping even once or a few times. I have come to the conclusion that balls is where the power of a man be, and it shouldn&#039;t ever be drained away. Semen is made from your own blood, why get your blood to constantly make new cum? After you exercise like a beast, you feel horny as fuck because your balls are full. You should just rest and let your body reabsorb the semen on its own, not fap it away like a retard just because fapping while on a pump feels infinite times better, it feels that way because your balls are full dumbass. Nofap will show its effects in a single day, go do some pushups, some squats, get a bicep pump drink water and eat a full meal, congrats now you are functioning like a normal human.

At least a few times a year women will offer to pay for my food, the last time it happened I was staring down some bitch in her rear-view mirror because she wouldnt stop looking at me, honestly I was just wondering why the hell she was staring, then she paid for my coffee. <br><br> Another girl I used to work with told me I had a &quot;face for sales&quot; and said to me &quot;if you told me something I would just trust you, and I would buy what youre selling.&quot; Then she told me to quit this job and go to another job where I could make more money. Sure enough im in sales now and prefer to deal with female customers as they are seemingly enchanted by presence, like being visited by some rare animal or something. I understand Spanish so I hear them saying things like &quot;Yes, or no?&quot;, presumably asking if im worth of a fuck, with the reply being &quot;Yes&quot;. Or Ive heard &quot;Hurry quick your husband is running away&quot; or &quot;I want to give that guy a kiss&quot;, things like that. <br><br>Also, when babies are crying, I can just look them right in the eyes and wave and they start smiling. They are mesmerized by my face/eyes. Fathers often have to nudge their young daughters to stop them from staring at me. <br><br>Being good looking is a gift. If I werent good looking I dont think id be making the money I do or have the positive life experience I have had, and im only a 7/10. Speaking of money, those women know Im making good money at my job, im sure theyre into me knowing I am not only attractive but can actually provide for them.

You need to cease any sexual activity/ejaculation until your neurons start firing properly again (being in a horny as fuck state literally implies even by biology you are at peak performance, so always be on the edge to breed) you can&#039;t be horny in a dulled out, exhausted state, so to heal your nerves, cease any stressors such as sex, depression, and you need to chill out.
