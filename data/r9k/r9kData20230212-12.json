If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the \neyes of the robot.<br>\n5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>YCYCYC", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676205821714515, "time": 1676205821, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "72181376", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 72195875, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:44:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>YCYCYC", "time": 1676205862, "resto": 72195870}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 72195867, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:43:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fucking nigger janny I hope a Himalayan black bear fucking tears apart the remains of your anus you dumb fucking tranny DIE DIE DIE", "filename": "neck yourself", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 225, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676205785474564, "time": 1676205785, "md5": "R7ptNJQz6p9zAfuCUgQ4VA==", "fsize": 2477933, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fucking-nigger-janny-i-hope-a-himalayan-black", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 72195506, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)06:43:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So, why don&#039;t you just stop being a nice guy?", "filename": "roastie", "ext": ".webm", "w": 576, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 140, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676202219270915, "time": 1676202219, "md5": "dJx7Ja6vraBVozkz+QWH+w==", "fsize": 4174679, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "so-why-dont-you-just-stop-being-a-nice-guy", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 19, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 72195520, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)06:45:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72195506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72195506</a><br>Women say I&#039;m mysgnositic.

You need to cease any sexual activity/ejaculation until your neurons start firing properly again (being in a horny as fuck state literally implies even by biology you are at peak performance, so always be on the edge to breed) you can&#039;t be horny in a dulled out, exhausted state, so to heal your nerves, cease any stressors such as sex, depression, and you need to chill out.

Types with Ni go with Ne types, Fe goes with Fi, Se with Si, and so on. But also that the two types have enough in common to have a reason to interact. I can see MBTI seeks that point in which two types are different enough to compensate for each other&#039;s shortcomings, but similar enough that they can understand and relate to each other.<br><br>However, not everyone enters a relationship with the goal of personal growth. Some people prioritize a personal connection, they may just want to chill or have someone that relates to them. Not all INTP are inclined to have an ENTJ boss them around, and not all ISFJ want to look after an ESFP.

The way genetics works is that in the long term, hundreds of thousands to millions of years, all the features you think that make you &quot;you&quot; will disappear from the gene pool with maybe 99.99999% certainty. Only an extremely extremely small amount of humans stay in the gene pool long term because they have a mutation like say Michael Phelps where his muscles literally produce half as much lactic acid as an average person, because that&#039;s generally useful. On a long enough time horizon you either become the common ancestor of all humans or the common ancestor of none of them and the latter is far far far more likely than the former. Your seed at best is only going to result in more children and healthier children being born into a community than might otherwise happen in the short term.<br><br>Yet this is not the only way to make an impact on the world really. Imagine somebody becomes a great leader who never has kids and makes a bunch of good decisions which benefits their entire community. Through doing so every child in said community, even ones related to them, end up doing better. Such a person can have a bigger impact than a sperm donor even on their own genetic lineage (people are generally too stupid to realise that your genes aren&#039;t just in you), but they would just be written off as &quot;cucks&quot; or whatever by some for making other children&#039;s lives better.<br><br>For me, I want to straddle the middle between these two visions of how to leave a legacy by reproducing but being heavily involved as a provider for my children.

I just spent the last couple months travelling round another country but I got too depressed and asked my mom if I could move in. But I was in such bad alcoholism the first week I couldn&#039;t stop and really scared my parents because I was going insane and like walking in the traffic and some guy like attacked me in front of my mom. I spent a week in my moms front room detoxing like a loser wondering how I let my life get so pathetic. My parents are way to tolerant of this shit. Oh boy the withdrawal was hell as well, I was drinking around 800ml-1L of vodka per day. Just pure suffering. I got through the worst of it and it&#039;s just the same shit, anxiety, depression, suicidality, just constant suffering and meaninglessness, boredom, ennui. What to do? how to spend my time? so much tension. I have no hobbies or interests and enjoy nothing. Also my work history is fucked because I just work for like 6 months max and save some money and I&#039;ll be like well fuck I have savings why work? And then it&#039;s so anxiety inducing like I have no income I&#039;ll be completely fucked if it runs out. It&#039;s like I&#039;m living on a timer.
