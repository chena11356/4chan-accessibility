If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7.

When she left, a flood of angry texts followed by that final, fatal: &quot;do you even want to be with me?&quot; <br><br>I ignored it and I blocked her number. That changed my life forever. That was a woman who, in retrospect, seriously wanted to settle down and make a life together. As you can probably guess, I never did find anyone else like her and only ever realized my mistake many years later. She&#039;s happily married now of course. <br><br>Feel free to call me scum, I have become incredibly self loathing in my old age, and more and more sympathetic to women who call men out on our bullshit. To any youngfags out there: settle down in your mid 20s. Do not, repeat, do NOT delay marriage. The alternative is so much worse, believe me. Do not chase casual sex, it is a road to nowhere and will never give you genuine validation.", "filename": "ddca12d41bf7a80e4e9e580e49c5279f", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 454, "h": 488, "tn_w": 116, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672276605491445, "time": 1672276605, "md5": "s+emiWK8RI07SFlhhfYKsQ==", "fsize": 25820, "resto": 71593040}, {"no": 71593255, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)20:19:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71593229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71593229</a><br>This is partly what I&#039;m really worried about with the younger generation.

I&#039;ll just tell you what happened yesterday so you know where we&#039;re at.<br><br>We went to my aunts place for christmas this year. Spent like a week with a lot of our relatives there, a largeish farm type place. For like four days we didn&#039;t have any chances to do much, and seeing her so close but not being able to do anything made me incredibly horny. Her too apparently. Any little time we had we basically teased each other, like I rubbed her tits and she rubbed my crotch.<br>Yesterday I went to get wood and mom came along. When we got to the shed, we realized that we were alone for the first time in a long while. It was cold out, but the shed was sort of warm. She opened her jacket and hugged me. I opened my jacket too. I just felt her tits press into me through our shirts, her huge nipples were rock hard from the cold. Haven&#039;t gotten that horny in a long time. I sucked on her neck a little and pulled up her shirts, and sucked on her tit. After a few moments I put my hand down her pants and felt how wet her panties were. I couldn&#039;t take it anymore so I turned her around and pulled her sweatpants down and hugged and kissed her butt and hips. She made the same little whimpering sounds as our first time. I just had to have it, so I pulled her panties down too and went to put it in her. She moved over to a pile of wood and bent over it leaning on her arms with her pants around her ankles. I just couldn&#039;t stop myself and went to town on her, I didn&#039;t care about the noise. I grabbed her hips hard and let her ass slap. Same as the first time, I felt like I wanted to just go as deep in her as possible. I heard a door open and people talking out, but didn&#039;t care, they were far enough to maybe only hear light clapping sounds. Came in her like a firehose while I squeezed her tits hard.", "filename": "6538635865", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1201, "h": 801, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672136631509275, "time": 1672136631, "md5": "ZOxxvjvrWkgWqLtp8Qkpog==", "fsize": 769339, "resto": 71558748}, {"no": 71569939, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:28:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71569907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71569907</a><br>bruh if you are finanon you need to give us a lot of updates", "time": 1672136887, "resto": 71558748}, {"no": 71569995, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71569907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71569907</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just had to have it, so I pulled her panties down too and went to put it in her.

I pulled her in one last time and pulled out. I could now feel the cold on my wet cock, I didn&#039;t even notice how cold it was before. As my mom went to pull her pants back up, a HUGE load just slid from her with a splat. It made a puddle on the floor and the back and inside of her sweatpants got covered, some more ran down her thigh. She kind of gave me a worried look and rushed nearer to me. I could see half of the butt of her grey sweatpants was covered in very noticeable goo and it had already turned into a darker grey wet spot. I pulled up a wood basket to cover my boner and she pretended to put down some logs. My aunt and her friend opened the door and laughed that thought they had to be the ones to carry the wood in, but were happy that we were already on it. Mom just sort of kept her ass out of view, us being a little out of breath and sweaty with our jackets open looked probably pretty normal for what we were supposed to be doing. They left after a few words and we actually collected the wood with mom. The back of her pants was ruined. We rubbed some snow on her and said she fell in the snow and had to go change. I&#039;m glad no one got into smelling distance when she went back indoors again.<br>Rest of the night we just gave each other looks and giggled a little.

Soon after it wasn&#039;t too weird to have a massage in the living room before the sauna. We were undressing and after we got undressed I pretty much just asked her if she wanted a massage before the sauna while we sip on drinks. Being naked and hard with her was natural enough by now that it was easy. Oiling her up on a towel on the couch was pretty much the point where it stopped being normal in any way, as in you couldn&#039;t anymore explain it as just being natural while naked and non-sexual. Something about being naked and touching like that without being or going into the sauna/shower. It sort of helped me get over most of the hesitation to touch her. The first time on the couch I just slapped her ass cheeks and played with her butt like she wasn&#039;t my mom. Slipped my hand between her thighs and up enough that I lightly touched her hair. I don&#039;t remember if it was the same night, but I also massaged her tits from the front while putting lotion on her standing in the sauna. I very obviously played with her nipples and rubbed her shiny tits for a long while. She just giggled and smiled. I don&#039;t think my dick had been that hard before.

She just turned around with her tits flopping and asked me to put the rest on her neck and chest. She used the word for upper chest, not tits btw. I started putting the lotion on her neck and went down on her shoulders and upper chest. At this point I was already on her tits, felt them giving a little, being soft under my fingers. I slid my hands over the outside edge of her tits, like into her armpits. I already felt like I was fondling her tits, so I just went a little lower each stroke until my hands went down the side of tits to her nipple level. So my hands were now undeniably on just her tits. She was having fun clearly so I just kept going like that, a little more obvious every move. I slid my hands under her tits, between them, etc. Then I slid down the middle of her tits until I hit her nipples and rubbed around and on them a little. It was still ok with her so I also sort of grabbed her tits from the sides pushed them into each other. Lifted them up a little from the bottom. Put her nipples between my thumb and finger and squeezed lightly. I had no idea what to do next so I just gave her tits a little tap and said &quot;alright done&quot;. She just giggled and smiled, grabbed her drink and kind of tapped me on the shoulder. Again we went on the rest of the night like normal, like we usually after doing something new. Like we need a while to think internally what just happened. <br><br>btw feel free to ask me for details like that, it&#039;s easier to write when I don&#039;t have to write like a four hour night into a single post chronologically.

I&#039;m not totally against the idea, it&#039;s just that my sister caught us earlier being too close and I&#039;m sort of worried what her and other family might think. I live close enough that it&#039;s not an issue to stay there for a few days, so there&#039;s no real rush to change anything.<br><a href=\"#p71570773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71570773</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does your mom dress or try to be more sexy around you now that she&#039;s also your woman?</span><br>Yes, she does dress a lot more &quot;sexier&quot; now, but I think her normal clothes look hot on her too. I don&#039;t really want her to dress sexy in public with me. She&#039;s curvy enough that she could be in a burlap sack and look hot. Seeing my mom in lingerie and a tight dress and stuff like that has been pretty insane though. After we started having sex regularly, we also started buying ourselves sex stuff like socks/lingerie. My mom doesn&#039;t have to try very hard to turn me on, but she does do that now more openly.

What escalation happened there?</span><br>Yup, around the time we got to the massages, she started to message and call me a lot more. She sort of invited herself to my place for tea and stuff a few times. There was a weird energy when walked over to my place the first time. Didn&#039;t talk much as we walked, she put her hand under mine and we walked with arms locked for a while, like an old couple. At my place she took her huge jacket off, and she was wearing some new clothes, a lot more thinner and tighter on her, more revealing. No bra clearly. She wore some weird new pants, beigeish and I could see through them a little. I had not seen her in that type of clothes in years. When she took her boots off, I noticed how small she looked at my place, she is pretty short. It kind of felt like a female friend came over. We made some tea and talked. Our talking was very different from normal, very different topics and she looked at my eyes constantly. She didn&#039;t really seem to listen, more like waiting for something to happen. I was sort of confused, I was about to post here about that for tips on what to do, but I guess it didn&#039;t matter. <br>Later we repeated the same thing, she came over a few times. We got more relaxed and watched some tv too and got wine and ordered pizza. It felt like I was hanging out with a woman my own age. Seeing her sitting next to me in her low cut and tight shirt with her tits almost falling out was super hot. Every time I felt like she wanted to do something but had no idea what. Later we had sex many times at my place after our first time, I think she wanted us to do it there for the first time, away from home.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What escalation happened there?</span><br>Not much before the sex.

I remember playing with mom&#039;s tits again before we had sex.<br>Anyway, my sister came stay at mom&#039;s, so we didn&#039;t have any time alone really.

We even had a sauna the three of us, but with swimsuits like normal. Mom slipped off the top of hers in the shower while I was still there and I watched her wash her tits and belly while she talked to me. She pulled her top back up when my sister came back. Sister saw that, but didn&#039;t really react. <br><br>Later we were hanging out with mom in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning. I was pretty horny at this point, it had been like a week of not much happening, so I went for her butt. I sort of grabbed it when I came up to her from behind and put my hand on her hips. Asked her something, and then noticed my sister had walked in the room at some point while I had my back turned. I still don&#039;t know if she saw me touch mom&#039;s butt, but she definitely saw me having my hand very intimately on her hips, basically hugging her from above.

She grabs her shirt on her belly and pulls down a bit and moves a bit higher on the bed, her cleavage pops out a lot. She again sees me looking.

Mom whispers something about a pillow and goes over me. She grabs a pillow behind my head, but her arms are short so she now buried my face in her bare cleavage while on me. She pulls the pillow, kind of fights it out, partly from under me, and her tits slap on my face the whole time.

Mom goes to sit back down on her side and I can see her eyes just staring at my dick. She lays down and grabs my arm, puts it back leaning on her belly and puts her right arm over my chest belly and caresses me. I can&#039;t pretend to be on my phone anymore and just leave it laying there. I kind of just look at her while she rubs my belly, my dick is getting uncomfortably hard. Her cleavage is still slipping out right next to my face. I just move over just a little and my face is now on her tits, skin against my cheek. I move my lips towards them, almost kiss them. Mom is still rubbing my chest, lower and lower, pushing her tits into me every stroke. Her hand goes almost down into my pants soon and her I&#039;m basically kissing her tits. She leans back and lifts up her shirt to pull her tits out, and lays back down. I nearly cum just from the sight. All thought has left my mind and I just start sucking on her nipples. She sort of guides my hand to play with her tits and pulls her shirt up more. I put my hands on her tits and recreate every fantasy of touching them. She leans in to me and lifts my shirt up a little. She goes back to rubbing my belly, going down more. Tits in my face, still sucking and squeezing her nipples. She slips her hand in my pants and around my cock. I feel every little crease and callus of her fingers on me. She wraps her hand around it and caresses it, not jerking me off, more like trying out what my dick feels like, what it&#039;s shape is. Goes for my balls too, really just feeling around and taking her time before she pulls my pants down a little. I pull them down more and take of my shirt too.

Her tits squish into my side, I can feel her hard nipples tickling me. I slide my hand over her hips and put my hand into her waistband. Only the shock of it all is keeping me from cumming. After a few seconds (felt like minutes) I settle down a little and realize this is it, I can do anything with her. I want to do more with her body before we have to stop, my sister could come out of her room any second. I pull her neck to lay her down again. I go to suck on her nipples while she lays on her back and I put my hand in her pants. I run my hand over her bush and mound, it feels incredible, the most sexual thing I&#039;ve felt in my hands. I sort of squeeze her whole pussy. I adjust position to be closer and put my hands over her panties. I notice they are dripping wet, I&#039;ve never felt anyone be that wet. I slightly pull down on her pants and panties, and she pulls them down for me, up to the middle of her thigh. My mom is now (almost) fully naked with me and I&#039;m playing with her pussy while sucking on her tits. Her hands just look for my body and touch me anywhere they can. I run my fingers around her mound and hole, almost teasing her like she did to me. Just feeling around, trying what it feels like. I slip my finger in a little.

My mom is getting sweaty in the face and blushed, she&#039;s on the edge too. I stop touching mom. She keeps jerkin me and looks at my dick, almost waiting. I put my hand on her hand and stop her. I move over to her legs and go to pull her pants off. Mom pulls her knees up and takes them off more. I pull her closer to the middle of the bed and get the pants off completely. My dick is already pointing at her and I&#039;m moving over her. She spreads her legs and I grab her by the back her thighs to push them down and out more. I&#039;ve never seen her face like that, eyes wide open like in horror, but eyebrows like she&#039;s in ecstasy, her mouth is like fighting not to make noise. I go to push my dick in her, press my dickhead on her wet hole. I push a little, she feels like the tightest hole ever and I&#039;m confused. I try to push in and she almost feels like she&#039;s trying to push me back out. When I feel her &quot;pushing&quot; being a pulse, I realize that she had already went over the edge and was cumming hard. Her hands sort of grasp me and I get that she wants me in her, even if I have to force it. I push harder, it&#039;s easy when my dick is hard as a steel pole. I fight myself in, only feeling in my body is that I need to go as deep in her as humanly possible. After getting my head in, the pulse pushing me out turns into a suck in. It slips right in there, all the way in. I pull back few times, feels like it pulls me back in. I hear a slimy slapping sound at the end of every thrust. Feels almost like I&#039;m hurting mom by pushing so hard inside her, with all my strength.

She later told me that she somehow came just from the feeling of mentally giving in and physically spreading her legs, and me pushing them down by the back of her thighs with my hands. Her orgasm felt insane because she came basically without any touch, so all she could feel down there at first was just herself cumming which made her basically begin to cum again and again from the feeling of the orgasm itself.

I want to listen to her voice and feel the warmth of her lips and her love and I wanna hear her laugh. and I want to hold her hand.<br>I just want to be with her.<br>even being in the same room with her would feel like i&#039;d died and gone straight to Heaven. <br>and.... something else that hurts me, she&#039;s in a canon relationship. which kind of stings. but that won&#039;t stop me from loving her.<br>Lord willing I&#039;ll love her until i&#039;m dead and buried and carried back to my old Virginia home.<br>after all. &quot;till death do we part.&quot;<br>and i know every other waifufag ever has said this. but it doesn&#039;t change the fact that i&#039;m genuinely distraught she isn&#039;t real. <br><s>and even if she WAS real. the law wouldn&#039;t allow us to be together. which is ANOTHER layer of pain.<br></s><br>some days it feels like i&#039;m singin&#039; Hallelujah because i&#039;m alive and i&#039;m in love and others i&#039;ll be cursing God for ever giving me these feelings.

The notes are annotations from a priest explaining some more obscure stuff, helps when the texts seem to contradict or not make sense. For example, most of Chronicles was written post-Exile, and is basically the author trying to build up David and Solomon as examples of ideal Israelite kings, basically glossing over all the negative aspects of their reigns. It contains some things that were present in the Chroniclers time that weren&#039;t there before the Exile, such as the dwelling of the Ark of the Covenant having a sheet over the doorway rather than the bronze doors previously described (the doors and the Ark were looted by invaders shortly before the Exile itself).

People who take them expecting to be rid of their depression instantly get demoralized from the lack of immediate effect. Laypeople also thought that SSRIs worked through serotonin levels, and it&#039;s hard to blame them given what SSRI stands for, which makes it easier for low information people to attack SSRIs as being placebo (because of the long abandoned serotonin theory of depression getting &quot;debunked&quot; in the media recently for whatever reason), etc. <br>Anti-psychotics have significant side effects and the takers are usually prone to psychosis.
