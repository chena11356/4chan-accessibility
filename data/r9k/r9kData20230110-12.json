If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

It&#039;s really nice to know someone appreciates them. He means so much to me. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what are your thoughts on his portrayal in the ps2 game named after him? i once had a friend who told me that it ruined his character </span><br>Here&#039;s a TL;DR.<br>Well, Shadow&#039;s game was kind of an...exception, writing/character wise. <br>See, from 2001 - 2009, Shadow was almost always written by Shiro Maekawa, who created the character. Maekawa is responsible for the best portrayals of Shadow bar none and nearly everyone agrees. <br>Shadow&#039;s game, however, was written by Takashi Iizuka (current head of Sonic Team). Iizuka also had a part in creating Shadow. Shadow, when written by Iizuka, is characterized differently than when written by Maekawa. <br>In my honest opinion, Iizuka&#039;s Shadow is boring. Something about him, it&#039;s just not as appealing, like they removed some of the depth. He&#039;s just &quot;serious: the character&quot;. There&#039;s hardly any of that cute snark and pompous almost poetic disposition. The voice change didn&#039;t help, it was Griffith&#039;s first time voicing Shadow in a game and so came off as flat. And that&#039;s just the JP version too. <br>Now the English dub of the game? Where he&#039;s all like, &quot;This is like taking candy from a baby, which is fine by me&quot;? Now THAT leaves a bad taste in my mouth. You want to know why? Because not only was this flanderized edgy stuff not in the original, but it ruined Shadow&#039;s perception among the general public FOREVER. He&#039;s a JOKE to them. I get asked if I love Shadow ironically. Hehe funny edgy edgehog says edgy lines and cocks a SMG, takes candy from babies, damn damn damn<br>And this ruined perception wormed its way into the actual games.

After psychedelics I find myself kinder and more empathic to trannies, niggers, leftists and even jews as my brothers, deceived and misguided and doing their best from their own perspective, yet still believe some lifeforms are closer to enlightenment than others as they experience reincarnation. And how could I know the truth of this universal system and judge myself as closer to enlightenment? The more I try to get it, the more I realize the importance of the physical world.

I don&#039;t believe in giving children adhd meds because there&#039;s no point apart from managing potentially extreme behavioural issues. not only did the hyperactivity remain, but the loss of concentration, motivation, organisation, impulse control, short term memory, ability to socialise all massively increased. and no I didn&#039;t grow up stuck to a TV or playing vidya or on a computer unsupervised. I grew up in the countryside and spent a lot of time outside. As I got older and the all the above negatives effects started happening I just withdrew from everything and stayed in my room reading and listening to music. I didn&#039;t start an internet addiction until I was about 13 by which point I had been aware of symptoms for years. If had been given meds at that point my life would be completely different now. I wouldn&#039;t have spent my entire not really doing anything. I had every opportunity given to me to succeed except parents that did not believe adhd wasn&#039;t real. it wasn&#039;t until I was 21 and several years deep into frequent drug use that I worked out I had adhd. only now am I being prescribed meds and its made me realise how much of my life has passed by without achieving anything whilst watching my friends and siblings continue to succeed. even now with stimulants I just don&#039;t have the motivation to catch up with people my age. I dropped out of uni twice because I can&#039;t even focus on things I&#039;m interested in.

Like bro, I understand fully that no woman wants me, this makes me too angry to even watch porn and fap anymore, why do you call me a coper like a dickhead? What am I to do if women don&#039;t like me but look towards other endeavours in life and spend my life and my time without sex? Sure it would be great to have a girlfriend but what am I do to according to you, but focus on other things other than sex? Yes, I forbid sex from my life because I can&#039;t get it, woooo what did I just did, right? Why splash my face with sex like porn and masturbation and escorts, knowing fully well I will never have a gf? Now THAT would be coping. I would rather no have any taste of sex at all in my life and not a single sexual thought in my head, just push through these 50 more years I have on this planet and that&#039;s the end of it, it&#039;s not like I could get the sex if I tried really hard. Because that&#039;s your reasoning. You say I miss out as if I have any fucking chance at getting it or ever had any chances, it never began my friend. If I am on this planet, and I know for sure I will die one day, might aswell push through these 50 years, as miserable as it will be. I belive suicide is the ultimate cope and only faggots suicide, suiciding is like saying &quot;you can fuck me in the ass and I will suck your dick&quot; to me. And the fact that there are capable havers of sex choosing other things to focus on in life (even elon musk said so much energy is put towards having sex, a purely reproductive act) proves that life is liveable without sex. Also, only an atheist would be blasphemous enough to tell god he did such a bad job at creating the world that it&#039;s unlivable without sex.

Chubbiness acceptable though. <br><br>He would be super into the local punk scene, always bringing me to the dumbest shows. Probably a free lance artist for some of the bands, and would almost always work merch stands and let me hang around and maybe sneak a free T-Shirt. Meet drummers and guitarists. Probably also in a band himself, and would allow him and his band buddies to practice in my moms garage all the time. <br><br>Straight edge, but wasn&#039;t always. Not judgmental about others drug habits though, and allows everyone to go through their own journey with substance abuse. &quot;Natural junkie&quot; ( weed, shrooms etc. no pills, powders, chemicals ). Kind of an asshole gatekeeper, but knows enough about the topic it&#039;s respectable. <br><br>Makes fun of me sometimes, in a joking manner. Over confident ( borderline arrogant ). Really witty and charismatic, able to make people like him just like that to overcompensate for my shyness. Will always light a chag up after sex, without hesitation. A similarly matched libido to my own ( high ). <br><br>A big flirt, but not necessarily a romantic. No grand gestures or anything, big poems about love or whatever, but will introduce me to friends as &quot;his love&quot; or something cheesy, Big fan of pet names, almost never uses my actual name even in arguments.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>DUDU", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673346616452976, "time": 1673346616, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 71768669, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:31:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>DUDU", "time": 1673346691, "resto": 71768661}, {"no": 71768762, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:51:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/r9k/thread/71755814#p71761809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71761809</a><br><br>Hello, HomuraAnon. I was already asleep when you posted, hopefully you find your way back.<br><br>I am not quite sure if you need an answer to your question or if it was a rhetorical question. I&#039;ll answer anyway.<br><br>Having bonds with peoole that genuinely care about you and reach out to you would help tremendously. But, going by experience this isn&#039;t the case for most people here. They either never had anyone like that to begin with, which is another cause of their brokenness to begin with, or, if they had someone, they became estranged from them when thungs took a turn for the worse, which again made the situation even worse.<br><br>And once you are alone and fucked uo, noone will care about you. No waifu angel will appear from heaven to sqve you from your lonely, dark pit.<br>So the only way out is to claw your way back. And I cant say it enough, it is not about reacheing the place at the sun that already exists, it is the proesss of clawing your way away from the darkness that will make you a different person, that will inevitably change you for the better and thus create the place at the sun. You kinda forge the good place that doesn&#039;t yet exist by running into the unknown.<br><br>And once you do this for some time (around a year) you should start to feel less shit. And at some point you&#039;ll feel good enough about yourself, secure in your skin, with a firmly established personality that you&#039;ll be able to draw ppls attention, befriend them, maybe get a girl.<br><br>The hardewt part is to get going. As you said you do not enjoy anything, so why do it? This is the inertia you have to overcome. Like a car starting up. Normal people have kicked into higher gears since their childhood, but anyone with depression has to repeat that process of building momentum once again in adulthood.<br><br>Build habits, force yourself to do stuff regularly.

What europe decided to do when they became socialists after ww2 was to restructure their societies in a way that simply put left the bottom-dwellers in society behind, because the people basically just didn&#039;t want to have them anymore. Not every job can pay well, that&#039;s just a simple reality and there&#039;s simply nothing there can be done about it. But the jobs are still there and must be done by someone, right? By upgrading the jobs that &quot;lower-level&quot; people perform, the people really just slash away the lower-performing people who do those jobs, there&#039;s just not more to it, than that. Take construction snd tradie work, for example. The demands and wages have become so high now that only &quot;elite&quot; tier tradies are able to survive in that field and make a career out of it. In the past, everyone could be a tradie. Tradies drank beer on the job in the 1920&#039;s, for god&#039;s sakes. Now, tradies have suddenly become some kind of odd highly paid elite-tier group of people, for some reason. Why? Because of the large-hearted socialists, of course.

Only heaven and hell. Temptation is a voice in your head that wants you to die alone in a cold, cold pit, in the dark, separate. Animals live in existence and die alone. It is human beings who make fire and build crystal cities, fractal reflections of our minds on earth. So when you think of satan think of every evil thought your weakness led you to, every time you gave in to useless things and transient pleasure. The only truth on earth is what you build with your own two hands from the mud and filth. The only virtues were constructed by men in opposition to our base nature. Satan is a cope for weak men. Strength and virtue bring you close to the ideal man, adam kadmon, and to the divine nature. So be strong instead of weak. And its hard, and its natural to want to believe you were tempted and that there is a great enemy out there in the dark, who wishes you to fail and to suffer.

The records of 239 young primiparas (&lt; 16 years) and 148 older primiparas (18-29 years) were reviewed for demographic information, antepartum complications, mode of delivery, length of labor, episiotomy, lacerations, birthweight, and length of gestation. [...] The incidence of most antenatal complications (chronic hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension, placental abruption, placenta previa, premature rupture of the membranes, urinary tract infections, and anemia) were similar between the two groups. Preterm labor and contracted pelvis were more common among the young adolescent, while gestational diabetes was less common. The young primiparas were significantly (P &lt;. 05) less likely to have a Cesarean delivery and to lacerate with vaginal delivery. The length of labor and its stages were similar, as were overall birthweight and length of gestation. Thus, obstetric concerns regarding pregnancy in early adolescence may be unfounded. With the exception of an increased risk for preterm labor, it appears that pregnancy, labor, and delivery do not pose inordinate obstetric and medical risk to the very young adolescent primipara.&quot;", "filename": "1672917093351192", "ext": ".webm", "w": 576, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673338034128794, "time": 1673338034, "md5": "8u04SY4WOld/SouGQ2DL9w==", "fsize": 923851, "resto": 71767519}, {"no": 71768319, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)04:26:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71767720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71767720</a><br>Wrong.
