Prototaxites was originally mistaken to be a type of yew, thus their taxonomic name which means &quot;first yew.&quot; However, the microstructure of the fossils revealed that it was nothing quite like a plant but instead a type of fungus. It&#039;s not entirely clear if prototaxites utilized photosynthesis, as there are microfossils showing what appear to be algae within its cells, and additionally prototaxites are theorized to be most closely related to lichens who are photosynthetic due to their algae symbionts.

If you think getting knocked up and babytrapping a scrote is the ultimate 4d chess move you&#039;re even dumber than a man.

One I know it has to tie in with an odd thing I have going on where I&#039;ve always wanted to be an older woman. Like, even as far back as when I was a kid I remember wanting to be an older lady, and when I was a preteen/teen and first started masturbating (and ever since to this day) in my fantasies I am always like in my mid-30s. I don&#039;t know why. I just have always imagined myself as being that age, it turns me on more than imagining myself at the age I was/am. I really like young men like senior in high school/college age boys too.<br>I like the intimacy of it I guess, it always seemed so sweet to me. Mother and son already feels like one of the closest possible relationships two human beings can ever possibly have. There&#039;s a sense of security and tenderness I suppose. There&#039;s already no one on earth you could love more than your own child. Making a regular male partner happy is nice, sure, but in my observation, mothers just light up to see their boys happy. I imagine it as like a whole new level of fulfillment and warmth knowing you can be the one that makes him happy.<br>Power reversal is also kind of hot. Saying &quot;humiliation&quot; sounds almost wrong but that&#039;s the best word I can think of. Like, you do truly love him and all, but going from a position of authority to one day getting your insides wrecked by the same person you&#039;re supposed to have authority over I imagine is degrading and a bit embarrassing - but loving and comforting at the same time. I also like similar dynamics like older boss office lady getting bent by the young college intern boy, female teacher/boy student etc, but the mom/son dynamic is special because unlike those there&#039;s a really strong emotional element there.", "time": 1675439925, "resto": 72078715, "filedeleted": 1}, {"no": 72079499, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)10:59:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72079478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72079478</a><br>pity sex for not being Chad", "time": 1675439942, "resto": 72078715}, {"no": 72079524, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:01:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72079430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72079430</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most of you have average to below average moms</span><br>that is true, so we just experience it vicariously thru anons that have hot moms and try to seduce them with various degrees of succes. retard.", "time": 1675440082, "resto": 72078715}, {"no": 72079529, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:01:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72079494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72079494</a><br>Just exclusively date younger guys.

I think sons are obligated to doggy style their moms in addition to mating press, you have to try and breed her from all angles. Like the son has decided in his head the only way mom can be truly his is to fuck her in every way conceivable, making sure there&#039;s no way they haven&#039;t done it so he can be the only thing on her mind when she&#039;s horny.<br><a href=\"#p72081417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72081417</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what happened, femanon?</span><br>Last relationship I met in college, church was back home in high school, mom took me with her every sunday.

I&#039;ve been using various forms of speed for the past few months, my plan is to use a therapeutic dose on the same level as ADHD meds in order to deal with my depressive symptoms (read: laziness).<br><br>I have been abusing the benzedrex inhalers though the last few days because I can&#039;t get any bona fide amphetamine (don&#039;t want to touch methamphetamine, not even orally at therapeutic adhd dose), and the problem is that propylhexedrine (the stimulant in them) is extremely similar to methamphetamine. It is much closer to methamphetamine than regular amphetamine is (chemically, propylhexedrine, like meth, has that N-methyl group that accounts for greater activity in various phenethylamines). It is my understanding that methamphetamine is much more euphoric and addictive because, beyond involving the big dopamine release, it also has strong serotonergic properties as well. I came to find out that propylhexedrine, unfortunately, shares this, and I don&#039;t want my use to get out of control.<br><br>It has been purported that NMDA receptor antagonists (mechanism of classic dissos) causes your tolerance to lower so long as they are present at the same time as a stimulant. I believe they are shown to specifically prevent the downregulation of dopamine receptors, not sure. Lot of discussion about it online elsewhere. I decided to test this claim this morning since I had some cough syrup containing DXM on hand-- I took some of it, and then drank my typical dose of propylhexedrine. It might just me that I took more than I thought I did, but I don&#039;t think so-- I think this NMDA antagonist tolerance thing is true.<br><br>I am feeling VERY, VERY speedy, as you can probably imagine given I&#039;ve just wrote this stupid long ass post.

I realized that I am a damaged person, and that at a young age I lost the ability to feel everyday joy that drives most normal people forward. I have felt empty and dead inside for years. Upon realizing this, I was able to feel something genuine for the first time in a long time.<br><br>Though, before in all my emptiness and languor, I did find one thing that could make me feel: great beauty. In all things, but it is mostly forms of serious art that does it for me.
