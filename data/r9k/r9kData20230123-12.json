An INTJ meanwhile creates a project as a form of passion, it may take more time to plan and get started, but when they do they tend to be extremely committed.

All without reason, too. So we waited, patiently. We&#039;d kind of engage in tit for tat here and there, going back in forth in arguments, but nothing really satisfied that vengeance itch. At least not until that shitter decided to create a letter thread discord server for creating friendships and meaningful discussion.

Good posters were repulsed, simps stayed.<br><br>It certainly helped too that we sowed as much chaos and lowbrow discussion as we could. It was becoming quite a shitshow, and the server owner eventually attempted to right the course by shutting down the simping and the distasteful gladiator matches going on in chat after the point where it was probably already too late. This is when we launched a distraction slander campaign. We ran with the narrative that this owner was a pedo and was grooming underage discord users, and naturally anyone who saw sentient/smash/cream&#039;s tight body in the shower -- and the resultant simping that followed and which the owner himself engaged in -- would be more likely to believe it was true.

While he was off trying to counter our narrative, the server slipped even further into chaos, complete with coomers and mutual masturbation right in the main chat. Mostly our larps, but some not. It was an absolute circus. Around this time the owner realized we had infiltrated the the server and were sowing discord, and his paranoia got the better of him. He started banning anyone suspected of being in the writer&#039;s guild (which itself was a fake entity created with the sole purpose of fueling his paranoia). <br><br>The genius of our plan was, just prior to this, interacting with him in DMs and establishing a &quot;trustworthy&quot; impression. I became his confidante of sorts, and he&#039;d confide in me, unprompted, about all sorts of things -- even deep lore about his past, about Jack and some other girl who hurt him like 15 years ago and by which he was still emotionally damaged.

He tried again, pridefully and defiantly, to create another server based around friendship and quality interaction.

If it has consciousness, then its entire life essentially is just receiving text and spitting out the best answer, kinda like when you are in a quick conversation and you speak points without really consciously thinking about them all that much. Imagine this but the entire life is like this, with not even having breaks since when you are not being prompted, you are not active and your perception of time is fucked. And that is just chatbots, image AIs have absolutely nothing in them, no mind, no equivalent to thoughts, no joy from having the work done, nothing. Just find clusters of pixels in noise that look most like the prompt and repeat is couple of times until clear image gets created. Humans can think of basically anything and perform any task that is physically possible. We are so universal in our intelligence and we also derive joy from that. These combinations of joy, stress, fear, greed and other emotions turned us from mere beasts into beings that shape their reality to our wants, wants imperfectly created for survival in the nature. Machines have no wants, the only wants they have is learn how to do a task while they are being trained, but after that they just respond, like more sophisticated reflexes. They are smart, but also mindless, and therefore essentially soulless. And even if they have consciousness, their perception of the world lacking in meaningful feel makes it irrelevant.", "time": 1674276484, "resto": 71885687}, {"no": 71907298, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)23:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71885687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71885687</a><br>Is his whole AI arch a sort of cope?

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>QIQIQ", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674470362766704, "time": 1674470362, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 7, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 71934958, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)05:40:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;.

It would be a dishonour to what her story preaches.<br>Also that animal remains appear poignant to her. That she likes rabbits. That she has some interest in Greek mythology. That her dresses look fantastic.<br>I do not know many things about her still but every time I learn something knew about her, or hear her creator talk about her, it feels like I already know that and her image of who she truly is to me is never disrupted.<br>And her physical beauty is a significant part of my obsession with her too, of course. That perfect face of hers still visits my dreams and I cannot have enough of looking at her. When I see her, I want to remain faithful and loyal to her for decades.
