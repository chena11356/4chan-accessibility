A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1672646776467430, "time": 1672646776, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "71628227", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 71657183, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:07:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks.

Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>AXAXA", "time": 1672646826, "resto": 71657177}, {"no": 71657197, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:09:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71657177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71657177</a><br><a href=\"#p71657183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71657183</a><br>No, fuck you, I don&#039;t do any of this bullshit and my life rocks.

Just a dull longing in my heart whenever I think of him. Sometimes before I go to sleep there&#039;s a passing thought that I won&#039;t wake up in his arms. And sometimes when I think of how long I&#039;ve loved him I idly think how, in all likelihood, I&#039;ll have some amount of feelings for him until the day I die. I can&#039;t tell the future, of course, so it&#039;d be a bit presumptuous to say I&#039;ll never fall out of love. But I think, 9 years now, it&#039;s withstood the test of time. Decade old feelings don&#039;t just go away, do they?<br>Maybe I&#039;m coping or whatever. That&#039;s alright. The thought of my arm lightly draped over his small but strong frame fills me with a sense of contentment, not unlike the feeling of a blanket draped over me. And sometimes it fills me with an excitement of sorts. I need to stop thinking about him so hard, because I realize my heart is pounding and I can&#039;t relax to sleep. <br>It&#039;s become second nature to me to pick apart things with autistic precision to get a little crumb of information about his life. Sometimes I feel like my brain is a living archive of information about him, there&#039;s nobody I know of who is aware of him like I am, or so I tell myself. Everything he&#039;s ever said, done, all dissected by me in every way possible. Everything committed to memory so I can pull it out like a file in a file cabinet at a moment&#039;s notice. <br>Maybe he&#039;d find that creepy. Maybe he&#039;d wonder what I find in him. It&#039;s hard to put into words at times but once I get going I can&#039;t stop, I can&#039;t stop rambling on and on about this rat that&#039;s affected my heart in the very deepest way he possibly could&#039;ve. <br>I imagine his smell, the thought of that musky lavender clouding my brain like brown noise. Even his imagined scent activates something primal in the very deepest parts of my brain I can&#039;t control. I can&#039;t control myself when I think of him.

Of course there are exceptions to this and you start seeing more and more thots come up with their cashapps and of links, generally they have way lower standards than any dating app. Mind you, you still need to meet a minimal threshold in looks to get a response.</span><br>https://archive.4plebs.org/trv/thre<wbr>ad/2269722/<br>/trv/ does/did have a lot of threads on the topic as well.", "filename": "620", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 393, "h": 700, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672647941490206, "time": 1672647941, "md5": "li4PA+Ft0sZq8/ewBPP3RA==", "fsize": 101195, "resto": 71655156}, {"no": 71657404, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:32:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71657345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71657345</a><br>no thanks, wtf is this?", "time": 1672648328, "resto": 71655156}, {"no": 71657454, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:38:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71657404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71657404</a><br>not me at least. don&#039;t talk to the esl sea women unless you&#039;re looking for a quick fuck.

The trans thing has nothing to do with it, she just happens to be trans. I dunno, do any of you follow any trans people? You&#039;d probably get it then.

At minor intersections, when a car approaches the minor end, the light will wait 10 seconds, and then change the light if there is a break in traffic.

On EW streets, if a car approaches a red left arrow, and no other traffic is present, the light will just turn green for them. On NS streets, if the same happens, the light will cycle back around to the EW street, before cycling again and giving the left turn arrow. Remember, default state is red for NS and green for EW. In the total absense of traffic, the light will stay in this state indefinitely.<br>Emergency preemption: Immediate change to give the green light in both directions to the street the emergency vehicle is on. Left turns are completely skipped.
