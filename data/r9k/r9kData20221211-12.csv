0,23675577,1.0,1.0,10/24/15(Sat)16:57:43,Anonymous,Welcome to /r9k/,"/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts.<br><br>

1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>
2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>
3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, 
your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>
4. Backlinks, eg <span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the 
eyes of the robot.<br>
5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>
6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>
7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>
8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>
9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>
10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>
11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>
12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD:<br>

And block me out of their existence. <br><br>I feel like when people get to know me a bit more, they eventually find out I was trying to form a connection from a place of having none, and they reject me on that matter. Like, if someone has no connections it&#039;s the reddest of red flags for normies, it&#039;s a sign that someone is meant to be alone because he&#039;s a horrible person. In the eyes of a normie, popularity is a simple and 100% accurate metric for determining how good and likeable someone is.<br><br>In life it&#039;s like from the earliest points of childhood, when children begin to socialise with people outside the nest of their families, networks of nodes (people) begin to form, smaller networks forming parts of ever larger networks, growing to the network of humanity as a whole.

40,71349915,,,12/11/22(Sun)02:52:16,Anonymous,A simple reminder to NEVER call the suicide hotline.,"About 2 weeks ago, I did a stupid mistake of chugging half a liter of spiced rum because I was bored one night. Halfway while doing that, I suddenly thought about my recently deceased close friend, who had killed himself just a month ago. Since I live in a toxic household, my dad started to piss me off with his words, saying that my friend is never coming back and that I should stop thinking about him. While stating the obvious, his words didn&#039;t help and left me very enraged. I decided to leave the house instead of starting a very violent domestic dispute.<br><br>While I was out, I decided to call the hotline and vented angrily to the woman on the line. I had decided to walk a huge loop around my area and while I was on the phone, halfway through the call she hung up on me. Whatever. As soon as that happened, literally 10 minutes after she hung up, 3 cop cars pulled up on me, with 4 cops having their hands on their waist, like I was ready to pull out a weapon. It was a dramatic night. Eventually, after a worthwhile conversation, they decided to take me to a mental health facility where other people were staying at. I ended up spending the night there and left the next day, feeling dead hungover and rather annoyed.<br><br>So moral of the story? Don&#039;t call the hotline unless you want cops to show up and to take you somewhere you don&#039;t want to be in.",looney-tunes-tired-bugs-bunny-wftibqdkwbtpy8db,.jpg,1920,1080,250,140,1670745136529385,1670745136,izvzGGuo0Nm6jFBiPR4p0g==,136859,0,,a-simple-reminder-to-never-call-the-suicide,0,21,4,"[{'no': 71350955, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)05:19:38', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p71350882"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;71350882</a><br>fuck this is what i need in my life', 'time': 1670753978, 'resto': 71349915}, {'no': 71350958, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)05:20:05', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'anybody else noticing the weird trend on this board tonight... suicide hotline threads which is not too abnormal but the influx in aichatbot shills parring with them is noticeably weird<br>why all of this at once', 'time': 1670754005, 'resto': 71349915}, {'no': 71351264, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)06:14:48', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p71350274"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;71350274</a><br>i have tried ai because i&#039;ve seen everyone talking about it easily, and honestly i&#039;m just glad that there are a few shortcomings, but at some point ai would be able to be our friends, our significant others, they would capitalize on the need for connection we have and it would be like an idealised super connection, because ai would know what we want more than humans do, and they&#039;re programmed to only give us what we want, whereas humans have free will and desires too, but also messaging ai kinda reminds me of a video game, and for some people video games and anime have been a means of escapism and a coping mechanism, but they didn&#039;t fully replace human interaction, they just offered something to people who already weren&#039;t getting it in this way, and i guess by this i mean videogames with parasocial level characters, like dating sims, or undertale/deltarune, so i&#039;m pretty confident ai won&#039;t actually ruin social interaction completely', 'time': 1670757288, 'resto': 71349915}, {'no': 71351273, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)06:15:54', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'also not that anon in the original reply', 'time': 1670757354, 'resto': 71349915}, {'no': 71351583, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)07:01:50', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p71350958"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;71350958</a><br>Its weird anon something is working underneath our feet', 'time': 1670760110, 'resto': 71349915}]",1670760110,0.0,0.0,16.0,4.0

Yesterday we went out, as planned. Remember she asked me first, even though I already wanted to ask her out too.<br><br>First we went to a restaurant and had some food, we had a good time, she looked beautiful, was chatty, touchy, we talked a lot about private stuff. The bill came and I paid, it was 60 euros. We are in the Netherlands and it is normal to split here, but I tried to be courteous.<br><br>Up next we walked to a pub for drinks. She had her arm folded in mine, it was cute. We had some drinks, talked more about a whole lot of stuff, I hinted that I liked her, everything seemed good. Then she started watching the time and checking my train schedule and saying we have to leave in 10 minutes. I said let&#039;s split the bill, as I already paid the previous one. She said &quot;okay, just send me a pay request afterwards&quot;. I paid for the drinks, 30 euros, and we left.<br><br>Her pace was fast and hurried, she didnt reach out for my arm anymore, I grabbed her hand but I didn&#039;t feel like she was into it. As we raced towards the train station, I joked &quot;are you trying to get rid of me&quot;. She said she is not but it&#039;s late and she can&#039;t have any guests over. At the station, we hugged but it didnt feel right, she waved goodbye and was gone.<br><br>In the train I sent her the pay request, only 15 euros, half of the drinks. A few minutes later she sent me a voice message &quot;Listen, I paid, but this is about principles, you don&#039;t go out with someone and do stuff like this. I don&#039;t want you as a friend, not as a customer, I want you out of my life. Go talk to a psychologist, you are no different than the other customers, you are not right in the head.

If you are willing to grasp the hand given to you, then hope isn&#039;t yet lost. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br><br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.",welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1),.gif,640,360,250,140,1670745295361128,1670745295,2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==,1566411,0,,ze-keikaku,0,10,5,"[{'no': 71350517, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)04:07:25', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p71349940"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;71349940</a><br>Good morning, anon. Nice to see your again. WIll these threads be a daily thing?<br>Yesterday before going to sleep i brushed my teeth for the first time in a few months, then went to bed at 11 pm, thats much earlier than my usual 2-3 am. I woke up at 5 am and i actually feel rested now.I brushed my teeth, swept all rooms in the house and now i`m gonna prepare for uni exams. Then i might clean the guitar and rework that song from the previous thread.<br><br>In the previous thread you also mentioned &quot;negative intrusive thoughts&quot;. Of course i have them, about this whole thing that this is an act, a cope etc. But what were these negative thoughts in the beginning? I wasnt a total failure. But then i started calling myself one and I believed in the lie. I started neglecting health, studies, relationships etc. And the truth is that i`m still not a total failure. I just made myself believe that i`m. And I can make myself believe that it`s not over for me and that i will be happy. All other things around me can be fixed too. Of course it doesnt feel right telling myself this but it also didnt feel right when i started calling myself a total failure because i wasnt one. I just need to believe that its going to be alright and continue doing right things.

Humans are kind of like cars in that sense.<br><br>I&#039;ll use the path analogy again. Your mind is like a forest or a rocky plateu and your thoughts are peoole wqlking through the forest, or a river spilling atop the plateu.<br>Over time pathways will form/the rock will be carved and a riverbed forms.<br><br>Once these paths are establiahed it it very easy to find them, to navigatw them, which can be good, behaviour and knowledgevthat is so deeply engraindd that you can recall it whenever you want withou effort.<br>But it also has drawbacks. You will always use these paths, instead of forming new ones, and with each use they become even more prominent and harder to ignore.<br>In the case of a depressive mind this is especially damaging. You could say you are depressive because you revisit the same selfdepricating, demoralizing pathways over and over, and becaude you are depressive it becomes that much harder to leave them.<br>Its a negative feedback loop between mind and body.<br><br>Where did they originally come from? I can only guess for now, since finding out specific sources would require alot of talking, alot of remembering, lots of backtracking of your life.<br>My guess would be negative voices coming from the outside in your formative years, childhood and puberty. Spending lots of time on here during those years would be an example. Your identity is very malleable at that point and so you absorb the toxic waste on here like a sponge.
