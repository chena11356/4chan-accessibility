Look at the porn industry, look at how men treat women, look at how much men admire their male peers and other male role models.

The &quot;straightest&quot; moids I&#039;ve known (both online and IRL) have been obsessing over penis in some way or other Men&#039;s insecurities and thoughts are solely limited to penis. The humor OP posted and the snow cock and balls you mentioned nona are all examples of that. When it comes to humor the first most logical thought to pop up in the male brain is male genitalia because it is the most satisfying and safe reminder of their own genitalia for them that they can cling to. Their homolust is first centered at themselves (narcissim) and then at other men (whore). Moids tend to evaluate their male friendships as much more emotionally fulfilling, it is something I have been seeing from the dawn of time. Even yesterday on 4shit I&#039;ve seen moids complain that they can&#039;t have female friendships because to them women are just a piece of meat with no thoughts only there to fulfill their hypothesised idea of what heterosexual sex should be. They can only form an emotional connection with men. It is something that has moids themselves say over and over again. I&#039;ve known moids tell me how men like to masturbate with each other in a friendly way, how they would help each other out while watching porn. That it is normal male behavior. All these men that told me that were straight-identifying. This solely solidifies my belief that there are no straight men and even if they have a girlfriend it is out of social expectations and genetic-anxiety (all men still want to cum into something warm and slimy in the end).

I wouldn&#039;t say it should be &quot;discarded&quot;, but rather that you should add to it. It&#039;s sort of like learning mathematics, you don&#039;t discard the teachings you learned from addition once you move on to subtraction or multiplication, etc. But rather you stop focusing on those older concepts, and focus on the new problems which utilize the knowledge you&#039;ve gained from your studies. <br>At some point the theory becomes in a sense &quot;useless&quot;. You cannot have a purely theoretical knowledge that is also useful. It has to be applied in some manner or form, which makes it no longer purely theoretical. But, if you&#039;re entirely focused on the theory you can never actually apply the theory to your own life, which is the purpose of the theory. <br><br>Another way to think about it is like learning an instrument. You can study music theory, or the theories behind your specific instrument, but you will never play whatever instrument if you don&#039;t put that study to practice. The same concept applies to MBTI (and everything in life). <br>The purpose of the theory is to be applied to and used in your life in a manner that allows you to easily understand the motives of other people and yourself, with the ultimate goal of understanding yourself so well that you can alter your behaviors in an attempt to make yourself &quot;the ideal person&quot;. The thing that should be discarded is the idea that you can only study and somehow improve. It doesn&#039;t work like that.<br><br>The theory is like the tutorial zone in a new video game.

The feeling of someone getting close to me is uncomfortable so I always create some distance whenever I feel it happening. In my case I don&#039;t really have a reason for it. I don&#039;t have skeletons in my closet that I don&#039;t want anyone finding out about or anxiety. I simply don&#039;t like the feeling of someone getting close to me.

When I latch on to someone I latch onto them hard. I more or less lose my mind and go insane when it comes to the person. However, I feel like even then that feeling of closeness isn&#039;t there. I am willing to give everything to the person I get attached to yet I don&#039;t feel that kind of closeness that has driven me away from more platonic relationships in the past. Once again, I assume it must be related to wanting a feeling of control, especially over my own mind.<br><br>But back to you. I know better than most that it&#039;s not easy if not damn near impossible to drown out feelings like yours. I will put it bluntly, you are acting insane and you are going to stay that way until this person returns your feelings or you manage to get over it. The only thing you can really do about that is recognize it and try to manage it so it doesn&#039;t slip out and scare him away.

Hypergamy explains why it is rare to see a woman with a low attractiveness ranking settle down with a man of equal or lesser attractiveness. it is also true that the inverse scenario, in which a man with a low attractiveness ranking is unable to secure a relationship with a woman of higher attractiveness, is also commonly observed.

These girls usually have been in ltr. I assume the sex at some point for them got boring and they decided to spice it up, and the sex ended up being pretty dirty. I&#039;ve even had one saying she likes both of us to shower before sex so everything is clean and smells fine and you can do whatever. At the same time, some of the ltr are the most boring ever in bed. Girls with high body counts have a huge advantage, they&#039;re less shy. Nothing is more annoying than a girl arching her back a weird way in case you see her butthole, or covering her chest if she has to go pee, odd things like that. The shyness can ruin it. I guess even worse is when that happens and you kind of go soft, then they feel like it&#039;s because of them and start having a conversation. So you completely lose your boner and they&#039;re like &quot;see anon! you&#039;re not attracted to me!&quot;.

For example we have plenty of results for various gene alterations that can improve lifespan, give immunity/resistance to certain diseases(That&#039;s what that Chinese doctor did for some embryos in regards to HIV iirc) and also remove certain congenital diseases from appearing in someone&#039;s offspring. There&#039;s also embryo selection where you essentially fertilize a bunch of embryos in vtiro and then compare the genetics of said embryos to pick which ones you want to keep. The latter I imagine wouldn&#039;t be to your liking since it&#039;s the termination of life at its very root. Some of the gene editting stuff is also more risky, the Chinese doctor got flack because crispr can also cause massive deletions of segments of DNA instead of just replacing a segment with what you want.", "time": 1671761633, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511798, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:25:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511663</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;which games? any maps you can post</span><br>sure, it&#039;s for games using the source engine like Garry&#039;s mod, half-life 2 etc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also, I would say I like bike rides but..</span><br>I don&#039;t really do it as a form of exercise I just enjoy riding around and the health benefits are just a bonus", "filename": "oldroom", "ext": ".png", "w": 1440, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671762324171270, "time": 1671762324, "md5": "1uocO/hHwl33YS0OvrcsXA==", "fsize": 1444313, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511828, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:28:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511483</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;conservative egirl</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;had sex with countless women</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;checks out</span><br>My political leanings have nothing to do with my sex life.", "time": 1671762488, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511868, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:31:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71504131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71504131</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gender</span><br>Female<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;age</span><br>24<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;height</span><br>5&#039;9<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weight</span><br>135-140 lbs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;race</span><br>White<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;color of eyes</span><br>Greenish-blue? idk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;color of hair</span><br>Blonde<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;color of skin</span><br>White<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how big is your cock / how big are your boobs</span><br>36D<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;occupation / job</span><br>Writer<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite food</span><br>Any sort of pasta or sushi<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite movie</span><br>End of Evangelion<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite book</span><br>Lolita<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite song</span><br>Alison by Slowdive<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;political ideology</span><br>Progressive on most issues, but I don&#039;t like trannies or minorities<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religion</span><br>Atheist<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bodycount</span><br>2 (one guy, one girl)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;describe yourself in 3 words</span><br>Dreamy, curious, passionate<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;describe your ideal partner in 3 words</span><br>Intelligent, romantic, easygoing <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;zodiac sign</span><br>Virgo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MBTI personality</span><br>INFP<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why are you on r9k?</span><br>More interesting people/conversations + freedom of speech", "time": 1671762712, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511901, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:35:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511483</a><br>content for my insta acc", "time": 1671762953, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511924, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:38:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511868</a><br>Writer?

I would say the curve to success is more exponential. You don&#039;t need group pics, you don&#039;t want just selfies, you don&#039;t want pics just inside. Girls will also look at the interior to figure out if you&#039;re at your parents or on your own, and probably judge it too. I&#039;ve said before over the year you can get enough pics just going on trips with your parents. When you go on a walk on thanksgiving, get a pic. If you&#039;re on a roadtrip, there will be a good time for a pics. Vacation, same thing. No one knows who took the pic if it&#039;s just of you. This is also assuming you have a decent haircut, correct clothes and so on. Dating is such a long ass thing to explain. Sometimes I think I should just write all my experiences down and put it online so others can read it. I, and others that will give advice online, want to help others figure it all out.

Lets say you&#039;re both tired and fall asleep, so no sex, it&#039;s such a nice time. So maybe after experience things like that I realize bodycount is just a society thing. It&#039;s a lot harder to find someone you love than it is to sleep with someone. Then there&#039;s the fact I&#039;ve slept with a lot of girls and realize so much of it is meaningless. So I assume the same with the girl. Essentially some connection with someone outweighs it all because that is so hard to find.

Guys are same but different, mostly their bottom line for dating apps like Tinder is sex usually in a push comes to shove sort of way and that probably works out more than trying to find a love connection because there&#039;s always someone just like you next week but they have a slightly more muscular build or are taller so it&#039;s easy to upgrade on in that sense. <br><br>Yes there are people who will say they met their wife/partner/etc from Tinder but those are usually exceptions to the rule.

I really should&#039;ve started studying this stuff ages ago! I know that eularyotes had mitochondria and that photosynthsisers had chloroplasts, but I had no idea that they were separate organisms that evolved as part of us. Nor did I know that cyanobacteria had a common ancestor with the chloroplasts.<br><br>I will definitely make sure to watch that video later as it does look pretty nice, but on a side note for now though, I must say that cyanobacteria are pretty interesting as the world&#039;s first photsynthesisers during the archaean I think, if I&#039;m not mistaken, they were also the cause of the snowball earth(s) yea?

Mitochondrion and chloroplasts are also neat in that they&#039;ve swapped bits of genetic code between them and their hosts. This is really neat as well because both of those endosymbionts use RNA to store their code whilst their hosts use DNA. My understanding of this is that it favors cooperation for future generations and helps to avoid endosymbiosis evolving into parasitism.<br><br>Cyanobacteria also might not have been the first photosynthesizers, there&#039;s a pretty good theory out there that the first photosynthesizers actually used a different kind of pigment and were anaerobic(which matches the conditions of early Earth better).
