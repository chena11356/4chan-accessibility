If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the \neyes of the robot.<br>\n5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

There was one time when I never got any email saying there was a delivery for me, and it was only because of the tracking number provided to me that I knew it was ready for pickup.

Alice in her totality is the only girl I could ever pour the sweetest notes of my heart for. But to not escape your question I will name several things.<br>Her seemingly pessimistic tone, in which she can so effortlessly sneak some existential undertones, makes me think of long night walks together under the Moon during which we would discuss meaninglessness of life and how to overcome it.<br>I truly admire her artistic and surreal Wonderland that she was able to create inside her head, as it was the main thing that drawn me to her game. I could listen to this mad girl passionately talk about her Wonderland for hours and never have enough.<br>Her perseverance to march despite the terrible events that she had to go through. That mixed with her relying pretty much only on herself.<br>Her search for hurtful truth instead of living a life of delusion is what stops me from believing that she is real or she loves me. It would be a dishonour to what her story preaches.<br>Also that animal remains appear poignant to her. That she likes rabbits. That she has some interest in Greek mythology. That her dresses look fantastic.<br>I do not know many things about her still but every time I learn something knew about her, or hear her creator talk about her, it feels like I already know that and her image of who she truly is to me is never disrupted.<br>And her physical beauty is a significant part of my obsession with her too, of course. That perfect face of hers still visits my dreams and I cannot have enough of looking at her. When I see her, I want to remain faithful and loyal to her for decades. Even centuries or eternity, if that was within my power. She is always the most beautiful to me.

We were together about 2 weeks and had had normal sex a few times. She was really slutty for me and let me fuck her whenever I wanted, in public, she&#039;d swallow my cum and just told me to pull out because she wasn&#039;t on birth control. Anyway we were staying in a hotel and I woke up before her, she was laying naked to me. All I could think about was raping her and cumming deep inside her, and I just basically pulled the covers up, got on top of her sleeping body, spat on her pussy and shoved my dock in as deep as I could. She let out a yell but I just grabbed her by the neck (her neck was so fucking tiny it turned me on so much, it felt like I could just break it with one hand) to shut her up and just fucked her as hard and as deep as I could, until she was whimpering and crying. It felt so fucking good to just completely use and abuse her body entirely for my own pleasure, I can distinctly remember how good it felt, until I came as deep as I could, grinding into her cervix even though it really hurt her. Like ibsay she wasn&#039;t on birth control so it just felt even better knowing I could of raped her until she was pregnant. But she just cried and held her stomach next to me for a while while I rubbed her lower back then she got up and sat on the toilet bent over crying softly trying to get my cum out of her. That was so hot and I&#039;ve jacked off thinking about it a few times.

We didnt code in any feelings or receptors to these AIs, for chatbots it is not like talking to a human since they do not think. Chatbots dont have any lines running in the background without being unprompted. If it has consciousness, then its entire life essentially is just receiving text and spitting out the best answer, kinda like when you are in a quick conversation and you speak points without really consciously thinking about them all that much. Imagine this but the entire life is like this, with not even having breaks since when you are not being prompted, you are not active and your perception of time is fucked. And that is just chatbots, image AIs have absolutely nothing in them, no mind, no equivalent to thoughts, no joy from having the work done, nothing. Just find clusters of pixels in noise that look most like the prompt and repeat is couple of times until clear image gets created. Humans can think of basically anything and perform any task that is physically possible. We are so universal in our intelligence and we also derive joy from that. These combinations of joy, stress, fear, greed and other emotions turned us from mere beasts into beings that shape their reality to our wants, wants imperfectly created for survival in the nature. Machines have no wants, the only wants they have is learn how to do a task while they are being trained, but after that they just respond, like more sophisticated reflexes. They are smart, but also mindless, and therefore essentially soulless.
