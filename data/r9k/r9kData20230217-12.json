I&#039;ve also been trying to learn guitar, mostly off and on. A good posture while playing will probably help with the bad back. Music is hard, I&#039;ve been writing my own music for years now, and I still don&#039;t consider myself to be great. It&#039;s just kinda fun to put my ideas down, so I don&#039;t worry about it too much. Continue singing!

Even if the song was complete booty cheeks, I&#039;d still sit down here and listen to it. I think the ideas the artist come up with, and the execution are really interesting and cool, no matter how &quot;bad&quot; it is. I think this way of thinking helps enable creativity, and less anxiety when sharing music. I was actually having a really shitty day today, nothing seemed to help me out. So, I decided to make this thread. Chilling here and listening to the music random people are willing to share, it just puts a big smile on my face. It makes me happy that there&#039;s a diverse spectrum of music people are making here. It makes me happy listening and to these ideas and sounds that I haven&#039;t hear before, and possibly will never hear again. Maybe that&#039;s cheesy, but I&#039;m usually very cynical and untrusting.

There are even studies saying that married men are far happier and more fulfilled than single men in every aspect of their lives, but a married woman&#039;s happiness is actually on average somewhat lower than that of a single woman.<br>In terms of intimacy and love, men need women far more than women need men. Women by contrast don&#039;t seem to care all that much about finding love, maybe it&#039;s like this additional neat benefit, but they can live comfortably without it (maybe due to the validation and support they receive from others).<br>Though it is probably also to some great extent the abundance of opportunities/choices for love that women are aware that they have (to the point that it&#039;s an almost universal aspect of the female experience to be indignantly angry about unwanted male romantic attention), which of course would lead to much lower desperation than that of a male who spends his life feeling worthless and trapped because no one will show any interest in him.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m actually jealous and wish I could lobotomize the part of my brain that is attracted to women and intimacy.</span><br>I relate to this as well.

some retard emotional and philosophical revelations i had about my problems, and that i was going to manage them with stimulant use.<br><br>some wise anon who seemed to have had a terrible history with stimulant or other hard drug abuse dug into me and did all of the correct things in order to scare me whilst in my altered state and warn me about the danger of addiction i was diving into head-first into. he refused to engage with my silly delusions or my fake, stimulant-induced good faith responses (i guess since its fake good i should say bad), and scared me enough to dump out all of the benzedrex i had left even though i had planned on not using again after that (because i thought i would have a steady supply of adderall instead, which is less harmful than propylhexedrine).<br><br>anyway, for reasons that would take awhile to explain, that event not too many days ago led me to find out that i have OCD, specifically a subtype Existential OCD which includes obsessions over existential/philosophical topics along with the absolute inability to tolerate uncertainty that characterizes OCD. i thought that my dysfunctional pacing around and &#039;thinking&#039; about the meaning of life for, at worst up to 6 hours but usually 1-2hrs a day was just my neurotic personality, but it turns out that its a neurotic pathology. go figure.<br><br>as can probably be figured from my writing, i am still taking stimulants and i must disappoint the anon that tried to get me to hard stop. i am not yet dependent, but that day will probably come soon-- thank you for trying to warn me, and i echo the warning to all others even though i have not fallen apart yet. i know now that my behavior and desire to use is an addiction, and for what it&#039;s worth i no longer deny that. im sorry to that anon, who probably remembers me if you&#039;re here.", "time": 1676289740, "resto": 72200880}, {"no": 72209386, "now":

mental problems prevent me from being productive. the OCD compulsions prevent me from enjoying things even when i am not compulsively performing them, since i am still obsessing about them.<br><br>i can&#039;t say it is only the OCD, because i have other problems too. the fact is that i have tried over the past few years very strongly to get my life together, but it continues to stay broken because i simply am not strong enough to do the right thing. this is not a justification for my use, this is an admission of weakness. an admission i probably would not be able to make if, as the previously mentioned anon had pointed out to me last time i stimposted, i wasn&#039;t extremely high on a drug that directly fires up my reward system.<br><br>my stimulant use has thus far made me able to be productive for time periods, certainly, however i recognize now that the main draw is of course how it just makes me feel good. one of the chilling things this anon said to me was something along the lines of &quot;with a high enough dose, you could receive news that would kill you with despair if you were sober, but still smile because your brain is all lit up from the drug&quot;. that was a truth i felt then enough to scare me to flush all of my retard-drug last time, and it is something i feel now. the OCD is still there while I am on stimulants, but it no longer inspires terrible agony inside of me. the drug cuts off the pain before it gets too deep and disables me, and it replaces it with that electric dopaminergic warmth. that is what i am addicted to, i suppose.<br><br>so, to anybody wondering about trying strong stimulants, i recommend you don&#039;t if you have bad mental problems (everybody on /r9k/) that you would like to be able to be free of. i liked what louis ck

but from what i gather there is addiction and there is hopeless addiction.<br><br>the first category seems to be filled with people who stay strongly in denial about their addiction but eventually come to terms with their behavior and understand that they are addicted, and try to beat the addiction. it seems that in many cases this takes time, and perhaps many fail, but they want to be helped and do stuff like go to rehab and try to be sober and whatnot<br><br>the second category seems to be filled with the people who, whether they are in denial or not, simply don&#039;t want to stop. they have no desire to stop-- i think these people often tend to be the ones to have nothing left to go back to when sober. they are the ones that don&#039;t want to be helped<br><br>i think i fall into this latter category. no doubt heartache and tears awaits me down this dark road i am staring down, but i think the fact is that i have nothing that makes me want to quit. if i stop doing stimulants i go back to the same life where most days i can&#039;t even get out of bed, where any productivity comes with the immense toll of fighting off my compulsions and ruminations, with the same pains over my own past events. even on stimulants, i still perform compulsions, but i am able to get some things done. i wrote about 4,000 words today. i have been studying mathematics again. but, again, mostly, the stimulants reduce the mental suffering that paralyzes me on most days sober. i don&#039;t choose addiction, even if i made the choices that lead to it. i just don&#039;t want to quit and i
