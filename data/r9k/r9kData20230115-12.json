If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

I also just feel like she was snubbed out of having a genuinely interesting character arc. Even if I remove my own feelings from the equation, wouldnt it have been a better reading experience to see her get her life in order? For context, the story starts with Aqua being kicked out by her parents (who we never see) for being 20 years old and not having a job (she is presented as a normal human and not a goddess) before moving in with kazuma, a childhood friend. Like imagine where you could go with that. Instead we get cheap plot lines where she gets treated as nothing more than a liability to our precious boy Kazuma.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>DJDJ", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673778767422801, "time": 1673778767, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 15, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 71832462, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)05:33:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>DJDJ", "time": 1673778825, "resto": 71832457}, {"no": 71832503, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)05:40:38", "name": "Ukranon", "com": "<a href=\"#p71832457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71832457</a><br>Hi, I went outside yesterday. Everything was Ok at first. I went to my English tutor who lives on the outskirts of the town to receive new books to work with. How did I feel wandering the streets? The same as I feel when I&#039;m inside my house. It didn&#039;t feel like I was outside, idk how to describe it. My body was outside, but my mind wasn&#039;t. Fortunately for me, I didn&#039;t meet anyone on my way there. But soon I ran out of luck. I hoped I&#039;d just take books and leave but no, she started lecturing me about importance of my future job, how I should study hard etc... Like I said my mind &quot;wasn&#039;t there&quot; at the present moment. I prayed that she would not ask me anything personal but that wasn&#039;t the case. She mentioned that my mom told her that I do nothing all day, don&#039;t go anywhere. And that was when I got extremely self-conscious and started nervously smiling like an idiot, drumming with my fingers and looking away from her. She suggested that we should renew our classes.(I stopped going there on feb24) And I agreed. Not that I could give her any other answer. So, every Friday I have to go there. Again.<br>And on my entire way home I was followed by a big fucker like picrel. And i really really fear dogs, they are one of reasons why I dont go outside. It didn&#039;t bark, or growl, or jump on me. It just followed me for 30 minutes.

In the past, I&#039;ve had coworkers who have been upset with me and avoid me outside of work. Sometimes it got to the point where they&#039;d show up to work and purposefully ignore me, they wouldn&#039;t say &quot;Hi&quot; or make eye contact, and I know the feeling that forms inside of you. You look over at them, but you don&#039;t want to look too long because you don&#039;t want to stare, so you just keep throwing them these occasional glares until they&#039;re gone, and while you&#039;re doing that, there&#039;s this blob that forms inside of you, it sinks your stomach and chills your blood and constricts your spine, because you know they&#039;re doing it on purpose and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.<br><br>This has happened to me twice. One of the issues I was able to resolve, but the other, I was unsuccessful with. I ended up trying to be rude towards them towards them in the end, just hoping that they&#039;d say something to me, but nothing ever happened. I know you&#039;re thinking it&#039;s hypocritical of me to say this after my previous suggestion, but my incident had a lot of background to it as well as a lot of moving pieces, so it was a fairly different situation, but the feeling was still there.<br><br>The only advice I can offer to you now is to carry on as best as possible, until things begin to change. Carrying on and persevering is the best thing to do, even if it feels impossible, even if every time you see him a little piece of you dies, even if the sadness you harbour inside your souls feels as if it will never subside, you gotta keep carrying on, and just keep making your way through the storm.

Still a virgin. Feels bad man. I&#039;m trying not to obsess over it because it wont do me no good, but at the same time I think that the normies I&#039;m trying to befriend at work and hobbies would cast me out if they found out. I think getting laid (through honorable means) is the final checkpoint for me to ascend from this place. Every other box has been checked out, on paper I look normal. Honestly I think it&#039;s the validation that I want. Just to feel like everyone else.<br>Ever since I started puberty I have never felt like a normal human being compared to others. I lived as a quasi-hikikomori from 14-22 because of my fucked up mother/family and fucked up mental health and all other things fucked up. I can&#039;t recall any happy memories from that age and wish to just forget everything.<br>Also the type of guys I hang out with are often jocks and it&#039;s pretty difficult to for me relate and fit in because most of the time the convos are about hooking up and sex and I got nothing to say about that so I&#039;ll just be anxious all the time about being interrogated because I&#039;m a terrible liar. So I&#039;ll just be quiet and people tell me I&#039;m a school shooter/npc/robot which is fun to hear.<br>I don&#039;t know man. I&#039;m not meeting women through my tiny social circles and I don&#039;t want to cold approach because that&#039;s just weird. I think I&#039;ll give tinder a go. I&#039;m not going to a fucking bar or club just to buy overpriced drinks and swivel 360 degrees in the hopes of a tiny crumb of pussy from some slag. That&#039;s even more sad.<br>Fuck this world. I just want to live in a medieval village where everyone knew each other and was more or less content to just to farm or make pottery or some shit. Yeah I would probably die by time I hit 40 but it&#039;s not like I really want to stay alive till my thirties now. Maybe I&#039;ll just volunteer to die in a war zone, start hitting drugs, idk.

Try 1000x. AI generated art is doing for the illustration world what Korean sweatshops originally did for animation (and it will also do the same thing for animation eventually). Artists may say &quot;oh, we&#039;re safe, AI can&#039;t draw hands,&quot; but it&#039;s going to be so easy for any commercial hack to just have AI do 98% of the work and then they just fix minor details on top of it. Artists, and creatives as a whole, will cease to exist as a career within the next 10 years, and I say this as someone who has spend 20+ years relentlessly pursuing music. I have a whole 1000 listens to an album I sunk a decade into, so I relate.<br><br>The only real creative projects that will be around will be collaborative, like movies and video games. You can currently push a button and make a song, a novel, or a drawing, but you need people to stick all those things together in the correct way to make something more multidisciplinary (i.e. a complete narrative experience). Eventually that too will become automated and all creative work will be reduced to the equivalent of just fixing a hand here and there. And it won&#039;t be paid.<br><br>One of the big arguments is always that jobs will adapt to AI. That&#039;s not true when the technology is actively designed to remove the human element, not to reintegrate it. Truck and cab drivers aren&#039;t being retrained as programmers, they&#039;re being cut.

They&#039;re a reflection of your skills and dedication as a student. In your other post you talked about how you recently realized differences between men and women. Performance in school and the workplace, and how that performance is interpreted, is a big one that most people don&#039;t get.<br><br>Academia and most workplaces tend to reward submission, rote memorization and following instructions/orders. Those are all things typically more suited for women than men. That&#039;s a big reason women tend to do better than men in school and some workplaces. But it&#039;s a mistake to assume those skills translate to intelligence. If you want something truly innovative, profound and deep it will almost always come from a man. Women are very good at memorizing and parroting what they have been told but their academic and professional knowledge is usually shallow and surface level. Men write the script women are memorizing. Men create institutions, women help to keep them running.<br><br>This difference between men and women stems from biology. Female IQ tends to cluster mostly around the 90-110 midwit range while men have more extreme outliers on both ends, meaning more male idiots but also more male geniuses. This doesn&#039;t mean every man is either an idiot or Einstein. There are plenty of male midwits too. But I&#039;d say 80-90% of people who are actually smart are men. Dumb people and midwits and smart people and men and women all have their purposes and need to coexist and work together, so don&#039;t interpret this as a &quot;women bad&quot; or &quot;everyone below X IQ should be purged&quot; rant. But it&#039;s bad for society and bad for humanity the feminine skills that lead to success in school and work are wrongly identified as intelligence by most people because that is filtering a lot of smart men out of academia and the workplace.", "filename": "ftm", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 754, "h": 768, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673646070539140, "time": 1673646070, "md5": "OgQUHr73aZqgBbLPIdYsdQ==", "fsize": 80671, "resto": 71804956}, {"no": 71811981, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)16:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71807250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71807250</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its super easy to get a boyfriend as a girl because there&#039;s always a lot of lonely guys</span><br>This in particular feels so vindicating to see a woman admit so plainly.
