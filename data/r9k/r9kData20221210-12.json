If you are willing to grasp the hand given to you, then hope isn&#039;t yet lost. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br><br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything alobg thise lines, thats where you proceed to go! <br>Do not ask yourself useless shit, like &quot;whats the use?

Blood is a highly valuable liquid, like how gold is valuable. Blood is valuable because it MAINTAINS life, and can be transfused to save one; one could call it &quot;liquid gold&quot;.<br><br>Secondly we have gold, which represents two things: literal gold, and urine. Liquid gold is valuable because gold itself is a precious metal, being used for jewelry, coinage, and other high-value purposes--Gold&#039;s high ductility, resistance to corrosion, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion-resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). Gold is also used in infrared shielding, production of colored glass, gold leafing, and tooth restoration. Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine. Why urine? In 1669 the German alchemist Hennig Brand boiled urine on his furnace until it broke down into phosphorous, which he thought could be used to create gold. Phosphorous led to the creation of matches, which are useful.<br><br>Thirdly we have white, which represents semen. Semen is valuable in the fact that it is stored in sperm banks, and is in high demand. Without it, none of us would be here, and the world as we know it would be far different.<br><br>Blood relates to the presidency in the fact that many presidents have been shot and bled, and many have made decisions which led to bloodshed or prevented bloodshed. Every presidential vehicle comes stocked with liters of the current president&#039;s blood type. Every president has blood, and has bled.<br><br>Urine relates to the presidency because former president Trump was accused of hiring prostitutes to urinate on him, giving him a &quot;golden shower&quot;. Every president produces urine, and has urinated.<br><br>Semen relates to the presidency because former president Bill Clinton was exposed for his inappropriate relationship with his secretary by her semen-stained dress.
