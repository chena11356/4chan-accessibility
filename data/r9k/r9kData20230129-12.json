Still have toum, an arab mayonnaise using garlic and lemon instead of eggs. And hummus leftover from the other night but most people know what that is, one bean dip made of garbanzo beans, garlic, lemon, and sesame seed paste. Pita was bought from a med bakery that gets bread shipped in from a state 10 hours away. <br>Maybe I&#039;m thinking mexican because of all the cumin but it would be better spicy. I added cayenne to the marinade and again on the skewers just before grilling this try but there was still no heat. Probably have to coat it in the stuff since I killed my capsaicin receptors somehow. Or maybe use something spicy in the marinade but cayenne is all I can usually find. The hummus was under salted somehow despite nervously following the recipe. Experience suggests most recipes either over salt or don&#039;t tell the brand of salt or use volumetric measurements of ultra light feather salt. Garlic could stand to be a little more prominent too, but I&#039;m quite pleased with the first try of making hummus. It made a lot and the texture is better than the store bought stuff, price is actually a bit cheaper than buying store bought too. <br>As a general rule I triple garlic when looking at recipes but seeing as the toum called for a heaping cup of peeled garlic to three cups of oil I thought I&#039;d try it mostly as written. For the first time ever it was something that actually tasted like garlic using just the suggested amounts, so I don&#039;t plan to alter it further.

Pena-Marin and Bhargave make heavy use of a research method known as &quot;meta-analysis&quot;, that is, examination of data from multiple independent studies of relevance. The citation of priorly published research supports the thesis of Pena-Marin and Bhargave without the need to entirely conduct their own research from the ground up. The implications of the studies used by Pena-Marin and Bhargave tend to point towards a general idea that the symbolic association of a &quot;rounded&quot; number (such as 20, instead of 19.79) causes a viewer to store an association with such a number in their semantical memory. The implication here is that aesthetic appearances, even those of numbers, have an effect on the mind of the consumer. </span><br>What one can draw from these conclusions, in a business/marketing setting, is the pricing of items, along with nutritional content, volume, etc. can be subtly and deliberately labeled in such a way to entice consumers into purchasing it. For example, &quot;Monster Energy Zero&quot; energy drinks are labeled as having &quot;zero sugar&quot;. The name, &quot;Zero&quot; also seems definite in its statement that it is null of any &quot;unhealthy&quot; ingredients. Of course, the fine print is that a can of Monster Energy Zero is in fact, 10 calories. Continuing with the theme of caffeine (and the research paper), many caffeinated energy drinks use rounded numbers to list the milligrams of caffeine per can: 130mg, 150mg, 200mg, etc. A rounded number, such as one ending in zero, has some evidence to show influence on how long the effects of the caffeine will last", "filename": "1635874045837", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674882911258492, "time": 1674882911, "md5": "CacvPyo3ivDpQdYMGgcZLQ==", "fsize": 62421, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 71996298, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:39:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71996115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71996115</a><br>Enjoy your sendoff<br>remember it&#039;s not being disappointed by your new city you&#039;re just coming down off the drugs <br>But whatever if you want to interpret that as being homesick it&#039;s your body", "time": 1674884342, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 71996360, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:46:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71996053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71996053</a><br>According to studies, up to once a month if you do everything perfectly, that includes doses and not overheating, and you&#039;re probably not doing everything perfectly.<br><br>So once every two months sounds better.<br><br>Reminder that if you have a comedown, this means you fucked up and possibly harmed your brain.

I&#039;m in college and adderall has been my vice. I tried convincing myself originally that I only am using it as a study-aid but after experimentation with masturbating everytime I take adderall I can&#039;t help but have an 8+ hour masturbation session. It is not mentally enjoyable, and hardly physically enjoyable either, but it&#039;s almost impossible to stop. Even when I had deadlines, important calls, or even plans with friends I&#039;ve had to cancel, or reschedule because I was stuck masturbating on adderall. The orgasm is incredible though it&#039;s like nothing I&#039;ve ever experienced before. The sheer amount of cum that shoots out of your penis is overwhelming itself. The orgasm in my opinion is what a female orgasm must feel like: the slow rise and constant up and down sensation of arousal, until you reach the point where you feel the bottom of your penis start to fill up like a syringe, and then ejaculation sends a shiver down your entire body for a good 30 seconds, or until you&#039;ve finished cumming. Like I&#039;ve said I&#039;ve had 8+ hour sessions of just masturbating on adderall instead of studying and the next day my dick is bruised and swelled. It&#039;s not something you want to do, but you just can&#039;t stop. I&#039;ve literally held in my shit and piss because I was masturbating for hours causing a immense pain during and after masturbating, but there&#039;s just no escaping the jack it&#039;s honestly horrifying and soul crushing realizing you&#039;ve passed your deadline for turning in an assignment you haven&#039;t worked on because you just couldn&#039;t stop masturbating.", "time": 1674963262, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008438, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:35:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hopefully bought some 4f mph from an ad from a post here almost 2 weeks ago and it is not fucking here yet. dropped 300 on it, where the fuck is it? all I have is gay ass kratom and I cant play videogames on that.<br>literally fucked up my entire weekend, fuck you.<br><br>I have a little stockpile of something a lot stronger too but I cant do that anymore I dont know why im keeping it should probably throw it out. fuck you for making me stare temptation in the face. fucking send the shit.", "time": 1674963337, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008511, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:42:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72008438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72008438</a><br>What kind of ad lol<br>I bought $300 of it but it turned out shit waste of money, nothing but anxiety", "time": 1674963775, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008542, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;shrooms last too short</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;acid lasts too long</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2ci is impossible to find</span>", "time": 1674963981, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008579, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:51:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71997115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71997115</a><br>i cant look at spindly naked tree branches without thinking about heroin <br><br>hhwereewwwww<br>wwrrrRRrr<br>HHHgghRRREEWWWwh <br><br>biyyyYeewww..... shhhrrooooosh", "time": 1674964285, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 72008648, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:59:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995197</a><br>I did 30mg Adderall and 3.5g of I think golden teacher, and the 2 definitely synergize. I was planning on studying for my Networking class taking the adderall first, but I usually get sick after taking adderall, so I thought taking the mushrooms would ease my nerves and let me drink water because not drinking enough water is usually what gets me sick. As soon as the mushrooms kicked in I was not in the same space it&#039;s almost as if my entire room turned into a painting things were much thicker and they were running like a river, I felt as though my skin itself were cold and thick just like I paint and looking in the mirror felt as I had been framed like a painting. I have done acid plenty of time, but mushrooms have this completely different trip. I don&#039;t know if it was due to the adderall, but my mushroom trip was very relaxing I felt as though I was in control the entire time where as with acid it feels like an overwhelming roller coaster ride that never ends and you&#039;re at the mercy of. There is also an intense body element to the trip I felt very warm inside my body almost as if I was fire it was very strange, but strangely nostalgic and comforting. I just had an overwhelming sense of euphoria, but not artificial like MDMA where you know it&#039;s going to end when the drug ends, but truly I felt at peace on this trip. My most intense part of the trip was when I was just laying in my bed and I closed my eyes and I began to feel as if I was a log cabin, or all things in my mind I can associate with a log cabin where felt in my body. I felt like I was the fire in the fireplace, the wood of the structure, the smoke stack coming from the chimney. <br><br>This combination is top tier definitely need to try again, and I just want to wish you well on your trip as well. <br><br>P.S.

You have baby making sex, fuck her, breed her, cum ballsdeep inside your own mother and basically recreate the moment of your own creation. This thought alone already fucks me up because it&#039;s just way too crazy and what&#039;s even crazier is that this is actually possible. Your sperm can actually meet her egg and fertilize it, one of the eggs that gave life to you, you&#039;re impregnating your own mother. If you were normal, this seed would one day create her grandchild, but instead you&#039;re giving her a new child herself. How the fuck would this make a man feel?<br>And then you have a child, part you, part your mother. Like, does it call you dad and her mom? Does your mom call you honey?

As you get older you don&#039;t care that much to hook up with people, and that&#039;s something I&#039;d keep in the back of my head. At the same time, a woman will feel &quot;young&quot; if she sleeps with a younger guy. So you also mix that she doesn&#039;t just want to be used, especially as she&#039;s older and had that happen so many times. Her initial view is probably reading you very well and knowing you just want to fuck. So, you&#039;re going to use her. You have to kind of spin it, again this is my opinion.<br><br>I would maybe go with the approach of saying &quot;why, are you old or something?&quot; and let them say whatever. Then say something like they can pretend to be young again for one night. You have to tip toe around it because it&#039;s so easy to say something offensive. For example, if they reject that, the best reply imo would be to say that they were probably boring when they were younger. This might end the convo, and if it does then I&#039;d just move on. Like, &quot;hah, no surprise you seem like you&#039;d be boring when you were my age.&quot;. The reason I think this is good is because they&#039;ll get worked up trying to convince you they&#039;re fun. These days they probably think they&#039;re boring and those old days were the highlights of their social life, so now they have something to prove. That&#039;ll make them want to say they&#039;re not boring, they were fun and were great back then. You kind of have to play it as you go, but you need to understand their situation. They can also probably read you a lot better than you realize. If a girl in her early 20s hits on me, I don&#039;t have that much interest. It&#039;s hard to explain but you can see straight through their BS so well. If they actually want to date, fuck or whatever. So with a woman you need to go for their weakness I guess.", "time": 1674984103, "resto": 72011438}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 72011558, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)04:15:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I feel less than nothing rn", "filename": "1638060102230", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674983744301077, "time": 1674983744, "md5": "k/nBRPploT00x15eJiBZIA==", "fsize": 423938, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-feel-less-than-nothing-rn", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 72011587, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)04:20:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what would you rather be feeling anon", "time": 1674984001, "resto": 72011558}]}]
