I don&#039;t remember thinking anything at first, but I don&#039;t remember enough. <br>It grew into a steady dislike as I saw a few of his appearances in that dub. See, without any knowledge of him he initially comes across as some complete nigh-villainous asshole who&#039;s stronger than everyone else in the cast. I also was a HUGE diehard Knuckles x Rouge shipper, and came to view him as competition since Shadow and Rouge are allies and thus a decently popular ship among fans. <br>This changed when I started taking interest in what the games did and watched the cutscenes. And I can still vaguely remember the feeling of &quot;oh, shoot&quot; when the guy I had hated for a surface level assumption had actually been a good person who had killed himself for his own mistake. <br>What followed was him very quickly becoming my favorite character as I tried to learn more about him with the new knowledge that he wasn&#039;t a bad person and his past had been terrible. <br><br>...Leading me straight into a second misconception lol. Fan interpretations, noncanon media, soon enough I had this vision in my head that he was some angel good boy who dindu nuffin and any morally dark actions he took weren&#039;t his fault. I could explain more but this is already long. Basically though, that 2nd misconception that he was always a good boy was slapped out of me when I was shown proof he tries to kill people.<br>With every step I take towards knowing the truth of his heart, my love for him grows brighter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL DR </span><br>Shadow is an awful jerk --&gt; Shadow is a perfect angel --&gt; Shadow is an angelic jerk", "filename": "ISDX00 - 1256651607531327489 - 2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2152, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674643974196693, "time": 1674643974, "md5": "Z/sTqnrmWpgfiJeMO89WlA==", "fsize": 130756, "resto": 71953833}, {"no": 71960110, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:17:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/r9k/thread/71891247#p71931303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71931303</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If waifu had to pursue a creative hobby (i.e drawing, writing, sculpting, etc) which would suit her best? </span><br>drawing, probably. he&#039;s skilled with his hands, and it&#039;s a good way to express his feelings without words, something that he has trouble with <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s something she needs help with?</span><br>how to be less wrathful/hot-tempered, impulsive, overconfident, single-minded, rude, insensitive, self-centered, and unsociable, and how to communicate with others through words instead of fists. thankfully, he improves in all of these aspects throughout his anime. <s>my answer has probably made him seem like a bad person, but i swear, he&#039;s a good boy at heart</s><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is waifu street smart?

A dutch passport holder in the year 2023 doesn&#039;t really have any direct connections to the United Provinces of once, no? He&#039;s just a human, it&#039;s not like a force field is gravitating him towards the lowlands or something. Truth be told he might actually be way closer with some other human who lives across the world from him (say someone in the PRC happens to have the same hobbies, values, and goals that he has) despite the differences of their dominant cultures.<br>I mean people can form a society on the basis of their grand-grand-grand... parents having been all attacked by the same guy, but that seems oddly specific and forced to me. If history wouldn&#039;t be taught, and if parents would shove their believes down kids throats, then all the land and all the people in the world would be both in theory and practice interchangeable! It is getting increasingly more harder to live isolated on the globe, and the most efficient ways to increase human quality of life happen to require intense international cooperation. Look at india, the US, the EU and so on, for the states of the future. Think about it, all of the cool sci-fi civs that start going faster than light always unite their entire home planet under a common authority, hmm? It just strikes me as backwards to keep any kind of nation-sentiment alive. It complicates social engineering so much when suddenly two entire landmasses don&#039;t wanna talk to each other just &#039;cuz an aeon ago they had a fight.

I also subscribe to the marxist view of substructures a lot. For instance in the right circumstances nuclear families will probably vanish (as long as people stop being so selfish ofc). SO as you can see I attribute a lot of sociological phenomena to more economic causes.<br>If I were to get a bit more specific, then I&#039;d mention that it would be quite cool getting an eu federation going and curtailing us influence on it.

And it was even worst in past generations, feminism honestly isn&#039;t wrong that men have been abusive in relationships. The problem is, women have developed a lot of defense mechanisms and their own shitty behaviours as a reaction to this, which has just furthered the gap between genders, we&#039;re both like porcupines that can&#039;t let eachother in. Now, you might say they&#039;re justified to react this way, but I will say that lately I see much more effort on the part of men to heal these wounds. Women aren&#039;t stepping up to meet us though, instead of choosing to heal they have let their trauma define them. So, even if it&#039;s not their fault ultimately that still doesn&#039;t excuse the behaviour. Women need to want to heal this. Men have been going through their collective ego loss, sure there&#039;s still shitty men out there, but by and large most dudes I see today and even most incels are genuinely pretty good people on the inside, they&#039;ve been raised to respect women, and a lot of the anger being expressed by them is a result of women not returning that. I don&#039;t see women practicing nofap. I don&#039;t see women practicing self improvement. Or WE GO GYM. There&#039;s no female equivalent of the &#039;nice guy&#039;, whose own sexual urges are in conflict with his morals. There are no women pushing for a return to traditional relationship dynamics (note that this doesn&#039;t imply a return to the past abusive relationship standards, but towards an actual union of masculine and feminine that has been in decline since arguably pre-abrahamic periods).

It&#039;s the ultimate taboo. If we look at it from a normie perspective, it&#039;s the one thing that CANNOT happen to a mother and son relationship. Not only physically speaking, but mentally too. It&#039;s not just that a normie would think the desire to impregnate your mom is disgusting, they probably assume that it&#039;s impossible to exist at all, totally unthinkable.<br><br>Out of all the things people want from momcest, impregnating your own mom is probably the rarest that could realistically happen. I think even in these threads I&#039;ve seen some saying that inbreeding is too far for them, and this is literally the thread for motherfuckers. With anal it&#039;s more like they&#039;re either into it or not, but with pregnancy it&#039;s like it&#039;s the one thing that mustn&#039;t happen.<br><br>And now imagine the scenario itself. She is the woman that gave birth to you. When she held you in her arms as a newborn, she probably thought of the future that is ahead of you. At some point she probably thought about how your future wife is gonna look like and she is eager to eventually see your kids, her grandkids and play with them.<br>But instead what happened is that somehow you ended up wanting her instead, and somehow she let it happen. And even then, there is still a possible out, you can stop your relationship and try to go back to normal. But that possibility gets obliterated when you actually impregnate her. Even the act itself changes things. Imagine making love to your mom, she&#039;s fertile and not on the pill and you both know this, and either you&#039;re just too into it or maybe both of you even want it. Either way you shoot everything you have deep inside her and then you look into her eyes and give her a passionate kiss. You both know that this is not just sex, but the desire to mate and procreate, despite being mother and son. And all of this is just the start. You and your mom will be a couple and raise a child.

I have nothing against them, but when is see the Siscest - Relatives with benefits tagline, I am immediately disappointed. Incest is extremely taboo, incest with your mom feels even more taboo, but nothing is more taboo than romantic incest with your own mom. The entire scenario is so bizarre and alien to everything we know and see growing up, in books, on TV and so on. Even a mainstream show like Game of Thrones doesn&#039;t have any real momcest as far as I know.<br><br>Yet this is exactly what makes it so fascinating. Your mother is not an equal. She&#039;s not a woman you meet and have a good time with, exchanges numbers and just date. Everything about your relationship seems to be at odds with even considering the idea of a romantic relationship, let alone trying to pursue it. Be it nature or socializing, fact is that wanting to take your mom as a woman or wife for example is extremely abnormal.<br><br>But for me at least, this why I love it. What happens if you succeed? How does it feel? How would she feel? Our desire to breed is impossibly strong, but if you want to do it with her, you would literally impregnate her with her own would-be grandchildren. Everything about this relationship would be upside down. Would you become her equal? Would you give each give each other valentine&#039;s presents and then kiss. Would you occasionally kiss even without the intention of it leading to sex, like a normal couple?<br><br>Most posts here seem overly fetish oriented, but I&#039;m always curious about how such a relationship would actually function. Like imagine having a child with your mom and the child calls you dad and her mom. From his perspective this is completely normal and sweet, but looking behind the curtain, it is kind of fucked up. No relationship seems to be able to capture the same kind of love, passion, weirdness, degeneracy and chaos like a mother and son relationship that turns romantic.
