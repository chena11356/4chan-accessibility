Finally for the first time in my life I trusted a female enough to confess my feelings for her. She immediately betrayed me and laughed about it with her friends.<br>That was my last chance at not becoming a wizard. It was like the universe itself desires to see me alone. Just when I recover from old wounds, another female rips the wound wide back open.<br><br>Almost grateful in a way to be so aware of how evil they truly are, but I would be lying if I said I want to be alone forever. I know I will not find love in life, but I hope that whatever comes after death will be worth the loneliness. <br>I try to convince myself that there is some grand reason why the universe refuses to allow me to find love and I will be happy to have lived this miserable life once revealed.

I don&#039;t particularly idolize any specific set of looks, and a 10/10 personality would save her looks unless she was really deformed/disfigured.", "filename": "1668142250028", "ext": ".png", "w": 523, "h": 502, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1673261060448814, "time": 1673261060, "md5": "2i8PDkhVneUojzzXJ2nspg==", "fsize": 316256, "resto": 71755423}, {"no": 71755809, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:45:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71755423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71755423</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Describe their appearance, </span><br>Brown hair, blue eyes, pale skin, BMI of ~18, average face <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;personality, </span><br>~18 years old, not retarded or insane, average IQ", "filename": "1664289697636", "ext": ".png", "w": 850, "h": 1340, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673261151363017, "time": 1673261151, "md5": "p5IF38aD++kSluEceS6OvA==", "fsize": 1003584, "resto": 71755423}, {"no": 71755816, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:46:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71755809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71755809</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;personality: 18 years old</span><br>kek", "time": 1673261213, "resto": 71755423}, {"no": 71755828, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:49:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;discord egf</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not overweight</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at least 20 y.o.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no dog</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unable to find a real partner (like me)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;exchanges lewd pics with me</span><br>That&#039;s all I want but going for it feels like bashing my head in a wall.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br> XGXG", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673261191077207, "time": 1673261191, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 4, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 71755818, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:47:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>XGXG", "time": 1673261230, "resto": 71755814}, {"no": 71755863, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:58:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71755814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71755814</a><br><a href=\"#p71755818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71755818</a><br>This sounds really boring, no thanks.", "time": 1673261901, "resto": 71755814}, {"no": 71756040, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)06:28:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71755814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71755814</a><br>what&#039;s up nhk anon?<br><br>back in wageslaving, luckily the golden retriever blonde is finally back from her vacation so i can do my own shit and have few free moments to lurk here", "filename": "1673171207380137", "ext": ".png", "w": 2218, "h": 2356, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673263712558819, "time": 1673263712, "md5": "8Nm7H57xtdPklpkfxDW1CQ==", "fsize": 710402, "resto": 71755814}, {"no": 71756245, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)07:09:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71756040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71756040</a><br>Gotta fin7sh up work first, theb we can be unproductive together.^^", "time": 1673266151, "resto": 71755814}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71755894, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)06:04:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s crazy that all I needed to be in a relationship, to have had sex, to maybe even have kids by now, was to just be alittle bit more socially aware than I was in middleschool and highschool. If I just didn&#039;t ignore, one word responded, ghosted or just stared at girls talking to me until they left it all would have been fine. By an interval of like 4 years, I learned enough social skills to be able to succeed with the women from those 4 years ago. Even though my social skills were always far below my peers at any given moment to have caught up with this small interval at any point was all I needed to do.<br><br>At 17 I knew what I should have said, done and how I should have acted at 13. At 22 I knew about all the chances I missed at 18, at 26 I learned about the chances at 22, and so on. By the age of 26 I had basically &quot;turned down&quot; 10 advances of diffrent women from ages 13 to 25 that all would have lead to some kind of relationship if I just knew what was going on and pursued them with interest. Like I said, I didn&#039;t need to be good at any of the social games that most people find natural, I just needed to catch up with this social awareness interval and it would have been fine and I never did.<br><br>The scary thing now at 31 is I haven&#039;t had any of these revelations since age 26 or so. I have to guess its because I interact with women so sparingly nowdays that I just haven&#039;t got enough experience to unconsciously receive any kind of revelation. Or the interval have increased and I&#039;m in for a big suprise in a few years, to know of even more missed opportunities.<br><br>It just doesnt feel like before though since the only women I interact with are from work. I work in service (massage therapy) with no co-workers, just clients. It becomes almost impossible to decipher any of my clients in my position, in case they imply double meaning.

Think of yourself as metaphorically (or really if you want to) being stuck in a simulation, and observe that pretty much anything (including sexual preference) is just unauthentic and made up! There&#039;s lots of things that can support you in such an endeavor. Studying the history of sexuality or looking at different cultures and examining ethics of things involving it are good choices for your particular problem, but you can always go further and start questioning all values or experiences that you see, in which case some general knowledge of metaphysics and/or ethics would probably be recommended. Of course you don&#039;t actually need to do any kind of research here.

After psychedelics I find myself kinder and more empathic to trannies, niggers, leftists and even jews as my brothers, deceived and misguided and doing their best from their own perspective, yet still believe some lifeforms are closer to enlightenment than others as they experience reincarnation. And how could I know the truth of this universal system and judge myself as closer to enlightenment? The more I try to get it, the more I realize the importance of the physical world.

I don&#039;t believe in giving children adhd meds because there&#039;s no point apart from managing potentially extreme behavioural issues. not only did the hyperactivity remain, but the loss of concentration, motivation, organisation, impulse control, short term memory, ability to socialise all massively increased. and no I didn&#039;t grow up stuck to a TV or playing vidya or on a computer unsupervised. I grew up in the countryside and spent a lot of time outside. As I got older and the all the above negatives effects started happening I just withdrew from everything and stayed in my room reading and listening to music. I didn&#039;t start an internet addiction until I was about 13 by which point I had been aware of symptoms for years. If had been given meds at that point my life would be completely different now. I wouldn&#039;t have spent my entire not really doing anything. I had every opportunity given to me to succeed except parents that did not believe adhd wasn&#039;t real. it wasn&#039;t until I was 21 and several years deep into frequent drug use that I worked out I had adhd. only now am I being prescribed meds and its made me realise how much of my life has passed by without achieving anything whilst watching my friends and siblings continue to succeed. even now with stimulants I just don&#039;t have the motivation to catch up with people my age. I dropped out of uni twice because I can&#039;t even focus on things I&#039;m interested in.

I fear that I may die soon. I have not told anyone but the pain grows worse every day. It seems that I decided far too late to begin to care for myself and I am now passing a point from which I cannot return. There may be a point soon in my future that you come to hear that I have leapt from a bridge. Do not be alarmed by this for it is not due to any lack of will to live nor is it anything within your power to influence. I am simply in great pain and would prefer to take my life while I still have some sanity left. This is however not what I have written to communicate to you. <br><br>I wanted you to know that you were the reason that I could fight in the first place. You opened my eyes to possibilities I had never imagined. No matter how hard things got all I had to do was imagine your smiling face and then everything became a little easier. Whenever I would feel down all I had to do was remember your warm hugs and I knew that everything would be okay. I do not expect this to mean anything to you, I just wanted you to understand the effect that you&#039;ve had on my life just by being yourself. I have found the lessons and what you have chosen to take from some of them to be quite beautiful. That is something that I have tried to carry forward as well.<br><br>Thank you and those that inspired you to be who you are today for giving me the chance to get to know you. To get to experience new things I had never before experienced. I appareciated every minute of it and carry those memories with me always.<br><br>I hope that you are well and fairing better than I. I hope for you all the happiness that I could never give, and the stability that you so very much deserve.
