At the end of the day, its just boring and it doesnt deserve to be put on a pedestal as all the women try to force you to believe to make them feel more special. The truth is, everything in life isnt about sex. There is so much more to life than sex. Women are only meant for procreation, not hedonism and dating them. Talking to them is not productive in 2022, focus on yourself and what makes you happy. This whole narrative about guys having kids with washed up roasties is exactly how it is supposed to be. Women cant feel love, but they dont owe you sex either. So why should you try to force yourself to love them? At the end of the day, just betabuxx and you get to have kids with a desperate roastie, or just adopt a kid, and then you pass on your legacy and win.

How so? </span><br>Picrel (Goodnight Moon) is by far my favorite. I find her regular ASMR videos a bit lackluster and boring to be honest, but she goes all out with her Babblebrook series and I can&#039;t look away from it. I hold picrel as a standard of beauty. That gal is gorgeous and her makeup/costume skills allow her to become mesmerizing. Also really dig her joyful impromptu videos, where she just runs out into the rain and rambles on about something she likes. It feels like sharing something personal with someone you care about, despite how sad that sounds. On the opposite spectrum, despite the hate, I have a thing for FrivolousFox. She&#039;s just so fucking good at what she does. Despite the drama and bullshit, she strikes me as one of the few that actually does enjoy ASMR and it shows in her ability to invoke that tingling at the back of my skull. Beauty-wise she doesn&#039;t hold a candle to some other artists, but the way she looks into the camera sometimes, entices me in ways I can barely put to words.
