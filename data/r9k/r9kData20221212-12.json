Reminder: Many trans people have had memories of wanting to be another gender at a young age, I personally had that at 5 years old, additionally Jazz Jennings is an example of someone who knew she was trans when she was young, and it wasn&#039;t a phase for her, nor was it grooming. If we continue to let people believe such misinformation about us, it will lead to increasingly violent rhetoric and increasing violence. Innocent people could die or be put in harms way.

Similar to how a dad would be &quot;proud&quot; of having a daughter with a hot body. It&#039;s pride mixed with being protective of their good qualities, and also subconsciously wanting them for themselves on some level. They will judge their son&#039;s gfs more harshly because they will feel their son deserves better. The mom might also become overbearing and possessive.<br>It&#039;s also apparently not uncommon for moms to become obsessed with their son around puberty, when they start to produce semen. Something about wanting to see them cum, something biological. I think that&#039;s why a lot of irl momcest starts with the mom giving a handjob to their son during puberty, seems to be a recurring theme in actual documented cases. They want to see them cum, but aren&#039;t ready to have actual sex with them specifically.<br><br>My mom thinks I have a huge dick because she caught me after jerking off as a kid and my cock happened to look huge right then flaccid.

If you are willing to grasp the hand given to you, then hope isn&#039;t yet lost. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.<br><br>XXX", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1670833404910569, "time": 1670833404, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "71349940-111222", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 16, "images": 11, "omitted_posts": 11, "omitted_images": 7, "last_replies": [{"no": 71365342, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)04:42:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71364882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71364882</a><br>Hey, Anon.<br><br>I know it&#039;s alot, but this thread will occur daily, so you may take your time and read it in small intervals, if it&#039;s too much for you.<br><br>Alternatively, you are invited to just chill here, tell us about your day, vent if you need someone to listen, ask for advise on tough life decision or share any creative stuff you made.<br><br>All I ask is that you keep a basic respect for your fellow robots.<br><br>So, how you doing today?

my camping spot and specifically my fire-pit were legal as i was not in a fire-controlled area. i was far enough off any official trail or road that she had to have specifically come out to inspect my camp because a patrol would never just take them through that area and i called her out on it. i started insinuating fucked up reasons she might be out there ending with an accusation she just wanted dick and whipped it out. she just stood there and stared at it for a bit, then told me have a good day and left. i was afraid she might be coming back with backup, so i picked up and left right afterwards. so i guess she won in the end.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;as a teenager, i had to help my mom bathe for about a week after she had a relatively minor surgery, but there were multiple (tiny) incision points that couldn&#039;t get wet, so somebody had to hand-bathe her. first couple days, i was washing her with a hand-rag and didn&#039;t attempt to wash her personal regions, instead having her clean her own breasts and region. but i was eye-balling her hard and i&#039;m sure she had to have noticed. the third day, i purposefully started washing parts of her with my hand instead of the rag and got brazen enough to wash her inner thighs and clean around her breasts with my hand, but she still washed her privates herself. for the rest of the week though, i&#039;m still not sure how i got the balls to do it or how i thought my mom would respond, but instead of having her jump in, i just put my hands wherever i wanted. despite being way too into it and noticeably spending way too long rubbing her breasts and cleaning her crotch, she never said a word. just closed her eyes and let it happen. that was years ago and she still has never spoken a word about it.</span>", "filename": "f65a30ca631d9b1ec6572b2dc0a873f5f7ddcb524eb72d13b52f864145a2b16f", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 864, "h": 812, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 234, "tim": 1670793031984230, "time":
