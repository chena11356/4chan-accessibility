For single family homes, a full transition to rent to own with evictions barred except for nonpayment would allow a very gentle phaseout without any major fireworks.

Those two terms are often used interchangeably though, so it&#039;s a common mistake. See morals are like our principle beliefs in right and wrong. Morals are also subjective, because individuals will have different ideas of what constitutes right and wrong. Ethics are more like generally accepted social rules. Like things you should and shouldn&#039;t do. A person who has strong morals may have no ethics, which means they aren&#039;t restrained by doing things a lot of people would believe is &quot;wrong&quot; but done in order to achieve the greater good.

My position involves a lot of interpersonal skills, and I feel that I&#039;m quite good at reading others and being able to get people to empathize with and form a good rapport with me. I like seeing the prolonged effort and dedication that my coworkers and I put in all pay off in short-term goals, all while working towards the long-term goal and purpose of this company. It&#039;s not all good, though. There have been times where others and I have worked and devoted months and even years worth of effort into something that admittedly seems pointless in the long-run and served no purpose in the greater scope of our goal. This happened pretty recently in 2019-2021, and Covid played a big part in it.

Finally, in January 2018, a group of researchers led by Francesca Lionetti published their article in Translational Psychiatry and introduced a third group: &quot;tulip children&quot;, which has both resilient and sensitive characteristics (by the way, Elaine Aron is one of the authors of this paper~): https://rdcu.be/c2MtB ! \\(^_^)/<br>So tl;dr:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dandelion: high resilience, low sensitivity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tulip: medium resilience, medium sensitivity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;orchid: low resilience, high sensitivity</span><br>*^w^*<br>You can take the flower test here: https://sensitivityresearch.com/sel<wbr>f-tests/adult-self-test/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whats you favourite one</span><br>Maybe spearmint! :3<br><br><br><a href=\"/r9k/thread/71611997#p71640940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71640940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;saying kek</span><br>N-no... :Oc<br><br><a href=\"/r9k/thread/71611997#p71641107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71641107</a><br>What&#039;s an INTJ-J?

The &quot;little adults&quot; idea largely hinges on exactly what age we&#039;re talking about. 11 year olds? Yeah, maybe. 3 year olds? No, toddlers are the furthest thing in the world from &quot;miniature adults&quot; on just about every possible level. <br><br>The impression I get is that the maturation process went at an accelerated rate compared to today, but that there was still a transition from child to adult that spanned years. Children in ancient fiction are still portrayed as mischievous, bratty, and dumb. 6 year olds worked hard on the farm rather than taking it easy, but they didn&#039;t hold significant ranks in society and were often considered not to be culpable for crimes. 11 year olds worked on the mines, but that didn&#039;t mean they were viewed 1:1 identical to adults psychologically - just that they were capable of doing manual labor. From what I can gather, many societies viewed people as full adults in the 14-18 range, not well into the 20s like today, but people below that range weren&#039;t viewed as adults. It&#039;s true that &#039;child culture&#039; wasn&#039;t much of a thing back then - kids wore smaller versions of adult clothes, they didn&#039;t have media specifically catered to them - but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s humanly possible not to realize that a 5 year old is very difficult from someone in their 20s or 30s, no matter what the culture or era.", "filename": "Yor 2", "ext": ".png", "w": 783, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672907498120223, "time": 1672907498, "md5": "K18Rs6PdvZNoZCCRl1+30Q==", "fsize": 862050, "resto": 71688227}, {"no": 71698870, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:32:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71698864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71698864</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would people be ok with any other demographic being forced into education camps?

Even if you excuse this as a necessary evil for society to function, I still think many parents don&#039;t give their kids enough freedom, scheduling out their every single hour and waking moment, trying to sign them up for every extracurricular possible to turn them into a Renaissance kid of a thousand skills regardless of their own personality or interests or desires. Kids aren&#039;t adult but they&#039;re still human beings. They should have choices, they should have a significant amount of freedom, they should have their preferences and feelings respected and listened to.

My only friend was my mom. No friends in school at all. I didn&#039;t understand how social interaction works, I still really don&#039;t. Whenever I talked with anyone, it would range from awkward silence because I didn&#039;t know what to say (ever) to just being bullied. I had a couple friends when I was doing Ju Jitsu but not really. My mom lied to the school district to get me into a higher income school since we were dirt poor and she wanted me to be better off than she was, and I was a year younger than my classmates. Was also disgusting half-white half-asian crossbreed (if you ever have kids, never create racial abominations. I look like an effeminate faggot because of my asian half but have relatively low intelligence due to my white half. I look and sound like a disgusting genetic defect upon the face of the earth, and I have all the worst aspects of my two least favorite races on earth). Middle school was worse, my dad was abusive as a kid and he started to have more control in my life around that time (me and my mom were evicted from our apartment, ended up living with my dad because no other option). Kids at school would bully me relentlessly, even though I didn&#039;t interact with any of them. They would bully me by stealing shit from me, and by making false accusations to teachers and snitching on me for minor things (including showing signs of suicide. I know for a fact those faggots never reported me because they were genuinely concerned, just because they wanted to see me suffer even more. No one who&#039;s genuinely concerned would go to the fucking people in charge). My teachers and the staff hated me, seemingly just because I was an easy reject to bully (and let me just tell you, every single teacher is a bad person. if you ever see a teacher, I encourage you to kill them with a baseball bat).

Of course, when I was with my dad, I wasn&#039;t allowed to do anything but homework. Not allowed to leave the house out of fear that I would run away. After middle school, I only had two friends, the only two friends I&#039;ve ever had in the history of my life and still have today. Multiple times, I would be accused of wanting to shoot up the school or bomb the school. For a time, I did want to, but only for a time. One time I got searched because some stupid dyke in my special ed class at the time heard I owned an airsoft gun with no orange tip (that I didn&#039;t have on me) and decided it was reason enough to snitch (I specifically hate fags and trannies because they&#039;re the most likely people on earth to snitch over fucking anything). I was talking about how shitty the situation was with an acquaintance at school, and someone listening behind us reported me because all they heard was &quot;school shooting&quot;. In high school, I got in trouble for something else and some other girl that didn&#039;t like me reported me to the cops for wanting to build a bomb. My stupid fucking dad&#039;s side of the family is all liberal and pro-cop, so of course I get my room searched and all the drugs that were allowing me to feel somewhat OK with being alive were taken. They didn&#039;t know that the fucking 4th amendment existed apparently and decided to let the cops in with open arms since I&#039;m pretty sure they like the cops more than they like me.

He would totally give me shit for being a rapist weirdo if I got in trouble at school for asking a girl out. Besides that though, I did have my sexual encounters. They were all with hood black girls. I think the reason why in hindsight was because there was no commitment and no snitching. Black girls are all fucked up and have shitty father figures, and so do I. We have that much in common and are both in horrible standing with institutions. Besides all that though, I got super into lockpicking and hacking. I would break into a ton of abandoned buildings for fun, and befriend homeless people. They were like me, thrown into society&#039;s garbage can. Impoverished and hated by mainstream society. I also broke into a lot of in-use buildings. They had nice rooftops and good shit, and evading security provided a challenge. I would also use my programming skills to write malware that would steal passwords from browser autofill and contribute my hacking skills to my little gang of 3. We were essentially a bunch of James Bond wannabes, we stole keys to large buildings and picked our way into houses that were for sale and made the keys to them, and essentially just treated all these places like we owned them.

These include feelings of inadequacy, especially of his scientific training (obviously he was bolstered by publishing together with Pauli; however, he was never comfortable with math and physics, his background was in the biological sciences). He cites three reasons for proceeding: (1) His increasing experience of and with the phenomena. (2) His research into the history of fish symbolism (presented in detail in his book Aion), which included a set of synchronicities - in addition to those in the published accounts, Jung found a snake that had choked in the act of swallowing a fish so that both had died. This occurred in 1933 at the shore by his Bollingen retreat. According to a family member, Jung saw this as a synchronicity since he was working on the relationship of Christianity/Fish and Alchemy/Snake at the time, and the external event paralleled his views on how these systems&#039; inability to integrate their perspectives was fatal to each, leaving them dead.

One of those disciplines had something to do with environment obviously and the author was arguing the other discipline doesn&#039;t need &quot;new thinking&quot; but &quot;better old thinking&quot; which is hilarious, because in the paper he criticizes the disciplines&#039; lack of an accepted definition but goes on to say, without defining, a &quot;better&quot; (by what definitiion?) old thinking would beat out new thinking in that field.<br>It&#039;s not going to stop me, that&#039;s for sure, but it makes it harder for me to do that study if the field is in such shambles.

There&#039;s something familiar about them -- they&#039;re the guy or gal next door. When they enter a room, they don&#039;t walk in with a splash. Instead, they move to the sides and weave their way inwards. These people have a familiar feel to them. Because they are rather sensitive to their environment, they can get flustered easily, especially in public. Their first instinct, when threatened or on unfamiliar ground, is to protect themselves. When new situations present themselves, they can immediately withdraw or act shy. Generally, these people come across as caring people. They seem quite sweet -- even innocent. Usually, these people appear unassuming enough to be quite approachable. Some Cancer Ascendants, however, have retreated into themselves so much as to be quite the opposite.<br><br>Since Capricorn is on the Descendant, Cancer Ascendant people are looking for structure and security in their partner and their relationship. These people function best when their partner displays strength, financial and emotional stability, and know-how. In fact, many Cancer Ascendants prefer it when their relationship has well-defined rules. Security is the basic need, and they are generally more than willing to give up some personal freedom in order to get it. In some cases, Cancer Ascendant people can surprise their partners. Why? Because they come across as rather unassuming, family-oriented people.

Has she ever flirted, even jokingly with you int he past? How exactly did she say she was ok with it? <br>Did she just shrug in a nonchalant way? This leans more towards she doesn&#039;t care and is comfortable sleeping in the same bed with a male friend and fucking you isn&#039;t really set in stone. Did she kind of smile and ask if you were ok with it? That would imply slight teasing, maybe signifying that she knows the implications and would be down with it.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>FUFU", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673076995702936, "time": 1673076995, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hello-anon-need-some-help-a-shoulder-to-cry-on", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 9, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 71726435, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)02:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>FUFIFU", "time": 1673077109, "resto": 71726414}, {"no": 71726447, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)02:39:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Previous thread:<br><a href=\"/r9k/thread/71712896#p71712896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71712896</a><br><br>Needle", "filename": "stab-jon-snow", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 278, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1673077190309768, "time": 1673077190, "md5": "kBYzEv32y0/muMp8p6p90w==", "fsize": 1115846, "resto": 71726414}, {"no": 71726560, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)02:51:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/r9k/thread/71712896#p71722276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71722276</a><br><br>Hello, Anon.

You see this sort of thing repeated all over Africa.

Now, those privileged groups are hated across the country. In Nigeria, it&#039;s the Hausa-Fulani. The natives of southern Nigeria were always more egalitarian. Pre-colonization, they had schools, their culture stressed the importance of education, their political system was mostly democratic, and they practiced indigenous religion that taught that all of God&#039;s creations are equal. The natives of Northern Nigeria were the opposite. They were Muslim, which meant they were a bit more technologically advanced but incredibly socially backwards when compared to the southerners. Their government was monarchic. Those who weren&#039;t part of the royal family and weren&#039;t part of the elite class were basically just slaves. They had no education and had no say in anything regarding their civilization.<br><br>The British thought that since the northerners were already so used to strict hierarchies and submitting to whoever was stronger, it was better for them to have direct control over Nigerian society.
