0,23675577,1.0,1.0,10/24/15(Sat)16:57:43,Anonymous,Welcome to /r9k/,"/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts.<br><br>

1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>
2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>
3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, 
your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>
4. Backlinks, eg <span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the 
eyes of the robot.<br>
5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>
6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>
7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>
8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>
9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>
10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>
11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>
12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD:<br>

I like cis people, love them even, but I don&#039;t like when they view us with scorn and derision. To say all trans people are groomers, is like saying all men are rapists, and the reason they are throwing this label at us is for silly reasons like fully clothed drag queens(drag is not the same as being trans btw) reading in a library, teachers merely mentioning to students that trans people exist in this world, teachers who are trans generally existing, parents listening to their children who might be trans or gender non conforming in some way. Reminder: Many trans people have had memories of wanting to be another gender at a young age, I personally had that at 5 years old, additionally Jazz Jennings is an example of someone who knew she was trans when she was young, and it wasn&#039;t a phase for her, nor was it grooming. If we continue to let people believe such misinformation about us, it will lead to increasingly violent rhetoric and increasing violence. Innocent people could die or be put in harms way. People have already sent a bomb threat to a children&#039;s hospital because there were rumors that they were actually getting trans surgeries. It turned out to be misinformation. Some random person shot up a club because drag queens held a family friendly event.

Similar to how a dad would be &quot;proud&quot; of having a daughter with a hot body. It&#039;s pride mixed with being protective of their good qualities, and also subconsciously wanting them for themselves on some level. They will judge their son&#039;s gfs more harshly because they will feel their son deserves better. The mom might also become overbearing and possessive.<br>It&#039;s also apparently not uncommon for moms to become obsessed with their son around puberty, when they start to produce semen. Something about wanting to see them cum, something biological. I think that&#039;s why a lot of irl momcest starts with the mom giving a handjob to their son during puberty, seems to be a recurring theme in actual documented cases. They want to see them cum, but aren&#039;t ready to have actual sex with them specifically.<br><br>My mom thinks I have a huge dick because she caught me after jerking off as a kid and my cock happened to look huge right then flaccid.

So, perhaps rather than the positive connotation of &quot;appreciate&quot;, &quot;acknowledge&quot; is more appropriate.

Simultaneously, I do not wish to let my suffering or apathy be the sentiment and feeling others have by being with me. Even if only briefly, I&#039;d rather good people appreciate and enjoy their short time with me. If you are indifferent to such interactions, I&#039;d ask not if you appreciated those times, but if they appreciated you, and why or why not.

If you are willing to grasp the hand given to you, then hope isn&#039;t yet lost. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.<br><br>XXX",welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1),.gif,640,360,250,140,1670833404910569,1670833404,2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==,1566411,0,,71349940-111222,0,16,11,"[{'no': 71365342, 'now': '12/12/22(Mon)04:42:59', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p71364882"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;71364882</a><br>Hey, Anon.<br><br>I know it&#039;s alot, but this thread will occur daily, so you may take your time and read it in small intervals, if it&#039;s too much for you.<br><br>Alternatively, you are invited to just chill here, tell us about your day, vent if you need someone to listen, ask for advise on tough life decision or share any creative stuff you made.<br><br>All I ask is that you keep a basic respect for your fellow robots.<br><br>So, how you doing today?
