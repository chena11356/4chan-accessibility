Women by contrast don&#039;t seem to care all that much about finding love, maybe it&#039;s like this additional neat benefit, but they can live comfortably without it (maybe due to the validation and support they receive from others).<br>Though it is probably also to some great extent the abundance of opportunities/choices for love that women are aware that they have (to the point that it&#039;s an almost universal aspect of the female experience to be indignantly angry about unwanted male romantic attention), which of course would lead to much lower desperation than that of a male who spends his life feeling worthless and trapped because no one will show any interest in him.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m actually jealous and wish I could lobotomize the part of my brain that is attracted to women and intimacy.</span><br>I relate to this as well.

The best way I can simply describe it is merging the conscious and unconscious minds. I completely clear my mind so that I exist in a completely empty black room. Then I consciously conjure an image in my mind, my favorite image for this is a fire. Once I&#039;m completely in tune with the fire and it becomes stable, I begin adding fuel to it. Once it&#039;s stable, I know I&#039;m in the zone and I have this feeling in the stem of my brain, like someone is pulling on my brain. Then once I start adding fuel to the fire, I have this eruption of energy from my brain stem that rushes down through my spine and into my limbs, and all the hairs on my body stand up. As I continue adding fuel, the fire grows to astronomical sizes, and changes colors as it grow. It completely illuminates the empty black room and I can see to the very depths of my own soul. <br>Once the fire reaches its absolute peak, I have this sensation as if I&#039;m being constrained by ropes, or that I&#039;m stuck in a block of ice, and I have to push all of that energy outward to break the constraints and be free. Then the fire rapidly recedes and implodes. From the darkness rises this huge towering entity that looks down lovingly upon me as if they were waiting for me to arrive, it reaches down and envelops my soul in this absolutely amazing warmth, pulls me up to its face and just stares, as if it&#039;s waiting for me to ask it something. So, I ask away. It opens its mouth as to speak, but no words come out, only images. And it will answer any question I have.<br><br>Last night I learned that when the entity arrives, I can see the sounds happening outside of my body in the black space surrounding the two of us. It&#039;s quite a mystical experience, and feels better than any sex.

There&#039;s the need of belonging, physical safety, relaxation, authenticity, competence, creativity, respect, play, humor, variety, freedom, intimacy, being understood, beauty, etc. When these are violated or not fulfilled, the usual first reaction is to feel sad or disappointed but we often mask it with various defense mechanisms. For us men the most common one is probably anger, directed either externally or internally. When you do this, instead of getting sad you either lash out at somebody else, or internally at yourself by going on a mental tirade of &quot;I am X and I will never be good enough because of Y&quot;, etc.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This can be very socially beneficial which is why people do it. It can make you come across as more masculine and instill respect or fear in people. It also lets you avoid other emotions that are even more uncomfortable, which could disrupt your functioning if it happens in the middle of a meeting or something like that.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem is that when this kind of emotional masking becomes a habit, you lose the ability to tell why you&#039;re feeling like shit and it all becomes a big tangle of hurt and anger. That&#039;s why when you&#039;re in the appropriate environment, it&#039;s worthwhile to sometimes drop the defenses by using the language of NVC in your internal monologue. It can give you insight about what needs are being unfulfilled, which may suggest some strategies for fulfilling them. You&#039;re not going to be able to get them all but improvement is often possible.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basic mindfulness meditation helps because it quiets the mind, which helps to notice more subtle things.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am going to sleep now because I have things to do in the morning.

When certain fixes are present together, common elements of each become amplified, and other characteristics become less amplified. When trying to discover your fixes, it&#039;s best to think about them in terms of a Venn diagram. When two elements are combined, which aspects of each are amplified or dulled? For example, when you combine 6 with 9, the more phobic qualities of 6 are amplified due to the 9 fix. When you combine 6 with 8, you now have two Reactive types and will likely have more counter-phobic 6 energy.</span><br><br><a href=\"#p72245756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72245756</a><br>Yep, now time to sit around playing video games and posting here except less greasy for the next couple of days.

some retard emotional and philosophical revelations i had about my problems, and that i was going to manage them with stimulant use.<br><br>some wise anon who seemed to have had a terrible history with stimulant or other hard drug abuse dug into me and did all of the correct things in order to scare me whilst in my altered state and warn me about the danger of addiction i was diving into head-first into. he refused to engage with my silly delusions or my fake, stimulant-induced good faith responses (i guess since its fake good i should say bad), and scared me enough to dump out all of the benzedrex i had left even though i had planned on not using again after that (because i thought i would have a steady supply of adderall instead, which is less harmful than propylhexedrine).<br><br>anyway, for reasons that would take awhile to explain, that event not too many days ago led me to find out that i have OCD, specifically a subtype Existential OCD which includes obsessions over existential/philosophical topics along with the absolute inability to tolerate uncertainty that characterizes OCD. i thought that my dysfunctional pacing around and &#039;thinking&#039; about the meaning of life for, at worst up to 6 hours but usually 1-2hrs a day was just my neurotic personality, but it turns out that its a neurotic pathology. go figure.<br><br>as can probably be figured from my writing, i am still taking stimulants and i must disappoint the anon that tried to get me to hard stop. i am not yet dependent, but that day will probably come soon-- thank you for trying to warn me, and i echo the warning to all others even though i have not fallen apart yet. i know now that my behavior and desire to use is an addiction, and for what it&#039;s worth i no longer deny that. im sorry to that anon, who probably remembers me if you&#039;re here.", "time": 1676289740, "resto": 72200880}, {"no": 72209386, "now":

mental problems prevent me from being productive. the OCD compulsions prevent me from enjoying things even when i am not compulsively performing them, since i am still obsessing about them.<br><br>i can&#039;t say it is only the OCD, because i have other problems too. the fact is that i have tried over the past few years very strongly to get my life together, but it continues to stay broken because i simply am not strong enough to do the right thing. this is not a justification for my use, this is an admission of weakness. an admission i probably would not be able to make if, as the previously mentioned anon had pointed out to me last time i stimposted, i wasn&#039;t extremely high on a drug that directly fires up my reward system.<br><br>my stimulant use has thus far made me able to be productive for time periods, certainly, however i recognize now that the main draw is of course how it just makes me feel good. one of the chilling things this anon said to me was something along the lines of &quot;with a high enough dose, you could receive news that would kill you with despair if you were sober, but still smile because your brain is all lit up from the drug&quot;. that was a truth i felt then enough to scare me to flush all of my retard-drug last time, and it is something i feel now. the OCD is still there while I am on stimulants, but it no longer inspires terrible agony inside of me. the drug cuts off the pain before it gets too deep and disables me, and it replaces it with that electric dopaminergic warmth. that is what i am addicted to, i suppose.<br><br>so, to anybody wondering about trying strong stimulants, i recommend you don&#039;t if you have bad mental problems (everybody on /r9k/) that you would like to be able to be free of. i liked what louis ck

come to terms with their behavior and understand that they are addicted, and try to beat the addiction. it seems that in many cases this takes time, and perhaps many fail, but they want to be helped and do stuff like go to rehab and try to be sober and whatnot<br><br>the second category seems to be filled with the people who, whether they are in denial or not, simply don&#039;t want to stop. they have no desire to stop-- i think these people often tend to be the ones to have nothing left to go back to when sober. they are the ones that don&#039;t want to be helped<br><br>i think i fall into this latter category. no doubt heartache and tears awaits me down this dark road i am staring down, but i think the fact is that i have nothing that makes me want to quit. if i stop doing stimulants i go back to the same life where most days i can&#039;t even get out of bed, where any productivity comes with the immense toll of fighting off my compulsions and ruminations, with the same pains over my own past events. even on stimulants, i still perform compulsions, but i am able to get some things done. i wrote about 4,000 words today. i have been studying mathematics again. but, again, mostly, the stimulants reduce the mental suffering that paralyzes me on most days sober. i don&#039;t choose addiction, even if i made the choices that lead to it. i just don&#039;t want to quit and i

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use?

You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>WTWTW", "time": 1676550437, "resto": 72250779}, {"no": 72250819, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:30:48", "name": "catatonica", "com": "<a href=\"#p72250779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72250779</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spend 2 hours a day walking</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;deep-clean entire house every week</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;feel better about self</span><br>a lot to ask of your average shut-in", "time": 1676550648, "resto": 72250779, "trip": "!7wLQx9m2Uo"}, {"no": 72250827, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:31:49", "name": "Ukranon", "com": "<a href=\"#p72250779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72250779</a><br>Hello anon, nice to see you are back.

Pretty standard stuff if you have had threesomes before, I fuck my gf, he fucks me, we both suck his dick; we both fuck my gf you know the usual stuff in a Sissy/Female/Male threesome. After the deed is done I&#039;m exhausted, take a shower and he drives us back; I get dressed and my parents pick me up later. We met up with him maybe 10 times total? We also met up with 2 other guys but it&#039;s pretty much the same experience for all three. One of them was definetly like 50.<br>Sadly, because of her father&#039;s work she has to leave the country and I wouldn&#039;t see her in the next 7 or so years. By that point I already stopped having my natural femininity. I was starting to bald and overall was very unkempt. We talked about the past and then we never met up again. Now I&#039;m here, all alone, depressed, drinking to cope and writing my memoirs in a mongolian basketweaving server.

Not super rich but probably on the lower end of rich, if Im going to be honest, so we took trips to foreign resorts and beaches pretty often.

Im in my 30s now. <br><br>I dont plan to rekindle or do anything about it again, my mom is older now and Im happily married. <br><br>Alright, with those out of the way, let me get to the point: I had sex with my mom for a full summer, and then sporadically through the span of about a year, back when I was around 19. It happened for the first time during a family vacation. There wasnt much build up, or really anything like a seduction process that I can remember. We were both attracted to each other and that was that, I think. In retrospect I think we were slowly building up to what happened, but it was nothing quite so planned or conscious on our part. Oh and another thing people give me shit about when I share my story: My mom has always been very hot. Proper hot, too, not fetish hot. Always first or second among my high school buddys MILF ranking, whenever we talked about it; and this was a pretty stacked category, seeing as we were all rich, private school kids with pretty moms. Still, I never made much about it. But I knew she was hot.<br><br>As an aside, picrels will be random women who kinda look like her in some way.

For most of my youth she was just my mom, and so I kept her out of my mind in the horny sense. But I always knew she was attractive. I remember she would often get catcalled or stared at in the street and so on, so I just figured. Even now shes hotter than women her age. <br><br>But anyways, as I said, I never made too much of it, back then. At some point, tho, I started noticing more. Just getting more of a sense that she was actually really hot, and she started turning me on. <br><br>And anyways, we were on this vacation, and she had been sunbathing in a bikini like she always did. So I was horny around her all the time. Looking and stealing glances, Im pretty sure.

Not quite flirting per se, but, like, spending more time than usual in unnecessary close proximity to one another. A lot of empty sofa, but nonetheless very close together kind of behaviors. I wasnt experienced enough to cut through the haze of this being my mom back then, but today I think, with more experience, and more distance, thats what was secretly happening.

But anyhow, back to the story: <br><br>We were together at this fancy resort on a family trip. My dad and uncle had booked this group activity thing for the afternoon, and I didnt want to go. Me and my brother were pretty wiped from doing something or other that morning. My mom didnt want to go either, since she never wanted to go to those things and always just wanted to sunbathe and stay next to the pool/beach. So, my brother, my mom and I stayed back, while my uncle, my dad and my cousin went to the thing. <br><br>Me and my brother went to the pool, and were just hanging out until my mom got there. At that point, my brother also decided to bail because he wanted to take a nap, so he went up. I stayed back with my mom, who had been at the beach before. <br><br>Nothing especially meaningful happened at the pool. She had drinks, like everyone does at resorts, and we quipped here and there like moms and sons do, but pretty much just left each other to their own thing. Im sure I was checking her out because I was already pretty consistently doing that by then, but other than walking to sit next to her every few minutes, no one made weird moves or anything. I dont know what else I was doing. Probably flirting with some girl, or practicing dives, since thats what I was used to doing at these resorts, but I cant remember. Eventually my mom insisted I got more sunscreen on, so I went to her chair to get it, but we were out. We had more in her luggage, she said, so I should go get it.

Her and my dad had one room for themselves, me and my brother had a room for ourselves, and then my uncle and my cousin shared a room for the moment and until my aunt got there. We didnt live all together, btw. Not that kind of family. But for vacationing we sometimes traveled together. <br><br>Anyways, at her room, we were both just going about our business at first. No big deal. But then, we both started going through her luggage, and we started brushing against one another, and being in very little clothes right next to each other, and the vibe immediately changed. Not right away, but suddenly it did. <br><br>I remember it very clearly, how electric it felt but also how unsure I was of what to do, despite being fairly certain of what I should do. I dont remember every word, sadly, but I remember the moment very clearly: <br><br>She was standing next to me in nothing but a white bikini, that barely kept everything covered, and I was only wearing a tshirt and bathing suit. We were so close. It would have been an awkward distance to stand in if what was happening hadnt been happening. She wasnt facing me, exactly, either. She was just a little bit turned away, so that she was kind of looking at me above her shoulder, but also not quite. Her hips were cocked, too, so she had some of her butt towards me, except not really. Anyways, I had already grabbed the sunscreen and she had offered to put some on my back, like she usually did. She had offered earlier, at the pool, back when we were still being mostly normal. Still, I said something about the sunscreen, about her applying it, and took off my shirt as I said it, but without moving from the spot I was standing in. I dont know why I went at it the way I did.

It was something like: you sometimes look at me with eyes that a son isnt supposed to give her mother.<br><br>And she still wasnt looking at me. So I grabbed her waist. Pretty aggressively. Not with force, but very boldly, like I wouldnt grab most girls I have met. I grabbed the side one opposite to me, so she slowly turned, after feeling my hand on her.

And then, she finally looked at me, and we started making out. <br><br>From there, we just fell on the bed and had sex. Right away. No pushback, and next to no complaining.

They wanted to take me bouldering, but I didnt know that at the time. This was on a weekday, right after midday, and as I was making my way there, my mom called. Asked what I was doing, and told me my brother had just left to meet friends, in case I wanted to come back, since no one would be home for a while. I knew what this meant, obviously, and knew it would be hard to find more chances that trip. So I went back home right away and just bailed on my buddies, figuring it would be fine. I got home and we fucked in her room for a good while, just staying in bed and having sex a lot. However, it turns out my brother had been messaging and calling for a while. I didnt know, because I just threw my stuff wherever when I got home. A buddy of his had last minute invited him to the same group hangout I was supposed to go, and they were all wondering if I was going to come after all (idk if you anons have gone bouldering but where Im from you usually rent gear and reserve a specific time to go, so just bailing is bad). I never picked up, or noticed, so then when my dad came back home and asked about my day, I told him that I had indeed met up with these friends, and just made up some story. Of course it didnt square with what my brother knew, but I didnt know then. I only noticed after me and mom were done, when I finally checked my phone, that he had even been calling at all, let alone figured out that he knew I had bailed on my buddies. So then when he came back home himself and asked where I was all day, I was caught on a pretty straightforward lie. I freaked out and said some excuse, but didnt really explain. They were just kind enough to drop it. But they knew I lied. My mom freaked out afterwards, obviously, and I didnt really have any response. So that was one time.

But nothing physical. As 5 years ago when I was just starting to pose Alice (not really knowing that I&#039;d love her still 5 years later), I used the Ninth Wave painting (pic rel) for the background because I thought it looks nice. And so as I was staring at Alice on these pictures in the following weeks, I were experiencing some intense emotions ranging from crying out of sadness to euphoric joy. This painting alone now always reminds me of that time and of how many rich feelings I was experiencing.<br>Since then I have of course changed the background to other beautiful pictures numerous times. And I never really returned to this painting. So I thought that it might be a nice symbolic thing to use once again, on the day of our fifth anniversary.<br>But other than that I will spend this day with thinking about the time passed and my love for Alice through the years.

For the longest time, all my other favorite musicians were already dead by the time that I found their music.

As the OP says, even if it is included in normal development, when you get stuck in it much longer than usual, and for those people that&#039;s a real and deep problem. So while it&#039;s good to specify where the core problem, or core question when it&#039;s someone else, is, it&#039;s very easy to slip into presuming that some particular solution would work that also worked for you. But it&#039;s more important that you don&#039;t make others hate you than to offer them solutions, because they will never want your solutions if they hate you first, or even reject them while they are both correct and needed.

Necromancy isn&#039;t explicitly dealing with reanimated corpses, it&#039;s also invoking/envoking and communicating with spirits of the deceased. Some have a natural inclination for this ability, others do not and must develop it, if they can do it at all. As with any type of magick you must have a strong mental fortitude, so if you haven&#039;t already practiced daily meditation and mindfulness, do so. <br><br>If you cannot naturally communicate in some way or form with the spirits of the dead, there are 2 ways I know of that you can &quot;force&quot; your third eye open. <br><br>The first is to have a near-death experience. I&#039;m not talking about almost crashing in a car and swerving at the last moment, you actually have to touch death, breifly get on the other side. Like overdose on heroin to where you&#039;re not breathing or get in some other kind of accident to where your vital signs stop to the point where you&#039;re legally dead for a bit. When you come back (if you do) then there&#039;s a very good chance that you will have gained some extrasensory perception of spirits. <br><br>The 2nd method is to steal the breath of a dying person on their deathbed. You must be with someone in their final moments and basically &quot;inhale&quot; their dying breath with the intention to become closer to the dead.", "filename": "4565435634", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 1203, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676537511775992, "time": 1676537511, "md5": "6ZNVEcgiBBGA+PiTR50xdg==", "fsize": 154561, "resto": 72248305}, {"no": 72249910, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:28:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72248305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72248305</a><br>This is absolutely forbidden because it cannot lead you to life, nor can it sustain you.<br><br>... that being said, why ask for this in particular?", "time": 1676543325, "resto": 72248305}, {"no": 72249922, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:30:09", "name": "pizza delivery anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p72248305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72248305</a><br>5 skulls minimum to start a pyramid.
