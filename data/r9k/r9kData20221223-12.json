If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

Success with women has nothing do with dumb memes like your game, it&#039;s mostly about whether or not they find you attractive and whether or not a better option than you swoops in. It fucking sucks.<br><br>It also fucking sucks that women who don&#039;t know me default to treating me like a dangerous predator and I have that working against me until proven otherwise, which I rarely get the chance to do. I&#039;m not violent and I can handle rejection in a healthy way.

Especially since puberty where suddenly from being a girl playing at the playground I had men of all ages leer at me, make weird remarks and in general be creepy. You have no idea just how much this happens and how afraid this makes you during daily life. This is not merely catcalling or compliments as many of you seem to think. This is things like men grabbing you, holding you in place, blocking your path, following behind you on the streets. And you never know if this is the end or not. At any moment of time one could pull a knife, rape you or worse. Everyone I know has experienced at least one genuine rape attempt in their lives.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s just minorities</span><br>I don&#039;t know if you are being serious or just being confrontational but assuming you guys actually mean this; No. I&#039;ve personally never dated a minority and the only negative experience I&#039;ve had with them is catcalling. I&#039;ve never been groped or attacked by a minority. They tend to leave white women alone. The most dangerous creeps tend to be older white men. They are the ones grabbing you by the arm out of nowhere so hard it leaves bruises and giving you heart attacks<br><br>Also there are so many other things we have to do that you guys don&#039;t realize. I have to avoid eye contact with men at all times because men think making eye contact is an invitation or flirtation. I almost always wear a headset when commuting with public transport, otherwise it&#039;s guaranteed that some guy is going to hackle you. I have to always look in window reflections to see if someone is walking behind me, and if they are I have to increase pace or change streets to see if they are actually stalking or not.", "time": 1671790697, "resto": 71507890}, {"no": 71515439, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)05:23:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71515406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71515406</a><br>You misunderstood the minority post.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep, deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><a href=\"#p71516246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71516246</a><br>This anon gets it.", "filename": "1611312397491", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1671797665098214, "time": 1671797665, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 71516114}, {"no": 71516292, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)07:18:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71516268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71516268</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heaven unconditionally</span><br>What about hell (i havent studied NDE), isnt it logical that some bad people go to hell?", "time": 1671797884, "resto": 71516114}, {"no": 71516330, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)07:22:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71516292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71516292</a><br>OP here.

I had it done on the NHS and although they resolved the phimosis, the cosmetic outcome was very poor. So I looked into getting it revised and there was a surgeon in Russia who was very well known for fixing botched circumcisions. I saved money up for a while to get it sorted, but then I ended up being fucked over by COVID and the Ukraine invasion. Eventually I just said &quot;fuck it&quot; and went over to Moscow in June of this year. I got questioned in the airport for about 3 hours, but when I told them the reason I was there, it was almost so absurd that they had no choice but to believe, because it wasn&#039;t something you would make up on the spot.<br><br>It has been a stressful ordeal but I finally ended up with a nice looking and functional penis. If you&#039;re going to have it done as an adult, I highly recommend going private and researching the surgeon beforehand.", "time": 1671727312, "resto": 71501577}, {"no": 71505109, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)11:47:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71501577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71501577</a><br>why can&#039;t more women be as enthusiastic like the one in the webm?

Think about who you&#039;re competing with as a 30 y/o trying to get women 18-21. It&#039;s guys 18-21, aka guys barely out of puberty without fully developed brains, who have had 9-12 years less than you to build status, money and muscle. At 30 you should have your own place, most zoomer men won&#039;t even live alone if they rent because they can&#039;t afford it. Men get demoralised because it&#039;s rough for young men in the dating market because 30 year old men have access to things 18 year old men don&#039;t, but those things come to the people who put the effort in to reap the rewards when they&#039;re older. Women have it in reverse, which is why it&#039;s so much worse for them, by the time they realise the reality of the post wall dating market, it&#039;s too late and they used their youth sleeping around.

Friend2 really tried to be smooth and was trying to be flirty with hoe, though she was just teasing him the whole time and he never ended up getting any action. We cooked some dinner and afterward, friend2 ended up having to leave and left us with hoe. We were watching some pirated episodes of south park on my laptop, and the chemistry between friend1 and hoe was very good. For whatever reason, we just ended up on the bed in there in some weird cuddling 3-way, just cuddling with nothing sexual at all between us.

For example we have plenty of results for various gene alterations that can improve lifespan, give immunity/resistance to certain diseases(That&#039;s what that Chinese doctor did for some embryos in regards to HIV iirc) and also remove certain congenital diseases from appearing in someone&#039;s offspring. There&#039;s also embryo selection where you essentially fertilize a bunch of embryos in vtiro and then compare the genetics of said embryos to pick which ones you want to keep. The latter I imagine wouldn&#039;t be to your liking since it&#039;s the termination of life at its very root. Some of the gene editting stuff is also more risky, the Chinese doctor got flack because crispr can also cause massive deletions of segments of DNA instead of just replacing a segment with what you want.", "time": 1671761633, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511798, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:25:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511663</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;which games? any maps you can post</span><br>sure, it&#039;s for games using the source engine like Garry&#039;s mod, half-life 2 etc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also, I would say I like bike rides but..</span><br>I don&#039;t really do it as a form of exercise I just enjoy riding around and the health benefits are just a bonus", "filename": "oldroom", "ext": ".png", "w": 1440, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671762324171270, "time": 1671762324, "md5": "1uocO/hHwl33YS0OvrcsXA==", "fsize": 1444313, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511828, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:28:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511483</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;conservative egirl</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;had sex with countless women</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;checks out</span><br>My political leanings have nothing to do with my sex life.", "time": 1671762488, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511868, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:31:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71504131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71504131</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gender</span><br>Female<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;age</span><br>24<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;height</span><br>5&#039;9<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weight</span><br>135-140 lbs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;race</span><br>White<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;color of eyes</span><br>Greenish-blue? idk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;color of hair</span><br>Blonde<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;color of skin</span><br>White<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how big is your cock / how big are your boobs</span><br>36D<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;occupation / job</span><br>Writer<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite food</span><br>Any sort of pasta or sushi<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite movie</span><br>End of Evangelion<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite book</span><br>Lolita<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;favorite song</span><br>Alison by Slowdive<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;political ideology</span><br>Progressive on most issues, but I don&#039;t like trannies or minorities<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religion</span><br>Atheist<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bodycount</span><br>2 (one guy, one girl)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;describe yourself in 3 words</span><br>Dreamy, curious, passionate<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;describe your ideal partner in 3 words</span><br>Intelligent, romantic, easygoing <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;zodiac sign</span><br>Virgo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MBTI personality</span><br>INFP<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why are you on r9k?</span><br>More interesting people/conversations + freedom of speech", "time": 1671762712, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511901, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:35:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511483</a><br>content for my insta acc", "time": 1671762953, "resto": 71504131}, {"no": 71511924, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:38:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71511868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71511868</a><br>Writer?

I&#039;ve gone to see a few metal bands live, and it&#039;s always a good time, provided that I have a few drinks. There&#039;s nothing quite like the atmosphere of getting drunk while seeing a really loud band play metal. Even someone like me who is completely anxious about everything socially was able to go and just get drunk and headbang a bit. However, I wouldn&#039;t expect to make any friends especially women. You have to be a social person to do that, you have to be the kind of person that is going to start a conversation with random strangers. Many people (most people probably) that are there will be with a friend or group of friends (assuming you are a real robot, you will be going alone) so you&#039;ll just kinda be the loner, which is ok, but don&#039;t expect people just to magically come up and start talking to you. It&#039;s on you to do that. I&#039;m not able to do that. I just go for the music and booze and still have a good time, except for the guilt and self hatred after I go home realizing I wasn&#039;t able to talk to anyone, or have any women interested in me, and knowing that I got some permanent hearing damage for my trouble. Really, as a hypochondriac, the hearing damage really bothers me so I pick and choose carefully when going see a band live is worth it. Often it&#039;s better just to stay in my bedroom and get drunk listening to music rather than going out because a) I have to usually drive drunk home and b) I get upset with myself for seeing all the normies and not making any social connections. I would say what you should do is just look at local bands, pick out one you like, and go there and try to have a good time.

Recent advances suggests in a somewhat near future (20-30 years) it will be possible for a full body transplant. Currently in china there are experiments involving rat head transplants (project HEAVEN/gemini procedure) this technology has a 100 year history but only really started getting anywhere in the 70s. Advancements in neurology suggests we might soon be able to fix neuron connections (spine damage caused in a brain transplant) using PEG or carbon nanotubes. Then by the month new advancements appear relating to organ printing or xenotransplantation.

Twice a week is more stable serum levels but once a, week is fine. What&#039;s not fine is if you somehow got a prescription and took it the way doctors say to which is once every month. If you care to know why look at half life charts for the specific ester of testosterone. You want stable levels not huge peaks and troughs.

There is also dorsogluteal, back of your butt, vastus lateralis, middle of leg.
