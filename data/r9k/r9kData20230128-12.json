Doing that for like half an hour or more. I think the theory behind it is that the point moving side to side simulates the how your eyes move when you are sleeping in the REM zone and there the brain consolidates memory or something like that. So it is like some kind of hypnosis trying to substitute some thoughts for others. At first I was shocked that was what my parents were paying 50 bucks/hour for and also trying to not laugh because it looked like some fake hypnosis bullshit. <br><br>But many things in psychology are like that, you have to believe in them to be effective. Many of them are bullshit or aren&#039;t really proven. But there isn&#039;t much more about psychologists, they ask you what is your problem, then about your life, relationship with your parents, then they give you some psychological explanation of what happens to you and finally they try different therapies or drugs to see if something helps you.

Last year I was getting my internet upgraded so I ended up not having any for two weeks. Installed a bunch of modern games that I happened to have amassed over the years and never played. Most were utter dogshit. I liked Bioshock 1 and 2 okay as shooters with slight rpg elements. Played them years ago. But Infinite was genuinely terrible. I don&#039;t know how anybody who isn&#039;t mentally retarded can consider this GOTY material, or even passable. Every single thing about it is just executed horribly. Thankfully I also had a couple decent indie shooters installed. Project Warlock was a lot of fun and I ended up playing through it a few times over those weeks with different builds. Outside of the occasional collection of an old series I liked and indie stuff, I don&#039;t really even care about most games anymore. I don&#039;t seek out news from them or anything. 95% of it is going to be complete dogshit, and then a lot of that remaining 5% is going to be stuff that just isn&#039;t for me but is still decently made. There&#039;s just so little depth in the new stuff. The money goes into graphics and celebrity voice actors and figuring out how to make the gameplay as inoffensive as possible to as many people as possible. There&#039;s no creative vision to most of it anymore, not to mention the monetization issues. Just imagine if Chrono Trigger or Viewtiful Joe or .hack or anything like those tried to come out today.

Now I make the food I like instead of what we grew up eating though. Just think about what you usually order and make it.<br>Easiest format and you can&#039;t go wrong with is meat+potato+vegetable. Rice can replace potatoes but that&#039;s more of a southern thing. I have money so I get potatoes. <br>Compared to Uber eats you can probably afford a ribeye or strip. A little salt and pepper and it&#039;s seasoned. Get the skillet as hot as you can and sear the outside. Cook longer and it goes from rare to medium. Potatoes are impossible to fuck up as long as you add salt and some kind of fat to it. Any vegetable you like works but my favorites are asparagus, broccoli, green beans, turnip greens, whatever is cheap. Not technically a vegetable but mushrooms just need to pan cook with a shitload of butter and garlic powder.<br>Macaroni and cheese is a favorite of mine. A little milk with a spoon of sodium citrate is all it needs. Grate like a pound of cheese and melt it in to make the sauce. Actually tastes better than the fussy technique based method using flour. The sodium citrate makes the cheese stay liquid, and it only takes a little bit to work. <br>I like Serious Eats for new recipes because they break every thing down into simple baby steps and explain the reasoning why. They approach cooking like a man would. Women just think &quot;hmm what would be shitty and super bad...

Pena-Marin and Bhargave make heavy use of a research method known as &quot;meta-analysis&quot;, that is, examination of data from multiple independent studies of relevance. The citation of priorly published research supports the thesis of Pena-Marin and Bhargave without the need to entirely conduct their own research from the ground up. The implications of the studies used by Pena-Marin and Bhargave tend to point towards a general idea that the symbolic association of a &quot;rounded&quot; number (such as 20, instead of 19.79) causes a viewer to store an association with such a number in their semantical memory. The implication here is that aesthetic appearances, even those of numbers, have an effect on the mind of the consumer. </span><br>What one can draw from these conclusions, in a business/marketing setting, is the pricing of items, along with nutritional content, volume, etc. can be subtly and deliberately labeled in such a way to entice consumers into purchasing it. For example, &quot;Monster Energy Zero&quot; energy drinks are labeled as having &quot;zero sugar&quot;. The name, &quot;Zero&quot; also seems definite in its statement that it is null of any &quot;unhealthy&quot; ingredients. Of course, the fine print is that a can of Monster Energy Zero is in fact, 10 calories. Continuing with the theme of caffeine (and the research paper), many caffeinated energy drinks use rounded numbers to list the milligrams of caffeine per can: 130mg, 150mg, 200mg, etc. A rounded number, such as one ending in zero, has some evidence to show influence on how long the effects of the caffeine will last", "filename": "1635874045837", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674882911258492, "time": 1674882911, "md5": "CacvPyo3ivDpQdYMGgcZLQ==", "fsize": 62421, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 71996298, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:39:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71996115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71996115</a><br>Enjoy your sendoff<br>remember it&#039;s not being disappointed by your new city you&#039;re just coming down off the drugs <br>But whatever if you want to interpret that as being homesick it&#039;s your body", "time": 1674884342, "resto": 71994310}, {"no": 71996360, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:46:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71996053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71996053</a><br>According to studies, up to once a month if you do everything perfectly, that includes doses and not overheating, and you&#039;re probably not doing everything perfectly.<br><br>So once every two months sounds better.<br><br>Reminder that if you have a comedown, this means you fucked up and possibly harmed your brain.

Semen contains lots of stem cells and other nutrients which circulate through your body and keep you young and healthy. Cooming frequently does the opposite. The more you ejaculate, the faster you age.<br>Not to mention that porn/masturbation flood your brain with dopamine, which can lead to addiction and other mental problems.<br><a href=\"#p71996820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71996820</a><br>A 2008 study actually found that masturbation increases your risk of prostate cancer because you&#039;re constantly flooding your prostate tissue with prolactin, which is carcinogenic.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>MBMB", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674905533888757, "time": 1674905533, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 71998434, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>MNMN", "time": 1674905574, "resto": 71998428}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71998424, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:31:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ever heard of Pink Lady?", "filename": "pinklady", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2392, "h": 2394, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674905498877319, "time": 1674905498, "md5": "e4diTBI3jdLjPjLIKngigQ==", "fsize": 1212384, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ever-heard-of-pink-lady", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71995818, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:39:15", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "how do i study when i feel like death?", "com": "please help exams are at the 30 and i have to also do a bunch of drawings", "filename": "tzeeze", "ext": ".png", "w": 1265, "h": 947, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1674880755899130, "time": 1674880755, "md5": "gAeaO0SkYnmkiS7I7QAFyw==", "fsize": 1176406, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-do-i-study-when-i-feel-like-death", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 28, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 14}, {"no": 71995827, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:40:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995818</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how do i study when i feel like death</span><br>same what do u study anon, these classes aren&#039;t too hard but so mind numbing", "time": 1674880810, "resto": 71995818}, {"no": 71995870, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:46:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995818</a><br>why are you studying anything? shouldnt you be doing camwhoring like you used to and also do twitch simp farming and do onlyfans?<br><br>its not like your future husband is going to be ignorant of your whorish ways, so you might as well capitalize on your youth?<br><br>lol", "filename": "1578981435108", "ext": ".png", "w": 404, "h": 404, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674881167199753, "time": 1674881167, "md5": "Oy3bWdhPKxaFIeyOv+mprA==", "fsize": 120533, "resto": 71995818}, {"no": 71995876, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:46:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995818</a><br>I hope you flunk, you are that annoying.", "time": 1674881215, "resto": 71995818}, {"no": 71995880, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:47:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995818</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have to do a bunch of drawings</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For uni</span><br>What sort of artfag major nonsense is this?", "filename": "1591916492331", "ext": ".png", "w": 200, "h": 199, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674881254877916, "time": 1674881254, "md5": "WOo0QpeNQh8aNicrsINF7A==", "fsize": 59948, "resto": 71995818}, {"no": 71995967, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:56:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995818</a><br>Simple you just ghost anons you add :3<br>More time for you to study right?", "time": 1674881800, "resto": 71995818}, {"no": 71995980, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:57:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995967</a><br>i have issues rigth now<br><a href=\"#p71995870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995870</a><br>not me", "time": 1674881873, "resto": 71995818}, {"no": 71996011, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:01:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71995818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71995818</a><br>Go study at the library and put your phone on silent.
