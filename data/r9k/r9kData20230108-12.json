Your tongue will be able to tell you what your low in. Like vit c. An orange is very high in it.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use?

Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>GOGO", "time": 1673163375, "resto": 71741068}, {"no": 71741466, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:23:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71741068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71741068</a><br>I am going to disembowel you and wear your skin OP", "time": 1673166212, "resto": 71741068}, {"no": 71741719, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)04:06:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71741466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71741466</a><br>Have you thought about th smell?", "filename": "e95d85b6-4677-482c-af6b-ee4074f27a12_text", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673168788735030, "time": 1673168788, "md5": "nFwZ/EQiMzvTFeOG3o1LSA==", "fsize": 527961, "resto": 71741068}, {"no": 71741736, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)04:09:42", "name": "6.62607015", "com": "<a href=\"#p71741068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71741068</a><br>ahoy anon good thread, keep it up. a bit early today, here&#039;s some energy for the lazy sunday<br><br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RWKib<wbr>0J4SmY", "time": 1673168982, "resto": 71741068}, {"no": 71741815, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)04:25:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bro just leaked the doomer to bloomer course", "time": 1673169930, "resto": 71741068}, {"no": 71741835, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)04:31:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71741736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71741736</a><br>Totally different vibe from your last posts.

Nobody has ever answered this question for me. What do women want and what do they have to offer in return?<br><br>A good female partner, IMO, is someone who makes your life better than it is without them. But a lot of women are scum who will make your life worse. In Western simpciety, we&#039;re not allowed to call women out for being POS assholes. We&#039;re allowed to say a man like Andrew Tate is a POS scumbag. But we&#039;re not allowed to say the same about his female equivalent. But if you look at it, there are some women who objectively worsen the lives of their male partners. Look at Meghan Markle, for example.

Yes, you can be successful single, but if you cant get laid, it is sign of you being a loser. Women outside of dating apps (on which there are several times more men then women) women will date you based on how much of a loser you are. NEETs and hikkies are basically guaranteed to be incels because they are the biggest losers. Then wedgies doing minimum wage work. Then mediocre normies getting average job, and finally successful people having either successful business or high-paying job. Money is however still not everything, status and how prestigious the job or your hobbies are also matters. Plumber unclogging shit might under some circumstances make more then a doctor, but doctor is more prestigious. Or you can be a wedgie with super interesting hobbies. Either way this thing is happening all over the world, not just West, and is not confined to western culture. Maybe 40 years ago Asians didnt act like this, but not because of different culture, but because they were all mostly rice farmers walking in mud all day, so they couldnt even try to think outside of marrying another rice farmer and having kids be rice farmers.", "time": 1673176650, "resto": 71741859}, {"no": 71742442, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:18:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71741889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71741889</a><br>If you watched porn then you never suffered, you are just alone by choice", "time": 1673176727, "resto": 71741859}, {"no": 71742479, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)06:23:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71741859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71741859</a><br>Yes, I am: obese, a 26 year old virgin, mildly aspergic, anti-social, don&#039;t drive, live with my parents, work in IT, and have odd interests.

Then once at least one girl did this, you met at least one girl, you take her on a date or two, go back somewhere to your place or hers or a rented room somewhere, and you see the vagina, all you have to do is have a haircut and act quircky and confident. Warning: this does not work if you are under 5&#039;8, bald, or way below average looking. <br>But yeah this is your best bet anon, to get a girl to hit up on you, or at least have a friend go tell a specific girl hey that guy said he likes you can he come over to chat? and you go, this is easy fucking mode even if you fail you get to sit next to a girl and chat, I repeat, get a friend, go to a cafe or bar, see a group of girls, tell your friend to tell a specific girl you want to talk to her, and go over and talk. Then it&#039;s endless possibilities, if you&#039;re funny and interesting you will see the vagina, if you&#039;re sad and awkward and low energy, no pussy for you.

I don&#039;t understand the enjoyment they get from &quot;socialising&quot;, this one time I went to a pub with my friend and it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life, all they did was listen to shitty blaring music, make inane conversation, drink alcohol, and play pool for hours on end.

Another thing that botheres me about them is the general Ignorance and lack of intellectual curiosity, they don&#039;t care about history, geopolitics, books, are either extremly politisised or are not political at all, but both are ignorant to the real issues plaguing their country, most normies just seem to lack any real intellectual curiosity + critical thinking ontop of being easilg offended.

They were too unstable and they would get left quickly. Some of them were too afraid of men to even talk to one, it took a lot of effort on my part to get them to communicate with me and I&#039;m not exactly a threatening person. Almost all of them were abused very harshly in their early lives and the mental and physical damage was too much for any would-be suitor. The ones that took the opposite route and became hypersexual were still incapable of long term relationships. Sex doesn&#039;t cure loneliness, it seems.
