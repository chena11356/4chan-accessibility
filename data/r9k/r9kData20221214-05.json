The guy got all pissed off at me and just kept asking me about it, eventually I got up and went over to the Asian chick and was like, can I just get my weed, and I got it and left and didn&#039;t go back. <br><br>Now in retrospect, dude was DEFINITELY just spewing complete horseshit.

Bodily fluids are rather disgusting to think about, plus there is stuff like thinking about how humans are bags of flesh. Most annoying of all would be the female companion; she would likely make moaning sounds which is one of my greatest annoyances with porn. Porn is much better with the sound off and sadly during regular sex I could not wear earmuffs. There is also the thought of it being a lot of physical exertion, I likely would prefer her to do the work since I am lazy but then would find it boring since I have nothing to do. There is also the issue of body warmth and skin touching, I hate heat and would rather a cold environment, plus I have sensitive skin and would rather not deal with contact. I also equate the sensation of an orgasm to be similar to that of a roller coaster; I hate the gut dropping sensation of being on a roller coaster and thus likely would absolutely hate to orgasm. For reference, I do not masturbate due to disliking all the fluids involved and hate friction. Since sex is essentially masturbation but far more forceful since it is an entire body, I imagine I would hate it even more.<br><br>Sex is far more appealing in the mind with as few details involved as possible. I find rape based porn appealing for the scenarios and situations it presents, some I may even consider arousing, yet I do not feel I would enjoy these acts in person and would make it very clear from the beginning of a relationship that I wish to remain asexual.<br><br>Part of me feels this is why I can never be with someone else.

The problem with trying to type people based on something like conversational style is that cognition is internal, while presentation is external, thus one step removed. Intuition, for example, is irrational and automatic, but intuitions can be subjected to reason after the fact, so it might appear that someone who is really relying more on intuitions is primarily rational. Of course Jung typed people using their writing in Psychological Types - but it wasn&#039;t just their writing, he was also using all of the autobiographical information he could gather about them. Jung closely studied these people, not just their style but their values, beliefs, life history etc, and even then he expressed caution in typing.<br><br>I assume one way CSJ gets around this limitation is with his &quot;four sides of the mind&quot; idea, where for example the unconscious or superego each has its own function stack that could be more easily identified. I don&#039;t think this is really compatible with Jungian theory though; the persona might have its own will, but it would be incomplete and fragmentary compared with the ego. <br><br>Likewise, the unconscious shouldn&#039;t have its own function stack, since a function stack is determined by the relative differentiation and resulting opposition between functions, while what is unconscious should be undifferentiated and fused together (primal). <br><br>This isn&#039;t to say his ideas are completely useless though, just that I don&#039;t think they&#039;re fully coherent from a theoretical standpoint.", "filename": "Ff04nA0VUAAGPsR", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670884684058993, "time": 1670884684, "md5": "9pCAsmXObH0KSVHiIHCb7w==", "fsize": 44713, "resto": 71355948}, {"no": 71373546, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:48:40", "name": "Turbie, Anons&#039; Waifu", "com": "...continues from <a href=\"#p71373196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71373196</a>!<br><br><br><a href=\"#p71367123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71367123</a><br>Are types and chocolates connected?

Most of my neighbors are boomers and they sometimes pay me to fix certain issues with their houses, like a broken hinge on a door, support column on their porch, etc. A nice woman who I didn&#039;t know well asked me if I&#039;d be willing to fix the flickering lights in her bathroom. Electrical is not my forte, but I said I&#039;d at least look at it. I come over her to place and just as I was taking a look at it, she gets a phonecall. Says she urgently has to take care of something, will be gone for an hour but she trusts me enough to leave me alone in her house. She leaves, and I quickly figure out that the issue is the light switch panel has come loose. I fix it by simply screwing it in tighter, problem solved.<br><br>So I&#039;m alone, and I have access to her home for an hour... I decided to snoop around, like I usually do. I open a random door and find a girl&#039;s bedroom... band posters on the wall, super messy. I could tell that it wasn&#039;t the lady&#039;s bedroom, it must have been her daughter&#039;s. The perve in me went straight to her underwear drawer. What I saw blew my mind... thongs, g-strings, all kinds of lacy panties, bras, corsets, so much slutty stuff. Figured that any girl who owned stuff this sexy must at least be in her 20&#039;s. This made me horny and I couldn&#039;t help myself, I took out a bunch of her stuff and took pictures of it on her bed. Jerked off into a thong, cleaned it off, put it back along with the rest of her stuff.<br><br>Then I looked around some more and found pictures of the girl, cute skinny blonde, and found her ID... she&#039;s 14. I just jerked off into some 14 year old&#039;s thong. I couldn&#039;t believe that someone so young owned all that slutty stuff... is that really that common among teens? Had no idea.

I know this sounds crazy, but I&#039;m going to tell my experience and maybe others can corroborate this. <br>Most people see VR porn as the most degenerate thing there is, but anyone that has a VR set will tell you, VR gets old fast and most is gathering dust. <br>VR porn was exciting at first, incredible but after a month i fell back into normal porn addiction and lust and stopped using VR. <br>Thats because VR porn is basically the same as regular sex. Which means its just as dull. I think the main aspect of porn addiction is the variety searching, and all the pics and different videos. Watching a VR porn video is like regular sex, which means it gets boring at parts. it&#039;s just a lady on top of you going up and down. <br><br>Recently, about a month ago, I decided to buy a subscription to VR porn site. For about a month now, I watch at most just one video a day, because I want it to be like regular sex. <br>The thing is, it&#039;s not addicting. I even have to kind of force myself to use it. I barely have a sex drive like as if I have wife. <br>The effects of this after a month is I no longer have lust or desire for women really. I think it&#039;s because VR porn is almost indistinguishable from real sex. My porn addiction was predicated on a fantasy and sexual frustration, and VR porn is more like the real thing. Because of this, I&#039;ve realized how stupid it is to lust for women. Women basically mean nothing to me now. <br>Contrary to regular porn addiction, I don&#039;t even feel bad after. I feel sexually healthy and balanced and can just go about my life like a normal person. <br>No more lust or frustration or regrets about missed opportunities and anger. I just feel content. <br><br>BTW -- I&#039;m not an incel, I&#039;ve had sex before, and I can tell you sex is basically the same as VR porn. If anything, VR porn is better<br>VR porn instills in me something I already knew, but it makes me realize how pointless sex is without love.
