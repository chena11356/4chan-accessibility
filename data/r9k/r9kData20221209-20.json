His parents and professionals around him thought it would be a good idea to try and make him think he was a girl and it failed miserably. He refused to wear dresses, he engaged in tomboy activities.<br><br>Taken in the context of people existing who do not regret surgery or crossdressing or any of those things he provides very compelling evidence of gender identity; that you CAN NOT make just any person who was born male into a trans women because that is not what they all are.<br><br>They basically made a trans boy out of a cis male.<br><br>Not that I think we should be fucking around with kids like this.
