She gets excited for movie nights, mostly old movies and foreign movies, because they make for the best cuddles.

She&#039;s aware that we&#039;re all doomed, but still looks for small ways to improve the world. She makes an effort to be nice to people whenever she can. She&#039;s a little too shy and awkward to be a normie, but she&#039;s learned how to mask as one so we can get along with our normie family and normie friends. She casually studies foreign languages because she loves other cultures and dreams of traveling the world, but she&#039;s very grounded on the financial logistics of that. She gets excited for experimentation in the kitchen, which involves lots of teamwork and lots of healthy veggies. She stays healthy by staying active too, not a gym nut, but enough of a casual exerciser to keep in decent shape. She does a little gaming but not too much, with a preference for board games. She plans to never stop learning more about this world we live in. She&#039;s communicative in both directions, able to share from herself and to ask good questions to draw out from others. She&#039;s honest and loyal and forgiving and pragmatic and principled. She doesn&#039;t judge individuals before knowing them, and doesn&#039;t let those individuals cause her to judge entire groups of people. She makes solid plans for the future, and we&#039;re going to build that future together. She ensures that we can always make time for our quality time.

She was the most beautiful girl to me for the whole of our relationship. She was very curvy and very pretty. She was deeply flawed as a person but I 100% believed in her and helped her start therapy, get a job, etc. And it seemed like she loved me just the same. She always made me little gifts, we professed our love regularly, and I worked a lot to keep our lifestyle stable. I 100% believed that we would become better for each other as time went on and I knew in my bones that she was the one.<br><br>Eventually, my buddy&#039;s brother entered our life and starting getting rather close to my gf, though I trusted her absolutely and assumed she had just made a friend. One day, she basically told me she was having massive issues with the relationship. This was just days before she was traveling for a vacation. I lived in constant anxiety for the next 2 weeks until she came back from vacation and broke up with me out of the blue for &quot;being distant&quot; and because she was &quot;unhappy.&quot; I was fed the basic crap about still being friends, nothing really changing, and whatever else women say to a man they&#039;ve broken. I learned the next day that she had been having an affair with my buddy&#039;s brother for about a month beforehand. After that, I cannot ever forgive her for throwing away 3 years of blood, sweat, and tears all because a guy she had known for like a week acted as a shoulder to cry on. My life has little greater purpose I can justify anymore.
