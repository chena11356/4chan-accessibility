In the past, I&#039;ve had coworkers who have been upset with me and avoid me outside of work. Sometimes it got to the point where they&#039;d show up to work and purposefully ignore me, they wouldn&#039;t say &quot;Hi&quot; or make eye contact, and I know the feeling that forms inside of you. You look over at them, but you don&#039;t want to look too long because you don&#039;t want to stare, so you just keep throwing them these occasional glares until they&#039;re gone, and while you&#039;re doing that, there&#039;s this blob that forms inside of you, it sinks your stomach and chills your blood and constricts your spine, because you know they&#039;re doing it on purpose and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.<br><br>This has happened to me twice. One of the issues I was able to resolve, but the other, I was unsuccessful with. I ended up trying to be rude towards them towards them in the end, just hoping that they&#039;d say something to me, but nothing ever happened. I know you&#039;re thinking it&#039;s hypocritical of me to say this after my previous suggestion, but my incident had a lot of background to it as well as a lot of moving pieces, so it was a fairly different situation, but the feeling was still there.<br><br>The only advice I can offer to you now is to carry on as best as possible, until things begin to change. Carrying on and persevering is the best thing to do, even if it feels impossible, even if every time you see him a little piece of you dies, even if the sadness you harbour inside your souls feels as if it will never subside, you gotta keep carrying on, and just keep making your way through the storm.

No judgement here, Anon. I have found myself in your shoes more often than I would like, even to this day. But it is because of not taking my own advice, choosing to put my heart last. Making things worse by complicating them further. There is a feeling safety in a spiral, of feeling like you do not know where you are going, when the alternative seems certain and scary. There is a balance, there is an extent to which you can speak up for yourself and clearly, politely ask for the love you need before that circles back around to being unhealthy or even toxic. You do have to try your best to be okay. But you are not alone in a relationship, so you should not feel alone. If I knew every side, even just more aspects of your side, it would still be tricky to comment on. Again, challenge yourself to change, to grow, to be a little stronger. But that cannot and should not be the only thing. Do not let it get out of hand. I know it can be very validating to be loved even for your too-muchness, but do not let that be the thing that decides how much of your hurt and neediness you express, if you have the ability to still be honest with your girlfriend without poisoning or draining. There is a middle ground, so find it. So you can be loved for 100% of what makes you you, but so you can also be proud of giving 110%, of being able to love yourself hard enough it makes it easier for your girlfriend to show how much she loves you.<br>*crosses fingers*<br>I think ideally, but logically, and speak from experience.

It did not work as well as stims for this purpose--like it didn&#039;t make me hornier--however, it made the porn I was watching look a lot nicer. Like it was as if the trashy ass porn I was watching was some sort of artistic masterpiece, almost had an epic quality to it. So I&#039;m thinking maybe if every time I smoke weed I just immediately start fapping, I will be able to finally enjoy weed.<br>Thoughts on this strategy?", "filename": "call on m", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 673, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673816506481582, "time": 1673816506, "md5": "F8iraxx4UBB8gZXbIhIKOA==", "fsize": 126039, "resto": 71818972}, {"no": 71838280, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)16:04:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Just popping in to say that I love magic mushrooms.

The main difference between left (liberals) and right (conservatives) is the definition of the smallest unit in society. Left in general believes the smallest unit is the individual so the rules should be built around them. It doesn&#039;t matter if the individual is a fucking degenerate. However this erodes society as a whole as the only way to keep this up if we normalize pretty much everything in the long run. Notice how we went from black / women rights to a man wearing huge fake tits and teaching children in school while everyone pretending this is normal. The greatest danger of this is making people more and more degenerate as crazy shit is treated normal as years go by. We might joke about normalizing pedophilia but in reality we are on the way to actually do it in a few decades.<br><br>For the right the smallest unit is the family. Yes it is inherently a stricter unit and not without faults. Notice conservatism doesn&#039;t mean no change but change in a much slower pace to give time to consider the consequences. It is telling you think any strictness means the person is a psychopath. Because you never experienced any hardships. Liberalism can only thrive if the society is lazy and fat.

Women break up male relationships and create artificial drama therein, often by putting themselves in front of the figurative train, wedged between two friends, in order to steal the best one and leave the other in the dirt.<br>It&#039;s cruel but even moreso proves their feelings are dull and not attuned to the same vital frequency that excites male bonds. <br>I admit it&#039;s mostly a subjective feeling and if I had a girlfriend at the same time I wouldn&#039;t feel the same way.", "time": 1673871317, "resto": 71842599}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71846617, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:02:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.<br>But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.", "filename": "1672734852030097", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 865, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 180, "tim": 1673870559233779, "time": 1673870559, "md5": "Rf1iscrLmiYdpBzr2uHLXA==", "fsize": 1252110, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "now-therefore-kill-every-male-among-the-little", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 71846684, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:14:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Based yhwh enjoyer", "time": 1673871279, "resto": 71846617}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71845045, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:46:35", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/nightwalk/", "com": "Sometime my heart skips a beat when I see another lonely /nightwalker/<br><br>The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night", "filename": "IMG_20221230_001150", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3024, "h": 4032, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673855195787888, "time": 1673855195, "md5": "AhdUlIg0uCiCWxjiWAjHzQ==", "fsize": 600210, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "nightwalk", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 10, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 71845050, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:47:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71845045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71845045</a><br>I&#039;d like to but I hate the cold.

That there are only various subsets of one. That zero itself is both a part of that one and also not part of it and non-existent. If all that exists is contained within the number 1 then any arbitrary breakdown of that 1 would still be a part of it. We think that there are distinct objects in the world but those objects are always made of lesser parts and themselves part of a greater whole. You consider yourself one &quot;thing&quot; but you are made up of cells and molecules etc. Any boundary set is purely arbitrary. And here lies the problem with postulating the existence of zero. Zero cannot actually be experienced or measured in any sense because the negation of everything cannot be experienced in a universe of something. Once you add anything to zero it is no longer zero. Mathematics as a philosophical outlook for understanding the world relies on it&#039;s own metaphysical assumption that zero is an actual thing even though mathematicians themselves have yet to puzzle out just what the hell zero actually is. Which is why they still don&#039;t know what the hell dividing by zero means and so forth. It just results in an infinity. And if all of creation is contained within 1 then logically 1 would also be infinite. Or to put it in a more poorly worded way. If 1 in a binary system encompasses everything, then it is infinite.

Their value systems are heavily influenced by cultural and societal norms, which reveals the outward focus of their feeling function.

Jung writes of extraverted feelers as those where feeling &quot;loses its personal character -- it becomes feeling per se; it almost seems as though the personality were wholly dissolved in the feeling of the moment. Now, since actual life situations constantly and successively alternate, in which the feeling-tones released are not only different but are actually mutually contrasting, the personality inevitably becomes dissipated in just so many different feelings.&quot; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung<wbr>ian_cognitive_functions#Extraverted<wbr>_feeling)</span><br><br>The gist of it is to look for social harmony.

By the nature of an object that is intangible and unobservable, it is very likely that we wouldn&#039;t even suspect its existence. For example, gravity, there could be some intangible object that causes the force we know as gravity. We cannot observe the object itself, but we can represent its force &quot;gravity&quot; with math. As a result of that, we cannot define any of the attributes of the object that creates the force known as gravity, if it does in fact exist. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If nobody knows that an object exists, and if it&#039;s a complete unknown unknown rather than a known unknown, is it an object?</span><br>Yes. But, due to the nature of the object being intangible, it can only be represented in an abstract way, for example, through math, or with some metaphor. So if somehow or another, someone was able to suspect the object existed, there would be no way for them to quantify the object in an objective manner. It would only be able to be represented as a concept or an idea. This is the premise of how theoretical physics works. Theoretical objects that cannot be observed being quantified through mathematics.", "filename": "1373655411845", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1440, "h": 810, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673868867099169, "time": 1673868867, "md5": "I7+ZfrkICoogHNYPkkSb7A==", "fsize": 170923, "resto": 71841004}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71845633, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:15:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I love sleeping.

I am glad to hear you are considering trying it out. I also totally understand feeling scared of opening up to a mental health professional, especially the felling of &quot;omg they are going to think I am batshit and lock me up&quot;. You probably need to build some trust with your therapist over time before truly opening up. It is only natural to not feel like talking about everything with a stranger. I need quite a few sessions before I feel like I can truly trust someone. Trust is hard. I am not sure if they can legally lock you up for anything you say either, unless you admit to something extreme like planning mass murder (you dont seem like that type of person from what ive read here).

He had no inherent value, which is why he had to try to really hard to end up modestly wealthy(and also a massively insecure faggot who still gives girls enough of the ick that he&#039;s going to go to jail because of it). <br>The fact is that most men are born with inherent value. Not as much as women, to be sure, but a good amount. Some are born with a lot of inherent value. This is based off of attractiveness and innate charisma. Charisma isn&#039;t something you develop: you either have it, or you don&#039;t. If you have it, it can be suppressed by extreme anxiety or insecurity, which is why those who have it will say &quot;just be confident&quot; or &quot;just be yourself&quot;. Those are the only 2 pieces of advice that can actually help, because if you have innate charisma then it&#039;ll allow you to express it. But if you don&#039;t have it, there is no way to get it. Women without it still do alright, because the male sex drive paves right over women being awkward. But a man without it? He has no inherent value. None whatsoever. And the world will never let him forget it. Every other human is primed to detect its absence, and will react to men without it like they&#039;re lepers. There is no way around it. People like Tate, who lack it and are trying to cope, will say that you have to make up for it by achievement. Achievements do not replace it. Achievement will let you accrue resources, and if you have enough resources people will be willing to pretend that they aren&#039;t creeped out by you in order to get some of them. But they are just pretending, they are just using you. You haven&#039;t made up for the lack of charisma, and you will never have the life of someone who has it, no matter how much you try and how much you succeed. You are broken at your very core, and everyone who meets you knows it, and they despise you for it.", "time": 1673858538, "resto": 71844840}, {"no": 71845446, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:45:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71845433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71845433</a><br>Charisma is like God, an 8th grader can tell you it doesn&#039;t exist.", "time": 1673858711, "resto": 71844840}, {"no": 71845481, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:51:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71845446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71845446</a><br>Charisma isn&#039;t real you&#039;re right it&#039;s just confidence which is not worrying if things go wrong.

A lot of the resentment that they feel towards men is basically the same resentment that incels feel towards women. A lot of the posts are women complaining about how other women profile them by attractiveness. I can attest to that in real life I see way more male friend groups with different levels of attractiveness but all female friend groups basically stratify by appearance. I find it somewhat comical that griping about other women is a big part of the sub. And then there&#039;s some posts that are just &quot;I can&#039;t believe Chad was attracted to Stacy over me&quot; where the girl didn&#039;t even make a move. It stands in stark contrast to incel stories where the rejection is accompanied with ridicule humiliation and social ostracization.

Most of the deaths I investigate are naturals, as in little old ladies having heart attacks at home. Sometimes I get a more interesting one, like a 35 year old who croaks in a bathroom with no drug or medical history.

Sometimes it&#039;s not entirely clear but you have to do the best with the information you have, especially since you can&#039;t really run accurate labs after death. To a certain degree you can with vitreous fluid (yes, you get to needle people&#039;s eyes), but in this case it was not viable. A lot of death investigation comes down to a person&#039;s medical history since even after an autopsy, there are certain things that just can&#039;t be seen, like an arrythmia (since that&#039;s a conduction issue).<br><br>As for the goth chick thing, it&#039;s definitely a draw for some, but I&#039;m happily married. If I was single I&#039;d definitely be using it to my advantage, since I happen to definitely like goth girls lol. There&#039;s a lot of interest in the industry from witchy zoomers who want internships, but once they smell real decomp or go to an autopsy most quickly lose interest.
