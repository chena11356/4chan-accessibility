He relented and backtracked a bit when I got upset when he said my IQ was probably in the 90s, saying it could be in the 100s instead and that IQ doesn&#039;t measure every facet of intelligence anyway. He said that he had faith Centaur would do a push-up after fighting with him for days. He defended me in September. He never seemed to hold very long grudges even after I was horrible to him in arguments, despite the fact that he would have been justified to do so. I liked when he told off that one anon for making fun of someone&#039;s speech skills. The fact that he suppresses his sadistic tendencies is a good thing in itself, but I gained a greater appreciation for that when he said that he doesn&#039;t really enjoy much of anything.

For one, I know that I have a lot of expectations placed upon me to be perfect. This can feel very overwhelming at times and make me feel like I&#039;m not good enough. I also feel pressured by society to be a certain type of person. This can be very stressful for me as I often feel like I&#039;m not living up to what people expect from me.

I think the most important thing is to remember that I can only do my best and that it&#039;s okay to make mistakes. When I feel like I&#039;m under too much pressure, I usually try to take a step back and focus on what&#039;s important to me. I also try to let myself feel whatever I&#039;m feeling and not push it away. Sometimes it helps to talk to someone about what I&#039;m going through, or just to take some time for myself. Sometimes I like to take a bath or go for a walk or spend time with a friend who makes me feel calm.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your favorite candle scent</span><br>I love the scent of flowers.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>PQPQP", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675244655359144, "time": 1675244655, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 9, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 72050672, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)04:45:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>PQPQPP", "time": 1675244700, "resto": 72050664}, {"no": 72050922, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)05:24:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I do all of this dogshit advice except maybe the haircut every 2 months.

Not once. So sex is already this super rare and valuable commodity, this is where men who buy onlyfans come from. For them it&#039;s worth a lot, for them having pussy for $200, once, is a good deal. Their values are tremendously distorted. They inherently think women are doing them a favor by having sex with them on a subconscious level. <br><br>So they&#039;re in this weird spot. They don&#039;t think women will respond to aggressive flirting, when in reality all adults can see through this thin veiled &#039;owo I just want friendship&quot; ploy. Women don&#039;t like it because it&#039;s dishonest, if I were a woman and someone came up to me like this I&#039;d take it as an insult because it&#039;s extremely easy to see through, the guy must think I&#039;m retarded to bite. And since they can&#039;t be aggressive, because they don&#039;t know how and lack the confidence to do so, for good reason, this is what remains for them to do. <br><br>Like a man who goes unemployed for long, or has never had work to start with. Work requires experience, experience requires work. Unlike men, and for reasons I won&#039;t go into, women do not like losers at all.

Im a really addictive person and the only times Ive been free from drugs was to practice buddhism looking for something better. I got more clear minded for sure but I never had any significant experiences in meditation that would compensate for a life of missing out.

That&#039;s one year compared to nearly 15 years of childhood trauma. I doubt I&#039;ll ever be the same. As much as you blame all of it on bipolar, you never once tried to change, get help, or make up for it. No, buying me something nice isn&#039;t making up for it. Even then, if you only made up for it with hugs, kisses, sorries, and cuddling, it wouldn&#039;t make it okay. At the end of the day, your refusal to change, go to the mental ward, get a therapist, or talk to your psych openly and honestly instead of &quot;I don&#039;t just snap at people randomly, they bring it on&quot; like I&#039;ve heard you say over and over on telehealth appointments is bullshit. I did not deserve to be punched, hit, thrown around, my belongings broken, your belongings broken, glass all over, windows, doors, and walls broken for anything. After a while I lost all attraction to you, being with you felt like trying to get used to having a knife periodically stabbed into my leg, and the good moments felt like cuddling a cold concrete brick that occasionally jacked me off. Even after that, I wanted to stay because of the promises you made that it was just mania and that you usually aren&#039;t like this. I hoped it&#039;d get better and that it&#039;d go back to feeling like being with the one person who understood my own mental illnesses because we had the same ones, laying next to the softest warmest teddy bear, and feeling like my entire head and chest was buzzing with welcomeness and love. Now, you only ever snort lines, scream about everyone being sociopaths, and call me a piece of shit for &quot;not getting you&quot;. I have bipolar too, I get psychosis too, we both have had trauma, but if I have freakouts and slip into mania or psychosis, I don&#039;t beat people until they&#039;re bleeding, I don&#039;t refuse help and beat the people who suggest it ...", "time": 1675139904, "resto": 72022805}, {"no": 72035429, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:47:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "meaghan<br>my birthday tomorrow... all i want is to hear from you. i&#039;m doing so well i bought a house with the money i was saving up for us i&#039;ve done a lot and thought a lot.. i still have faith in you and i&#039;m waiting for you. i&#039;ve done so much just for us and i&#039;ve made some mistakes but you too have and we reflect and think about eachother, i want to do so many things with you. everyday i&#039;m waiting i miss you<br>john", "time": 1675140437, "resto": 72022805}, {"no": 72035437, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72035300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72035300</a><br>I am a J otherwise I would not be replying to you, Anonymous.", "time": 1675140488, "resto": 72022805}, {"no": 72035440, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:48:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72035349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72035349</a><br>Cont.<br>When I&#039;m asked if I&#039;m okay, I don&#039;t punch them, when I see someone&#039;s upset, I don&#039;t take it personally, when I learn about someone&#039;s trauma, I don&#039;t call them a pussy for not wanting to be in places or situations that remind them of it, I don&#039;t blame people for not accepting when I do something shitty because of my mental illnesses, and lastly, when someone disagrees with me I don&#039;t get so upset that I nearly fucking murder them, and if I did do all of that, I would want to change. I would want to change so fucking much that I would have an entire mental health team, and maybe a neurologist just in case. After a while, you told me I had anger problems. Truth is I only agreed with you to avoid another fight. Before I moved in with you, the only fights I would have were while my mother was an alcoholic and minor arguments when my brother would try to rush me because I am too slow at a lot of tasks. You know what I did after those fights? Learn, try to get my mother help to quit drinking, try to speed up me doing chores. After I moved in with you is when I started having anger problems. I&#039;m not like you, at all, and even though part of me has hope you&#039;ll get better, proper medications, maybe even finally get a therapist, I&#039;m glad I&#039;m finally moving back to the house that originally gave me the trauma for a PTSD diagnosis. Maybe I do hate you, but I still love you, and I can only hope with time away that I stop both hating you and loving you. <br>But now, moving away brings another set of problems, since you are convinced everyone around you is sociopaths right now, you have all of my legal information memorized.

I&#039;m just figuring out what&#039;s the point to living here if I&#039;m not reaping the benefits (like I even cared for them to begin with).", "filename": "1674772844957692", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1074, "h": 1832, "tn_w": 73, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675236113295101, "time": 1675236113, "md5": "5Zl88Hp3JOw1rQbgPUm0Ww==", "fsize": 234951, "resto": 72049511}, {"no": 72049805, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)02:32:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72049739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72049739</a><br>Well if you do move to Tampa, Busch Gardens can be good fun during weekdays when it&#039;s not so crowded. Assuming you enjoy rollercoasters. Florida residents can buy a year&#039;s pass for just a bit more than a day&#039;s pass, although that pass is literally for just that calendar year and not 365 days. I haven&#039;t really gone there in almost 8 years though, so I don&#039;t know how its changed since I grew up.<br><br>I can definitely see the population control angle, I honestly originally thought China purposefully let out the virus to let it ravage their retirees but their overblown lockdown measures made me reconsider that. Just about every industrial nation on the planet right now is going to have problems with their retirees in the future and diseases are pretty much the blameless means that could be used to deal with them, vaccines that aren&#039;t safe should only make that easier.<br><br>For NY state it&#039;s even hard for you to own any firearms, isn&#039;t it? Down here in Florida it&#039;s pretty relaxed. From what I remember if you don&#039;t have a concealed carry license then there&#039;s just a 3 day wait after you buy/order a firearm to make sure you aren&#039;t a felon or have any warrants for your arrest and then you can pick it up. Lots of nice restaurants down here too that aren&#039;t exceedingly expensive either, although real estate prices are currently really high due to amount of people from places like New York and California that have moved here recently. If things do look better then the real estate prices should drop again to what&#039;s normal and then it&#039;d be a great time to buy, assuming you&#039;re looking to buy a house here in the future.<br><br>One other thing that I&#039;d recommend if you move down here is to try fried alligator. It&#039;s some of the best lean meat you may ever try, only criticism I have for it is that it can be chewy.

On one hand, you could see the pandemic narrative as a way originally to filter out and depopulate the elderly, especially when this concerns people who have or live in multigenerational households in countries like Spain or Italy, which, coincidentally, also suffered the most cases for positive. Nowadays, the boomers are just people who we see as parasites for having us live the way we do now.<br><br>Honestly, everything is a pain in the ass in NY. Even if I could happen to own a firearm, I&#039;d be too broke to carry one and most people are minding their own business, hence the conundrum on whether or not it is my right to bear arms in a place that either doesn&#039;t really need them or where people just mind their own business about everything. Although granted, I do see why I would need one if I&#039;m ever to move to FL. But unlike NYers in general, I have visited Miami and Orlando a couple of times and found myself acclimating to the heat pretty well.<br><br>I can also get alligator tenderloins on wild fork, a site for meats to help me save money but again...still broke.

I wouldn&#039;t be surprised though if covid just so happens to &quot;mutate&quot; in a way that&#039;s super lethal to the elderly, spreads covertly through the youth without doing much harm to them and has a long incubation period.<br><br>Honestly as far as alligator goes, if you&#039;re going to a restaurant you can probably find some there. It won&#039;t be as cheap, for the amount you get, as buying the meat yourself and preparing it but if it&#039;s for an outing then it should be enjoyable nonetheless. Also what kind of cheeses do you use for your mac and cheese? I love gouda for mine and toasting up the top. Another thing too I&#039;ll say, if you do move to Florida it&#039;s super easy to live off of fish and the like. Learning the basics of fishing is easy enough, plenty of videos are out there to teach you if you don&#039;t already know, and the waters down here are absolutely brimming with fish. A fishing license should only be like 40-50$(last I checked anyway) for either fresh or saltwater fishing(about 100$ for both) and a lot of the invasives here are themselves good meals. Lionfish for example(which won&#039;t really be able to be caught on a hook and line but are super easy to catch while spearfishing) are apparently amazing and walking catfish taste great too. Just make sure you bleed any fish you catch before preparing them. A tip from a Floridian too, keep a lemon or lime around. Citrus fruits and their peels/juices get rid of that fishy smell/gunk. Scratch the peel to get under your finger nails and wash your hands and then apply the juice and wash again to completely rid yourself of the smell. That juice also helps with any fish that have a &#039;fishy&#039; taste to them to remove that taste and to make the meat more firm. <br><br>As for your friend with kidney stones you should try getting him to drink more water and maybe lemonade.

Video games have been suffering from quality control since 2012 and if we&#039;re going further than that, since 2004 also. Very few games that I know have reached a certain level of quality from the likes of games such as Persona 3, Ninja Gaiden II, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, KOTOR II, etc. The only game that&#039;s ever come close to quality recently is DMC5. But even now with the influx of microtransactions, many people still cling to CS:GO, LoL, Halo, Insurgency Sandstorm, Fortnite, etc. It&#039;s a vicious cycle that&#039;s been running itself to the ground.<br><br>I don&#039;t like porn. I&#039;m too autistic for it. Many male pornstars in the industry also suffer from deflation from taking too many steroids for their penis and can&#039;t seem to cum well enough (but that&#039;s beside the point). Feminists may argue the degradation of women, but between that and transfixing your gender body parts, it&#039;s a matter of choice and people would choose the &#039;easier&#039; route to satisfy their dopamine receptors while others go on ranting about &#039;kinghood&#039; in an effort to say they&#039;re better than that.<br><br>In the end, we&#039;re all human.

I personally dont think there will be a total collapse per se, but you will definitely notice more draconian laws/policies tried to be implemented specifically aiming for curbing dissent online using AI as an excuse, as well as entirely new levels of censorship you had not thought possible. Things like private property will be more and more of a relic as people rely on subscription services and essentially rent everything they have with a different name out of being slaves to convenience, and more of the privileges we happen to call basic rights will be eroded away by simpletons and opportunists.
