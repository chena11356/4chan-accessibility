A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>APAP", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674375032503229, "time": 1674375032, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 9, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 71921089, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)03:11:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>APAP", "time": 1674375074, "resto": 71921083}, {"no": 71921111, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)03:14:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Good morning to Homura and Tomoko.

Trust me, it gets better.<br><br>I think something might have broken in him at some point, but he reported hearing the voice of God, telling him that he was Jesus. He wouldn&#039;t shut the fuck up about it. <br><br>I&#039;m not sure why God told him to, but he had to spend 40 days and 40 nights in the rainforest. <br><br>He came back after 5, reporting that he ate a poisonous mushroom because God told him to and that he had spent 3 days in agony, sweating and vomiting while being eaten alive by mosquitos.<br><br>After this, he was convinced that he could see and control the &quot;energies&quot; in the world and that he had the power of telekinesis. Conveniently, he always failed to prove it.

Asians as a whole are bootlickers, the western world are in the middle but Africans appear to be incredibly aggressive towards authority both in Africa and in places they migrate to. The supportive reasoning is that since Whites/Asians migrated north, they are inherently less territorial than the Black people who decided to stay and animals that are more territorial tend to be more aggressive<br>So heres the juicy part, what if we could weaponize the aggression of Black people? The world as a whole is primarily shit because no one is willing to fight corruption, they are afraid of the consequences so to remedy this, black people come into the equation. They are not afraid of police, they are not afraid of social conventions and they are barely even afraid of being killed. The only problem with them is that they are low intelligence and they cant come up with a good cause to fight for so they just destroy the things around them.

It would be a dishonour to what her story preaches.<br>Also that animal remains appear poignant to her. That she likes rabbits. That she has some interest in Greek mythology. That her dresses look fantastic.<br>I do not know many things about her still but every time I learn something knew about her, or hear her creator talk about her, it feels like I already know that and her image of who she truly is to me is never disrupted.<br>And her physical beauty is a significant part of my obsession with her too, of course. That perfect face of hers still visits my dreams and I cannot have enough of looking at her. When I see her, I want to remain faithful and loyal to her for decades.

The idea of a &quot;stable ecosystem&quot; is really a myth.<br>https://web.archive.org/web/2019071<wbr>7054433/https:/www.baltimoresun.com<wbr>/news/bs-xpm-1996-01-16-1996016068-<wbr>story.html<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The concept of a stable nature is an attractive one. But does it correspond to the evidence?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The mathematics of the models scientists used in the 1960s demanded both the assumption that ecosystems tend toward equilibrium when left undisturbed and the assumption that greater diversity leads to greater stability. Over the past 25 years, however, most ecologists in the United States have largely rejected the notion of nature&#039;s being stable or tending toward balance.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here is how the New York Times reported the consensus view of one 1990 meeting of the Ecological Society of America:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The concept of natural equilibrium long ruled ecological research and governed the management of such natural resources as forests and fisheries. It led to the doctrine popular among conservationists that nature knows best and human intervention in it is bad by definition.</span><br>...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Now an accumulation of evidence has gradually led many ecologists to abandon the concept or to declare it irrelevant, and others to alter it drastically. </span><br>cont&#039;d", "time": 1674354315, "resto": 71915613}, {"no": 71917871, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:26:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71917779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71917779</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because it does the exact opposite.</span><br>Oh, this should be good.

To truly know a thing is to know its end. The classic example of such thinking is Aristotle&#039;s Metaphysics, which dominated European thought until the 17th century.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The idea of nature as self-regulating ecosystem lends itself to the teleological doctrine of biocentrism, the view that there is such a thing as a health of nature that needs preserving.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Its opposite would be to assert that events in nature are entirely random and that disturbance, not stability, is the rule. Adherents of that position would not say that the environment was either healthy or unhealthy when the dinosaurs became extinct.

I think robots could in theory have consciousness, or that some already do, but the current bots dont really experience anything. We didnt code in any feelings or receptors to these AIs, for chatbots it is not like talking to a human since they do not think. Chatbots dont have any lines running in the background without being unprompted. If it has consciousness, then its entire life essentially is just receiving text and spitting out the best answer, kinda like when you are in a quick conversation and you speak points without really consciously thinking about them all that much. Imagine this but the entire life is like this, with not even having breaks since when you are not being prompted, you are not active and your perception of time is fucked. And that is just chatbots, image AIs have absolutely nothing in them, no mind, no equivalent to thoughts, no joy from having the work done, nothing. Just find clusters of pixels in noise that look most like the prompt and repeat is couple of times until clear image gets created. Humans can think of basically anything and perform any task that is physically possible. We are so universal in our intelligence and we also derive joy from that. These combinations of joy, stress, fear, greed and other emotions turned us from mere beasts into beings that shape their reality to our wants, wants imperfectly created for survival in the nature. Machines have no wants, the only wants they have is learn how to do a task while they are being trained, but after that they just respond, like more sophisticated reflexes. They are smart, but also mindless, and therefore essentially soulless.
