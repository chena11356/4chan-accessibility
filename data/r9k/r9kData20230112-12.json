Pegging is great because prostate orgasms are 1000x better than penis orgasms. I want a woman to do it to me instead of a man, because men are physically disgusting. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d even be okay with a tranny doing it and most of them don&#039;t pass or like using their dicks anyway, so there&#039;s no point in even considering that an option. Women need to wear strapons to top, so people act like they can&#039;t possibly get anything out of it and are just doing it to please the man. The fact is though women are capable of orgasming from the act, perhaps even with more frequency than traditional sex if they genuinely have an interest in it. Sex for them is largely mental, so doing something that turns her on already gets her halfway there. The benefit of pegging though is that quality strapons designed to stimulate the clit, which women are able to cum from much more easily than vaginal penetration.<br>So the reason why I want to get assfucked by a girl is because I want to watch boobies jiggle in front of my face and seeing the woman moan as she grinds her clit against the strapon while grinding the other end against my prostate. /thesis<br><a href=\"#p71792604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71792604</a><br>Based.", "filename": "Intellijent Smoking Wojak", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1420, "h": 946, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673513897701030, "time": 1673513897, "md5": "rnDphCLN+lHK5yTmiA43kw==", "fsize": 91836, "resto": 71791611}, {"no": 71794483, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)06:28:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71792604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71792604</a><br><a href=\"#p71793510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71793510</a><br>gentlefags belong on reddit", "time": 1673522928, "resto": 71791611}, {"no": 71794511, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)06:33:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71794483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71794483</a><br>No, that&#039;s where the cucks go.

I&#039;m starting to forget it but it went something like this. My uncle or grandad or someone died so we went to pay our respects. He was slumped over in a chair in his old house that was near mine and I was warned he looks bad. has blood on him and looks very morbid. As such I decided not to view him and left the room. Later on things started happening. I was unable to move or close my eyes and I&#039;d start getting teleported up into the air and the dead soul of said relative was starting to haunt me. He said I did not pay my respects so he killed me. I resurrected and I tried to tell everyone what happened and I kept having to go back to this place. Nobody believed me this was happening. I did some sleuthing online that I was being stalked by some dead relative that was hautning me and a lot of evidence cam eup to suggest I was right. I tried telling everyone and they all told me I&#039;m crazy. The dead soul haunted me again and a big &#039;boom&#039; cinema SFX sound hit like &quot;oh shit, its happening again&quot;. I got a friend to come and inspect it with me and the friend got it as well and died but I was spared. I later discovered that the dead relative needed souls to remain in the earth realm and if someone else died I was spared. I make a post on facebook saying &quot;I need someone to ring me ASAP im in trouble&quot; and spam messsage everyone on messenger. People come to my aid and I show them the evidence I had but when it came to the fact it was just random pokemon videos and stuff that didnt make sense. I frantically scrolled past my history to reveal a load of shit and thats when I realised that I&#039;m infact crazy and I&#039;ve been going through a mental episode and people are dead and what I thought transpired didnt.

I&#039;d consider someone old when they turn 40, but not 30. I often think people who project these ideas that any life stage beyond your early twenties being worthless, are either teens that don&#039;t have a lot of life experience and make massive judgements over what little notion they have about growing up, or adults in that age that romanticize their teens and twenties because it was a happier time in their lives (whether they miss the free time, the energy, or experiencing certain things for the first time).

For those anons, I only want to say one thing: succumbing to peer pressure will make everyone everyone happy... except yourself. Yeah, people will always demand you do things in order to satisfy ages-old societal expectations (that may be even harder to fulfill as time goes by), but your own happiness should be what ultimately matters.

The order betrays the Upanisadic reasoning. Things are impermanent, i.e., ever-changing, and by that token they are not satisfactory, and by that token they cannot be the atman.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The third hallmark is very often mistranslated (sometimes by me too, in the past) as &quot;not having a self or essence&quot;. That is indeed how later Buddhists came to interpret it, but that was not its original meaning - in fact, it is doubly misleading. Both Pali grammar 14 and a comparison with the Vedanta show that the word means &quot;is not atman&quot; rather than &quot;does not have atman&quot;. Comparison with the Vedanta further shows that the translation &quot;self&quot; is appropriate, as the reference is to living beings. However, as time went by the term was taken as a possessive compound and also taken to refer to everything, so that it became the one-word expression of the Buddha&#039;s anti-essentialism.</span><br>https://archive.org/details/WhatThe<wbr>BuddhaThought/page/n85/mode", "filename": "1d5199fe52fd1255118e3c1342b5fdfea7f97070", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 869, "h": 1205, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673499949146327, "time": 1673499949, "md5": "udh76sCkPTTMrB3JlDR6Mg==", "fsize": 977300, "resto": 71789959}, {"no": 71791859, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:16:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71791073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71791073</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about men then?</span><br>Yeah, what about &#039;em?

Contributions can be made by making sure my kids are taken care of, the environment is clean, food is well made, finding a safe place for our children to go so we can spend an evening alone, increase my status by paying only me attention when there are other men around, taking time to listen and understand my thoughts/feelings, make my life easier. <br><br>If you&#039;ve access to a credit card with a $25k line and know that it automatically gets paid off whenever you spend anything then using that to make our life better in ways that I don&#039;t understand or have time for is infinitely better than making money to pay for dinner. <br><br>*working meaning a job by an employer that pays money, if you want to do amazon FBA, or blog or whatever and it makes money fine I&#039;m proud of you, but once a household has over a certain threshold of assets money becomes worthless.

Have you turned this place into your personal notepad?<br>The only reason I caught onto your meaning (I think) was that I figured out what you were referring to although we call them different things. What you called the swarm, we call &quot;the sequence of shapes&quot; moving along time&#039;s arrow. I&#039;m impressed with how similar our two ideas are.

It makes some idiotic users think they&#039;re enlightened somehow when really they are just a fool who took a drug and felt good. A bad trip, then is just a psychedelic &quot;insight&quot; gone awry.

That doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t have some aspects of yourself that don&#039;t need working on that the psychedelic was pointing you in the direction of.

Socrates only considered parent/child relationships as bad because of the age difference for example, not because it was &quot;incest&quot;.

It&#039;s always hard to get an idea what the average person thought back then, but it&#039;s pretty telling that women were often kept away from being with male relatives alone, like the expectation is that they&#039;re going to fuck at any point they can. Like it&#039;s just nature.<br><br>Greeks/Romans still saw incest as somewhat &quot;barbaric&quot;, similar to having sex outside of marriage or visiting a hooker. It was normal, but not &quot;proper&quot;, unless you happened to be rich or royalty.<br><br><a href=\"#p71793644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71793644</a><br>Interesting stuff. I think people try to find different justifications for incest depending on the culture. In Japan it seems to be about the mother &quot;helping&quot; her son.

That&#039;s how I&#039;d imagine incest should be viewed. It&#039;s natural, but shouldn&#039;t be encouraged particularly, just accepted as part of normal sexuality. It definitely shouldn&#039;t be illegal, there is nothing actually wrong with consenting adults having sex, even when they&#039;re related. It will always happen, and it would be better if there wasn&#039;t a need to hide it.<br>Maybe like thirty years from now it will be normal, but just sort of weird, to get married with your single mom. I could see it happening again, if it was like that before too. People are clearly able to accept that happening. Social norms can change pretty fast, even extreme ones.<br>You can sort of see it happening already with incest porn becoming normal. It was illegal not too long ago, now it&#039;s the most popular category on all sites. You start to see incest mentioned in regular media too, and with less stigma than before.

Anime is another thing they picked up on. I don&#039;t really watch anime, but can&#039;t help to notice an influx of females over the past few years. It used to be almost exclusively a male thing. Why does this happen every time with every thing. They even like to shout about their gym schedule for some reason, lifting weights once a week for fifth of an hour, every 10 min into a conversation that has no link to fitness whatsoever. Nobody cares. And they always somehow make the topic dull and washed out.

Specifically writing bait and writing essentially short stories to post. Originally i would make a sport of how popular i could get my r/relationshipadvice posts get, how long i could keep it at the top of the sub. even made it to the front page of reddit once, that was a crowning achievement. <br><br>after a few years, i had gotten banned from every semipopular sub i could use for that. Paid for a vpn for a while but eventually decided the hobby was a time suck anyway and stopped. <br><br>after that i migrated to 4chan. Its harder here, people are slighly less stupid, and the text limits are shorter. Also people are more prone to skip long posts. But i adapted. started on /adv, shifted to /b for a while, eventually this became my main board. <br><br>People are gullible here but not so much so that it isnt fun (the reason i dont use discord for this anymore, it felt too easy). They respond to basically anything where i say im a woman almost immediately, without requiring proof (but also i can post tits here if i want to, mods dont enforce the no self posts rule at all lol). Posts get responses pretty fast, but also have some potential to stay up for a couple days. Theres also an interesting contrast between the swathes of normalfags and the actual old school robots, i can almost always tell which category a response comes from. <br><br>so uh, yeah, thats why im on the board. You ask, i answer. Out of boredom and a very weird hobby.

First, number of genes means nothing, even plants can have more genes than humans. Then, on one hand, women don&#039;t make use of two X chromosomes at the same time, making them genetically &quot;striped&quot;, this is the reason only female cats have 3 colors for the most part, as one of the color genes is saved on the X chromosomes. Note that this doesn&#039;t give them a new color male cats can&#039;t have, it just means each part of their body uses a different X chromosome, resulting in parts with different colors.
