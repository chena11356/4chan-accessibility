If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4.

After work 3 days a week I would go to the gym with the trainer for about an hour and I are a fairly clean high protein diet and I got in very good shape in about 6 months. <br><br>After that I worked out at the gym myself for about 6 months and then covid hit and I just said fuck it. And over the last 2 years I got fat. <br><br>I could easily have gone to the gym by late 2020 but I didn&#039;t because going to the gym is annoying and it&#039;s hard work. <br><br>I think I put on about 25 lbs in these 2 years and lost a lot of muscle. <br><br>Last year I got a new job that I actually like for the first time in my life. The problem is my schedule is all over the place. I do overtime all the time and I travel all the time so it&#039;s basically impossible to go to the local gym again with a trainer because they require a fixed schedule. So I feel like I&#039;m stuck being fat. <br><br>I simply do not have the self discipline to workout without a trainer. After work I go home, eat and play in bed with my laptop on my chest all night until I fall asleep. I don&#039;t even move except to go to the bathroom. I can&#039;t do one pushup right now. <br><br>They have gyms in the hotels I stay at on the road but I&#039;ve never even stepped foot inside of one. <br><br>I really need to list this weight because I&#039;m getting over and the thoughts of dying alone are becoming very real.

The IDEAL fiasco, the depression that followed, her unintentional erasing of memories from the boy she likes, rendering him unable to not only remember her, but also unable to form new memories of her. But she still marches on, hoping for her miracle. Protecting the people and things she cherishes, so I suppose that&#039;s my favorite part.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If there was one thing you could say to waifu, what would it be?</span><br>&quot;Fun, Misaki.

I&#039;m a fan of Japanese music, so I&#039;d use the charts feature in an effort to discover more of it. Back in 2017 I discovered Sakamoto through async, and liked it. I went and listened to &quot;Thousand Knives&quot; and fell in love with it. So, after that binged all of YMO&#039;s stuff after that. I hugely admire Sakamoto and think he is a musical genius. I&#039;m also kind of weird in that if I like something, I&#039;ll over listen to it, so I listen to YMO and associated acts very frequently. I was just listening to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1A<wbr>2A5kFweI for example. I&#039;d give you my RYM account, but it was banned so... maybe I&#039;ll make a new one though.<br><br>Anyway, I mostly like electronic and classical music, and tend to like things that sound a bit weird or unconventional, yet still have a listenable pop structure. It&#039;s why I love YMO so much. I&#039;m a huge fan of another Japanese musician, Katsuhiko Maeda or world&#039;s end girlfriend, give him a shot if you haven&#039;t heard of him.

Humans are sexual beings and will make everything sexual by default, especially other humans. Sex is only a problem if it is made into one, of course we live in a culture that has had a messed up relationship with sex. Everything to do with sex has been brutal and evil for thousands of years so it&#039;s not a shocker that 70% plus of normies just think sex = bad no matter the context, so associating sex with anything they care about is also bad.

How long have you played DL? I could only possibly understand your arguments if you didn&#039;t play long enough to collect assorted generic staples as they were coming out but even then don&#039;t new players still get a fuckton of free gems right at the start so you could&#039;ve just beelined salamangreats, stomped through ladder to collect the rankup gems, and then get more cards/staples with those. Like I said, I&#039;m FTP and I do fine and have hit KOG before as well (during Harpie meta, another deck that was pretty ftp accessible at the time) you just gotta play it smart with your gems and come to terms that there will be times where you skip ranked for a couple months and save gems till you see another good ftp-friendly deck you like come up and then you build that and enjoy ranked for a while.

Really, she just wants to play the latest fighting games and J-RPGs and relax at home. She initially comes across as childish and stubborn, but her passion for her hobbies and involving other people in them shows her true disposition.

Admires her more experienced colleagues with respect, and aims to be like them even if she struggles herself. Quite ambitious, although needs more time to process work/schooling tasks than others (which she prepares for). Her greatest fear is letting down the people she looks up to, perhaps even one she is infatuated with. Reads romance novels in her personal time, sometimes imagining herself and her circle as the characters. Prone to daydreaming.

For her, simply breathing in the fresh, grassy air and scent of tree sap, or hearing the ribbit sounds of frogs and buzzing of bees acts as an outlet for escape. Maintains a remarkably lithe frame despite eating plenty due to her active lifestyle, which keeps her trim and subtly athletic, though it does not show much. When alone, sometimes prone to sudden dancing or beat tapping. Is fond of flowers and for some reason, mushrooms, but does not cultivate either at home, instead appreciating them when in woodsy locations. Due to her frequent proximity with and occasional feeding of local birds, they frequently walk near her without concern, which sometimes causes embarrassing situations to ensue when unknown passer-bys come through.<br><br>Her delicate inner nature and contrasting outgoing energy towards her private world are appealing to those who are willing to appreciate her nuances. Likewise, she appreciates those who are willing to understand her sensibilities and talents. While she admires confidence and wishes she had more of it herself, she is most fond of human compassion. Sometimes when she sleeps, she has dreams of a tall, broad-shouldered romantic partner being her big spoon and kissing her quietly on the nape, cheek, and lips. Yet, she also secretly sometimes finds some girls in passing to be cute as well, though she&#039;d be unlikely to admit it except to a close friend.", "time": 1671702092, "resto": 71491342}, {"no": 71502481, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)06:19:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "not page nine a third time", "time": 1671707964, "resto": 71491342}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71500171, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)01:16:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t know how to whistle.", "filename": "1640340714886", "ext": ".png", "w": 220, "h": 221, "tn_w": 220, "tn_h": 221, "tim": 1671689809380884, "time": 1671689809, "md5": "eoxYngqw4FeQSUD4G3+3cA==", "fsize": 64140, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-dont-know-how-to-whistle", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 30, "images": 8, "unique_ips": 17}, {"no": 71500181, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)01:18:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71500171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71500171</a><br>Are you Peppa Pig?<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jil<wbr>0WCh_UoQ", "time": 1671689882, "resto": 71500171}, {"no": 71500186, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)01:18:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71500171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71500171</a><br>Same.

Why does life have to be this thing that you have to experience without having any vices? Sure if you&#039;re letting them ruin your life it&#039;s a problem, but if you&#039;re in control of it there&#039;s no issue. Life is meant to be enjoyed and experienced, sometimes enhancing those experiences with chemical substances is fun. Most people do it anyway with drinking alcohol and caffeine, some just choose to do it with superior but less socially acceptable drugs like cocaine and MDMA.
